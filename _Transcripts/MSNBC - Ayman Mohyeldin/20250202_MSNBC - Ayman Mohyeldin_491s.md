# Trump slaps tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0)
*  As promised, President Trump dropped sweeping tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=0.0s)]
*  raising the risk of a trade war with America's three biggest trading partners. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=5.64s)]
*  Canadian imports will be hit with a 25 percent tariff, although energy products will be at [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=9.0s)]
*  a slightly reduced rate of 10 percent. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=13.52s)]
*  Those are set to take effect on Tuesday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=16.36s)]
*  There will also be a 25 percent tariff on Mexican imports and 10 percent on Chinese [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  imports, although it is unclear when those tariffs will start. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=23.8s)]
*  Trump might be fighting with these countries, but who really is going to pay the price? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=29.52s)]
*  In case it is not yet clear to you, it is us, the consumers, for everything from groceries, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  gas, home prices, even cars. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=41.24s)]
*  We will pay for it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=44.12s)]
*  There's something rather funny in Trump's order today called a, quote, retaliation clause, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=48.04s)]
*  which states that if Canada, Mexico or China chooses to retaliate, Trump will take further [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  action with respect to likely tariff increases. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=57.44s)]
*  Nonetheless, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says that there will be a, quote, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=60.4s)]
*  forceful but reasonable retaliation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=65.92s)]
*  Trudeau is also set to respond to Trump's tariffs later tonight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=68.64s)]
*  Joining me now is senior economics reporter at Axios, Courtney Brown, and director of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=72.32s)]
*  economic policy research at Vita Henrietta Trays. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=76.8s)]
*  It's great to have both of you with us. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=80.72s)]
*  Courtney, take us through the details of these new tariffs. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=82.92s)]
*  How are they different from his first administrations? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=86.56s)]
*  Former Treasury official and I think self-described trade wonk described it to me this way. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=91.76s)]
*  Trump did more on tariffs in one weekend than he did in the entirety of his first term in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=97.92s)]
*  the White House. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  So they're pretty sweeping across the board tariffs, and it is totally accurate to call [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  it unprecedented. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=112.08s)]
*  Really, it's unknown what the fallout will be. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=115.52s)]
*  It's really difficult for economists to model what the inflationary impact will be, what [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  the economic impact will be, because we don't know what the retaliation is going to be, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  and we don't know whether the White House is going to choose to up the ante. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=128.08s)]
*  So it's really this big basket of unknowns, and we're already going through a period of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=132.76s)]
*  high inflation. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=138.66s)]
*  I think the concern is that this is going to further aggravate the inflation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=139.66s)]
*  Do we have an idea, Henrietta, of what goods will be tariffed, or is it just blanket across [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=144.68s)]
*  the board? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=149.28s)]
*  I mean, obviously, we understand, as we've heard previously on the show, that American [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=150.28s)]
*  importers will ultimately be paid—the taxes will be paid by American importers passed [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  on to the consumers. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  But where should we expect to see these price increases? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=160.72s)]
*  It's going to pop up everywhere. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=165.18s)]
*  I mean, to put some numbers behind it, we were talking about $350 billion worth of goods [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=166.18s)]
*  put the China tariffs on in the first Trump term, this is now $1.4 trillion worth of imports. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=172.04s)]
*  For the average family, this is about $1,500 per person. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=178.56s)]
*  So that means your smartphone, your laptop, the backpack that you're buying, your elementary [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=182.92s)]
*  school student, all groceries coming in, especially for Mexico. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=186.76s)]
*  The real pernicious part, in my opinion, is the impact to things that flow through the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=191.56s)]
*  USMCA or the three nations, Mexico, Canada, the US. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=195.76s)]
*  Some of those car parts cross five times across the border, back and forth, between [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=199.16s)]
*  the US and Mexico. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=204.04s)]
*  Are we putting those 25 percent tariffs on every single time? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=205.04s)]
*  Is it on only the final good? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=208.6s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of very heavy-hitting pain economically coming in the way of the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=210.24s)]
*  US consumer. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=215.4s)]
*  Courtney, why is he doing this? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=216.4s)]
*  Why is Trump's reasoning for doing this? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=218.16s)]
*  I mean, what is the actual explanation that he is giving as to why he wants to do this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=219.76s)]
*  against Canada, Mexico and China? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=224.6s)]
*  He is giving reasons like drugs crossing over our borders. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=227.24s)]
*  But how does he see the imposition of tariffs on Canadian, Chinese and Mexican goods directly [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  linked to that? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=239.84s)]
*  Well, to be frank, they're not. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=241.68s)]
*  They're not directly linked to that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=245.88s)]
*  But I think we've seen so far in the Trump administration him wield the essentially economic [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=247.6s)]
*  might of the United States against other nations. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=253.6s)]
*  In the case of Colombia, it was a threat. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=257.24s)]
*  And then Colombia, obviously, back down and seemingly complied with Trump's demands. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=260.68s)]
*  And I think he is very much using tariffs in the same way here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=267.32s)]
*  I think the only exception is it looks like he's going to follow through this time. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=272.32s)]
*  But I think there are some business groups sending out statements and kind of sending [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=277.64s)]
*  texts hoping that between now and Tuesday, when they go into effect, there can be some [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=282.52s)]
*  sort of deal. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  He declared an economic crisis. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  And in the executive order, he said that when this crisis is solved, the tariffs will come [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=292.76s)]
*  off. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=298.24s)]
*  What will it take for this crisis to be solved with effect of fentanyl and border controls? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=300.24s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=307.56s)]
*  How quickly could consumers notice a difference? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=309.12s)]
*  Henrietta, I mean, you mentioned that it's going to affect everything from groceries [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=312.12s)]
*  to iPhones. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  Will there be a lag period between Tuesday when this begins and when we begin to see [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=317.4s)]
*  the price of everything start to go up? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  No, I would not expect that to be the case. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  It's incredible what Customs and Border Patrol can do. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  I have on very good authority for years now that they can change tariff rates within 12 [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=332.52s)]
*  hours. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=337.4s)]
*  Once this executive order is signed and CBP has their marching orders, the tariff rates [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=338.44s)]
*  are so streamlined and harmonized that you can change rates in 12 hours. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  So this should be very quickly felt. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=347.0s)]
*  And I think it's important to think about, you know, state by state, what this is going [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=349.35999999999996s)]
*  to mean. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=352.12s)]
*  Ninety-five percent of heating oil from Maine comes from Canada. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=353.12s)]
*  So it might be a 10 percent tariff, but it's on 95 percent of the heating oil you have. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=356.88s)]
*  It's different for every state. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=360.88s)]
*  Really quickly, Henrietta, is there an option for these American importers who are getting [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=362.52s)]
*  these goods to simply just not get them and say, you know what, we're not going to pay [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=365.76000000000005s)]
*  it. We're not going to pass these under consumers. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=369.36s)]
*  We're not going to get the order that we wanted or we're going to pass on it this time [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=371.04s)]
*  around. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=374.24s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=375.24s)]
*  And then, so, for example, if you have a housing crisis and you need lumber from Canada to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=376.24s)]
*  build more of your homes, you're now not going to be supplying that lumber. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  You're not going to have it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  You're not going to build the home. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=385.08000000000004s)]
*  Courtney, I know you just came back from the World Economic Forum in Davos. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  Just give us a sense of what the sentiment there in Europe is. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  And now that this opening salvo of a trade war has been fired by the U.S. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=392.68s)]
*  It was really interesting because I've been to Davos, the World Economic Forum, a few [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=398.68s)]
*  times and never before have I felt such a split in the vibe. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  You talk to Americans and American CEOs, they were feeling quite giddy, very excited [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=407.4s)]
*  about deregulation under the Trump administration, potential tax cuts under the Trump [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  administration. But you talk to the Europeans and their economy already. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=417.56s)]
*  It's not doing so hot. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=422.68s)]
*  Germany and France actually contracted their economy shrank in the most recent quarter. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=423.91999999999996s)]
*  And they're really afraid about what the impact of tariffs will do to the continent. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=429.64s)]
*  And the executive order today only addresses Canada and China and Mexico. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  But we heard Trump in the Oval Office say that he plans to implement tariffs on the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=439.8s)]
*  EU. So very weird vibes. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=444.68s)]
*  And I think the giddiness of corporate America might be a little less so today, given all [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=447.48s)]
*  of the responses from corporate America that we've gotten so far. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=453.32s)]
*  I was going to say between the trade wars and the deep seek A.I. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4FbXPa4y0&t=457.52s)]
