# Texas Rep. Marc Veasey is done with thoughts and prayers
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo)
*  We start tonight with that breaking news on the horrific mall shooting in Allen, Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=0.0s)]
*  According to two senior law enforcement officials, the suspect gunman—the suspected gunman, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  excuse me—interacted with neo-Nazis and white supremacist content online. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=14.32s)]
*  One of the officials said that the suspect posted this kind of content himself. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=18.96s)]
*  The other official said that he consumed such rhetoric online and said that authorities [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=23.6s)]
*  found him with a patch with a right-wing acronym on his chest. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=27.54s)]
*  We should note the official said it is too early in the investigation to ascribe a motive, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=32.02s)]
*  but here's what we do know. Eight people, including a five-year-old child, died in that shooting. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=37.06s)]
*  Of course, as we just said, the Republican refrain after massacres like this one is always thoughts [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  and prayers. No action. Zero change. That is undoubtedly the standard Republican Party line. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=48.82s)]
*  But another line is now coinciding with it, and we heard it last night on Fox [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=57.62s)]
*  as the news of the horror in Allen, Texas was unfolding. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=62.5s)]
*  Just like General Mattis once said, be polite, be professional, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=67.7s)]
*  but have a plan to kill everyone you meet because you never know. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=71.62s)]
*  That was former U.S. Marshal Special Deputy Alex Cocker telling Fox viewers that in America in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=76.58s)]
*  2023, we must have a plan to quote, kill everyone in order to survive this society [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=82.9s)]
*  that our lawmakers have created for us. A new necessary line that conservatives will now use [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=91.94000000000001s)]
*  when discussing guns. It's not enough to own a gun. It's not enough to have that gun on you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=98.58000000000001s)]
*  What you need to do is be prepared, is to consider murder everywhere you go. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  Whether it's thoughts and prayers or plan to kill everyone you meet, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=112.74s)]
*  Republicans make these kinds of statements because they want to avoid accountability. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=117.94s)]
*  So let's talk about that accountability for a moment and what exactly it is that they have done. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  Take, for example, this guy, Jeff Leach. You may remember him from last night. He was the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=129.3s)]
*  state representative who actually serves the city of Allen, Texas. He co-authored the 2021 Texas [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=133.86s)]
*  Permiless Carry Bill. Leach last night said thoughts and prayers after making it easier [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=141.38000000000002s)]
*  for people to have guns in public. Of course, this guy, Governor Greg Abbott, who in 2015 said he was [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  embarrassed that Texas was the number two state in the nation for new gun purchases and demanded [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=153.86s)]
*  that Texans start elming themselves as quickly as possible. Abbott put out an empty statement of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=159.22s)]
*  thoughts and prayers as well and said the attack was evidence of a mental health crisis in America. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=164.74s)]
*  Greg Abbott, that guy, that same governor, cut $211 million in Texas mental health funding in 2022 [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=171.46s)]
*  alone. How about this guy, Dan Patrick? That is Abbott's lieutenant governor, who was one of the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=180.82s)]
*  pioneers of the door control movement. Remember that one? Asserting that guns weren't the issue [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=187.06s)]
*  at the heart of school shootings in our country. The number of doors a school has is the real [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=193.38s)]
*  danger. If only we can guard the doors. Now, to be clear, we are not saying these individuals [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=198.98s)]
*  are responsible, but these people have worked to create the environment that we are seeing in Texas. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=205.54s)]
*  No doubt about it. And that environment is one where guns seem to matter more than human life. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=212.02s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Mark Vesey of Texas. Congressman, thank you so much [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=219.22s)]
*  for making time for us tonight. I know that your state is in mourning, once again, just after the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=223.62s)]
*  horrible events in Cleveland, Texas. Now you are reckoning with another mass shooting, this time [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=229.06s)]
*  in Allen, Texas. How are you doing? How are your constituents doing? How do Texans wake up every [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  day in that state with all of this grief and tragedy and heartbreak? Yeah, you know, the first [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=240.18s)]
*  thing that I thought of is that, you know, Allen is not far from Fort Worth, where my family and I [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=246.1s)]
*  reside. And we've been to that outlet mall several occasions. It's a very popular outlet mall. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=250.5s)]
*  The fact that a white supremacist would go there is honestly not a shock because [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  Collin County is a very diverse county. A lot of the newer tech jobs that have been created [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=264.66s)]
*  the last several years here in the DFW area are in Collin County. And lots of families, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=271.22s)]
*  international families, reside there and use that mall. It's scary. And we do need more than [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=278.18s)]
*  thoughts and prayers. If you, if Republicans would pick up the Bible and read it and read James 226, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=285.70000000000005s)]
*  they would know that faith without works is dead and that God would want us to take action [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=290.9s)]
*  when there's been so much carnage, so much bloodshed, so many families that have been [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=297.78s)]
*  devastated by the senseless violence that continues to take place in America almost on a daily basis. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=302.82s)]
*  Yeah. And your past life as a representative in the Texas state legislator, you were fighting [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=310.58s)]
*  Governor Greg Abbott and his gun extremism every day. Talk a little bit about that response from [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=314.9s)]
*  Abbott last week, the one that was tone deaf, posting a photo of his dog after the Cleveland [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=321.06s)]
*  shooting, calling the victims illegal immigrants. And now his reaction to the events in Allen, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=326.58s)]
*  where he basically is saying mental health before any official has come out and publicly ascribed a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  motivation. Yeah. Well, first of all, politically, you have to understand that Greg Abbott is a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=336.82s)]
*  desperate man. He doesn't get nearly as much attention as Ron DeSantis does. And a lot of this [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=342.5s)]
*  rhetoric, a lot of this dehumanizing, you know, human beings that are here in Texas working hard, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=350.34s)]
*  regardless of their immigration status, is a way for him to sort of try to catch up with DeSantis [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=358.1s)]
*  and the crazy department. And again, on the gun, he's him being completely tone deaf when it comes [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=365.06s)]
*  to that is absolutely no surprise. We used to have very reasonable gun laws here in Texas. If [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=371.46s)]
*  people wanted to have a concealed carry license, for instance, they have to go and take a course [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=380.18s)]
*  to make sure they were proficient in shooting. They've gotten rid of that. You used to have to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=385.53999999999996s)]
*  have a, you used to not be able to walk into the state capitol without a gun. Now they've taken the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=389.85999999999996s)]
*  metal detectors down at the state capitol. You can just walk right in into the state capitol now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=396.58s)]
*  So, you know, things here are going backwards as it relates to gun safety. And I can tell you, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=403.38s)]
*  this whole talk about gun grabbing needs to stop. I'm a gun owner. I'm never going to give up my [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=410.65999999999997s)]
*  guns. Most Democrats that I know are never going to give up their guns. But we expect for reasonable [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=417.46s)]
*  steps to be taken when this much blood continues to be spilled. Why can't we have, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=423.62s)]
*  pass the background check bill? Why can't we pass an extended background check bill? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=429.22s)]
*  You know, why can't we make sure that boys or men that are not even old enough to rent a car [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=434.18s)]
*  can't buy an AR? Why not do that? No one's going to lose anything that way. They're perfectly [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=441.62s)]
*  reasonable steps. And any Texan, even a lot of Republicans that you talk to will tell you that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=448.34s)]
*  they believe in those things. But it just shows you how off the deep end the Republican primary [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=453.61999999999995s)]
*  has become in states like Texas. Yeah. You can have a beer as an 18, sorry, you can have, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=459.78s)]
*  you cannot have a beer as an 18 year old, but you can certainly buy an assault rifle and do what you [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=465.38s)]
*  want with it. What do you, what do you make of this metastasizing campaign of fear mongering from [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=469.53999999999996s)]
*  conservatives? First, it was everyone buy a gun, then everyone carry a gun at all times. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=474.5s)]
*  And now, as we heard there from that Fox personality saying, carry a gun at all times [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=481.3s)]
*  and constantly think about how you can kill everyone you meet. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=487.46s)]
*  You know, I'm out visiting colleges right now with my 17 year old and, and we were, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=494.9s)]
*  we're actually in Houston right now. And I was, we were in the Galleria here in Houston. I have to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=502.02s)]
*  tell my son, hey, if something happens, you know, you need to think about what you would do. And [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=506.42s)]
*  that's just such an unusual thing that someone should have to say to their kid. And let me just [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=512.9s)]
*  tell you, someone that has a concealed handgun license, I can, I'll never forget when my [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=520.74s)]
*  instructor told the group of us that she was teaching, you have to think about any time you [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=526.34s)]
*  pull that trigger. You do, when you're, when you're slinging bullets, you don't know where [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=532.6600000000001s)]
*  they're going. And let me tell you, no one with any, you know, no one within reasonable mind [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=537.86s)]
*  wants to ever have to make the decision to use their firearm inside of a mall or grocery store [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=545.7s)]
*  or school or any place like that, because that's not what everyday citizens are trained to do. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=552.1s)]
*  That's what law enforcement and military personnel are trained to do. No one in their right mind, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=556.9s)]
*  Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative wants to have to make that decision. And so to [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=562.74s)]
*  hear Republicans say things like that, it's just absolutely insane. And it just shows how these [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=567.94s)]
*  radical reckless Republicans in state like, like Texas, how far removed they are from the average [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=573.78s)]
*  everyday Texan. Yeah. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winrgfBV3Mo&t=580.98s)]
