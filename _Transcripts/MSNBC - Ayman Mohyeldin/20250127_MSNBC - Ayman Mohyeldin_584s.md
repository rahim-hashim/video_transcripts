# Fred Trump III calls on Democrats to 'get some spine' amid Trump's retribution tour
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU)
*  What we have right now is the Donald Trump retribution process on steroids. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=0.0s)]
*  And we just have to, as people who believe in this democracy, at some point, we're going [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=9.32s)]
*  to have to start a forceful pushback. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=15.68s)]
*  That was former chairman of the January 6th select committee, Benny Thompson, sounding [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=19.86s)]
*  the alarm to my colleague Ali Veltri on President Trump's retribution tour. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=23.3s)]
*  Trump has stripped security details for former national security adviser turned Trump critic [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=27.56s)]
*  John Bolton, as well as former NIH director Anthony Fauci, who became a target in MAGA [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=32.32s)]
*  World for contradicting Trump's COVID lies. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=37.04s)]
*  And in a Friday night massacre, the president fired 18 inspectors general without even notifying [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=40.2s)]
*  Congress, a move that Democrats and even some Republicans say violated the law. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=46.36s)]
*  And now NBC News is reporting the White House has warned Republican senators to get on [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  board with Trump's nominees or suffer the consequences after Trump's controversial pick [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=56.04s)]
*  for defense secretary Pete Hexeth barely won Senate approval. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=61.08s)]
*  Joining me now is Fred Trump, the third. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=65.68s)]
*  He is the nephew of President Trump and author of the book All in the Family, the Trumps [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=68.12s)]
*  and How We Got This Way. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=72.16s)]
*  Fred, it's great to see you again. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=74.44s)]
*  You and I spoke a few days before the election. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=76.44s)]
*  And in fact, I want to play for you something you said on the show about the fears that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=79.8s)]
*  you had if Donald Trump were to win. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=83.66s)]
*  I think what scares a lot of people there, there are no, to use the word in vogue, guardrails [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=85.92s)]
*  anymore. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  Just think of the people that he is now surrounding himself with. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=96.88s)]
*  There's no General Kelly. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=99.56s)]
*  There's no General Mattis. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=101.4s)]
*  There's Stephen Miller, Tom Hornman and Rudy Giuliani coming back. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  That should scare anybody. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  And so now we're a week into Trump's term. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  We're getting a preview, maybe a glimpse of what will continue to happen with this retribution [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=116.2s)]
*  tour. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=122.44s)]
*  But what do you think of what we've seen so far in this first week? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=123.44s)]
*  It really is no surprise to me and shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  We've seen this literally since the day he left the White House. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  He will go after anybody who is not for him or jumps on board. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=136.44s)]
*  And what was said there about his cabinet picks? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=142.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they will go out there and primary anyone who goes against his wishes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=147.48s)]
*  You know, Trump has always been a petty man. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=156.4s)]
*  A lot of people have described him that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=159.0s)]
*  I'm curious to get your thoughts. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=160.88s)]
*  What other rationale could be applied for why he has stripped the security detail of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=162.32s)]
*  people whose lives are genuinely in danger? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=169.96s)]
*  People like John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Anthony Fauci. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=172.84s)]
*  It really comes back to the same thing in my mind. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=175.8s)]
*  The interesting one to me is Fauci. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=179.28s)]
*  I don't remember Fauci coming out there and saying he did a terrible... [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, he is a very thoughtful gentleman. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  Maybe a different story. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=190.0s)]
*  He's out there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=191.32s)]
*  But Fauci did a great job, has done great work for this country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=192.32s)]
*  But it didn't work out for Donald. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  Some of the blame got assigned to Donald, which I believe rightfully so. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  Fauci may have even taken the spotlight away from Donald for a while. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=206.32s)]
*  I mean, he was out there in front every day. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=210.76s)]
*  Yeah, let me... [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=213.36s)]
*  In fact, actually, I was going to say I was going to share this with you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=214.36s)]
*  I mean, the danger here for both Bolton and Fauci, in 2022, the DOJ charged a member of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=216.08s)]
*  Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in a plot to kill Bolton, likely in retaliation [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=221.96s)]
*  for the Trump administration's killing of an Iranian general back in 2022. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=227.08s)]
*  As you were saying, Fauci has been subject to death threats, part of the MAGA conspiracy [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=231.88s)]
*  world. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=235.8s)]
*  But, you know, let me play for you what he said about this watch, about Fauci. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=236.8s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=242.36s)]
*  Would you feel partially responsible if something were to happen if you saved Dr. Fauci or John Bolton? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  You know, they all made a lot of money. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  They can hire their own security, too. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  The question is about their safety and security as people who worked in government and served [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  American interests, including somebody like Bolton, who, you know, worked for a Trump [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=259.32s)]
*  administration that killed an Iranian general. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=264.16s)]
*  And now he's basically throwing them out there on their own, saying, hey, you should take [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  care of your own security. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=269.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  And I'll go back to Fauci. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, here's a man who dedicated his life's work to saving American lives. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  OK? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  How many? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  I can't tell you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  Thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=286.12s)]
*  But he did that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=287.12s)]
*  He did it under the radar up until COVID. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=288.12s)]
*  But his reputation in the circles I travel is pretty—he's an astute, generous with [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=290.92s)]
*  his time and his career helping this country. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=299.64s)]
*  Do you think he went after these people because they are high profile and sends a chilling [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=302.64s)]
*  message to others? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=307.11999999999995s)]
*  I mean, do you think this is going to continue with people that are lower names but people [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=308.11999999999995s)]
*  he will still want to go after? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=312.64s)]
*  There's no end to his— [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=315.32s)]
*  No. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=316.32s)]
*  There is no end. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=317.32s)]
*  John Bolton's on TV all the time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=318.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=319.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=320.32s)]
*  And that probably irks him and drives him crazy. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=321.32s)]
*  It may. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=322.32s)]
*  But John Bolton is out there all the time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=323.32s)]
*  Fauci, I don't understand because he's gone off. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=324.32s)]
*  Maybe he wrote a book. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=327.88s)]
*  He's out of the public limelight. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=329.48s)]
*  He's not talking about you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=331.48s)]
*  So why that has to get stripped, I don't understand. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  Who knows if Fauci is going to be needed in the future? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=337.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=340.56s)]
*  When you think about the Republicans in Congress right now, do you—I mean, you kind of see [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=341.56s)]
*  them all falling by the wayside to back Donald Trump, even with the pardons of January 6th, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=345.64s)]
*  no spines among any of them. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=349.88s)]
*  Now you have somebody like Elon Musk with billions of dollars willing, with the press [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  of a button, to primary and challenge any of these Republicans who may dare to stand [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=355.76s)]
*  up to Donald Trump. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=362.76s)]
*  So you have this, like, not only this public fear that is being whipped up by Donald Trump, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=363.76s)]
*  you now have a financial backer who's willing to take those words of Donald Trump and challenge [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=368.38s)]
*  and browbeat anyone who challenges Donald Trump. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=374.48s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=377.76s)]
*  And I'm just waiting for someone in Congress to say, it's worth it to keep my principles [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=378.76s)]
*  primary away. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=384.28s)]
*  It's pretty wishful thinking on your part. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=385.79999999999995s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  It's Sunday night. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=389.79999999999995s)]
*  Is it that great to be in Congress? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=393.11999999999995s)]
*  I mean, when someone says they want to stay in Congress and give up their principles, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=394.44s)]
*  well, maybe they're in it for the money also. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=399.52s)]
*  What is the grip that he has? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  How do you explain this ability to have a grip over these types of people? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=404.28s)]
*  I mean, again, you're talking about politicians who in their own right are powerful. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=408.23999999999995s)]
*  You know, they should be some of these Senate members that have been there for years. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=412.36s)]
*  They have their own followings in their constituencies. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=416.48s)]
*  And yet Donald Trump has come in and managed to completely overpower them. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=419.8s)]

*  He's in a safe zone. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=489.04s)]
*  And let me just please add this. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=490.04s)]

*  William is cared for. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSAddovWCKU&t=502.35999999999996s)]
