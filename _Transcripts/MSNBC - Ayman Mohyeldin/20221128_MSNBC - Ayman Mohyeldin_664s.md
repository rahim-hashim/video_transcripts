# Rep. Barbara Lee Calls Trump’s Meeting With A White Supremacist “Shameful” But “Not Surprising”
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we are following the follow-up from Donald Trump's dinner with a man that the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=3.7s)]
*  Justice Department has labeled a white supremacist. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=8.22s)]
*  Last week, the ex-president hosted Nick Fuentes and Kanye West at his Florida home. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=11.98s)]
*  Sources told Axios that Trump, quote, seemed very taken with Fuentes and was impressed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  with his ability to rattle off statistics and recall speeches from Trump's 2016 campaign. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=23.1s)]
*  But once word got out of the dinner, the backlash sent Trump world-reeling. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=29.24s)]
*  One longtime Trump adviser called the situation a, quote, effing nightmare and told NBC News, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=34.18s)]
*  quote, if people are looking at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to run against Trump, here's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=40.22s)]
*  another reason why. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=45.14s)]
*  Now Trump's trying to distance himself from Fuentes, saying he didn't know the 24-year-old [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=47.379999999999995s)]
*  was going to be at the dinner and had no idea who he was. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=51.64s)]
*  This despite the fact that Fuentes has been a feature player in right-wing circles for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=55.9s)]
*  a while, palying around with MAGA Republicans like Arizona's Paul Gosar and Georgia's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=61.260000000000005s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=66.02s)]
*  Last year, both members of Congress attended the American First Political Action Conference. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=68.06s)]
*  It's an event organized by Fuentes himself, where he took the stage to spout ideas like this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=73.34s)]
*  Our secret sauce here, it's these young white men. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=80.46s)]
*  That's what we call the secret ingredient. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  America and the world has forgotten about them, but not us. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=96.46s)]
*  We've got the white Christian men that built this country the first time, and we'll do [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=100.33999999999999s)]
*  it again. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=105.22s)]
*  Look, it doesn't matter what Trump claims he did or didn't know at the time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=106.98s)]
*  What matters also is what he knows now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=113.14s)]
*  Trump undeniably knows now that Nick Fuentes is an outspoken racist, that he's an anti-Semite, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=116.62s)]
*  that he's a Holocaust denier. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=122.06s)]
*  But in the statements he has put out after that dinner, Trump has declined to condemn [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=124.18s)]
*  him or even denounce those views. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=129.3s)]
*  And will that change? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=131.3s)]
*  For those who know the ex-president's long history of refusing to criticize anyone who's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=133.48s)]
*  complimented him, that seems, to put it generously, unlikely. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=138.32s)]
*  Let's discuss this more with the just-videowed and now re-videowed Democratic congresswoman [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=143.56s)]
*  Barbara Lee of California. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=150.6s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=153.0s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to the dinner. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=154.0s)]
*  Obviously, an explosive decision to have a dinner with Nick Fuentes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=155.83999999999997s)]
*  Does Trump's failure to denounce Fuentes surprise you at all? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=159.72s)]
*  And I guess what do you imagine are sort of the downstream impacts of a failure to denounce [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=163.4s)]
*  those types of viewpoints? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=168.44s)]
*  Thank you, Sam, for having me. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=172.24s)]
*  Let me just say, first of all, while it is shameful, I'm really not surprised. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=173.24s)]
*  Secondly, it's no excuse to say that I did not know. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, he knows what Kanye's views are in terms of his comments as it relates to anti-Semitism [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=183.84s)]
*  and hate. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=189.68s)]
*  So, you know, I think it's once again he's showing us who he is. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=190.68s)]
*  And he needs to apologize. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, if he were for real, then he would say, I'm sorry, I apologize. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=198.8s)]
*  He didn't do that, and he won't do that, because once again, that is who he is. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=204.56s)]
*  He associates with these people, and he's constantly behaving and saying hate, promoting [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  anti-Semitism, white supremacy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=216.64s)]
*  And really, it's very dangerous, because a lot of what he has done leads to violence. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=219.55999999999997s)]
*  Hate speech leads to hate violence. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  And so he knew, but he said he didn't. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  So if he didn't, why doesn't he apologize? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  Why doesn't he disassociate himself for those who he knows are anti-Semitic and saying anti-Semitic [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=232.76s)]
*  things such as Kanye? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=238.88s)]
*  Well, why do you think he doesn't apologize? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=240.27999999999997s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=244.8s)]
*  And you know, for some reason, he's going to continue. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=246.0s)]
*  Hopefully, the public now understands who he is. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=249.44s)]
*  Remember the campaign of 2016 and the horrible, horrific kind of language he used toward Mexican [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=251.92s)]
*  Americans, towards Muslims, towards women, towards African Americans, towards people [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=257.84s)]
*  who were different than him, who were not white males. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=263.8s)]
*  And when we look at the policies that he put forth, when you look at the bans that he put [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=268.68s)]
*  in place, this man's policies reflect who he is. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=274.6s)]
*  And so this is something that I think the Republicans also need right now to disassociate [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=278.44s)]
*  themselves from him, what he says, and move on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=283.36s)]
*  And I haven't heard many Republicans say anything about what took place at this dinner. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=286.36s)]
*  And so we have to move forward as Democrats, though, and we're going to continue to work [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=292.8s)]
*  for the people. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  So you mentioned Republicans. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=297.32000000000005s)]
*  Republican Congressman James Comer of Kentucky. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=299.44000000000005s)]
*  He was actually asked about this meeting on Meet the Press this morning. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=302.36s)]
*  Let's take a listen to what Comer had to say about this. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=308.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, he certainly needs better judgment in who he dines with. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=310.7s)]
*  I know that he's issued a statement and said he didn't know who those people were. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  I would not take a meeting with that person, though. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=319.5s)]
*  I wouldn't take a meeting with Kanye West either, but that's my opinion. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=321.94s)]
*  Now, I mentioned this a moment ago. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump's not the only GOP lawmaker Fuentes has met with. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=329.78s)]
*  Is this just an issue of bad judgment? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=335.14s)]
*  Do comments like Comer's suffice for you? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=336.82s)]
*  No, this is deeper than bad judgment. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=340.82s)]
*  You know, he should say he condemns it, and he needs to make sure that he says that very [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=344.38s)]
*  clearly and that that's wrong and that it's more than bad judgment. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=350.9s)]
*  This is who Donald Trump is. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=356.14s)]
*  He was president. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=358.5s)]
*  We saw his policies. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=360.09999999999997s)]
*  We know what he said during his campaign. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=361.34s)]
*  And the country, I think, is beginning to really understand this at a deeper level. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=363.97999999999996s)]
*  But again, Democrats have to move on. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=369.41999999999996s)]
*  And I think what's going to happen is more people are going to disassociate themselves [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=372.34s)]
*  from Donald Trump in terms of supporting him for president. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  And I think that the country is coming to really understand even those who supported [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=381.06s)]
*  the first time around are beginning to understand that this is a dangerous man and he's filled [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=386.5s)]
*  with hate. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=391.14000000000004s)]
*  We'll see about that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=392.14000000000004s)]
*  The Republican drama doesn't stop at Trump. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=394.22s)]
*  In your chamber, GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, he's currently fighting for his political [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=398.62s)]
*  life for the speakership, I should say, in the House. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=403.94s)]
*  He's trying to secure enough votes to become speaker. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=406.26000000000005s)]
*  One, do you think he'll ultimately get those votes? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=408.86s)]
*  And two, will the concessions that he has to make to the Freedom Caucus in exchange [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=412.98s)]
*  for those votes, how do you expect that to impact the next two years in terms of what [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=418.58s)]
*  the House will look like? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=423.98s)]
*  Well, I can tell you one thing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=425.46s)]
*  The concessions that he gives to the Freedom Caucus won't be concessions that are going [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=428.1s)]
*  to address the climate crisis, child care, the cost of living, the quality of life, housing, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=434.26s)]
*  health care. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=439.82s)]
*  They won't be concessions that speak to the needs and the aspirations of the American [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=440.86s)]
*  people. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=446.14s)]
*  And so whatever concessions he's negotiating, I can tell you one thing. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=447.14s)]
*  They will be concessions that we're going to have to fight against and they will be [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=451.7s)]
*  concessions that the public will understand who's on their side. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=457.02s)]
*  And so we're ready, whatever their agenda is, and we're going to continue to make sure [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=461.38s)]
*  that we put forth policies that are going to make life better for everyone. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=467.06s)]
*  Do you think he ultimately gets the votes to become speaker? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=471.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, I don't know. That depends on the concessions he makes. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=475.46s)]
*  I mean, he's got such a slim margin that I shudder to think what those concessions may [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=478.58s)]
*  be. But if he does, look out. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=484.18s)]
*  That's all I can say. I know they won't be concessions about how we move forward to ensure [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjCFfX1DBo&t=486.85999999999996s)]
