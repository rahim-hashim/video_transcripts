# USC Valedictorian speaks out after University cancels graduation speech
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI)
*  But the double standard being applied to pro-Palestinian free speech, perhaps no one knows that better [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=0.0s)]
*  than the University of Southern California valedictorian Asna Tabassum, who was barred [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=5.2s)]
*  from speaking at this year's commencement ceremony after pro-Israel groups raised concerns [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=10.14s)]
*  over her social media posts in support of Palestinians. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=15.42s)]
*  Earlier, I had the chance to speak with Asna about the university's decision and her plans [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=18.48s)]
*  for the future. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=23.18s)]
*  Asna, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=24.18s)]
*  First off, tell us how you felt when you received the news from the university that they were [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=28.72s)]
*  canceling your speech over, quote, safety concerns. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=33.96s)]
*  And have they given you any reasons or details as to what those safety concerns were? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=37.8s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it was unexpected, for sure. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=44.32s)]
*  I think I was a little bit disappointed in my university, especially because they've [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=48.68s)]
*  had my back throughout all four years that I've been at USC. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=52.2s)]
*  This was not the greatest feeling, for sure. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=56.44s)]
*  But I think what was the toughest part about it was that I received no details as to what [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=60.28s)]
*  the security concerns were. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=65.32s)]
*  And you know, I care about safety. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=67.12s)]
*  And ultimately, if I were given concerns, I would have made the necessary steps. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=68.88s)]
*  But you know, I wasn't given any reason to believe that security was the basis of the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  decision. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=77.52s)]
*  There were several pro-Israel groups who demanded the university rescind your selection due [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=79.2s)]
*  to pro-Palestinian social media posts. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=84.84s)]
*  Do you believe that was a factor in the decision by the university to not allow you to give [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=87.4s)]
*  this valedictorian speech? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I had some material on my Instagram that was pro-Palestinian, for sure. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=95.84s)]
*  And I think that that invited, unfortunately, a lot of hatred. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  You know, some of it was like a valid academic position or ideological position. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=105.92s)]
*  But a lot of it was unfortunately just plain Islamophobia, plain racism. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=110.76s)]
*  And I think the pressure of that hatred campaign definitely played a role in the university's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=116.28s)]
*  decision. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=122.68s)]
*  And, you know, I'm sure multiple factors were at play, but I would say that that's possibly [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=123.36s)]
*  one of the biggest ones. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=128.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure you probably saw this on Friday. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=129.84s)]
*  This situation continues to just kind of spiral out of control. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=132.6s)]
*  You had the USC announcing that it would eliminate all outside speakers, including [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=136.0s)]
*  John Hsu, who is the director of Crazy Rich Asians, tennis star Billie Jean King, from [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=142.52s)]
*  attending the ceremony, citing the quote, highly publicized circumstances now surrounding [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=147.28s)]
*  the event. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=152.48s)]
*  First of all, what is your reaction to that and how quickly this situation is spiraling [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=154.28s)]
*  and getting bigger? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  Do you think this could have been a preemptive move in case one of the invited speakers either [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=159.68s)]
*  chose not to show up or perhaps express solidarity with you or to try to dilute the fact that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=164.96s)]
*  this is about you and more about public safety? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  I think that's definitely a possibility. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=175.72s)]
*  I have no idea personally. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=177.72s)]
*  But what I will say is that I was at a dinner when I got the news and I got many, many texts. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=180.16s)]
*  And I think my first reaction, my first feeling was, you know, an ultimate hurt because my [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=185.16s)]
*  class has worked so hard for graduation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=192.4s)]
*  And I know that we deserve a commencement that is true to the work that we've put in. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=195.24s)]
*  And I think it's also just it's a tough factor to know that, you know, we are most of us are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=200.44s)]
*  from the high school class of 2020. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  We didn't receive our high school graduation either. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=206.8s)]
*  And so for this to also be, you know, the not traditional commencement that we've been [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=209.08s)]
*  looking forward to and for some of us, it's like one of the biggest moments of our lives. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=213.72s)]
*  It's honestly so tough. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=218.96s)]
*  And I think that everyone's on the same page here about wanting to celebrate and wanting to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=221.2s)]
*  have fun for the work that we've done so hard. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=226.56s)]
*  So, yeah, it's it's definitely tough. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=229.76s)]
*  I'm sure you've been aware and certainly for years, you know, there's been a debate in this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=232.11999999999998s)]
*  country and certainly those on the right in this country have complained about attacks on free [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  speech on college campuses. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=240.56s)]
*  They claim that it stifles the free exchange of ideas. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=242.76s)]
*  I'm curious, have you received any support from that cancel culture crowd or do their free [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=246.2s)]
*  speech protection seems to have ideological limitations when it comes to people speaking up [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=251.44s)]
*  on behalf of Palestinians? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=257.0s)]
*  You know, I've honestly seen both. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=259.96s)]
*  I think there are people who might not agree with my views, who are still fighting for my privilege [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=262.32s)]
*  to speak. There are also people who don't agree with my views, who, you know, don't want me to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=267.12s)]
*  speak. And so there's there's definitely not a homogenous like set of set of people here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=272.24s)]
*  And I think that there's people with wildly different perspectives who have wildly different [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=279.24s)]
*  reactions to the issue. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  What I will say, though, is that for me, I see free speech and academic discourse as integral to the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=284.56s)]
*  university culture. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=290.12s)]
*  And I think that it's very important that we remain consistent with the way that we apply free [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=291.6s)]
*  speech and encourage free speech. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=296.0s)]
*  And there shouldn't be, for example, double standards or inconsistencies with how we apply this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=297.96s)]
*  freedom and this right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=303.96s)]
*  Do you think there is currently a double standard and inconsistent with what you're seeing both in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=305.2s)]
*  your own personal example and across colleges in America, for example, what is happening in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=309.76s)]
*  Columbia University and elsewhere in this country against those who want to speak up on behalf of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=315.32s)]
*  Palestinians? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  To be honest, yes, I think that unfortunately it takes a it's a little bit of inconsistency when it [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=321.4s)]
*  comes to applying free speech. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=328.32s)]
*  And I think that everybody should be welcome to put their views on the table. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=329.76s)]
*  And that's exactly what academic discourse is, you know, and student activism is as American as [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=333.48s)]
*  apple pie, you know, and that's where we should be most available and most free to make our opinions [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=339.52s)]
*  known, most available to protest. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=345.56s)]
*  And my brothers and sisters in Columbia, Pitzer, Berkeley, you know, like we're making change, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=348.64s)]
*  we're using our voices and we're amplifying one another. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  And if we're not doing it on college campuses where discourse is supposed to be encouraged, then [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=359.24s)]
*  where can we do it? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  And so free speech must be applied consistently. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=365.88s)]
*  And it's most important and it has the most gravity on college campuses for sure. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about what you want to see happen next. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=375.72s)]
*  I mean, are you individually going to seek any kind of recourse against your rights within the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=377.92s)]
*  university, silencing your speech or canceling your speech? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=383.8s)]
*  Are you going to pursue that? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=387.16s)]
*  And more importantly, what do you plan on doing next with both this attention you got and the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=388.24s)]
*  momentum that you have behind you for for your speech? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=393.12s)]
*  Are you going to deliver the speech somewhere else that we can hear? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  What were you going to say? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  So my priority here is to make sure that what has happened to me does not happen to anyone else. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=399.52s)]
*  You know, and I think that my duty here and my principle here is to make sure that students who [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  come in the future feel encouraged and feel free to express their views no matter what those views [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  may be. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think that I'm keeping my options open about how to best set that precedent. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=416.84s)]
*  But ultimately, I love my university. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=421.84s)]
*  You know, my university has given me everything. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=424.0s)]
*  It's also given me the very education that I'm using to make my voice heard in the world right now. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=426.64s)]
*  And so it's it's something that I'm thinking about. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=431.64s)]
*  But when it comes to like, I'm sorry, can you repeat the second part of your question? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=434.64s)]
*  The second part is more or less what are you going to do now? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=439.84s)]
*  I mean, you know, you won't be able to address your classmates at your commencement. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=443.0s)]
*  Is there a message that you'd like to share with them or any other soon to be graduate at this moment? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=447.76s)]
*  Yeah, my message to the graduates right now is we've been given such a wonderful education. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=456.32s)]
*  We've learned how to learn. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=462.56s)]
*  And it's upon us. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  It's the responsibility upon us to learn about the world and make decisions and make change. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=466.76s)]
*  And if we're not using our education in this way, then we're not doing due respect to the education [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=474.52s)]
*  that not a lot of people in this world receive. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=480.56s)]
*  When it comes to actually being able to address my graduates, my fellow graduates on a larger level, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=483.2s)]
