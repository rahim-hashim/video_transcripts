# When Is A Baseball Game More Than A Baseball Game?
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4)
*  All right question when is baseball or a baseball game more than just simply a baseball game [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'll tell you when one of the teams has a racist nickname when that fan base steadfastly [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=6.24s)]
*  Refuses to let a controversial team tradition die when that team plays in a state [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=11.56s)]
*  That's ground zero for Republican attempts at voter suppression and election subversion [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=16.56s)]
*  When a disgraced former president uses the game itself as an excuse to throw fuel on the culture war fires [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=21.04s)]
*  That are burning all over the country when you combine all of that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  That's when you get a baseball bellwether now the World Series is underway [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=32.0s)]
*  In fact game five is on as we speak last night was game four between the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves the home team [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  It was a great game. And if you didn't watch any of it, this is what it sounded like for much of the broadcast [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=43.12s)]
*  Now [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=58.08s)]
*  That of course was the so-called tomahawk chop a controversial fan tradition that has been criticized as [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=64.44s)]
*  Racist along with the team nickname for years now keep in mind it is 2021 [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  We are living in the age of the Cleveland Guardians and the Washington football team [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=76.08s)]
*  No one can claim ignorance about this stuff anymore [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=80.4s)]
*  Now MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has voiced his support saying that Native American [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  Community in Georgia or in the region is wholly supportive of the Braves program including the chop [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=88.48s)]
*  But this is a national pastime not a regional one [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=93.92s)]
*  So in a statement that was released Wednesday the National Congress of American Indians writes in our discussions with the Atlanta Braves [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=97.12s)]
*  We have repeatedly and unequivocally made our position clear [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=103.72s)]
*  Native people are not mascots and degrading rituals like the tomahawk chop that dehumanize and harm us have no place in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=108.08s)]
*  American society with the controversy over this gesture swirling all week [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=115.64s)]
*  It's no accident that former President Trump decided to attend last night's game. Here's how that went [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=120.24s)]
*  All right [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=126.4s)]
*  All right, let's keep that video up there for a moment because I want you to really look at this [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=136.8s)]
*  Trump clearly came to this game for a reason. He is inserting himself at the center of the latest culture war flashpoint [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=141.88s)]
*  That's his brand [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=150.08s)]
*  It's been the center of his own electoral strategy from the beginning and the fact that it's happening in Georgia is only natural [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=151.64s)]
*  Now since last year's election, Georgia has become the epicenter of the GOP's entire electoral strategy [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=158.76s)]
*  Remember after he lost the election it was in Georgia where Trump repeatedly tried and failed to get Georgia state officials to overturn the results [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=164.72s)]
*  He is on tape literally on tape telling Georgia's top election officials. I just want you to find me [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=173.44s)]
*  11,000 [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  780 votes those very public efforts then helped hand two pivotal Senate seats to the Democrats when John Ossoff and Raphael Warnock [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=181.12s)]
*  Won in the special runoff election now state Republican lawmakers responded by being among the first states to pass new voting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  Restrictions including measures that give the Republican state legislator more power over county election boards in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=196.36s)]
*  Response to that Major League Baseball then decided to move the All-Star game out of Atlanta [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  That is the very site of last night's game and tonight's so doubt in elections and institutions [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=209.76s)]
*  Make it harder to vote and whip up a culture war panic [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=216.32s)]
*  This strategy was made in Georgia [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=219.92s)]
*  But you can see it playing out in states across the country including the Virginia governor's election on Tuesday [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=222.48s)]
*  And that's why last night's and tonight's baseball game is about so much more [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  Than just baseball [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJbgrB43lI4&t=234.2s)]
