# Former Trump Administration Official Miles Taylor Announces Departure From the GOP
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y)
*  Joining me now is Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff for the Department of Homeland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Security in the Trump administration. He is the executive director of the Renew America [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=6.22s)]
*  Movement. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=10.52s)]
*  Miles, it's great to have you. Thank you so much for making time for us this evening. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=11.52s)]
*  Let's start with Buffalo. What was your reaction when you heard what happened in Buffalo? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=14.44s)]
*  A-Amen, I'll be honest with you. It reminded me of something else that had a pretty profound [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=20.68s)]
*  effect on me a few years ago. You recall the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. A shooter [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  walked into a Walmart and killed or injured dozens of people. And in the wake of the attack, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=35.44s)]
*  when they found his manifesto, he cited an invasion at the southern border as one of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=42.48s)]
*  the reasons he conducted the attack. That was alarming for two reasons. One, just the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=49.04s)]
*  naked racism behind the brutality. But two, the shooter echoed the same language we were [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=54.68s)]
*  seeing from Donald Trump in that time period. Now, I had already quit the administration [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  in protest, but it was the type of thing we had been warning about for years that this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  dangerous rhetoric was like a loaded gun for extremists. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=71.88s)]
*  When I heard what happened in Buffalo and very shortly after we got news of the attack, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=76.78s)]
*  we started to get news about the shooter's motivations. It was a reminder that yet again, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=80.72s)]
*  this extreme rhetoric from the party wasn't just resulting in extreme behavior among voters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=86.32s)]
*  It was resulting in violence and death and tragedy. And I spent the weekend thinking [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=92.18s)]
*  about that and thinking about really whether there was any utility in trying to stay inside [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=98.44s)]
*  the party to bring it back to the center or whether this was evidence that it's just all [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=103.7s)]
*  gone too far such that the Republican Party is irredeemable, which I think it is at this point. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  So this irredeemable party, the party as you described it now, if this wing or if this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=115.72s)]
*  fascist wing of the GOP continues to lead the party, what do you fear could happen in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=123.48s)]
*  America generally in 2024 and in 2028 if they are, as expected, take control of the House in 2024? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  And who knows what happened, excuse me, in 2022 and then in 2024 if they field a candidate who wins the White House? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=137.0s)]
*  Amin, it's really tough to break through to people on this because when people like you and I start [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=145.0s)]
*  to warn about where it could end up or James Clyburn saying this could be autocracy, we are often [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=149.32s)]
*  written off as being hyperbolic. But I'm just going to tell you from having lived inside this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=155.0s)]
*  party most of my life, from having served two Republican presidents, still communicating with [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=159.8s)]
*  people on the inside of the party at the highest levels constantly, I am more alarmed than I've [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=165.32s)]
*  ever been. Folks who think that we defeated the pseudo-authoritarian threat within the GOP in 2020 [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  when Donald Trump lost are wrong and they could not be more wrong. The threat is much greater today [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=177.4s)]
*  than it was in 20, than it was in 2016 because Trump and the phenomenon of Trumpism has morphed, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  matured and metastasized within the Republican Party to the point that no one can reverse it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=191.16s)]
*  And I admire Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for still trying to fight the fight within the party, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=196.92s)]
*  but what alarms me is that the base of the party has been now so completely radicalized. And again, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=202.68s)]
*  folks will accuse us of hyperbole for saying that, but if you go look at the data, a majority or [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=209.32s)]
*  close to a majority of Republicans now believe the stolen election lie. They believe the QAnon [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=214.84s)]
*  core tenants and they believe things like the racist great replacement theory. This is the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=220.6s)]
*  core of the Republican Party. Polls show that they believe it. It will take a generation [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  to excise this from the party. And my worry is that the longer the GOP base remains radicalized, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  the more violence we are going to see, the more uncivil rhetoric and the more deterioration to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=235.72s)]
*  our democratic foundations. That really is the worry. And I don't think James Clyburn is wrong [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=240.44s)]
*  in saying if that happens, it's a slow slide towards autocracy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=245.24s)]
*  There's no doubt, Miles, that Donald Trump accelerated a lot of these turns that the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=251.0s)]
*  Republican Party has taken. And I want to just hone in on something you wrote, which is in your [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=255.4s)]
*  piece, you write the party of Lincoln once stood on granite solid ground promoting free minds, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=260.12s)]
*  free markets, free people. And some of our viewers may be watching this and thinking, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=265.0s)]
*  what time period are you referencing here? Because the 60s and 70s, this country saw the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=269.48s)]
*  GOP fighting tooth and nail against civil rights. The 80s, the party sought to demonize LGBTQ people [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=274.84s)]
*  during the AIDS crisis. 2000s, you saw the party, it reveled in Islamophobia and then birtherism, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=281.23999999999995s)]
*  which gave birth to Donald Trump and then ultimately to what we're seeing now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=288.52s)]
*  So when you look at the GOP over the last 40 years, when do you think this party [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  was the party that you believed in and committed to? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=297.96s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, Amon, this is a place where you and I are probably going to disagree. I'm a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=301.24s)]
*  big fan of Ronald Reagan. I'm a big fan of George W. Bush, whose administration I served in. I think [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=306.6s)]
*  really good things happened in the party through various periods. But my worry isn't even that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=311.16s)]
*  the GOP is regressing to the 50s, which a lot of people are saying the 1950s. I'm worried that the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=317.0s)]
*  GOP in some ways is progressing to the 1850s. Now, I've been rereading the narrative of the life of [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=322.76s)]
*  Frederick Douglass, and it's almost eerie when you go back and you read writings from that time [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=329.16s)]
*  period about how even well-intentioned people were waltzing zombie-like into this racist American [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=334.36s)]
*  political environment. And no, we're not living in the 1850s in terms of the scourge of slavery. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=343.0s)]
*  But boy, we've got a lot of people that are zombie-like in not waking up to the realization [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=350.04s)]
*  that racism has been weaponized in this country and that we've got people radicalized by GOP [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=356.2s)]
*  rhetoric who are going and shooting black and brown people in grocery stores to carry out a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  political objective. Now, I spent most of my career doing counterterrorism. This is, by definition, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  terrorism. And the Republican Party is providing the ideological motivation that is radicalizing [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=375.47999999999996s)]
*  people to commit terrorist acts. Amen. This is what we saw with the rise of al-Qaeda, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=383.0s)]
*  with the rise of ISIS. I never in my life thought I would see that radicalizing rhetoric coming from [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=387.72s)]
*  my party, coming from the Republican Party, and resulting in the deaths of Americans on American [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=393.8s)]
*  soil. That is what we are witnessing. And it's not just a physical threat to Americans with the spike [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=399.32s)]
*  in domestic terror. Again, it's a threat to the foundations of our democracy because the GOP is [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=404.52s)]
*  spreading this deeply illiberal view of what it means to be a democratic republic. That is [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=410.2s)]
*  giving me deep alarm, and I no longer think we can reform the GOP from within. We've got to counter [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=416.44s)]
*  it from without. Let me ask you finally, if I can, why, and our viewers may be wondering this, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=421.4s)]
*  why was this the final straw? Why was it the final straw to see what happened in Buffalo and say it's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=427.32s)]
*  time for you to leave? Why was it not, for example, when Trump tried to impose this complete ban on [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=431.56s)]
*  Muslims entering the United States or the way he denigrated Mexicans and migrants or his anti-Semitism? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=437.0s)]
*  Why was this the moment that said, I'm out? It's a fair question, and it would be a fair criticism. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=444.36s)]
*  My response, though, is that perhaps naively, in that time period, I did not believe that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=450.76s)]
*  Trump represented the core of the Republican Party. I didn't believe he represented the millions [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=456.92s)]
*  of good Americans who are centrist Republicans and that he was the threat and that he had to be [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=461.72s)]
*  removed from office. It has become abundantly clear that it's no longer just about Trump, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=467.64000000000004s)]
*  that there really is truly a radicalized base in the Republican Party. That is something I no longer [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  think we can reform anywhere in the near term, and to defeat it, we've got to do it from outside the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  Republican Party. Look, it's not an easy decision to make, and no one's got to play the violin for me, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=485.24s)]
*  but it's tough to change that part of your identity, but I would urge other Republicans [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=490.12s)]
*  out there to do the same thing. I hope people continue to leave in droves like they did after [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=495.88s)]
*  the January 6th insurrection. It's time to leave the GOP, go start something new, become an [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=500.52s)]
*  independent, join the Democrats if you agree with them, but the Republican Party is no longer a home [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=505.56s)]
*  to rational Republicans and concerned conservatives. In fact, in many ways, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=511.16s)]
*  it is genuinely a threat to our public safety and national security. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-vHQnQ_x5Y&t=515.96s)]
