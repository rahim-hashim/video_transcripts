# How the weaponization of antisemitism is becoming a grave threat to freedom of speech in America
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA)
*  As the White House Correspondents Association is about to host its annual dinner, a celebration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=0.0s)]
*  of the First Amendment, the war on the First Amendment in this country wages on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=4.88s)]
*  One of the recent battles in this war was the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=9.8s)]
*  Khalil, of course, is the Columbia University student and protest leader, a legal resident [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=13.0s)]
*  and green card holder of Palestinian descent who was essentially kidnapped on March 8th [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  by government agents, right in front of his eight-month pregnant wife. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Now, this week, new court documents reveal that Khalil was detained without an arrest [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=27.08s)]
*  warrant. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=31.64s)]
*  Khalil now sits in a prison in Louisiana while his American-born wife gave birth to their [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=32.64s)]
*  first child on Monday. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=38.6s)]
*  In court documents, DHS lawyers claim that they had exigent circumstances to conduct [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=40.2s)]
*  the warrantless arrest and that Khalil said he would not cooperate and intended to leave [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=46.04s)]
*  the scene. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=50.68s)]
*  Of course, we've all seen the footage that was shot by Khalil's wife showing that he [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=51.68s)]
*  was in fact cooperating and told officers, yes, I am coming with you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=55.52s)]
*  A group of congressional Democrats traveled to Louisiana this week to meet with Khalil [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=61.28s)]
*  as well as with Rameysa Ozturk, the Tufts University PhD student who was also abducted [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=65.48s)]
*  in Massachusetts, without explanation and without criminal charges, simply for an op-ed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  that she wrote about Israel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=76.28s)]
*  Here's what they had to say outside the ICE detention facility. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=78.56s)]
*  Both of these individuals are political prisoners. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=82.96s)]
*  They don't belong here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=88.32s)]
*  This is not about enforcing the law. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=89.32s)]
*  This is moving us toward an authoritarian state. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=94.36s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil has lived in Syria under Assad. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  He knows what an authoritarian regime looks like. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  And he says this is it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=108.48s)]
*  This is it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=113.2s)]
*  Another detained student who got a visit from a member of Congress this week is Mohsen Mahdawi. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=115.2s)]
*  Mike Khalil Mahdawi is a Columbia student of Palestinian descent and a peace activist [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=120.32s)]
*  known for building bridges with Jewish students and students of all backgrounds. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=125.48s)]
*  On April 14th, at his naturalization hearing to become a U.S. citizen, he was abducted [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  by government agents without any charges. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=134.76s)]
*  Vermont Senator Peter Welch visited him at an ICE prison in Vermont and asked him to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=137.44000000000003s)]
*  respond to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's charge that he has somehow a threat to national [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  security and that his activism is anti-Semitic. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=150.0s)]
*  Basically, he is describing being anti-war as anti-Semitic. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=151.0s)]
*  How could that be possible when my partners, most of my partners at Columbia's campus and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  beyond, are Jews and Israelis? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=164.88s)]
*  My work has been centered on peacemaking and all what I am doing, I am being a human. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=168.0s)]
*  My empathy, as I mentioned before, extends beyond the Palestinian people and my empathy [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=174.68s)]
*  extends to the Jews and to the Israelis. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=181.2s)]
*  The abduction of these students and the attempt to deport them is a threat, freedom of speech [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=184.56s)]
*  and an attack on all Americans' right to descent. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=189.88s)]
*  It is being done on the false premise that their speech is both a threat to American [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=192.84s)]
*  foreign policy, which we have said many times on this show is a laughable claim, and that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  their protests are anti-Semitic and a threat to the safety of Jewish students. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=201.56s)]
*  But that's a dangerous and quite honestly a dishonest smear. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=206.72s)]
*  We have heard the words of Mahdawi and Khalil, their allies and partners in their protest [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=210.68s)]
*  movements are in fact Jewish students, many of them advocating for peace. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=215.16s)]
*  But imagine, just imagine for a moment, if one of these students had said, I have killed [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=220.6s)]
*  a lot of Israelis in my life and there is no problem with that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=225.2s)]
*  I mean, that would certainly sound threatening and be a reason for alarm, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=229.0s)]
*  Well guess what? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=234.2s)]
*  Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett once said, I have killed lots of Arabs in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=235.2s)]
*  my life and there is no problem with that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=239.04s)]
*  Well, this year Bennett has already been welcomed to Columbia University, Harvard University [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  and Princeton University. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  And at Harvard, he even went further. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=248.16s)]
*  He even joked about giving protesters a pager, a violent reference to Israel's deadly pager [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=250.16s)]
*  attack in Lebanon last year. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=256.36s)]
*  Or imagine for a moment that any of these students, these student protesters, had openly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=258.84s)]
*  advocated for bombing Israeli food supplies in an attempt to collectively punish and starve [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  the Israeli people. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=269.92s)]
*  That would be problematic, wouldn't it? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=271.02s)]
*  Well guess what? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=273.6s)]
*  Israel's racist national security minister proudly posted on X this week that food and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=275.96s)]
*  aid depots in Gaza should be bombed. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=281.68s)]
*  Again, this man has been convicted in Israel of inciting racism and supporting terrorism. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  In the U.S., he is welcomed with open arms. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=291.06s)]
*  This week, not only did he meet with Republican leaders at Mar-a-Lago, but he also spoke at [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=293.52s)]
*  Yale University before coming here to New York City. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  What happened to all the advocates for campus safety? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=302.48s)]
*  Where are the congressional hearings? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=305.26s)]
*  Where are the demands for university presidents to step down for creating a dangerous environment [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=307.02000000000004s)]
*  for students? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  None of that is happening, because the truth is this was never about safety on campus for [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=313.68s)]
*  any students. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  This is a campaign that is all about stifling and now criminalizing criticism of Israel [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  or support for Palestinian rights. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=325.6s)]
*  And that campaign has become one of the gravest threats to American free speech in our lifetime. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=327.66s)]
*  Starting us off this Saturday evening is California Congresswoman Lara Friedman. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=334.06s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for making time for us. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=337.42s)]
*  Let me start with the plight of these students. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=339.94000000000005s)]
*  Some of the colleagues, some of your colleagues in Congress are now meeting with these students [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=342.18s)]
*  at ICE detention centers. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=347.02000000000004s)]
*  When the Ramesa Ostarg video emerged, you posted, this scene and stories like it are [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=349.46000000000004s)]
*  deeply disturbing, especially as a Jewish woman. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=353.42s)]
*  Can you talk about that moment that we're in where Donald Trump is claiming to be fighting [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=356.86s)]
*  anti-Semitism under the guise of protecting Jews, but using that as his cover to advance [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=360.56s)]
*  his authoritarian agenda? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=367.3s)]
*  Yeah, I consider what Trump is doing to be weaponizing anti-Semitism, not fighting it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=368.96s)]
*  Certainly, we have seen problems with anti-Semitism on college campuses, and we've seen problems [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=375.52s)]
*  with Islamophobia on college campuses. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=379.88s)]
*  I've worked extensively when I was in the California legislature with our university [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  system and through legislation to find ways for universities to deal with hatred on their [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=386.68s)]
*  campuses, including anti-Semitism. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=392.2s)]
*  And they were very receptive to that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  But what's happening now is not helpful. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=397.32s)]
*  I don't think it's making Jewish students safer. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=399.84s)]
*  I think it has a real chilling effect on our students. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=402.08s)]
*  These students seem to be targeted in a really willy-nilly fashion. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=405.47999999999996s)]
*  This is a chaotic response, and it's one that is frightening, because, as you pointed [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=410.24s)]
*  out, it tramples our civil rights in this country, and it chills speech that shouldn't [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=416.08s)]
*  be—you know, that might be difficult for people to hear or offensive, but somebody [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=422.68s)]
*  writing an op-ed in a newspaper that's not calling for violence, that's simply stating [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=426.96s)]
*  an opinion, should not be grounds to be picked up on the street and deported without due [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=432.44s)]
*  process. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=437.28s)]
*  Let's be really clear that everyone deserves due process. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=438.35999999999996s)]
*  And what we're seeing is that some of the accusations that have been made against these [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=442.2s)]
*  students are just flat-out false. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=445.88s)]
*  And so we need to know if they are really a danger to California, if they're a danger [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=449.2s)]
*  to the United States, let's see the evidence through a trial. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  But that's not what this administration's offering. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=458.82s)]
*  And they've even—it's even turned out that they've deported in some cases the wrong [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=461.55999999999995s)]
*  people with some deportations they've done of immigrants. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  And in this case, they thought they were picking someone up who they thought only had a student [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=470.0s)]
*  visa who turned out to be a legal permanent resident of the United States. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=473.40000000000003s)]
*  They are chaotic, they are bumbling, and they are trampling on our civil rights. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=477.56s)]
*  Let me, if I can, pick up on the point that you talked about, the weaponization of anti-Semitism, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=483.44s)]
*  and ask you about, does this not make Jews actually in danger in this country? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=488.36s)]
*  Is it not threatening the way that Trump, you know, the administration right now, is [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=494.48s)]
*  doing all of this, actually cause a backlash against Jews by using Jews, if you will, as [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=498.6s)]
*  his pretext for this crackdown on freedom of speech? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=504.08s)]
*  Isn't he opening the door for people to say, blame the Jews if they don't like these arrests [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=507.68s)]
*  and these deportations, the very same way that he, during the campaign, would say, if I lose, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=512.6s)]
*  basically blame the Jews, or if Jews don't vote for him, they hate Israel? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=518.52s)]
*  That is absolutely a concern of mine, and from this White House, you've seen them bring [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=524.68s)]
*  people who are white nationalists, who are from the far right, who are certainly no friends [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=529.24s)]
*  with the Jewish people, into the White House. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=533.44s)]
*  We've seen them defend these same kinds of people. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=535.6s)]
*  I worry about the deportations, certainly, and the backlash, as you said, and I certainly [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=539.44s)]
*  don't want universities defunded, universities having less money for research, less money [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=544.96s)]
*  for scholarships, less money to spend on things like anti-Semitism efforts in the name of [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=550.5200000000001s)]
*  the Jewish people. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=556.84s)]
*  That's not our values, and this administration does not reflect my value as a Jewish woman. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=558.32s)]
*  Do you think, I mean, obviously, that these arrests are happening right now? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=564.2800000000001s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  This escalation, this sharp escalation, has happened under the Trump administration with [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=569.1600000000001s)]
*  these authoritarian actions. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=572.6400000000001s)]
*  But do you, when you look back at what happened during the protests last year, and they haven't [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=574.96s)]
*  happened in, they often happened in Democratic-run states or Democratic-run cities, do you think [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=580.28s)]
*  it was a mistake for Democrats, including the Biden administration, to not address these [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=585.16s)]
*  in a different way, to instead fan the flames of the attacks on college students and make [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  these wild accusations against them that Trump is now using to justify his actions? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=595.56s)]
*  I think that the campuses were unprepared for some of these protests. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=602.68s)]
*  I think that there were people who came in, quite honestly, who were chaos agents, who [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=606.92s)]
*  weren't even students, and there weren't even students. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=611.6s)]
*  And there were strong feelings on a lot of sides, which is understandable given what [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=613.56s)]
*  we've seen in the Middle East. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=617.76s)]
*  But I think the college campuses have learned from this experience. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=619.4s)]
*  I have worked with them on making sure that students know what's expected of them, of [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=623.24s)]
*  having, for instance, a code of conduct when students enter universities so that they know [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=628.32s)]
*  what's permissible protest and what's crossing a line, and then they're free to cross that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=632.68s)]
*  line if they want, but at least they would know what the repercussions might be. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=637.64s)]
*  Prior to the last few years, universities didn't generally have those kinds of understandings [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=642.12s)]
*  with their students. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=646.64s)]
*  And certainly, I feel that a lot of universities, even ones that had DEI departments, didn't [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  necessarily teach antisemitism and didn't have places for students who were experiencing [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=653.72s)]
*  antisemitism to go to. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=659.4s)]
*  So there were issues that we saw on the campus that were real issues, but deporting students [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=662.72s)]
*  is not the answer. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=667.92s)]
*  The answer is working with college communities to make sure that people understand what antisemitism [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=668.92s)]
*  is and what it's not, and what behavior we expect from students when they protest on [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=673.48s)]
*  any issue. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=678.36s)]
*  Let me, if I can, widen out a little bit, Congresswoman. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=679.36s)]
*  You just returned to the U.S. from a congressional delegation trip to the U.K., Israel, Jordan, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=683.24s)]
*  focusing on a lot of the very pressing foreign affairs issues facing this country. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=689.88s)]
*  Today, of course, at the Vatican, President Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=693.68s)]
*  Zelenskyy. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=698.6s)]
*  And afterward, Trump questioned Volodymyr Putin's commitment to ending this war. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=700.12s)]
*  It obviously comes in the same week that he sent out a bizarre tweet on Truth Social saying [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=704.04s)]
*  Volodymyr, stop seemingly begging the Russian leader to end this war. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=708.6s)]
*  What do you make of these latest developments on that front end? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=715.3s)]
*  Whether or not we are any closer to ending this war with the Trump peace plan? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=719.0s)]
*  We met with officials. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  This was at CODEL, a congressional delegation organized by leader Jeffries. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  And we met with officials in London and in Denmark. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=729.6s)]
*  And I can't tell you how alarmed these leaders in Europe are over the U.S. seeming to give [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=733.0s)]
*  a pass to Russian aggression, to try to change the facts that Russia invaded a sovereign [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=739.0s)]
*  nation and is trying to take over a part of another country and is doing so in an incredibly [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=745.84s)]
*  violent manner that they don't seem to show any sign of slowing down on. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH3uJzSu6XA&t=752.3199999999999s)]
