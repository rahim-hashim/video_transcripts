Video Description: Trump's latest outburst on social media demanded that Republicans "kill" a bipartisan bill meant to protect journalists. After his years of attacking the press and embracing anti-media dictators, this comes as no surprise. MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin spoke about how this legal attack against the press is one of Trump's refined tactics from his last presidency.

# Trump pushes GOP to ‘kill’ PRESS Act that would protect journalists
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A)
*  Since Trump entered politics, he's attacked immigrants, Muslims, Haitians, Democrats, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=0.0s)]
*  basically anyone who isn't 100 percent down with MAGA. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=5.4s)]
*  But there is one group he seems to despise above all—journalists. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=9.68s)]
*  Not the TV personalities, podcast hosts, or propagandists who cheer him on. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=15.32s)]
*  He loves them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=20.36s)]
*  And what he hates are journalists who hold those in power like him to account. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=21.36s)]
*  After all, it was journalists who uncovered his illegal schemes over decades. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=27.2s)]
*  They helped expose assault allegations against him over the years. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=31.08s)]
*  And in just the past week, it was real journalism that helped derail one of his most important [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=35.16s)]
*  cabinet picks, Matt Gaetz, for attorney general. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=39.68s)]
*  We've heard him attack the press for years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=43.36s)]
*  That's not new. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=45.2s)]
*  You've heard historians warn of how attacks like these are out of the dictator playbook. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=46.2s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=50.8s)]
*  It's frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=52.8s)]
*  And people should look into it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  You take the writer—because you're never going to find it, either they're going through [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=59.959999999999994s)]
*  phone records, it's been a long time—you take the writer and or the publisher of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=63.64s)]
*  paper, a certain paper that you know, and you say, who is the leaker? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  National security. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=75.12s)]
*  And they say, we're not going to tell you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=76.72s)]
*  They say, that's okay, you're going to jail. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=78.08s)]
*  And when this person realizes that he is going to be the bride of another prisoner very shortly, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=80.92s)]
*  he will say, I'd very much like to tell you exactly who that leaker was, Bill Jones. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  They're the enemy of the people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=96.48s)]
*  They are. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=98.4s)]
*  They're the enemy of the—I've been asked not to say it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=99.4s)]
*  I don't want to say it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=102.16s)]
*  They're the enemy of the people. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=103.16s)]
*  And someday they're not going to be the enemy of the people, I hope. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=104.16s)]
*  Now, Trump knows he can't sway real reporters, the ones, you know, with integrity, who take [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=107.48s)]
*  their jobs seriously. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=112.24s)]
*  So he's finding workarounds. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=114.0s)]
*  He has cozied up to far-right media personalities like Tucker Carlson, Laura Loomer and Nick [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=115.44s)]
*  Fuentes, the types who will parrot his agenda, no questions asked. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=120.68s)]
*  And then this year, he went further, aligning himself with Elon Musk and giving the billionaire [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=125.12s)]
*  unprecedented access to his incoming administration. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=129.08s)]
*  Now he's moving to get ahead of the game in the legal sense. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=132.24s)]
*  You know, you see, Trump's not happy about a piece of legislation called the Protect [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=135.6s)]
*  Reporters from Exploitative Spying Act or the Press Act. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=140.12s)]
*  On Wednesday, Trump said on Truth Social, Republicans must kill the bill. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=145.0s)]
*  His post came after Jody Ginsburg, the CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, had [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=148.52s)]
*  this to say. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  We know that Trump is interested in going after whistleblowers, people who leak, and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=155.44s)]
*  it's absolutely essential that they are protected and that journalists' sources are protected [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=159.96s)]
*  and that journalists are allowed to do their job. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=164.48s)]
*  The Press Act, of course, is all about filling in a major gap in protecting journalists. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=167.16s)]
*  It would block the FBI and other agencies from using subpoenas to figure out who leaked [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  information by going after reporters, their internet providers, or even any services they [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=177.2s)]
*  may have used. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=182.64s)]
*  Basically, it would help journalists protect their sources without the fear of being thrown [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=183.64s)]
*  in jail for simply doing their job. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  This bipartisan bill already passed the House unanimously this year. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=191.56s)]
*  Many of Trump's allies in Congress support the bill, and at one point even Tucker Carlson [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=195.38s)]
*  actually endorsed it in an interview. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=199.08s)]
*  This was one of a few things many Republicans and Democrats were on the same page about, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  protecting the First Amendment and stopping government overreach when it came to journalism. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=207.12s)]
*  In the past, press advocates have slammed presidents from both parties for crossing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=212.12s)]
*  the boundaries between government and the press. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=216.44s)]
*  Take for example when the Bush administration sent a reporter to jail for not giving up [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=218.8s)]
*  the name of a source, or when the Obama administration obtained two months' worth of phone records [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=222.72s)]
*  from journalists at the Associated Press. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump's outburst Wednesday may have trashed all the bipartisan work done to prevent this [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=230.28s)]
*  kind of overreach, even though the House-backed Press Act is now looking unlikely to make [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=235.08s)]
*  it through the Senate before the session ends. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  It only takes one senator wasting time on the floor to push this off until next year, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=244.64s)]
*  when we know what happens. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=249.24s)]
*  Republicans take control of Congress. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=250.88s)]
*  With so many Republicans scrambling to prove their loyalty to Donald Trump, it is worth [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=252.68s)]
*  pausing to think about where America is heading and what message this sends to the world, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=256.54s)]
*  especially when Trump takes cues on how to treat the press from dictators like Vladimir [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=261.56s)]
*  Putin or Viktor Orban and Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=266.8s)]
*  This year, the U.S. ranked 10 spots lower in press freedom than it did in 2023, according [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=270.44s)]
*  to Reporters Without Borders. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=274.8s)]
*  And just today, Israel, a major U.S. ally that receives billions of dollars in American [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  tax-paid money, sanctioned one of its largest and longest-running newspapers, Haaretz, because [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  the government simply did not like its reporting. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=286.54s)]
*  Trump's doubling down on media tax, suing outlets for billions just for doing their [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  jobs shows how he has refined his tactics since his last term. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  His pushback on this bill is likely just the beginning. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=299.26s)]
*  Joining me now is Jodie Ginsburg, CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=303.17999999999995s)]
*  Jodie, it's great to have you back on the show. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  Trump singled out your PBS NewsHour interview last week when he demanded Republicans kill [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=309.34s)]
*  this bill. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=313.5s)]
*  How important is this bill for the safety of journalists, and how concerning are Trump's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=314.73999999999995s)]
*  reactions to all of this? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=318.5s)]
*  It's really important. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=321.52s)]
*  There's no federal-level shield law. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=322.52s)]
*  So, 49 states in America have some kind of protection for journalists and their sources [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=325.66s)]
*  to protect those sources so that we have access to information in the public interest. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=331.22s)]
*  You think about public interest stories like Flint, Michigan, the water in Flint, Michigan, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=337.94000000000005s)]
*  and the toxins in there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=343.18s)]
*  You think about stories about individuals like the Republican senators and the Democratic [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  senators that have been exposed as corrupt by reporters. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=352.3s)]
*  All of that is essential that we protect them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=355.78s)]
*  So it was a little surprising to hear Donald Trump's reaction to my comments on Monday [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=359.94s)]
*  because this has had bipartisan support. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=366.06s)]
*  This isn't a partisan bill. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=369.34s)]
*  This has had bipartisan support from the beginning. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=371.21999999999997s)]
*  It just needs to pass the Senate. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=374.5s)]
*  But now it looks like it won't. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=376.26s)]
*  And without it, we may see many more actions, many more journalists subpoenaed to give information [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=378.26s)]
*  about their exposés into all sorts of wrongdoing and corruption at all kinds of levels. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  I mentioned that Reporters Without Borders lowered the U.S.'s press freedom ranking. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=393.65999999999997s)]
*  What has been the state of journalism like here for the last few years? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=399.28s)]
*  I mean, give us the overview. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=403.21999999999997s)]
*  We've seen journalists get arrested during Black Lives Matter protests, protests against [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=405.18s)]
*  Israel's war on Gaza, and so on. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=408.78000000000003s)]
*  But from your vantage point, from where you sit, what is the trend that you have been [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=410.96s)]
*  seeing? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=416.06s)]
*  So we've seen a decline on all fronts. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=417.06s)]
*  We've seen a 50 percent increase in assaults on journalists. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=420.26s)]
*  We've seen a huge spike in online harassment of journalists. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=423.74s)]
*  And remember, that normally affects women, most specifically those from minority communities. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=427.94s)]
*  We're seeing an increase in the number of legal threats against journalists, again, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=435.46s)]
*  at all sorts of levels. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=440.46s)]
*  And what's really important to remember about this is this isn't about the mainstream media, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=441.46s)]
*  as Trump likes to call them. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=447.3s)]
*  This isn't about the big names, the CNNs, the New York Times, the Washington Post. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=448.38s)]
*  The people that this hit hardest are the small local newspapers that do not have the resources [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=454.06s)]
*  to fight back against spurious legal threats brought by local officials, for example. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=459.98s)]
*  And that's where most people get their news and their information. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=465.26s)]
*  It's the information that has most bearing on people's ordinary lives. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=469.18s)]
*  Say that Trump succeeds in getting his party to kill this legislation. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=474.34000000000003s)]
*  How can journalists protect themselves from an administration that has called them the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=478.62s)]
*  enemy from within? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=483.38000000000005s)]
*  What does the next four years of journalism look like in your opinion? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=485.1s)]
*  I think the next four years looks like one in which we expect journalists to have to [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=490.82000000000005s)]
*  significantly increase their resources to protect themselves against legal threats. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  We're seeing a number invest more significantly in digital security, physical security, certainly [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=501.82000000000005s)]
*  starting to build funds to fight these kinds of subpoenas, the kinds of potential libel [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=509.78s)]
*  and defamation threats that we know are likely to come. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=516.8199999999999s)]
*  We've already seen those threatened from Trump, and we're likely to see more not just from [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=520.26s)]
*  him but from administrations across the country, local administrations. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=524.18s)]
*  So I think it's one in which we can expect journalists to be fighting on many more fronts [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=528.74s)]
*  to be able to provide the kinds of information that is essential for all of us to live our [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=534.9s)]
*  everyday lives. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=540.26s)]
*  And at the same time, we can expect a continued flood of miss and disinformation that tries [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=541.26s)]
*  to make the space one in which it's very difficult for people to understand what they should [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=549.14s)]
*  trust, who they should trust, what trust, where the information even looks like. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=556.14s)]
*  Let me ask you about another important development overseas, and this is of course dealing with [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=560.9s)]
*  Israel sanctioning Haaretz, one of the leading and oldest newspapers in that country. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=565.12s)]
*  Israel has also killed dozens of journalists in Gaza, detaining Palestinian journalists, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=570.9s)]
*  censoring critics of the war. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=576.1s)]
*  You advocate against actions like these and dedicated your career to it, but as you know, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=578.0600000000001s)]
*  Danielle is happy about Trump's win with both Sun in power at the same time. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=582.58s)]
*  Just give me your reaction to what you see happening in that country with the developments [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=588.0200000000001s)]
*  today in Israel. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=591.82s)]
*  Well, this is the latest in what has been a systematic attempt to censor the media and [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=593.82s)]
*  information coming out of Gaza and information from Palestinian journalists and now increasingly [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=602.1s)]
*  from journalists in Israel. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=608.1400000000001s)]
*  And it's part of a pattern. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=610.7s)]
*  It's part of a pattern of journalists being killed, journalists being arrested, media [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=611.82s)]
*  infrastructure being targeted, and of course foreign media banned, as we've seen Al Jazeera [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=616.78s)]
*  was banned from Israel. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=623.14s)]
*  Its premises were raided in the West Bank, and now we're seeing sanctions against Haaretz, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=624.8199999999999s)]
*  which is one of the few papers, the few news outlets in Israel that has been reporting [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=629.78s)]
*  independently and with great clarity on what's happening inside Gaza. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=635.4599999999999s)]
*  All right, Jody Ginsburg from the Committee to Protect Journalists. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=640.6999999999999s)]
*  Jody, thank you so much for joining us and the work that your organization is doing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=644.1s)]
*  Certainly appreciate it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=648.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moshpl5_82A&t=649.6600000000001s)]
