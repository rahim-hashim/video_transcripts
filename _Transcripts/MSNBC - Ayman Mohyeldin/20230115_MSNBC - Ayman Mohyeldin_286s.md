# Democrats grow frustrated with White House response to Biden documents probe
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg)
*  Breaking news. More documents have been found at President Biden's Delaware home. That is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=0.0s)]
*  according to the president's own special counsel, Richard Sober. In a statement today, Sober [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=9.24s)]
*  said that he found the documents on Thursday as he was working with Justice Department [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=14.24s)]
*  officials to hand over one final page of classified material. And while there, Sober, who has [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=19.72s)]
*  the security clearance needed to handle sensitive documents, said that he found five additional [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=26.7s)]
*  pages with classification markings. The Biden administration has maintained they were simply [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=32.3s)]
*  following standard search protocol. But there is an important question that remains. Why [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=37.58s)]
*  was the president in possession of these materials in the first place? That is the question [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=43.72s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland has tasked Robert Herr, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=48.9s)]
*  to get to the bottom of after naming him as special counsel in the department's probe. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=54.02s)]
*  Now, unsurprisingly, the investigation into Biden has drawn comparisons to ex-President [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  Trump's hoarding of sensitive government material at Mar-a-Lago. And I want to take [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=64.14s)]
*  a moment here to address this because it's a weak comparison when you look beyond the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=68.72s)]
*  headlines. President Biden's own team notified the National Archives of the material quickly [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=74.9s)]
*  discovered by them. They've since handed over the small number of documents to the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=81.54s)]
*  proper authorities, and they have been notifying the Justice Department throughout this entire [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=86.5s)]
*  process. In Trump's case, he was tracked down by the National Archives and spent months [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=91.06s)]
*  resisting before he finally agreed to send 15 boxes of material to the agency. And that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=96.94s)]
*  is when the Department of Justice got involved, believing Trump was holding on to even more [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=102.78s)]
*  The FBI eventually executed a raid on Trump's residence in Florida after a subpoena was [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=108.7s)]
*  issued where they recovered an additional 13,000 documents, about 100 of which were [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=113.42s)]
*  marked as classified. And let's not forget in all of this, Trump's being investigated [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  for obstructing the investigation into those documents. So far, that is not the case for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden. There are significant differences in how the documents came to light, the sheer [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=130.86s)]
*  amount of the material involved, and most importantly, how Joe Biden and Donald Trump [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=136.0s)]
*  have both responded. But the problem is politics isn't built for that kind of nuance in this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=140.88s)]
*  country. And here's the thing. President Biden sure isn't helping his case with clapbacks [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=146.16s)]
*  like this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, classified material next to your corvette. What were you thinking? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  Let me get a chance to speak on all this, God willing, soon. But as I said earlier this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=161.36s)]
*  week, people, and by the way, my corvettes in a locked garage. Okay, so it's not like [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=166.44000000000003s)]
*  you're sitting out in the street. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=171.52s)]
*  So material was in a locked garage? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  Yes, as well as my corvette. But as I said earlier this week, people know I take classified [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  documents and classified material seriously. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  Now, with all due respect, do the American people really know that? A flippant response [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=185.72s)]
*  about your corvette isn't exactly the most serious answer. And speaking of being serious, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=191.72s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Hank Johnson took things to a whole new level when he floated a baseless [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=197.32s)]
*  conspiracy that these documents could have been, quote, planted. So it's no surprise [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=201.92s)]
*  that some in the party have grown frustrated with the White House, which didn't disclose [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=207.6s)]
*  the discovery of classified documents until it was reported by the media. NBC News is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=212.88s)]
*  reporting that Democratic allies are calling on the administration to be more forthcoming [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=217.8s)]
*  in its handling of this issue. And right now, the American people need transparency, not [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=222.2s)]
*  quips about corvettes and conspiracies. The fundamental question Biden and Trump need [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=227.32s)]
*  to answer is why? Why did they have classified documents in their possession after leaving [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=232.6s)]
*  office? And that's about the only question both men need to answer, because that's where [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=239.4s)]
*  the similarities in their situations end. The sad thing is, while there are stark differences [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=243.96s)]
*  in the cases against Trump and Biden, the facts won't stop the ex-president supporters [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=249.72s)]
*  from pouncing. And a glib response from Biden does nothing but create more fodder for the GOP. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=254.72s)]
*  . [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkTI4jpKzg&t=269.4s)]
