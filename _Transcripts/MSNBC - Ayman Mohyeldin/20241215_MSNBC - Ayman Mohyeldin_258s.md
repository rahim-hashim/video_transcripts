Video Description: The murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson – allegedly by Luigi Mangione – has unleashed a wave of anger at America’s health care industry. What should we make of the unique reaction to a coldblooded murder and will it spark a much-needed change in the system? MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin explains we should reject celebrating vigilantism while still acknowledging "the legitimate rage that people are sharing about the health insurance industry... The cold and inhumane reactions to the death of this CEO is a reflection of the cold and inhumane economic system that this CEO represents.”

# The legitimate outrage at America’s for-profit health care industry and what we must do about it
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94)
*  When police finally apprehended 26-year-old Luigi Mangione at a McDonald's in Alatuna, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=0.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania this week and charged him with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  the public fascination with this story only increased. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  The murder and the man who allegedly committed it continue to spark a national conversation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=14.84s)]
*  For the first time in a very long time, the deep-seated anger in America's for-profit [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=19.76s)]
*  health care system is front and center. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=23.52s)]
*  Republicans are taking to social media to share their health care horror stories, stories [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=26.52s)]
*  about being denied care or having their claims rejected or going into debt due to illness [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=30.0s)]
*  or injury. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=34.16s)]
*  And media outlets are not only telling their stories but actually highlighting some of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=35.4s)]
*  the predatory practices of this powerful industry. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=39.04s)]
*  UnitedHealthcare is the country's largest health insurer with 50 million customers, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=42.56s)]
*  and multiple reports suggest they also lead the industry in denying claims, with a rate [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  at nearly double the industry average. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=51.0s)]
*  ProPublica has a powerful new piece out about how UnitedHealthcare is strategically limiting [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=54.04s)]
*  access to critical treatment for kids with autism. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=58.92s)]
*  UnitedHealth initially declined to respond to ProPublica for this story, then said they [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=62.04s)]
*  couldn't respond because they are in mourning and didn't have time to deal with a non-urgent [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=65.56s)]
*  matter. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=70.28s)]
*  And it's not just United. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=71.28s)]
*  There are new reports out about how health insurers gave $120 billion to shareholders [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=73.16s)]
*  while denying your claim. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=79.0s)]
*  Or how since the Affordable Care Act's passage, the top five health insurers' annual profits [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=81.96s)]
*  have jumped 230%. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=86.8s)]
*  Millions of Americans have had their lives and their livelihoods ruined by an industry [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=89.88s)]
*  that treats patients not as humans in need of care, but as consumers who generate profit. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=93.8s)]
*  Their voices are now being heard. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=100.12s)]
*  It's also leading to another phenomenon. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=101.84s)]
*  That's because just as a big part of this conversation, either the total indifference [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=104.72s)]
*  to the fact that a man was murdered or in some cases outright glee and celebration [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=109.52s)]
*  of the man alleged to have committed it, like this scene from a Boston concert this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  weekend where a DJ put Mangione's face on the screen to the sound of huge cheers, it's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  important to put this all in perspective here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=124.56s)]
*  The legitimate rage that people are sharing about the health insurance industry should [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=127.8s)]
*  not come as a surprise. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=132.32s)]
*  The cold and inhumane reactions to the death of the CEO is a reflection of the cold and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=133.96s)]
*  inhumane economic system that this CEO represents. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=139.36s)]
*  At the same time, vigilantism and murder won't fix it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it may just lead us to more acceptance of the disposability of human [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  life. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=153.24s)]
*  That's supposed to be what we are all fighting against. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=154.24s)]
*  The same time, an individual taking matters into his own hands is also a reflection of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=157.4s)]
*  the helplessness that people feel to enact any meaningful change. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=161.68s)]
*  We just had a multi-billion dollar presidential campaign where neither candidate addressed [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=165.84s)]
*  that we have a sick health care system where profits increase as more coverage gets denied. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=170.72s)]
*  Donald Trump spent years trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and now that he's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=176.44s)]
*  in office or soon to be is surrounded by billionaires and multimillionaires who may finally achieve [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=180.8s)]
*  the Republican goal of privatizing Medicare. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=186.0s)]
*  And on the Democratic side, Kamala Harris spent her campaign running away from her past [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=189.72s)]
*  for a Medicare for all system, the type of system that would take profit out of the equation [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=194.0s)]
*  and center it around patient care. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=198.8s)]
*  So if someone is angry at the legalized corruption of the health care industry, where can they [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=201.44s)]
*  channel their anger? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=206.52s)]
*  Who is fighting on their behalf? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=207.62s)]
*  What movement can they actually join? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=209.16s)]
*  If any positive can come from this murder, it is that one, this horrendous and sick system [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=210.76s)]
*  must be fixed. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=216.96s)]
*  And two, we must have legitimate outlets or movements or places to channel our anger [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=218.12s)]
*  at these cruel systems and actually have them respond to us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=224.12s)]
*  We must have the ability to do something about it in a legal, nonviolent and democratic manner. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=227.56s)]
*  We can be sure that the insurance industry will do everything in its power to fight this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfWTZE85I94&t=233.14000000000001s)]
