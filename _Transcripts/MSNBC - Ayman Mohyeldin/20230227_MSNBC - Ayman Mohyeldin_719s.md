# Rep. Barbara Lee on her 2024 Senate bid
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI)
*  So the 2024 presidential race is taking shape. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, you heard me correctly. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=8.0s)]
*  I am talking about 2024. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=9.44s)]
*  First Lady Jill Biden just gave one of the clear signs yet that President Biden will [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  run for reelection, telling the Associated Press there is, quote, pretty much nothing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=15.8s)]
*  left to do but figure out the time and place for the announcement. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=20.28s)]
*  And for the president, there actually may be no better time than the present. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=24.98s)]
*  A new NPR PBS poll has Biden with his highest approval rating in almost a year, 49 percent [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=28.92s)]
*  among registered voters. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=35.96s)]
*  And then you have Donald Trump, who is not faring as well. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=37.78s)]
*  According to that same poll, a majority of Republicans and right-leaning independents [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=41.800000000000004s)]
*  prefer someone other than Trump at the top of the GOP ticket. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=46.2s)]
*  It is one of several recent indicators that Trump's grip on the Republican Party might [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=50.74s)]
*  actually be slipping. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=56.24s)]
*  A new report from The Washington Post finds that even some of the ex-president's most [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=57.76s)]
*  faithful supporters are now suffering from the dreaded Trump fatigue. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  The Post interviewed more than 150 Trump supporters across five pivotal electoral states, and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=67.1s)]
*  they found that although he maintains a bond with his base, many voters have expressed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=72.2s)]
*  interest in finding a new standard bearer. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=77.6s)]
*  One voter told The Post, quote, I and a lot of other Republicans who were supportive of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=81.16s)]
*  President Trump are becoming less and less supportive. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=85.42s)]
*  Not because I'm a never-Trump-er. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=88.34s)]
*  I just don't believe Trump is the best person to move this party forward. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=90.86s)]
*  Ouch. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=95.26s)]
*  And just this morning, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel threw a new [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=96.26s)]
*  problem at Trump, a loyalty pledge. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=101.22s)]
*  McDaniel said that all candidates wishing to take part in the Republican Party's first [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=104.42s)]
*  presidential primary debate must promise to support the eventual 2024 nominee. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=108.34s)]
*  That must be news to Trump, who said earlier this month that his potential support, quote, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  would depend on the nominee. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  It almost seems like that pledge is designed to knock Trump, and only Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=121.34s)]
*  Look, we know the 2024 election is ages from now, but what's happening at this point could [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  set the stage for the rest of the primary cycle. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=132.36s)]
*  And here's what we're seeing tonight. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=135.34s)]
*  Democrats are coalescing around President Biden at the time he needs it most. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  Republicans are fleeing from Trump at the worst possible time for the ex-president. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=142.78s)]
*  Earlier, I spoke with Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California about the 2024 presidential [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=147.78s)]
*  race, her own 2024 race for the U.S. Senate, and more. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=152.78s)]
*  Congresswoman Lee, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=158.98s)]
*  Let's start with President Biden here for a moment. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  After racking up a series of political wins, the president is seeing some of his highest [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=164.33999999999997s)]
*  approval ratings in almost a year. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=169.44s)]
*  We're expecting him to officially announce his reelection any day now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=172.38s)]
*  Is Joe Biden the right candidate for Democrats in 2024? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=176.7s)]
*  And does the answer depend on who Republicans nominate? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=180.12s)]
*  Nice to be with you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=184.28s)]
*  Let me just respond by saying I think he is absolutely the right candidate for president [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=187.44s)]
*  next year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  When you look at, first of all, the context and the environment in which he took over [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  in terms of people dying and getting very sick from the COVID-19 pandemic, making sure [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  that he put forth measures to save lives and livelihoods. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=205.28s)]
*  I mean, that was a big deal. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=208.88s)]
*  We're still not over it, but we're moving toward, you know, an environment where people [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  feel safe now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=215.84s)]
*  He put forth the infrastructure plan, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CARES plan. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  We did so much with regard to CHIPS, bringing jobs back into America, good paying union [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=224.32s)]
*  jobs. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=231.2s)]
*  He worked very hard to develop provisions to address the climate crisis. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=232.2s)]
*  He has done an amazing job. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=237.64s)]
*  Ensured that racial equity, gender, LGBTQ plus equity is included in every single policy [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=240.28s)]
*  that he puts forward. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=246.46s)]
*  Let me move on to another 2024 race one that will be watched very closely, expected to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=249.04s)]
*  be one of the most expensive ever, and that is your bid to be California's next senator. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=253.48s)]
*  Talk to us about why you decided to throw your hat into the ring. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=258.84s)]
*  And more importantly, how do you plan to stand apart from your Democratic colleagues who [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=262.76s)]
*  have also declared their candidacies like Representative Adam Schiff and Katie Porter? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=266.96s)]
*  I intend to put forth to the voters my accomplishments, first of all, and what I have done to deliver [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=272.92s)]
*  California voters for many, many years. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=281.16s)]
*  As a progressive African American woman, I connect with the voters and many of their [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=284.32s)]
*  daily challenges and their experiences. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=289.88s)]
*  I'm going to move forward in my campaign, which is what I'm doing now, talking to people [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=293.24s)]
*  who have never been seen, for example, people who are living on the edges. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=297.68s)]
*  I want to focus on some issues that really aren't lifted up in campaigns by helping make [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=303.28s)]
*  life better for people such as poverty elimination. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=308.44s)]
*  We have over 140 million people living in poverty in the United States, over 20 million [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=312.64s)]
*  in California, food insecurity, inequality in general, looking at the climate crisis, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=317.64s)]
*  bringing forth new ways to address public safety. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=323.88s)]
*  Every community wants to be safe. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=326.4s)]
*  Housing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=328.64s)]
*  You know, California has an extremely severe housing emergency, looking at issues that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=329.64s)]
*  we can tackle at the federal level in the Senate to address housing in a comprehensive [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=335.8s)]
*  way. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  If elected, you would become just the third black female senator in our country's history. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  Black women are often described as the backbone of the Democratic Party. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=348.48s)]
*  We saw that even in 2024 in the turnaround that Joe Biden had in South Carolina. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=351.68s)]
*  Why do you think they have struggled to gain the representation in the upper chamber that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=356.78s)]
*  they deserve? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=361.76s)]
*  Well, representation does matter. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=363.76s)]
*  And let me just remind you that the first House and Senate went into session in 1789. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=365.56s)]
*  Since then, two African-American women have served in the Senate a total of 10 years. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=372.0s)]
*  That's Senator Kamala Harris and former Senator Carol Moseley Braun. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=376.84s)]
*  The lens of black women are extremely important. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=381.24s)]
*  The lens of everyone in this country are very important in the Senate. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=384.28s)]
*  Of course, you know, we have all of the challenges and barriers that black women and women of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=389.4s)]
*  color continue to face, and still we move forward in breaking these barriers. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=393.56s)]
*  Financing, funding campaigns. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=398.35999999999996s)]
*  We have to get to public financing of campaigns because black women have many challenges and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=400.08s)]
*  many barriers to raising money. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=404.32s)]
*  But we still move forward and look at what Mayor Bass did in her phenomenal race. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=407.0s)]
*  Nine million dollars she won, to $100 million, which her opponents spent. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=411.2s)]
*  And yes, black women have dealt with many challenges and barriers that this country [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=417.44s)]
*  has embedded in its DNA. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=426.0s)]
*  Every time we break those barriers, we break it not only for ourselves, but we do that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=427.0s)]
*  for everyone. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=431.76s)]
*  We bring everyone to the table, a seat at the table. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=432.76s)]
*  And so it's important that the strength and the lens and the experiences of black women [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=435.76s)]
*  be included in the Senate debates and included in Senate legislation and policies. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  It's outrageous that we don't have that perspective in the Senate. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=447.28s)]
*  Speaking of rights and policies, let's switch gears to a looming decision that we're expecting [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=451.91999999999996s)]
*  out of Texas. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=455.79999999999995s)]
*  A Trump-appointed judge could ban abortion pills nationwide. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=456.79999999999995s)]
*  You have been an outspoken critic about the overturning of Roe vs. Wade and speaking about [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=461.24s)]
*  your pre-Roe abortion undergoing what you described as a back alley abortion in Mexico. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=468.32s)]
*  Are you fearful that women once again will have to resort to dangerous procedures if [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=475.4s)]
*  these safe and effective methods are continuously stripped away from women in this country? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=480.68s)]
*  Yes, millions of people use medication abortion. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=486.35999999999996s)]
*  It's safe. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=490.35999999999996s)]
*  And in fact, I'm worried that the clinics now are going to be overwhelmed once again [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=491.35999999999996s)]
*  because patients from other states that have banned abortions also need treatment. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=495.64s)]
*  In addition to that, abortions need miscarriage treatment. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=501.8s)]
*  And so we're waiting to see what this decision will render. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=507.36s)]
*  We're waiting to see what exactly it will say. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=511.04s)]
*  But believe you me, this is a terrible precedent to set because it really hampers the FDA from [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=513.16s)]
*  moving forward on developing other drugs, other FDA-approved drugs, if in fact the court [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=519.16s)]
*  rules against medication abortion. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=527.36s)]
*  Millions of people rely on this and it's wrong to take this another way to help people control [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=530.7s)]

*  This is another rollback on our basic rights. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=540.78s)]
*  And it's up to people to decide what they want to do with their own medical decisions. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=544.66s)]
*  And medication abortion is an option that people should have and it should be their [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=550.78s)]

*  Before we go, I want to ask you about a bill you proposed this week. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=560.0200000000001s)]
*  I would argue a pretty bold bill. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=562.86s)]
*  It's the People Over Pentagon Act, which would cut the Pentagon's budget by $100 billion [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=565.2600000000001s)]
*  per year. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=570.98s)]
*  You've suggested refocusing that money on other priorities like infrastructure, health [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=572.2600000000001s)]
*  care and education. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=576.0600000000001s)]
*  What is your message to those who think a cutting budget or cutting the budget of defense [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=577.98s)]
*  spending makes us less safe, especially as the world becomes more dangerous with Russia [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=584.34s)]
*  and China on the rise? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=588.18s)]
*  But you know what it doesn't. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=591.38s)]
*  Cutting $100 billion, when you look at the defense budget, over $850 billion compared [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=594.38s)]
*  to the budget which I chaired on the Committee on Appropriations for last year, $64 billion [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=600.4599999999999s)]
*  for development and diplomacy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=605.0999999999999s)]
*  Come on, we've got to have a balanced national security strategy. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=606.5799999999999s)]
*  $100 billion, when you look at the waste, fraud and abuse inherent in the Pentagon budget [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=610.6199999999999s)]
*  that hasn't even passed an audit yet, when you look at defense contractors misusing tax [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=617.5s)]
*  dollars, scamming the system, you can't tell me that $100 billion will tamper. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=623.6999999999999s)]
*  And we've had military experts show us and make sure that we understood that's not going [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=628.26s)]
*  to touch any effort that would harm our troops. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=633.86s)]
*  It's not going to make a dent in our ability to ensure our national security. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=637.78s)]
*  And what it will do is begin to address waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars so we [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=642.38s)]
*  can have the resources here in our own country for education, for housing, for health care, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=648.3s)]
*  for the climate, for all of the issues that the American people so deserve. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=655.78s)]
*  $100 billion out of $858 billion versus $64 billion for diplomacy, for preventing wars. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=660.0999999999999s)]
*  Come on, this is a modest measure. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=667.8199999999999s)]
*  I've been working on this not recently. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=671.54s)]
*  I mean, this has been for 25 years on trying to cut this defense budget. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=673.3s)]
*  And we're building support around the country for this, but it's not an issue around national [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=676.8199999999999s)]

*  Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=687.42s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for your time. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=689.78s)]
*  Always appreciate talking to you. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8akqBZLDAI&t=691.38s)]
