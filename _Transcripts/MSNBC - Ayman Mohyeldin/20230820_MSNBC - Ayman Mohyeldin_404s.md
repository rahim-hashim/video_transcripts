# The real victims of Donald Trump’s election lies
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY)
*  So, it's a process that is becoming all too familiar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=0.0s)]
*  Following the release of Fallon County DA, Fonny Willis' bombshell 41 count indictment, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, like clockwork, took his failed social media site to rail against the charges [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=10.66s)]
*  and once again cast himself as the victim of an unrelenting political witch hunt. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=17.02s)]
*  Now it's language that we have heard before, but when it comes to this specific case, Trump's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=22.06s)]
*  insistence on playing the victim card is actually downright insulting because despite what the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=27.9s)]
*  twice-impeached and now quadruple-indicted ex-president wants you to believe, he is not [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=33.3s)]
*  the victim here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=38.74s)]
*  In the days, weeks and months following his election loss, Trump and his allies employed [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=39.86s)]
*  a desperate scheme to hold on to power with no consideration for the innocent people that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=44.7s)]
*  they took down along the way. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=49.5s)]
*  Of course, there's Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=51.18s)]
*  earned the ex-president's ire after he refused to help Trump and his allies find enough votes [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=55.18s)]
*  to win the election. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=61.260000000000005s)]
*  Raffensperger would soon find his commitment to democracy and the rule of law basically [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=62.580000000000005s)]
*  came with a steep cost. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=68.14s)]
*  His wife, Tricia Raffensperger, told Reuters how the threats and intimidation from Trump's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=69.58s)]
*  supporters forced her family into hiding for almost a week in late November. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=74.38s)]
*  The harassment continued for months, often in the form of threatening text messages, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=79.42s)]
*  including this text that Raffensperger told Reuters she received in April 2021, reading, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=83.5s)]
*  quote, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=88.66s)]
*  There's, of course, Gabriel Sterling. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=93.66s)]
*  Back in December of 2020, he is the Republican senior election official who held that emotional [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=95.46s)]
*  press conference at the state capitol in which he recounted the death threats and abuse he [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=99.78s)]
*  and others had endured in the weeks since the election. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=104.86s)]
*  Sterling even called out then-President Trump directly and cautioned what could happen if [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=108.61999999999999s)]
*  the violent rhetoric continued. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=112.98s)]
*  Someone's going to get hurt. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=114.7s)]
*  Someone's going to get shot. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=117.62s)]
*  Someone's going to get killed. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=118.62s)]
*  But perhaps no two people bore the brunt of Trump's big lie in Georgia more than these [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=121.22s)]
*  two, Ruby Freeman and Shay Moss. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=125.30000000000001s)]
*  In the days after the election, the mother-daughter duo, both Atlanta election workers, found [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=127.94s)]
*  themselves at the center of one of the most persistent conspiracies spread by Trump and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=132.82s)]
*  his allies. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=138.5s)]
*  Using selectively edited video, Trump and Rudy Giuliani claimed that Freeman and Moss [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=139.7s)]
*  committed voter fraud by pulling out fraudulent ballots from a suitcase on election night. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=144.94s)]
*  Giuliani also said Freeman and Moss were passing USB drives containing votes, quote, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=150.26s)]
*  like vials of heroin or cocaine during ballot counting operations. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=155.14s)]
*  Trump even referred to the two women more than a dozen times during his infamous call [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=160.02s)]
*  with Raffensperger falsely calling Freeman a, quote, professional vote scammer and a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=164.42000000000002s)]
*  hustler. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=169.26000000000002s)]
*  And despite Georgia election officials immediately debunking these outrageous claims, the lies [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=170.26000000000002s)]
*  spread and spread and spread on conservative media like wildfire. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=176.22s)]
*  Now, last year, Freeman and Moss testified before the January 6th committee, and they [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=180.74s)]
*  shared how the ex-president's dangerous disinformation campaign nearly destroyed their lives. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=184.82s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  Upside down, I no longer give out my business card. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=194.38s)]
*  I don't transfer calls. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=202.66s)]
*  I don't want anyone knowing my name. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=205.46s)]
*  I don't want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  aisle or something. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  There is nowhere I feel safe. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=215.62s)]
*  Nowhere. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=218.10000000000002s)]
*  Do you know how it feels to have the President of the United States to target you? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=221.3s)]
*  The President of the United States is supposed to represent every American, not to target [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=229.82000000000002s)]
*  one. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=237.38000000000002s)]
*  But he targeted me, Lady Ruby, a small business owner, a mother, a proud American citizen [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  who stand up to help Fulton County run an election in the middle of the pandemic. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=248.5s)]
*  Now, unlike Brad Raffensperger and Gabriel Sterling, you know, officers of the state, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=255.18s)]
*  Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss didn't ask for this national spotlight. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=261.1s)]
*  They didn't run for public office. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  They didn't take on high-profile positions that came with resources and security. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=267.34s)]
*  They simply volunteered, just as thousands of ordinary Americans do every election cycle [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=272.26s)]
*  to help their fellow citizens at the polls and do the work that keeps our democracy functioning [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=277.38s)]
*  year after year. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=283.58s)]
*  And what thanks did they get from their president? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=285.66s)]
*  A months-long harassment campaign led by the most powerful man in the world. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=287.94s)]
*  Unfortunately, it seems accountability is on the horizon for Freeman and Moss because [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  last month Rudy Giuliani was forced to admit in a court filing that he made false statements [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=297.54s)]
*  about the duo manipulating ballots. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=303.7s)]
*  Now, a significant part of this week's indictment focuses on that harassment campaign that targeted them. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=306.5s)]
*  The indictment charges Trump and others with repeatedly and falsely accusing Freeman of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=313.38s)]
*  committing election fraud, with some going as far as traveling from out of state to Freeman's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=318.02000000000004s)]
*  home to intimidate her and solicit her to falsely confess to election crimes that she did not commit. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=322.82s)]
*  Freeman's place in that indictment serves as a reminder of the human toll of Trump's lies. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=329.54s)]
*  Far too often when we talk about the ex-president's election interference, we center one victim, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=334.82000000000005s)]
*  democracy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=340.82000000000005s)]
*  Yes, that is important to acknowledge the damage that Trump did to our democracy, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=341.94s)]
*  and it continues to do to our institutions. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=346.5s)]
*  But we cannot let the real people he harmed along the way fall through the cracks. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=349.06s)]
*  As the fallen county in Diamond lays out, in black and white, the ex-president's alleged crimes [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=353.70000000000005s)]
*  were not victimless. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=358.26000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump's big lie has now changed the lives of everyday people like Seymoss and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=359.94s)]
*  Ruby Freeman, and it's been changed forever. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=365.46s)]
*  They deserve accountability. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=368.42s)]
*  They deserve justice. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=370.34s)]
*  And they deserve to know that in America, no one, not even a former president, is above the law. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=372.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJjTl1N_LY&t=389.94s)]
