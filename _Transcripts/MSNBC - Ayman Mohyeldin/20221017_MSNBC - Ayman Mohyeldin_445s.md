# Reflecting On #MeToo, Five Years After The Movement Went Viral
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA)
*  Five years ago this week, the Me Too movement went viral. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=0.0s)]
*  It brought light to millions of cases of sexual harassment and harassment around the world. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  And joining me now is the founder of that movement, Tarana Burke. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=11.22s)]
*  Tarana, it's great to have you in the studio. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=14.08s)]
*  It's great to see you and meet you in person. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=15.84s)]
*  I've finally been following your work for so many years. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=17.6s)]
*  As we mentioned, it's been five years since this movement was launched. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=21.12s)]
*  How do you – it's been a remarkable journey. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=25.1s)]
*  How do you take it all in? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=28.64s)]
*  How do you evaluate what these past five years have been? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=29.68s)]
*  Well, you know, the way I've been framing it and trying to help people frame it is that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=32.2s)]
*  when five-year marks happen in civil rights movements or any kind of social justice movements, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=36.68s)]
*  people tend to want to talk about all the things that have happened and, you know, how [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=41.36s)]
*  do you feel. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=45.36s)]
*  But what I've been talking about lately is what Me Too has made possible. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=46.36s)]
*  Because it's easy to codify, like you talked about, the laws and the policies and the cases. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  I think it's really important to think about what the last five years have made possible. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=55.68s)]
*  Because just five and a half years ago, we couldn't have a sustained conversation about [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=60.6s)]
*  sexual violence in this country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=64.72s)]
*  And now we can. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=66.7s)]
*  Five and a half years ago, survivors of sexual violence, no matter how they identified, couldn't [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  feel comfortable to talk about the things that they experienced. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=72.56s)]
*  And now we can. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=75.52s)]
*  So we have made so much more possible in the last five years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=76.8s)]
*  In fact, we've probably made more possible in the last five years than we could have [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  in the next 20 years. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=83.8s)]
*  What do you attribute that to? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=85.44s)]
*  Is it simply a cultural shift? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=87.12s)]
*  Or is it simply the fact that everybody realized, hey, you are not alone, and that the sheer [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  volume of people who had survived sexual abuse was so compelling that it could no longer [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  be ignored? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=99.88s)]
*  You couldn't look away. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=100.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=101.88s)]
*  I think that when it went viral, for the sheer number of people that came forward, I think, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=102.88s)]
*  you know, of course you had the celebrities and people like that who came out. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=107.28s)]
*  But you cannot take away from the labor of survivors who came forward, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=110.48s)]
*  Every day people who decided to put the hashtag online or tell a friend or just to disclose [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=114.64s)]
*  for the first time. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=119.68s)]
*  It was so many people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=120.84s)]
*  You're talking about in the first 24 hours, there were 12 billion disclosures across social [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=122.32s)]
*  media. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  You cannot ignore that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  And I think once that happened, it created a community. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=129.56s)]
*  And one of the places that we don't even find to be safe a lot of times for survivors, it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=133.04s)]
*  created community on the internet. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=137.04s)]
*  And that spilled over into real life. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=139.28s)]
*  And once people couldn't look away, then we started building from there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=141.44s)]
*  As I mentioned, you started working with young brown and black girls in Alabama. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=145.2s)]
*  That's where this began. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=149.28s)]
*  But since then, this movement has evolved. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=150.28s)]
*  And I want to just know, how has your work evolved from what you were doing in Alabama [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=152.68s)]
*  to what you are doing now? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=156.68s)]
*  How has that informed the way that you organize and the way that you collectively mobilize [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=158.86s)]
*  your team and the organization? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=166.2s)]
*  Well, first of all, our work evolved from girls from the very beginning, even before [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=168.24s)]
*  2017. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=173.88s)]
*  I started with black and brown girls in Alabama. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=174.88s)]
*  We started including more and more people even before 2017 came. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=176.76s)]
*  But one of the biggest things that I think I learned in the last five years is that we [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=181.44s)]
*  have to focus on culture shift and narrative change. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=184.4s)]
*  We can change as many laws and policies if we want to. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  But if we don't change the way people understand sexual violence, if we don't undermine the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=190.88s)]
*  roots of rape culture in this country, then it won't matter what kind of laws we pass. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=195.86s)]
*  In fact, we've had laws in the books to say these things are illegal for years, but people [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=200.5s)]
*  ignore them. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=204.62s)]
*  It's the culture that we have that makes the space for the violence. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=205.78s)]
*  Once we undermine that, then we will have people engaging differently with sexual violence, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=209.46s)]
*  understand it as a public health crisis and a social justice issue. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=215.06s)]
*  I was moved by a piece that you wrote in Time Magazine this week, and I want to read a little [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=217.98s)]
*  bit of it, because you wrote that you referenced a woman you encountered during the Christine [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=221.58s)]
*  Blasey Ford testimony. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=226.58s)]
*  She told you that she wished Ford could remember more. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=228.14000000000001s)]
*  We see often that survivors are easily dismissed when they can't recount exactly every detail [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  of what they survived and what they endured. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=238.3s)]
*  Somehow, because they can't remember every single detail, they are not the perfect victim. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  Talk to me a little bit about this idea. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=247.74s)]
*  When you talk about the cultural shift that needs to happen, about what we need to do [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=248.98s)]
*  to simply believe women. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=253.45999999999998s)]
*  This is what I call the life cycle of a survivor. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=255.54s)]
*  I think it's a misconception we have because of all the television shows. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=258.02s)]
*  I'm a survivor myself, and that's why I use that story to explain. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=261.74s)]
*  People think there are some people who remember every single detail and every single moment, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=265.76s)]
*  and then you have to understand this is some of the worst things that have ever happened [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=269.74s)]
*  to us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=273.08s)]
*  I don't want to remember. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=274.08s)]
*  I do remember a lot of the details, and because I don't want to remember, I would rather [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=275.5s)]
*  lose all of my memory than to remember that moment in my life. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=279.94s)]
*  I think it's things like that that people don't get about what sexual violence is. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=284.26s)]
*  You have to compare it as a type of death for so many people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=288.54s)]
*  You've taken a part of us that we can never get back. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=292.46s)]
*  We can only try to get something new in its place and try to be whole again. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=295.26s)]
*  When people understand what sexual violence does to a person, then I think they will engage [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=299.48s)]
*  with it differently and engage. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=304.24s)]
*  It's not about individuals. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=306.04s)]
*  It's about our collective safety. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  If you care about gun violence, you should care about sexual violence because it's about [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=310.08s)]
*  our safety, about community safety. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=313.92s)]
*  I want to ask you about men in this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=316.32s)]
*  What role do men play in this movement? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=321.24s)]
*  When you talk about a cultural shift and a change of the system, men are obviously a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=324.12s)]
*  big part of that reality. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=328.54s)]
*  How do we change it? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=331.48s)]
*  What is incumbent on men to do in this system change that you're talking about? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=332.88s)]
*  Well, one, it's incumbent on all of us to know that men are survivors, too. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=336.04s)]
*  The first role of men in the Me Too movement is as survivors. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=340.52s)]
*  We have to stop thinking about this as a woman's movement, and we have to stop thinking about [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=343.92s)]
*  sexual violence as something that only happens to women. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=347.5s)]
*  Once we understand this happens to all of us, then maybe all of us will engage in this [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=350.56s)]
*  as something that we have to all attack together. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=355.0s)]
*  I also think that we have to talk about power and privilege, and we have to understand that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=358.36s)]
*  people don't ever want to relinquish their power and privilege. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=362.68s)]
*  When you think about power and privilege, you think about people who are the most vulnerable. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  Those are the people who are always going to be attacked, and people don't ever want [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=370.8s)]
*  to relinquish their power and privilege. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  Men who have a lot of power and privilege have to do some self-analysis. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=376.8s)]
*  People who have a lot of power and privilege have to do self-analysis about how they use [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=381.52s)]
*  that power and privilege. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  Sexual violence is not about sex, and it's not about desire. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=390.96s)]
*  It's about power and privilege. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  Once we rethink the way we've been engaging with that and understand that, then we can [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=396.68s)]
*  understand how we fight this issue differently. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=402.08s)]
*  Tyronne Burke, it's been five years longer since the beginning of this movement, but [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=404.32s)]
*  thank you for the incredible work you and everyone else is doing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=408.76s)]
*  We have a long way to go to make it right, but it is an important milestone nonetheless. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=417.0s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=418.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=419.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=420.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ng9UiEClA&t=420.96s)]
