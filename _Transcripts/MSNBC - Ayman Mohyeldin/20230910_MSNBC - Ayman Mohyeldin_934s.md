# Rep. Jamie Raskin on fighting the right-wing plot to gut the federal government
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU)
*  We begin tonight with a rare warning about our democracy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=0.0s)]
*  It is in dire straits, and that is not according to just one or two, but rather 13 presidential [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=7.28s)]
*  libraries dating back to Herbert Hoover, all of which on Thursday released a joint statement [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=14.96s)]
*  calling for a recommitment to the country's bedrock principles, including the rule of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=20.72s)]
*  law and respecting a diversity of beliefs. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=25.84s)]
*  I can't say this enough. This is an unprecedented move from the group. Never before have the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=30.0s)]
*  presidential libraries engaged so directly in political affairs. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=35.36s)]
*  And while the joint message stopped short of calling out individuals by name, the subject [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=39.8s)]
*  of the warning was clear. The declaration read, in part, Americans have a strong interest [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=44.52s)]
*  in supporting democratic movements and respect for human rights around the world because [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=50.22s)]
*  Free societies elsewhere contribute to our own security and prosperity here at home. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=54.88s)]
*  But that interest is undermined when others see our own house in disarray. Our elected [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=60.6s)]
*  officials must lead by example and govern effectively in ways that deliver for the American [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=66.4s)]
*  people. This, in turn, will help to restore trust and public service. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=71.88s)]
*  Maybe you're thinking this sounds a bit melodramatic because things may not look like they're falling [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=77.92s)]
*  apart, but students of history will recall that one authoritarian method is too slowly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=83.44s)]
*  to begin to chip away at democratic norms. It doesn't happen overnight. It's not going [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=90.2s)]
*  to overhaul the whole system in one fell swoop. But if you keep chipping away at it, it will [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=95.28s)]
*  finally and ultimately erode. Tom Nichols writes in The Atlantic, the collapse of democracy [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=99.64s)]
*  in the United States will look more like an unspooling or an unwinding rather than some [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=104.68s)]
*  dramatic installation of Gilead or Oceania. My guess is that it will be a federal breakdown [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=110.04s)]
*  that returns us to the late 1950s in all of the worst ways. Nichols admits he is guessing, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  but if informed, it might be an actually educated guess. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=125.4s)]
*  Last month, a group of right-wing organizations and former Trump officials published something [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  called Project 2025. It's essentially a roadmap for reshaping the federal government should [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=133.62s)]
*  the disgraced ex-president return to the White House. They want to gut the so-called administrative [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=139.62s)]
*  state from within by ousting federal employees that they believe are standing in the way [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=145.22s)]
*  of Trump's agenda and replacing them with like-minded officials more eager to fulfill [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=149.66s)]
*  their approach to governing. They believe on day one that they'll be able to commandeer, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=155.52s)]
*  reshape and do away with the quote deep state bureaucracy in part by firing as many as 50,000 [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=161.62s)]
*  federal workers. And they have plans for the military as well. Former acting Secretary [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=168.38s)]
*  of Defense Christopher Miller contributed to this plan and he wants Trump to immediately [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=173.44s)]
*  ban quote Marxist indoctrination and critical race theory programs and reinstate personnel [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=177.98s)]
*  dismissed for disobeying vaccine orders. As Nichols ends his essay, much of this stuff [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=184.54s)]
*  is nonsense of course, but it'll be nonsense right up until the point it isn't. There are [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=190.9s)]
*  these are all names that would reappear in a second Trump administration. We know that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=198.78s)]
*  and this time they'd move a lot faster in breaking down the federal guardrails around [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=202.54000000000002s)]
*  our democracy. And that should terrify all of us. Joining me now is Congressman and House [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=208.02s)]
*  Oversight Ranking Member Jamie Raskin. Congressman, it's great to have you back on the show. Thank [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=213.66000000000003s)]
*  you so much for making time for us this evening. What was your reaction to this unprecedented [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=219.10000000000002s)]
*  joint warning from the 13 presidential libraries? Well, I'm glad that people who are concerned [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=224.56s)]
*  about American history are willing to intervene in the moment to say that the Trump movement [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=232.72s)]
*  is threatening to utterly derange and deform the American experiment. And that's where [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=240.6s)]
*  we are. We're still in the thick of this struggle. And so it's good to have people speaking out [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=246.8s)]
*  about that. You know, they are laying out their plans to renew what Steve Bannon talked [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=252.48s)]
*  about at the very beginning of the Trump administration, which was to dismantle the deep state by [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  which he means the federal government that implements the laws of the people adopted [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=265.76s)]
*  by Congress. So if they can't repeal the Clean Air Act, if they can't repeal the Social Security [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  Act, if they can't repeal the Clean Water Act or the Fair Labor Standards Act, they [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=277.36s)]
*  will make it impossible for the federal government to enforce any of these critical framework [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=281.88s)]
*  statutes. Congressman, let me get your thoughts on this plan, this so-called Project 2025 [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=287.12s)]
*  put forth by Trump allies. It sounds almost supervillain-esque. Why are they so desperate [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=293.52s)]
*  to gut the federal government? And how seriously should we take this? Well, very seriously. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=300.0s)]
*  We see the way that they targeted women's right to choose in Roe v. Wade. They packed [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  the courts with Federalist Society right-wingers and they demolished Roe v. Wade and they've [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=314.44s)]
*  thrown the country into an uproar over this assault on women's rights. They've rolled [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=321.4s)]
*  the clock back on the civil rights progress that we've made since the 1960s and 70s in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  many different ways. I mean, you've got Governor DeSantis, who's trying to teach children [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=336.64s)]
*  that slavery was basically a skills training apprenticeship program in the beginning of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=341.88s)]
*  American history. And so what they're really talking about doing is demolishing and destroying [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=349.4s)]
*  the New Deal and repealing the administrative state that's used to enforce statutes like [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=356.56s)]
*  the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the National Labor Relations Act. They want to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=363.44s)]
*  make it impossible for federal laws to be implemented. Now, it's the president's job [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=367.92s)]
*  to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. That's the heart of his constitutional [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=373.32s)]
*  duty. But they, of course, want to take care that all of the laws be totally frustrated [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=377.88s)]
*  and defeated. And that's their vision. They want to return power to corrupt right-wing [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=385.88s)]
*  state governments and make the federal government just for military and national security state [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=393.04s)]
*  purposes and for passing out corporate largesse to their best friends and business. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=399.0s)]
*  Congressman, let me pivot for a moment and get your thoughts, if I can, on the developments [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  out of Georgia with Mark Meadows failing to move his Georgia election case to a federal [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  court. I mean, as somebody who has investigated January 6 so closely as a result of the second [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  impeachment trial, what do you make of that development and the argument that Mark Meadows [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=421.26000000000005s)]
*  was trying to make that he was simply doing his job as the White House Chief of Staff? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=427.22s)]
*  Well, the critical issue in that ruling, Eamon, was whether or not he was fulfilling his federal [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=431.46000000000004s)]
*  duties. And if he had been fulfilling his federal work assignment, then he really could [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=440.62s)]
*  have gotten his case removed to federal court. Those are statutes that are there to protect [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=447.62s)]
*  federal workers who are trying to implement civil rights laws, for example, against recalcitrant [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=454.62s)]
*  racist governments in the South. But the court, I think, rendered an excellent ruling saying, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=461.06s)]
*  if you're getting involved in politics generally as a federal worker, you're violating the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=468.5s)]
*  Hatch Act. You've crossed the line to engaging in political work. And if you go all the way [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=475.5s)]
*  through just getting involved in a campaign to trying to overthrow an election, you're [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=480.98s)]
*  not just being involved unlawfully in campaigning. You're involved in a criminal assault against [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=485.38s)]
*  the constitutional order. None of those things can be protected by federal law, and none [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=492.86s)]
*  of them give you the refuge of the federal courts from a prosecution in state court for [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=497.86s)]
*  your crimes. And of course, sir, our viewers know you very well as a congressman, but you [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=503.82s)]
*  were a constitutional law professor for many years. Let me get your thoughts on this effort [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=508.5s)]
*  to use the 14th Amendment to bar Trump from the 2024 ballot. Do you think it is a worthy [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=513.5s)]
*  legal strategy to pursue, or is it doomed to fail? No, the January 6th select committee [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=519.7s)]
*  invoked it, and we talked about it also during the impeachment. It's gotten a new lease on [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=526.78s)]
*  life as an argument because two very conservative Federalist Society professors wrote this law [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=531.4599999999999s)]
*  review article for the UPenn Law Review. But Section 3 of the 14th Amendment says that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=536.26s)]
*  anyone who's sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and violates the oath by, quote, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=541.3s)]
*  engaging in insurrection or rebellion, shall never be allowed to hold federal or state [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=545.86s)]
*  office again. Those professors made the point that this is a self-executing provision, like [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=550.14s)]
*  the one saying you've got to be 35 years old to run for president. If you show up to get [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=556.18s)]
*  on the ballot in Colorado and you're 22 years old, the board of elections or the secretary [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=561.02s)]
*  of state will just say you're not qualified, and they're making the point that these administrative [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=566.38s)]
*  actors can also say you're not qualified to someone who has engaged in insurrection against [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=571.86s)]
*  the union. So I think this is an issue that's going to break out all over the country, and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=577.46s)]
*  inevitably it will make its way up to the Supreme Court of the United States. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=581.54s)]
*  The Section 3 of the 14th Amendment doesn't say you can't have been, you can't run for [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=586.14s)]
*  office if you've been convicted of insurrection or rebellion. It just says you can't have [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=591.1s)]
*  engaged in insurrection or rebellion, which implies that it can be determined as a civil [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=595.86s)]
*  matter and you don't need to go to criminal court. Of course, Congress already determined [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  in the impeachment that President Trump had incited insurrection against the union, and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=606.86s)]
*  there was a 57 to 43 vote to convict him of that on the Senate side. Not enough to [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=611.74s)]
*  get to the two thirds of holding him culpable, but still robust bipartisan majorities in [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=617.22s)]
*  both houses saying that he had in fact engaged in insurrection by inciting it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=623.42s)]
*  Congressman, we spend a lot of time on this show talking about your oversight colleague [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=628.5s)]
*  James Comer and his conspiracy-laden quest to try and connect Joe Biden to his son's [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=633.22s)]
*  Now you have House Republicans pushing for an impeachment inquiry into the president [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=639.5s)]
*  without any factual basis to do so. Do Republicans at this point even care about policy and getting [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=644.42s)]
*  things done for Americans? I mean, if this is what the base of their party wants, how [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=650.58s)]
*  do Democrats work to counter program all this nonsense? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=655.46s)]
*  Well, when the Trump movement took over the Republican Party, they didn't pass a platform [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=661.46s)]
*  and that was a fairly explicit statement that their platform is just whatever Donald Trump [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=669.22s)]
*  tells them it is. It's not a party that's unified by any programmatic or policy purposes. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=673.7800000000001s)]
*  It's unified simply by their subservience to Donald Trump and their willingness to do [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=680.94s)]
*  whatever he tells them to do. So, yeah, I think that what's definitive of the GOP today, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=685.6600000000001s)]
*  alas, Lincoln's party, is that it's become a cult of authoritarian personality. They [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=693.66s)]
*  are going to impeachment simply because Donald Trump feels like he doesn't want to run against [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=700.18s)]
*  someone who's not been impeached when he's the first twice-impeached president in U.S. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=706.1s)]
*  history. I keep reminding my Republican colleagues that the constitutional standard for impeachment [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=710.86s)]
*  is treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors, and they haven't laid any [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=716.18s)]
*  wrongdoing at the footsteps of Joe Biden. They've got nothing on him. They've got 91 [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=721.78s)]
*  criminal charges against Donald Trump in courts all over the land, and there's nothing against [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=728.5s)]
*  Joe Biden, and Trump can't live with that. So that's why they're saying they're not going [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=733.46s)]
*  to vote for a budget. They'll shut the government down unless their impeachment proceedings [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=737.98s)]
*  initiated against Joe Biden. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=742.66s)]
*  And speaking of oversight, I've got to ask you about Jared Kushner. I mean, you have [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=744.94s)]
*  asked Comer to subpoena Jared Kushner's investment firm over its ties to the Saudi Arabian government, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=749.54s)]
*  to the Qatari government, United Arab Emirates as well. Can you explain why you are concerned? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=755.78s)]
*  What have you seen that makes you worried about this, that you want to have subpoenaed? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=760.3399999999999s)]
*  Jared Kushner created a company the day after the Trump administration ended and proceeded [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=768.3399999999999s)]
*  to collect billions of dollars, more than $2 billion from the Saudi government for investment [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=774.26s)]
*  there, despite the fact that the sovereign investment funds, investment advisors recommended [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=780.34s)]
*  against it. They were overruled by the homicidal crown prince himself, Mohammed bin Salman, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=786.34s)]
*  who said he wanted to give that money to Jared Kushner in addition to a $25 million a year [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=792.26s)]
*  management fee. There's been very little of that money invested. The whole thing smells like a huge [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=798.58s)]
*  payback, a payoff essentially for everything that Kushner did for Mohammed bin Salman in the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=805.14s)]
*  Saudis when he was running Middle East foreign policy there. And remember, he covered up for [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=812.9s)]
*  bin Salman's brutal dismemberment and assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, his drawing and quartering. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=818.98s)]
*  He tilted towards Saudi Arabia in the Yemen war when there were just terrible atrocities taking [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=827.14s)]
*  place against the Yemen population. And, in fact, Kushner had pushed for Saudi Arabia to be the [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=833.22s)]
*  first destination of Donald Trump in his foreign travel. So he got this huge payback. We have been [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=841.62s)]
*  trying to get documents showing what exactly they were doing for each other, but Jared Kushner [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=848.26s)]
*  refuses to comply. He's not answering any of the Democrats' requests. And Chairman Comer, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=854.26s)]
*  he said he agrees with us that Kushner crossed the line, crossed a line of ethics. And if that's true, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=860.02s)]
*  then he should go ahead and render a subpoena so Kushner will comply with our request so we [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=867.7s)]
*  can get to the bottom of this massive conflict of interest, likely foreign emoluments clause [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=874.02s)]
*  violation and crime against the public interest. And our foreign policy has been, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=880.5799999999999s)]
*  you know, irrevocably damaged by what Jared Kushner did with Saudi Arabia and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=888.9s)]
*  the other Gulf monarchies. And we want to get to the bottom of it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=895.22s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, sir, it's always a pleasure to see you. It's great to see you're [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=898.74s)]
*  doing well, sir. Thank you so much for coming back on the program, and we hope to see you again soon. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=902.26s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb9iccE71rU&t=907.9399999999999s)]
