Video Description: Former Never Trumpers—and even some Democrats—are suggesting Donald Trump deserves another chance. In a New York Times op-ed, "Done with Never Trump," Bret Stephens claims critics overreacted to January 6 and other threats to democracy, even speculating Trump may have changed. But Trump hasn’t become more disciplined—he’s doubling down, suing news outlets and targeting Never Trumpers like Liz Cheney. MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin explains how Stephens’ op-ed gets it wrong—and why Democrats like Senator Fetterman shouldn’t push for making peace with MAGA.

# Done with Never Trump? Polarizing op-ed divides anti-Trump conservatives ahead of second Trump term
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0)
*  Brett Stevens, a New York Times columnist, recently published a piece about those Republicans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=0.0s)]
*  titled Done with Never Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=4.3s)]
*  Never Trumpers are Republicans who vow to oppose Trump at every turn to protect democracy [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=8.16s)]
*  and the true conservative values of the Republican Party. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=14.32s)]
*  One of the most prominent voices, of course, of that coalition is former congresswoman [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=17.54s)]
*  Liz Cheney, who endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=20.5s)]
*  Stevens argues that it's time for folks like her to give up the resistance and give Trump [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=24.1s)]
*  a chance. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=29.88s)]
*  As a self-identified Never Trumper, he admitted Trump is a dangerous person from a conservative [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=31.32s)]
*  view, but he argues the movement overreacted, especially about January 6th. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=36.48s)]
*  Stevens writes that Trump's election lies and the Capitol attack led him to vote for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=42.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  But he said democracy means letting ordinary people, not elites, decide how important January [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=47.7s)]
*  6th is, and apparently most don't see it as a big deal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  Let's just stop here for a second. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=57.4s)]
*  The problem with January 6th, in my opinion, is not solely the attack on our Capitol. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=59.48s)]
*  It's also Trump's incendiary rhetoric and unfounded claims of a stolen election in the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  lead-up to the attack. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  Yes, I guess him telling the rioters to fight like hell really didn't help either. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=69.6s)]
*  But what he normalized then, and what he continues to normalize now, is the right for he and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=75.56s)]
*  his party to declare any and every election they lose as rigged just because they do not [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  have the courage to pay a politician's debt, which in this country means saying you lose [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=89.38s)]
*  when you lose. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  So I think it is fair to say calling January 6th an overreaction ignores the green light [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=97.44s)]
*  that Donald Trump and his enablers gave to this anti-democratic force, especially now [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  that he and those very same enablers are returning to power. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=106.8s)]
*  Stevens also assumes that despite nearly a decade in politics, there's a chance that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=110.94s)]
*  Donald Trump has changed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, changed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  As Rick Wilson responded, men in their late 70s do not suddenly have moral awakenings. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=119.38000000000001s)]
*  Trump hasn't become more disciplined or statesmanlike. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=124.3s)]
*  If anything, he's doubling down, which brings us to the revenge tour that Trump has promised [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=127.78s)]
*  and seems to have already kicked off. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  And just the past few weeks, ABC settled a lawsuit with Trump for $15 million, which [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=135.46s)]
*  many believe will embolden Trump to sue more outlets when they challenge him. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=139.52s)]
*  Trump's suing a local Iowa newspaper over polling results he didn't like during the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=145.7s)]
*  election. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  And in regards to never Trumpers like Liz Cheney, Trump and Republicans want the FBI [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=149.89999999999998s)]
*  to look into her for investigating the January 6th attack in Congress. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=154.17999999999998s)]
*  If this is what Trump will do before he returns to the White House, what does next month even [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=159.66s)]
*  look like? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=165.26s)]
*  We have elections for speaker, the election certification, the inauguration, and of course [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=166.78s)]
*  the Senate confirmation hearings for Trump's cabinet, something Stevens also wrote about. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=170.86s)]
*  He wants never Trumpers to give Trump's cabinet picks a chance. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=176.34s)]
*  He says they should stop comparing Trump to dictators and quit worrying about democracy [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  falling apart. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=183.74s)]
*  That is easier said than done, given who Trump has nominated. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=185.3s)]
*  Well, it's not a cabinet position. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=188.66000000000003s)]
*  Trump wants Cash Patel to run the FBI, the same man who said this to Steve Bannon. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=191.18s)]
*  We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=199.5s)]
*  helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=203.46s)]
*  Words that must be music to a wannabe dictator's ears. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=207.38s)]
*  We should just overlook that, especially when we know Trump embraces authoritarian rulers [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=211.46s)]
*  who mock democracies. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=216.78s)]
*  While he might claim to be joking, Trump mocks our own democracy all the time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=218.38s)]
*  He suggests things that violate our constitution, like not being able to run for a third term [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=222.66s)]
*  unless Republicans do something. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=227.86s)]
*  He also wants to take away birthright citizenship, something that is in the constitution. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=230.38s)]
*  This is not a time to soften oversight and criticism of Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=233.98s)]
*  He's about to be the leader of the free world again after four years of researching how [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=238.14s)]
*  to pull off what he couldn't do the first time. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=242.3s)]
*  And there are some Democrats already making the case for befriending MAGA, like Pennsylvania [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=245.18s)]
*  Senator John Fetterman on ABC Today. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=249.86s)]
*  Well, I it's like I've been warning people like you got to chill out, you know, like [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=253.98s)]
*  the constant, you know, freak out. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=261.02s)]
*  It's not helpful. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=265.3s)]
*  So you know, pack a lunch, pace yourself, because he hasn't even taken office yet. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=266.9s)]
*  You met with Kash Patel, I believe, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=273.18s)]
*  Yesterday. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=276.3s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=277.3s)]
*  He's talked about going after Trump's enemies. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=278.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=281.78s)]
*  And I've and we've had conversations, but we had, you know, all of all of these all [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=282.78s)]
*  of these interviews were all off the record and and those things. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=289.3s)]
*  So I'm not going to go into detail. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=294.18s)]
*  But but he absolutely is that that's, you know, that's never going to happen. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=295.9s)]
*  Look, democracies don't just collapse suddenly overnight. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  They erode slowly with the help of polite excuses and shrugs and giving, as we just [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=307.26000000000005s)]
*  saw there by John Fetterman, good faith arguments to those who have not earned it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3EdLuaHD0&t=312.62s)]
