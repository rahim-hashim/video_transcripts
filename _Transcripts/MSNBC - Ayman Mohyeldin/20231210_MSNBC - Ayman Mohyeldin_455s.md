# Ayman: James Comer's 'bombshell' claims about Hunter Biden keep unraveling
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo)
*  House Republicans are ready to take their evidence-free impeachment mission to the next [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=0.0s)]
*  level. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  They have scheduled a vote next week to formalize their inquiry against President Biden, alleging [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=8.56s)]
*  he and his son, Hunter Biden, engaged in shady business dealings. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=12.36s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson says he believes they have the votes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=16.36s)]
*  But the real question is, do they actually have the goods? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Now let's first address the elephant in the room. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=22.04s)]
*  Hunter Biden was indicted Thursday on nine tax-related charges, including allegations [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  of failing to file and pay taxes, evading an assessment and filing a fraudulent form. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=29.56s)]
*  But there isn't a single mention of his father anywhere in this indictment. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=35.08s)]
*  So at least for now, no luck for House Republicans there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=39.44s)]
*  Then there is House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, who this week claimed to have [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=42.84s)]
*  the smoking gun. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=47.16s)]
*  And he said that he obtained bank records showing Hunter Biden's firm making monthly [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  payments to his father in 2018, reflecting a, quote, pattern revealing Joe Biden knew [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=52.44s)]
*  about, participated in and benefited from his family's influence peddling schemes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=58.16s)]
*  It turns out the payments were for a 2018 Ford Raptor truck Joe Biden had purchased [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=63.36s)]
*  that Hunter was using. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=70.0s)]
*  Now this follows Comer's other supposed bombshell back in October, payments that revealed Biden [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  in his personal capacity two years after serving as vice president, loaned his brother some [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=76.88s)]
*  money, a loan his brother paid back. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=81.68s)]
*  Every time Comer claims he's uncovered real evidence against President Biden, somehow [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=85.12s)]
*  the story just promptly unravels. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=90.72s)]
*  As MSNBC Steve Benin notes, it is tempting to compare Comer to the boy who cried wolf, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=93.36s)]
*  but the parallels are imprecise. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  The boy in the story who destroyed his credibility eventually saw an actual wolf. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=101.12s)]
*  Congresswoman Chantelle Brown of Ohio sits on the Oversight Committee. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=107.12s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=110.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's great to have you back on the show. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=110.72s)]
*  Thank you for making time for us. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=112.4s)]
*  As we said, there's been no evidence tying President Biden to these serious charges Hunter [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=114.32s)]
*  is facing, but your colleagues on the Oversight Committee, they're still insisting there's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=119.84s)]
*  something there to impeach him for. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=124.08s)]
*  Your reaction to this impeachment push and the vote we'll see next week. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=126.64s)]
*  Here we go again. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=131.68s)]
*  Another week where this committee is showing that they are unserious, they have [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=133.28s)]
*  substantiated it is unnecessary. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  This investigation is just in another illegitimate impeachment inquiry, which is nothing more [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=141.44s)]
*  than a stunt. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=147.68s)]
*  Amen. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=148.4s)]
*  It shows that Republicans have their priorities are in the wrong place. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  They have no real policies to put forward. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  And now we're talking about years. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  We're talking about years of House Republicans and House Senate doing investigations that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=158.8s)]
*  have produced no evidence showing any wrongdoing by President Biden. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=164.16s)]
*  But this is what they do. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=169.28s)]
*  This tracks for the Republicans. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=170.56s)]
*  This is particularly on brand. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  They lie and they do it unapologetically, consistently and with zero shame. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=174.16s)]
*  They are consistently mischaracterizing the facts and distorting the timelines because [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=180.96s)]
*  there is nothing there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=186.16s)]
*  In fact, one of my colleagues was caught red handed during the last Hunter Biden [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  impeachment inquiry falsifying evidence because again, there is nothing there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=193.12s)]
*  So as I sit on these and oversight hearings and listen to hours and hours of testimony, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=198.96s)]
*  their own their own witnesses have admitted that there is nothing there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=205.52s)]
*  So this is just another stunt by the Republicans. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=212.0s)]
*  And instead of focusing on how we can lower health care and improve the quality of people's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  lives, Republicans are continuing to play politics for the audience of one, the twice [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  impeached, four times indicted. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=224.72s)]
*  As you pointed out, the one day dictator, maniacal, mega extremist, Don [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  No, J. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=235.92s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to ask you about Donald Trump in just a moment and the enablers who continue [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=237.44s)]
*  to make it possible for him to exist in our political life. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=242.16s)]
*  But James Comer is threatening to hold Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=244.48s)]
*  If he doesn't testify behind closed doors this week, Hunter to his credit has previously [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=248.88s)]
*  said he'd be willing to testify publicly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=252.64s)]
*  But Comer, as we've seen, shot that down. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=254.56s)]
*  Why do you think Comer is trying to push this behind closed doors? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=256.96s)]
*  Well, I think it's important to point out that first of all, the administration has [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=261.84s)]
*  been over backwards to comply with their endless request. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=265.52s)]
*  House Republicans have been given 35,000, 35,000 pages of financial records and 36 hours [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=269.52s)]
*  of testimony from top officials, including the FBI and DLJ and more. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=275.92s)]
*  So subpoena and Hunter Biden and forcing him to try to do it behind closed doors is further [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  proof that they have no evidence. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=286.24s)]
*  They want to be able to create their own narrative. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  They want to be able to misrepresent the truth. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=290.56s)]
*  You would think you would think if they had the evidence that they proclaimed that they [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=293.76s)]
*  would be chomping at the bit to have Hunter Biden on live TV giving his testimony, but [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=298.0s)]
*  they know they have nothing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  So this is why I think they are attempting to force him to do it behind closed doors, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=305.68s)]
*  because again, they have zero evidence of the president's doing anything, anything wrong. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=311.12s)]
*  Let me ask you really quick. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=316.56s)]
*  I mean, at the end of the day, is this impeachment mission about politics or accountability? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=317.44s)]
*  I mean, are they just trying to help Trump to give them some politics ammunition for [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=321.52s)]
*  the 2024 race? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=325.44s)]
*  It is definitely about politics. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=328.8s)]
*  They have no ammunition. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=331.12s)]
*  As you pointed out at the top of the story, Comer has talked about this smoking gun. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=332.4s)]
*  I don't even think it's amounted to a water pistol, as one of my colleagues pointed out [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  during the oversight committee hearing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  Comer has proven that he will do anything to try to satisfy Donald Trump. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=344.32s)]
*  But evidence has shown that there is nothing that the president has done wrong. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  And this is, again, an illegitimate inquiry. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=354.64s)]
*  My constituents in Cleveland, they look at this and they shake their heads, Aiman. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  This is not what they sent me to Congress to do. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=361.76s)]
*  People have bills to pay, work to do, businesses to run. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=364.32s)]
*  And they see the Republicans in Washington are living in a fantasy land and just pushing [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=367.52s)]
*  their, peddling their fictional conspiracy theories. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=372.48s)]
*  Let me ask you really quickly about Enablers for a Moment Congress. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=377.2s)]
*  It's something we talk a lot about on the show, and that is AIPAC. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  It has affiliates and its affiliates, they have endorsed 109 January 6 insurrectionists. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  I know you've received some funds from AIPAC. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=387.12s)]
*  How do you reconcile this? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=389.76s)]
*  And will you accept funds from them this cycle, given the fact that you talk so openly [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=391.28s)]
*  against those that try to overturn our democracy but receive money from an organization that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=395.84s)]
*  supports those very same politicians? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, their organization has members and members that support some of the same policies [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=403.67999999999995s)]
*  that I do. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  So I don't have the privilege of identifying who supports what. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=410.0s)]
*  We get our contributions and we are grateful for the support that we receive. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  But I will continue to represent all of my constituents in the 11th Congressional District [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=418.72s)]
*  to make sure that I am bringing the democratic policies, principles and values to the halls [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=423.92s)]
*  of Congress every single day. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=428.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWIU6V0tCo&t=448.72s)]
