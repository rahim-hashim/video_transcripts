# Who Is Edward Blum?
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg)
*  All right, so have you heard of Edward Bloom? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=0.0s)]
*  Maybe the name isn't ringing a bell, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=2.64s)]
*  but I'm sure you're familiar with some of his work. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=4.44s)]
*  Despite not being a lawyer, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  Bloom has been behind some of the most high-profile [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=8.44s)]
*  Supreme Court cases of the last decade, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=11.02s)]
*  including what seems like his one-man mission [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=13.02s)]
*  to end affirmative action in the United States, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=16.26s)]
*  as we know it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=18.22s)]
*  In fact, in 2016, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=19.06s)]
*  Bloom was one of the forces behind [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=20.62s)]
*  Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=22.36s)]
*  That case concerned a white student named Abigail Fisher, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=24.3s)]
*  who sued the university, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=28.200000000000003s)]
*  arguing the school shouldn't use admissions policies [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=29.540000000000003s)]
*  that favor black and Hispanic applicants [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  over white students. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=34.58s)]
*  Now that case didn't exactly pan out [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=35.84s)]
*  as Fisher and Bloom had hoped. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=37.68s)]
*  In a four-to-three decision, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=39.82s)]
*  the Supreme Court upheld the use of race [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=41.28s)]
*  in the school's admissions process. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=43.44s)]
*  After that defeat, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  Bloom is now back for rounds two and three. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=46.52s)]
*  In fact, last week, the Supreme Court announced [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=49.72s)]
*  that it would take up two affirmative action cases [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  next term, this time against Harvard [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=53.32s)]
*  and the University of North Carolina. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=55.900000000000006s)]
*  The lawsuits accused the two schools [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=58.66s)]
*  of discriminating against Asian Americans, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=60.16s)]
*  and in UNC's case, white students as well. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=62.0s)]
*  The plaintiffs claim the school put them at a disadvantage [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  and valued black and Latino students more highly. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=68.1s)]
*  Except there's, here's the thing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=71.5s)]
*  The lead plaintiff in both the Harvard and the UNC cases [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=73.44s)]
*  isn't actually a student at all. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=76.1s)]
*  It's Edward Bloom. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=78.08s)]
*  Now you might ask, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=79.52s)]
*  what does Bloom have to gain from meddling [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=80.92s)]
*  in the admissions process of schools [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=82.42s)]
*  he has nothing to do with? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=84.52s)]
*  And why is he putting the Asian community [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=86.2s)]
*  at the center of this fight? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=88.68s)]
*  Especially when you consider that Bloom's organization, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  Students for Fair Admissions, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=93.04s)]
*  has failed to present a single Asian American student [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=94.72000000000001s)]
*  at trial, and that 70% of Asian Americans [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=97.92s)]
*  are actually in favor of affirmative action. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=101.58000000000001s)]
*  In fact, during Bloom's previous attempt [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=104.7s)]
*  at knocking down the policy [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  more than 160 Asian American and Pacific Islander groups [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  filed amicus briefs in support of affirmative action. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=114.97999999999999s)]
*  And despite a clear lack of support [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=119.88s)]
*  from the community that Bloom. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Sxkzu6abg&t=122.05999999999999s)]
