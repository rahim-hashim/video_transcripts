# Trump's nephew, Fred Trump III, says he’s voting for Kamala Harris
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE)
*  The Harris campaign has decided to keep it fully positive until the end. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=0.0s)]
*  A senior campaign official tells NBC News that Harris's East Lansing rally today at [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=5.0s)]
*  Michigan State is the first since Harris became the nominee that she did not mention Trump [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  by name. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=13.88s)]
*  What a statement about the moment we are in, about the toxic form of politics that Donald [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=15.16s)]
*  Trump has normalized in this country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=19.68s)]
*  And someone who has seen Trump's vile nature firsthand is my next guest, his nephew, Fred [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Trump III. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=27.04s)]
*  He's featured in a new ad put out by a disability rights group. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=28.48s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=31.68s)]
*  This is my uncle Donald and this is my son William. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=32.68s)]
*  My dad died in 1981. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=40.28s)]
*  Donald was named my trustee. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  I needed to talk to him about William's son. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=44.72s)]
*  He said, your son doesn't recognize you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Let him die and move down to Florida. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  William loves music. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=53.2s)]
*  He loves to swim. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=54.46s)]
*  He loves to eat. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=55.64s)]
*  If Donald knew William, maybe you would have a different appreciation for those who have [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=57.04s)]
*  disabilities. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=61.92s)]
*  With me now is Fred Trump, the third nephew of former president Donald Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=64.48s)]
*  He is also author of All in the Family, the Trumps and How We Got This Way. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=68.0s)]
*  Fred, it's great to have you on the show. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=72.16s)]
*  I'm sorry it has to be under these circumstances, but that was such a powerful ad. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=74.56s)]
*  And I'm just kind of, how did it feel hearing that from your uncle about your son in 2020 [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=78.6s)]
*  when you met him? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=86.4s)]
*  Well, as I say, and thank you again for having me, my first reaction was, no, Donald, he [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=87.4s)]
*  does recognize me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=94.4s)]
*  And what I think your viewers would, I'd like them to understand is Donald never met William, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=96.68s)]
*  never asked to meet William. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=102.48s)]
*  So how we could make a comment like that? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=103.76s)]
*  How one person could say that about another human being, but about your grand nephew is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=105.76s)]
*  beyond me. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  But it's not the first time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  He said something to me in the Oval Office when I was with a group of advocates called [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=113.88s)]
*  Equally Alive. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=119.28s)]
*  And when they all left the Oval Office I was with, Donald only said, the cause of those [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=120.5s)]
*  people, they should just die. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  Talking about a group of people that are human beings that need our help and our support, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=130.28s)]
*  which is why whoever wins this election, I've in progress of starting a nonprofit called [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=135.76s)]
*  which I think will be impactful for such a large group of people, 60, 70 million strong. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=142.52s)]
*  You certainly know Donald Trump more than most of us will ever know, certainly on a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=149.52s)]
*  kind of more intimate level as a relative. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=154.0s)]
*  But when you hear what he said to you and when you hear the rhetoric that has come out [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=156.76s)]
*  of him in recent days, even today about not wanting to leave the White House or the comments [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=161.24s)]
*  he has made about shooting through journalists or even comments against Liz Cheney, what [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=166.24s)]
*  do all of those points, from the stuff that you've personally experienced and the stuff [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=171.16s)]
*  that you're publicly hearing, what do they reveal to you about your uncle? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, he always wants to win. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=181.96s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=184.44s)]
*  Look, I like to win too. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=185.44s)]
*  As I mentioned to somebody, I'm an athlete, I'm a business guy, I love to win. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=186.44s)]
*  But there's a point where giving up your character for the sake of winning and to turn [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=193.0s)]
*  to such vile comments and thoughts is just, well, it's embarrassing to me personally as [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=202.32s)]
*  a relative. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=209.48s)]
*  You have said in the past that January 6th, and you've certainly met with him many times, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=211.2s)]
*  that you said January 6th was a real turning point for you, as it was for many Americans [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  who saw that and attribute what happened that day to the rhetoric of Donald Trump. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  But what scares you the most about a potentially second Trump presidency? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=224.8s)]
*  I think what scares a lot of people, there are no, to use the word in vogue, guardrails [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=231.04s)]
*  anymore. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=238.72s)]
*  Just think of the people that he is now surrounding himself with. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=240.2s)]
*  There's no General Kelly. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  There's no General Mattis. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=244.72s)]
*  There's Stephen Miller, Tom Hornman, and Rudy Giuliani coming back. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=247.64s)]
*  Should scare anybody. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  This is the kind of debate I think a lot of Americans have, which is some are trying to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=258.36s)]
*  say he's not as bad as he is portrayed in the media, the people that talk about his [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=262.56s)]
*  fascistic tendencies, the people who served under him who say he is a fascist to his core. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=268.32s)]
*  They're either vengeful, they hate him, they don't know him, they don't like him. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=273.28s)]
*  They're part of the swamp. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=277.24s)]
*  You're saying to those people, no, these are all true descriptions of your uncle. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=278.76s)]
*  I think they're true descriptions. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=285.6s)]
*  I'm sorry to have to say that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=287.12s)]
*  And as I was quoted in an article, is it really worth the risk to think that he's just saying [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=290.24s)]
*  this to ramp up his base and that he's not going to go forward with it? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=297.16s)]
*  I don't think it is. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  And you were mentioning in the lead up about Kamala Harris. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=302.72s)]
*  I watched that Saturday live thing last night a couple of times with her and Maya Rudolph. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=305.6s)]
*  And I actually smiled for the first time, maybe through this entire election cycle. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  It was just a happy thing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=316.48s)]
*  It made me laugh. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=318.72s)]
*  I don't think anyone can laugh with Donald around. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  So what is at stake, I guess, in this final 48 hours? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  What is the message that you would say to American people, to someone who might be out [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  there undecided watching this right now, trying to weigh whether or not Donald Trump is someone [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=331.68s)]
*  they should entrust with their vote? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  I'll have to give a shout out to my mom, who was born and raised in Kalamazoo, Michigan. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=340.96s)]
*  So I know Michael Moore was on before. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=345.04s)]
*  She left me a message. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=347.16s)]
*  And other than Donald's sister, Elizabeth, my mom has known Donald longer than anybody. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=348.48s)]
*  She was there when Donald demeaned my father, when he hatched a plan to take my sister and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=353.6s)]
*  me out of my grandfather's will, when he said what he did about William. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  She left me a message saying, I was talking to an old friend of mine from Wisconsin. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=364.24s)]
*  Now, great Midwestern values. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  Please do whatever you can, Fred, to ensure, to let the people know the real Donald and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=371.0s)]
*  the danger that really does exist. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=376.88s)]
*  And what is that real Donald, if you had to describe it in one word? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=379.68s)]
*  To me, I'm tired of it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=384.88s)]
*  I think the country is tired of it now. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=387.2s)]
*  I will disagree with Michael. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be a landslide popular vote difference. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=391.84s)]
*  He's not going anywhere for a while. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=395.68s)]
*  You think even if he loses Donald Trump and Trumpism will still be a presence in our country? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=402.48s)]
*  Fred Trump III, thank you so much. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=405.24s)]
*  I really appreciate having you on the show and sharing your insights with us. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=406.76s)]
*  It's a historic moment. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=410.48s)]
*  I think a lot of people need to just have some kind of insight in these final couple [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=411.48s)]
*  of days before they have to make this life-altering decision. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=418.04s)]
*  I'm sorry I have to say that about a relative, but the country is more important. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  Sure is. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=423.88s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=424.88s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=425.88s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=426.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXcw2IDxdrE&t=441.48s)]
