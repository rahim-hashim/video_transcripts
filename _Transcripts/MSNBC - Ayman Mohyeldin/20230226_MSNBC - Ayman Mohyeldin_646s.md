# Safety concerns raised over Kevin McCarthy giving Tucker Carlson exclusive Jan 6. footage
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU)
*  All right, new tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=0.0s)]
*  Media outlets and news organizations, including this one, NBC News, are now demanding that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=4.34s)]
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy give them the same access to the 44,000 hours of January [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=9.58s)]
*  6 footage that he gave to host, Fox host, Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=14.88s)]
*  Laura Handman, the lawyer representing these outlets, said in a letter to McCarthy, quote, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=19.86s)]
*  There is no basis for further delaying granting this access to these news organizations or [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=24.0s)]
*  any other media outlets that make similar requests. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=30.04s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy gave exclusive access of this footage to Tucker Carlson, who spent the last [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=33.76s)]
*  two years downplaying the events of January 6 calling the insurrection a quote nonviolent [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=38.28s)]
*  election justice protest, even produced a documentary suggesting the day's events were [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=44.68s)]
*  a false flag operation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=50.04s)]
*  But this goes beyond just conspiracies. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=52.52s)]
*  There's real concern that Capitol security could be compromised if certain secure locations, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  including evacuation routes, are improperly released to the public. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=60.96s)]
*  Here's what Congressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the January 6 committee, told my colleague [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=65.04s)]
*  Stephanie Ruhl. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=69.22s)]
*  We have security concerns about turning over the location of security cameras in the U.S. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=72.56s)]
*  Capitol that the police use. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=78.4s)]
*  We have concern about the escape and evacuation routes that were used on that day. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=80.24s)]
*  We don't want to just, you know, throw our hands up and say, well, let's just let everything [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=85.0s)]
*  go and let the insurrectionists have the materials that will allow them to plan the next January [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=89.78s)]
*  6. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  Here's one hypothesis why Kevin McCarthy gave the footage to Carlson and only Carlson. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=97.32s)]
*  This was in effect an olive branch to one of his most high profile skeptics. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=104.24s)]
*  McCarthy's trying to appease the far right wing of his party, this time by effectively [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  outsourcing a bid to reinvestigate the riot to his favorite cable news commentator. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=113.84s)]
*  Because Kevin McCarthy, despite being speaker, is not the real power broker for a group of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=120.16s)]
*  House Republicans. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  Remember, this is the same McCarthy who suffered through 15 humiliating rounds of voting before [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  being elected speaker, and he only succeeded once he made concessions to the far right [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=134.4s)]
*  of his party. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=140.16s)]
*  McCarthy became beholden to the likes of Marjorie Taylor Greene and Jim Jordan and was forced [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  to reward them with key committee assignments and more in exchange for their votes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=147.0s)]
*  It is easy to see how this deal with Carlson is a similar effort to win over a former critic. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=151.76s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy has been speaker for a little over a month and he's already given away so [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=158.88s)]
*  much power. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=162.8s)]
*  You have to wonder if he still has or if he ever had any real power of his own. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=163.96s)]
*  This is the point where we'd normally laugh at Kevin McCarthy and kind of joke, but it's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  hard to laugh when McCarthy has deliberately and recklessly put people's lives in danger. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=175.96s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Jimmy Gomez of California. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=182.28s)]
*  He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=185.4s)]
*  Congressman, it's great to have you back on the show. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=189.72000000000003s)]
*  Why do you think Kevin McCarthy is giving this footage only to Tucker Carlson and the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=191.16s)]
*  folks at Fox? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=196.6s)]
*  I want everyone to be very clear what Kevin McCarthy and the extreme, MAGA Republicans [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=199.48s)]
*  are trying to do. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=206.2s)]
*  They're trying to rewrite the history of the last two years and of the Trump era so that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=207.2s)]
*  they can have a different political narrative going into 2024 and win a larger majority. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=213.4s)]
*  They do that on the House Oversight Committee, which I'm on, by having these cockamamie types [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=219.64s)]
*  of investigations that everybody knows are based on conspiracy theories. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Now he's handing over these tapes to Tucker Carlson so that Tucker can cherry pick the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  footage that he deems necessary to use the Fox megaphone to basically say that January [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=237.56s)]
*  6th was no big deal. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=245.72s)]
*  It's much ado about nothing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=247.0s)]
*  It was only because the Democrats and the liberal media are trying to manipulate you [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=248.76s)]
*  believing that the Republicans were involved in an insurrection that almost toppled our [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=253.72s)]
*  democracy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=259.48s)]
*  So this, what they're trying to do is pass the buck in order to gain more viewers and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=260.48s)]
*  voters going into 2024. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=265.08s)]
*  You have both leaders, Hakeem Jeffries in the House, Chuck Schumer in the Senate, condemning [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  the move. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=273.88s)]
*  Schumer says that the release of the footage would quote, compromise the safety of the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=275.44s)]
*  legislative branch. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=278.68s)]
*  Do you agree with that assessment? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=280.44s)]
*  How do you see the safety being compromised? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=282.08s)]
*  As somebody who was in the Capitol on January 6th, who was one of the last 20 to 25 members [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=286.28s)]
*  who got evacuated by the Capitol police, when we had insurrectionist beating on the gallery [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=292.8s)]
*  We know that every nook and cranny of that Capitol was actually a security advantage [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=300.48s)]
*  that we had because they didn't know where they were going. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's what allowed us to escape and make sure that nobody lost their lives out of members [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=311.24s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=315.8s)]
*  It didn't stop the fact that police officers lost their life. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=316.8s)]
*  But imagine if they actually knew where they were going, what they were doing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=321.24s)]
*  Things could have been a lot, lot worse. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=326.18s)]
*  So yes, I'm concerned that this footage has information that will allow insurrectionists [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=328.32s)]
*  and another January 6th to occur. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=334.32s)]
*  And also, does that mean that foreign or foreign adversaries, people that want to cause us [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=337.2s)]
*  harm, could they use that footage? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=341.76s)]
*  We don't know yet because we don't know exactly what the contents of that footage entails. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=344.64s)]
*  And that's why I'm supporting Hakeem Jeffries in getting more information to ensure that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=350.44s)]
*  the safety and security of the people in the Capitol are maintained. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=355.28s)]
*  How desperate is Kevin McCarthy in all this? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=358.52s)]
*  I mean, what does it say that he is beholden to figures like Tucker Carlson and Marjorie [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=360.88s)]
*  Taylor Greene? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  It shows that he's a figurehead in name only. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=369.32s)]
*  He might be the head, but Marjorie Taylor Greene is the neck that turns the head. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=373.28s)]
*  It is that extreme wing of the party that is putting the American people in danger. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=377.85999999999996s)]
*  Remember some of the things that she said this past week even go to the core of what [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  it means to be the United States of America. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=389.6s)]
*  So we're in a terrible place. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  We need to make sure that we push back and we don't allow them to change the narrative [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  of the last couple of years. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=399.44s)]
*  Speaking of Greene, I'm sure you saw the news this week. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=401.64000000000004s)]
*  She is defending her push for a national divorce between blue and red states, saying the country [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=404.48s)]
*  is moving towards another civil war. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=409.72s)]
*  I remember you pushed for Greene to be stripped of her committee assignments in the last Congress. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=412.48s)]
*  I just want your reaction to having a sitting member of Congress openly calling for the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=417.12s)]
*  dissolution and dissolving of the United States of America. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=422.84s)]
*  I find it personally offensive. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=428.92s)]
*  Somebody who I believe in this country wholeheartedly, I believe in our institutions and I believe [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  that our differences are settled at the ballot box and in the legislative and political process, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=437.21999999999997s)]
*  not through the dissolution of our great country. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=445.62s)]
*  And let's remember that she is not only the neck that turns the head, but she is also [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=449.58s)]
*  oftentimes at the forefront of what is being spoken and talked about in the dark recesses [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=457.06s)]
*  of the extreme mega Republican sphere. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=464.7s)]
*  And so is she now somebody who spread the big lie in 2020? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=469.82s)]
*  Is this something else that she's pushing? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=475.06s)]
*  And I want to be very clear why this is dangerous, because the same people that believe the big [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=477.5s)]
*  lie will probably be the same people that start repeating this dangerous, dangerous [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=482.58s)]
*  rhetoric that there should be a national divorce or a section of states from the union. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=489.3s)]
*  And that would be a terrible, terrible mistake. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=495.5s)]
*  Let me switch gears for a moment. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=499.02000000000004s)]
*  You recently launched the Congressional Dads Caucus to focus on policies for working families. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=500.38000000000005s)]
*  In fact, you even brought your five month old son to the House floor during that whole [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=505.34000000000003s)]
*  speaker vote fiasco. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=510.14000000000004s)]
*  I hope he did well there because that thing dragged on a lot longer than a lot of people [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=511.42s)]
*  had anticipated. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=515.94s)]
*  Tell us about that caucus and what you hope to achieve for working families in this country. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=518.46s)]
*  Yeah, the dads caucus, we just, I just realized we wanted to take advantage of all the attention [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=523.6600000000001s)]
*  that we got because the fact that I brought my son to the House floor. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=529.82s)]
*  I got praise for something that women would often get criticized for, just taking care [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=535.26s)]
*  of their own child. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=540.22s)]
*  But we can hopefully call attention to that double standard and then hopefully gain more [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=542.54s)]
*  support for policies that support working families, everything from affordable child [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=549.78s)]
*  care to the child tax credit to paid family leave. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=553.74s)]
*  As somebody who had parents that worked four to five jobs a week to make ends meet when [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=556.5999999999999s)]
*  I got sick with pneumonia and almost bankrupted my family because my parents had mis-shifts [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=561.3399999999999s)]

*  And if we want to talk about family values, we want to talk about supporting families [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdRQ58BLCU&t=572.3s)]
