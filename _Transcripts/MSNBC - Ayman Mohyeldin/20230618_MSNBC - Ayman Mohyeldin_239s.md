# The case to televise Donald Trump’s trial
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms)
*  All right, so Donald Trump surrendered to authorities this week at a federal courthouse [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=0.0s)]
*  in Miami. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=7.0s)]
*  This is one of the only glimpses that we got of the ex-president at the courthouse that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=8.6s)]
*  day, a shadowy figure waving behind a car's tinted glass. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=13.24s)]
*  That sad image is now how generations will remember the historic second indictment of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=18.48s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  And that's because just hours before Trump's court appearance, magistrate Judge Jonathan [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Goodman, who oversaw the proceeding, denied a request from a group of local and national [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=29.16s)]
*  media outlets, including NBC News, to allow cameras in the courtroom. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=33.28s)]
*  Now, in that same order, the judge rejected the news organization's request for the release [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=37.04s)]
*  of the court's audio feed of the hearing. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  And since 1946, media coverage of criminal proceedings in federal courts have been largely [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=44.88s)]
*  prohibited under the federal rule of criminal procedure. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=50.0s)]
*  But if there was ever a time to reevaluate that prohibition, it is now, because a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=53.84s)]
*  former president and a current presidential candidate is facing 37 federal charges. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=59.08s)]
*  Don't the American people deserve to see the trial arguing the merits of those charges [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=66.16s)]
*  play out? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=70.92s)]
*  Renowned Harvard law professor Lawrence Tribe made that case on this show last week. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=72.48s)]
*  The only way the country can be satisfied that justice has been done, that the truth [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=76.72s)]
*  exposed, regardless of the verdict, whether it's guilty or not guilty, is to have the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=84.32s)]
*  public watch the trial. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  The Chief Justice of the United States has an obligation to make an exception through [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=92.36s)]
*  the judicial conference to the usual blackouts that accompany trials. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=97.72s)]
*  In a new piece, which you can read right now on MSNBC.com, I laid out why I believe it [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=103.35999999999999s)]
*  is imperative the American people witness firsthand the United States of America versus [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=108.24s)]
*  Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=113.16s)]
*  If Judge Aileen Cannon, the Trump appointee set to oversee the rest of trial, continues [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=114.56s)]
*  to follow standard procedure, the only accounts the public will hear, see and read will be [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=119.64s)]
*  secondhand accounts from reporters, witnesses and participants. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=124.6s)]
*  That includes a defendant who has repeatedly demonstrated an inability to tell the truth. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=128.66s)]
*  Since the moment Donald Trump descended down that escalator in 2015, he has put on a master [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=134.8s)]
*  manipulating the media, lying to the American public and obfuscating the facts and circumstances [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=140.36s)]
*  around his behavior and actions. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=145.68s)]
*  Now as a member of the news media myself, I have confidence that those allowed inside [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=148.68s)]
*  the courtroom will try their very best to accurately document the proceedings. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=152.84s)]
*  But the truth is simple. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=157.4s)]
*  That is not enough given the severity and gravity of this moment. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  The trial of Donald Trump is not only an unprecedented event in U.S. history, it's also a monumental [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=162.56s)]
*  test for our legal system. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=168.48s)]
*  Right now there is a very real possibility Donald Trump could be the Republican Party's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  nominee in 2024. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=174.2s)]
*  And there's also a very real possibility that this trial could still be underway on election [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=175.6s)]
*  day. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=182.16s)]
*  The American people deserve to see with their own eyes that Trump in accordance with the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=183.16s)]
*  law is given a fair and just trial. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=187.44s)]
*  They also deserve to know that judge overseeing the trial is playing by the rules and not [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  engaging in potentially nefarious political favoritism. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=196.44s)]
*  And the only way to ensure both and to protect our democracy in this process is to be as [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  transparent as possible. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=206.0s)]
*  Let the American people watch and draw their own conclusions into how this case unfolds. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=208.84s)]
*  . [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCanVh3Jms&t=226.4s)]
