# Candidates Face Debates With 3 Weeks To The Midterms
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE)
*  Coming up on this hour of Amen, substance versus psychopathy in a week of consequential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=0.0s)]
*  swing state debates, Democrats brought solutions, Republicans on the other hand, fake police [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=10.16s)]
*  badges. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=16.44s)]
*  Plus, Trump's legal problems go well beyond January the 6th, new details on DOJ's latest [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=17.44s)]
*  moves and what's happening with the New York attorney general's investigation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=23.0s)]
*  And cultural correction, an American museum returns African bronzes stolen during the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=27.6s)]
*  19th century. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=32.28s)]
*  My conversation with one of the women who led the efforts to get those statues home. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=33.56s)]
*  I'm Ayman Mohideen. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=38.64s)]
*  Let's get started. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=39.64s)]
*  All hands on deck. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=50.2s)]
*  That is the call Democrats are sending out just three weeks until the midterms. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=51.64s)]
*  And new today, President Obama is answering that call, announcing plans to campaign for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=56.76s)]
*  Democrats in three key battleground states at the end of the month. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=61.32s)]
*  Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=65.72s)]
*  All three have critical races up and down the ballot and all three, coincidentally, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=68.08s)]
*  had some of the most consequential debates of the election cycle this week, including [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=72.68s)]
*  last night's Senate debate in Georgia between Herschel Walker and incumbent Raphael Warnock. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=77.16s)]
*  Yes, it was weird, to say the least, and it also reinforced a theme we have noticed throughout [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=83.64s)]
*  the 2022 cycle. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  Democrats are bringing ideas, and Republicans, they're bringing nonsense, either a total [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  lack of policies or strikingly incoherent and just flat out stupid policies, like when [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=96.92s)]
*  the scandal-prone Herschel Walker made this argument to Georgians who are worried about [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=103.32s)]
*  the costs of insulin. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=108.56s)]
*  I believe in reducing insulin, but at the same time you got to eat right, because he [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=112.16s)]
*  may not know and I know many people that's on insulin. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=117.0s)]
*  And unless you have an eating right, insulin is doing you no good. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=120.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=124.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=125.16s)]
*  Let's see, does Herschel Walker know that there is a type of diabetes that is not linked [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=126.16s)]
*  to eating habits? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=134.64s)]
*  Anyway, look, the bar was so low for him last night that just showing up and speaking, however [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=136.11999999999998s)]
*  incoherently, was actually seen as a win by Republicans. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=143.0s)]
*  Yeah, they actually thought he did amazing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  That's no surprise at this point. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=149.48s)]
*  As we said last week, most Republicans are ready to support Herschel Walker no matter [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=150.6s)]
*  how much he messes up. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  But the most memorable moment of the night for Walker wasn't a conversation about policy, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  no. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=162.27999999999997s)]
*  It wasn't even about touching a story about his public service. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=163.92s)]
*  It was a stunt. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=167.52s)]
*  It was this move, pulling out a novelty police badge, a response to Senator Warnock rightly [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=168.94s)]
*  pointing out that Herschel Walker misrepresented himself as a law enforcement officer on multiple [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=176.12s)]
*  times over multiple years. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=181.0s)]
*  And instead of addressing those claims with any substance, he chose to look like a 16-year-old [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=183.16s)]
*  using a fake ID to try and buy wine coolers. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=190.32s)]
*  In debates across the country this week from Georgia to Ohio and Michigan to Wisconsin, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=194.56s)]
*  Democrats came prepared to talk policy and they talked about what they'd done for the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  American people under this administration and what they hope to do in the future, things [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=202.88s)]
*  like protect abortion access, strengthen gun restrictions, lower health care costs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=207.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republicans engaged in bad performance art. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=212.76s)]
*  J.D. Vance raised money for the Legal Defense Fund of the insurrectionists. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=218.44s)]
*  This is the kind of extremism, J.D., that we wholly reject. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=225.48s)]
*  Can you imagine one guy saying out of one side of his mouth he's pro-cop and out of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=228.44s)]
*  the other side of his mouth he's raising money for the insurrectionists who are beating up [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  the Capitol Police? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=237.52s)]
*  The one guy he tried to raise money for got four years in prison. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=238.92s)]
*  The same month as the Oxford school shooting where four children were murdered, eight were [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  injured and the community was terrorized. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  Tudor Dixon posted on her social media a picture of her shooting a gun with the caption that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  said gun control means using both hands. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=256.92s)]
*  She is too dangerous and too out of touch to be trusted with protecting our kids. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=261.4s)]
*  She'll put the second amendment before second graders every time. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=266.0s)]
*  We cannot let that happen. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=270.12s)]
*  What do you find admirable about your opponent? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, no, no, seriously, I do think, you know, the senator is proven to be a family man and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  I think that's admirable. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=279.44s)]
*  Likewise, I appreciate the fact that Lieutenant Governor Barnes had loving parents, a school [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=280.44s)]
*  teacher, father worked third shift, so he had a good upbringing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=285.76s)]
*  I guess what puzzles me about that is with that upbringing, why is he turned against [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=290.4s)]
*  America? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=294.56s)]
*  I mean, why does he find the founding of America awful? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=295.56s)]
*  Somehow, we did not... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  I said something admirable. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=301.84s)]
*  What a disgraceful stunt from Republican Ron Johnson. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=304.28s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=308.76s)]
*  You got to give him credit because at least he showed up. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=309.76s)]
*  Marco Rubio has refused to debate Val Demings in the Florida Senate race. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  Alex, excuse me, and Adam Lexalt is too afraid to debate Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=316.96s)]
*  Masto, fundamental part of the small D democratic process that we have in this country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  He's actually hearing political candidates debate these issues before voters cast their [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  ballots. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  Republicans running scared from that are doing a disservice to their constituents. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=333.8s)]
*  But the Republicans who showed up to the debate, honestly, they're not much better. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=337.76s)]
*  Voters didn't hear them discuss the issues. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  They just watched a bunch of smoke and mirrors and cheap GOP tricks in a pathetic attempt [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=344.32s)]
*  to distract from their lack of substance and soul. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guFwYQE6jE&t=349.16s)]
