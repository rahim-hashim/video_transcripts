# Debunking the “Outside Agitator” Trope amid pro-Palestinian campus protests
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc)
*  As pro-Palestinian and anti-war protests spread to college campuses across the country, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=0.0s)]
*  there was one phrase that kept popping up. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Outside agitators. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=9.84s)]
*  Outside agitators. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Those outside agitators. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=12.64s)]
*  Them as outside agitators. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=14.48s)]
*  Outside agitators. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=16.48s)]
*  Outside agitators. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=17.84s)]
*  Outside agitators. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=19.44s)]
*  Paid outside agitators. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=21.04s)]
*  Outside agitators. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=22.8s)]
*  In recent days, university administrators, law enforcement officials, politicians, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=25.04s)]
*  have all trotted out that familiar trope, the so-called outside agitator, accusing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=29.52s)]
*  professional organizers or nefarious foreign actors of hijacking student-led protests and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=35.12s)]
*  encouraging its participants to adopt more aggressive and violent tactics. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=41.36s)]
*  Just yesterday, a bipartisan duo consisting of Congressman, Republican Mike Lawler and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Democrat Josh Gottheimer called on the FBI to investigate those supposed shadowy figures. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=51.2s)]
*  A similar sentiment was shared online by the NYPD Chief of Patrol, who accused a, quote, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=57.84s)]
*  unknown entity of radicalizing our vulnerable students and taking advantage of their young minds. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  He urged his federal partners to, quote, follow the money. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=70.4s)]
*  Now, we should be clear here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  Some of the hundreds of people arrested at campuses across the country over the last few [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=76.08000000000001s)]
*  weeks have not been students, including at Columbia University, where city officials say [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=79.92s)]
*  29% of those arrested last week had no connection to the school. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=84.8s)]
*  But as the New York Times reports, there's little evidence that those so-called outsiders [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=89.36s)]
*  had any role in organizing or escalating the protests. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=94.72s)]
*  In fact, many were arrested without ever having set foot on campus. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  And according to a review of police documents, only a small handful of the nearly three dozen [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=102.08s)]
*  arrestees, lactized to the university, had also participated in other protests around the country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=106.96s)]
*  Quite a blow to this professional protester narrative that is being pushed around by law [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=114.08s)]
*  enforcement. The Times examination also revealed that far more of the unaffiliated protesters had [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=118.88s)]
*  no such histories. Instead, those demonstrators said they arrived at Columbia in response [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=125.36s)]
*  to social media posts or word of mouth invites. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=130.64s)]
*  And that includes Matthew Cavaletto, a 52-year-old computer programmer who's lived within a half a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=134.16s)]
*  mile of Columbia University for most of his life. Cavaletto was arrested on the street outside the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=139.76s)]
*  school after he stood in the middle of the intersection and refused to budge. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=145.28s)]
*  The native New Yorker dismissed the notion that nefarious outside actors were pulling the strings, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=150.32s)]
*  describing his fellow non-student protesters to the Times as, quote, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=155.76s)]
*  members of the community, folks from the city, folks from our neighborhood, not some kind of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=160.32s)]
*  foreign element that had snuck into SAP our city's vitality. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=165.84s)]
*  One Barnard College student explained to NBC News why she thought officials were pushing this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=170.88s)]
*  outsider's trope. Quote, I really struggle a lot with the whole narrative of outside agitators [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=175.04s)]
*  because I see it as a means through which to justify violence and to claim that because [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=181.04s)]
*  individuals are not students, they are deserving of police brutality. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  Blaming unnamed outside actors also accomplishes another goal. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  Distraction. Distracting from the protesters' primary aim, which is to bring attention [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=195.6s)]
*  to the war in Gaza. We should call out this boogeyman narrative for what it really is, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=200.56s)]
*  an effort to discredit, delegitimize, and marginalize an entire movement. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  And honestly, it isn't anything new in this country. This same outside agitator trope was [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=210.0s)]
*  frequently evoked during the civil rights movement used to imply that protesters were driven by the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=215.12s)]
*  sinister agendas of unknown shadowy figures as opposed to being motivated by their own personal [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=220.96s)]
*  beliefs and concerns. Even civil rights giant Martin Luther King Jr. was labeled as an outside [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=226.88s)]
*  agitator since he was often called in to assist with demonstrations across the South. Not only [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=232.96s)]
*  did King reject that label, he also rejected the very idea of outside agitators. As he famously [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=238.8s)]
*  wrote in a letter from a Birmingham jail, quote, we are caught in an escapable network of mutuality [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=246.56s)]
*  tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=252.72s)]
*  Never again can we afford to live with the narrow provincial outside agitator idea. Anyone who lives [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=259.76s)]
*  inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=266.72s)]
*  you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjGPHdvjmc&t=276.56s)]
