# Trump says Nikki Haley is 'not under ionsideration' to be his running mate
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k)
*  It's there and whoever is his VP has to know if you go in any time if you break the loyalty oath [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=0.0s)]
*  of Donald Trump liking the mafia they're going to come for you. The politically savvy people if [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=6.8s)]
*  there are any within his camp would probably say go with somebody like Nikki Haley. She still has [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=11.84s)]
*  she is still getting a little bit of support within the Republican Party. She can fundraise [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=17.36s)]
*  and it would perhaps give a little bit of assurance for those Republicans that are not 100% [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=22.959999999999997s)]
*  Magolites. Do you see that happening because there was a there was a reporting there it is on the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=30.24s)]
*  screen from Axios that she she was being considered. Donald Trump fired out a tweet saying or whatever [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=34.4s)]
*  it is to social saying that ain't happening. Yeah and Donald Trump jr said I will like do [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=39.36s)]
*  anything to prevent that. I mean look Nikki Haley's still getting 20 30 percent of the vote in states [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=44.16s)]
*  where she hasn't been on the ballot in months and months which I think is also an important [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=50.08s)]
*  data point. Like there are never Trump people who are going out and voting for someone who is not [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=56.64s)]
*  even in the race and I don't I don't know that those people come home to Trump. I'm not convinced [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=62.16s)]
*  and so I would say I think it's very unlikely she hasn't endorsed him. Yeah and my take is everyone [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=68.16s)]
*  kept saying she's going to endorse she's going to endorse she's an endorse and and I really think [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=74.24s)]
*  she like Liz Cheney are both trying to keep their powder dry for what happens if he loses. What do [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=78.4s)]
*  you think what's that what's the play here for not just Nikki Haley but for Donald Trump to go with [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=84.4s)]
*  as a vice presidential pick? Cue the breaking news banner. People pick a white man okay America. You [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  will pick a white man because that's what he's about. This is the man who bragged first of all [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=96.0s)]
*  about just recently the white people are being discriminated against in America. This is a guy [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=101.04s)]
*  who believes that he is the defender of whiteness. There's no doubt about it. You just had a great [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=105.28s)]
*  segment on MAG of the core is a white nationalist movement. Second he again is bragging that he [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=109.36s)]
*  terminated Roe v Wade. He said I was honored to terminate Roe v Wade meaning he is happy that he [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  took a fundamental right from women. He does not view people of color nor does he view women as [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=119.68s)]
*  equals. He views them as inferior. He will pick a white man because that's what his base wants and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=125.2s)]
*  that's what he wants more importantly. So we can play this tape back when he makes his choice. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=129.84s)]
*  It's gonna be a white guy. All right we will we will hold on to the tape. Not convinced it's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=134.16s)]
*  gonna be a white guy. I think it could still be Sarah Sanders. Oh interesting okay. I mean I think [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=138.0s)]
*  it's more likely to be a white guy but I think Sarah Sanders is still in it. Close enough all [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=142.88s)]
*  right. All right well hold hold those thoughts. We've got a lot more to discuss. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=147.44s)]
*  you [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLNnWU3qQ9k&t=164.16s)]
