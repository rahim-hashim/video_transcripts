# The Right’s Ongoing Refusal To Concede Elections
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc)
*  In 2016, Donald Trump said he could only lose the presidential election if it was rigged. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=0.0s)]
*  Two election cycles later, more and more Republicans at every office level are echoing his rhetoric. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=10.96s)]
*  There are so many examples of this that there isn't time to cover everyone, literally. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=16.94s)]
*  So let's just put the spotlight on two specific cases. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Georgia gubernatorial candidate Candace Taylor. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=25.4s)]
*  She just won 3.4% of the vote in the May primary, but she claims the entire race was rigged. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=28.32s)]
*  In the process, she's attracted the attention of MyPillow CEO and conspiracy theorist Mike [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=36.8s)]
*  Lindell, who's promising a, quote, big investigation on her behalf. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=42.36s)]
*  Can't wait to see it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=47.12s)]
*  Then there's the Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona Secretary of State, self-identified [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  oath keeper Mark Fincham. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  He's still advocating for decertifying the 2020 election results in the year 2022. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=54.8s)]
*  This week, he got the GOP primary for Arizona's secretary of state. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=62.68s)]
*  It's a pivotal position, obviously, for the next presidential election. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=66.8s)]
*  So to discuss that, let's bring back our Sunday night panel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=72.44s)]
*  Right, Molly, it's a pretty simple question. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=75.96s)]
*  What happens if people like Mark Fincham are given the levers of the election infrastructure? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=79.08s)]
*  Where do we go from there? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=86.2s)]
*  Do we enter a guaranteed constitutional crisis? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=87.2s)]
*  At best, we enter a guaranteed constitutional crisis. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=92.08s)]
*  At worst, we stop having free and fair elections. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah, this is really scary. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=98.6s)]
*  The one thing I would say that is totally fascinating to me is that almost all of the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=101.2s)]
*  states where you have these people running are purple states, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=106.2s)]
*  Like Arizona, these Trumpy candidates won, but they barely eked it out, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=110.92s)]
*  And so you are seeing these guys are going to come up, you know, this is not Mississippi. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=117.12s)]
*  These are purple states. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  And so you have these sort of terrible Trumpy candidates that can barely can win a primary. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  And again, with all of this Trumpism, it's Trumpism wins you a primary but gets creamed [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=128.32s)]
*  in the general, as we saw with Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=132.92s)]
*  So I do think this is a setup that's particularly bad for Republicans. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=135.32000000000002s)]
*  Of course, having one party turn up, turn against democracy is bad for all of us ultimately. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=139.4s)]
*  But I think in this shortstop gap, I think it'll hurt Republicans. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Eventually, though, I mean, who knows where this goes? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  Nowhere good. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, to pick up on that point, Maria, isn't the reason that this is happening in purple [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  states largely, if not primarily, because Donald Trump has focused a lot of attention [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=158.88s)]
*  on these states. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  He's filled the voters and elected officials of these states with the idea, the conspiracy, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  that their systems were rigged against him. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=171.72s)]
*  And therefore he produces the type of political climate that allows these types of candidates [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  to prosper. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=178.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=179.76s)]
*  So there's a saying in Mexican Spanish, which is, le sale el tiro por la culata, which means [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=180.76s)]
*  it backfires. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  It's a little weird. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  Le sale el tiro por la culata. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  I really feel like in terms of the Republicans, Molly's right. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=192.88s)]
*  It's like, what's your end game? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=195.8s)]
*  What's your end game? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=197.94s)]
*  Which is really writ large. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=198.94s)]
*  And I'm really glad we're talking about this, because these are threats to democracy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  This is exactly what it looks like. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=205.12s)]
*  This is exactly what it looks like to take, look, it's not perfect, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=207.16s)]
*  There is no perfect democracy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  But to basically throw these completely ridiculous claims and get that kind of going, it's not [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=214.76s)]
*  normal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=223.72s)]
*  Now, then again, what is normal? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=224.72s)]
*  I mean, I think that's very problematic, obviously, in terms of how the Republicans are playing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=226.72s)]
*  this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=231.6s)]
*  But the end game, it's very dangerous. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=232.6s)]
*  And so we need to be, and again, the Democratic Party needs to be sounding the alarm, that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=233.6s)]
*  this is very, that this is a huge alarm. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=238.32s)]
*  This is a red alarm. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=241.04s)]
*  A four alarm fire? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=242.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=243.04s)]
*  Five alarm. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  Five alarm. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  Five alarm. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  We go higher and higher in our alarms here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  I can't believe I got two beaches. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  One in English and one in Spanish. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  I got them right, hey. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I guess to your point, you know, the thing that was very interesting to me this [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  past week was, in Arizona, you have Carrie Lake, who has been, who has won the Republican [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=256.88s)]
*  nominee for governor. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=263.08s)]
*  What happened in the election on Tuesday was she ended the night trailing her opponent, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=265.28s)]
*  but then, of course, more ballots came in, legitimate ballots, and they catapulted her [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=270.44s)]
*  into the lead. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=275.36s)]
*  Now, this is almost precisely what happened in 2020 in Arizona. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=276.36s)]
*  Only Biden was the beneficiary. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=280.92s)]
*  And of course, back then, Carrie Lake, to this day, says something fraudulent was happening [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=282.2s)]
*  when it's to her benefit. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=287.96s)]
*  We don't hear as much. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=289.2s)]
*  And the question for you, Josh, is, you know, is this, is this not an indictment of how [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=290.72s)]
*  these people think about their own voters, that they assume they don't see the inconsistencies [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=297.92s)]
*  here, that they assume that they don't find the contradictions and that they'll just be [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=302.64s)]
*  with them no matter what they say? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=306.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=308.04s)]
*  I mean, it's definitely disrespectful, or they just assume the voters care about the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=309.04s)]
*  idea of democracy as little as they do, right? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=314.8s)]
*  Because, like, a Republican candidate's participation in an election is like a four-year-old's participation [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  in a game of Scrabble. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=322.04s)]
*  Like, they just throw down whatever tiles they have, and they go, hey, we won. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=323.04s)]
*  They don't care about numbers or rules. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=326.44s)]
*  And so, like, a candidate in Michigan who finished fourth place called the results predetermined. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=329.2s)]
*  And of course it feels predetermined. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=333.52s)]
*  You're in fourth place. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=335.12s)]
*  You were going to lose. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=336.12s)]
*  The writing was on the wall, right? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=337.6s)]
*  Like, if Shake Shack put out a burger that was horse puke on an asbestos bun, it would [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=338.92s)]
*  be predetermined that I would stick to fries. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=344.4s)]
*  So, like, Republicans, I think it's a contempt for their own voters, but it is just like [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=347.0s)]
*  an also a contempt for the idea of a democratic process, which they are hoping to bring their [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=351.0s)]
*  voters along for that ride. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=355.38s)]
*  Sorry, a horse puke burger? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=357.21999999999997s)]
*  Is that what that was? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=359.34s)]
*  A horse puke burger on an asbestos bun. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=361.34s)]
*  Sounds delicious. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=363.82s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQ_7KdOjc&t=364.82s)]
