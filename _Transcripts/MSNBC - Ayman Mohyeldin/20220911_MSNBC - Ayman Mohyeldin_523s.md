# Federal Judge Rules Anti-HIV Medicine Is Unconstitutional
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0)
*  This week, a federal judge in Texas declared it unconstitutional for the Affordable Care [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=0.0s)]
*  Act to require coverage for certain HIV prevention drugs. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=8.48s)]
*  U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that the ACA mandate for free coverage of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=12.52s)]
*  HIV drugs like Truvada and Discovy, commonly known as PrEP, violated the religious beliefs [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=18.64s)]
*  of a Christian-owned company. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  These drugs are taken by hundreds of thousands of Americans, but they're most often taken [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=28.34s)]
*  by men who have sex with other men. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=33.32s)]
*  And that is the crux of the issue for conservative activist Jonathan Mitchell and the Christian [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=36.1s)]
*  employer on behalf of which he filed this lawsuit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=41.68s)]
*  For years, Mitchell and other Republicans have targeted quote-unquote liberal social [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=45.54s)]
*  policies with legal action, including abortion rights and LGBTQ rights. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=50.54s)]
*  This Texas ruling comes just as elected LGBTQ officials and Democratic operatives joined [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=56.62s)]
*  forces to fight conservative bigotry and discrimination, creating a political group, Agenda PAC, which [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=62.76s)]
*  has taken on anti-LGBTQ candidates in the midterms. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  We have to fight back and stop them. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=74.82s)]
*  Our mission? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=78.6s)]
*  Harness our energy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=79.6s)]
*  Make the difference in tough races. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=80.6s)]
*  Protect our basic freedoms to love and choose. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=82.82s)]
*  That's our Agenda. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=86.58s)]
*  We're Agenda PAC. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=88.58s)]
*  Joining me now is Agenda PAC Chair and Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=92.58s)]
*  my good friend Malcolm. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=98.5s)]
*  It's so good to see you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=99.86s)]
*  What is your reaction to this Texas judge's ruling on HIV preventative drugs? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=101.42s)]
*  You know, Katie, always good to be with you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=108.7s)]
*  My reaction is one of a turned stomach. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=111.98s)]
*  You know, as somebody for whom my Christian faith is core to who I am, I was ordained [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  as a minister in my Pentecostal church at the age of 14. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=123.7s)]
*  I almost went to seminary. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=128.74s)]
*  My faith is a guide and a cornerstone of my entire life, and that's true for so many people. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=131.72s)]
*  And to see our faith be bastardized over and over again to justify clear cruelty is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=139.06s)]
*  incredibly frustrating to me as a person of faith. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=150.58s)]
*  Jesus literally spent his life going around healing people who had chronic diseases. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=154.5s)]
*  And now you have people who claim that they are followers of Jesus, who want to strip [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  away life-saving treatments and also preventative treatments like PrEP and like HIV medicines, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=170.54s)]
*  which we know has helped so many people live a healthy whole lifestyle. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=178.22s)]
*  And so it is infuriating. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=182.98s)]
*  My hope is that this is obviously not upheld, but this is a part of what we're seeing out [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=185.18s)]
*  this Christian nationalist movement that flies in the face of everything I learned growing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=192.06s)]
*  up in church and also flies in the face of who we ought to be as Americans. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=197.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=202.5s)]
*  And Malcolm, obviously the intent behind this lawsuit was motivated by hate and hatred towards [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=203.5s)]
*  a specific group of people. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=209.18s)]
*  So to combat that, let's talk about Agenda PAC. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=211.62s)]
*  What impact do you want this group to have in this upcoming November midterm election, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=215.22000000000003s)]
*  2024 elections and all of the election cycles that are to come? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=221.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=224.98s)]
*  So you know what? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=225.98s)]
*  We are doing everything we can to beat the beatable bigots all across this country. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=226.98s)]
*  You know, I will tell you, I've been saying this over and over again, but so many of these [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  folks, be it religious freedom or this, you know, they just try to own the zeitgeist around [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=237.42s)]
*  this idea of American freedom. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  A part of what these bigots consistently do is expose themselves. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=245.82s)]
*  They actually don't give, you know, two farts about freedom. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=250.01999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=254.42s)]
*  They are about imposing their views onto other people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=255.42s)]
*  And Agenda PAC is going to make sure we stop these people from being in office. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  We're going to be doing the type of aggressive messaging and campaigning, telling people [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=265.74s)]
*  the truth and being a part of this conversation. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=270.9s)]
*  I think it's critical for us to not allow the bigots to be the only voice in conversations [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=274.18s)]
*  about our basic freedoms and rights. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=280.06s)]
*  We're going to be rolling out our first ad against Doug Mastriano just early next week. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=282.97999999999996s)]
*  And so if people want to be the first in line to see this ad, I think it's pretty good. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=289.02s)]
*  They should just go to AgendaPAC.org, get involved, as we're seeing so many people across [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=294.62s)]
*  the country decide to do as well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=300.82s)]
*  And we're going to continue to take on the people who have no business being in office. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=304.22s)]
*  We have to make sure that in this country, no matter who you are, who you love, how you [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=310.98s)]
*  worship, that you get a fair shot and a fair shake. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=314.74s)]
*  And we're not just going to sit idly by while people try to rip away the freedom to choose, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=317.74s)]
*  the freedom to love, and the freedom to exist as an American and be a full participant in [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  the promise of this country. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=328.38s)]
*  So let's talk about those freedoms, Malcolm. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  You and I have had conversations before about what happened during the Dobbs decision and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=333.26s)]
*  the impact that it had. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=339.38s)]
*  And so now we have this ruling in Texas dealing with the PrEP medications. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=341.02s)]
*  Justice Clarence Thomas and his concurrence in Dobbs saying that he wanted the court to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=345.98s)]
*  revisit same-sex marriage, the right to contraception. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=350.54s)]
*  He identified cases that clearly were highlighting that SCOTUS, for example, might be gunning [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=354.26s)]
*  for those freedoms. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=359.65999999999997s)]
*  What is the work that your group going to be doing to help combat that? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=360.85999999999996s)]
*  So part of what we're going to be doing is to make sure that there is a political price [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=365.82s)]
*  to pay for peddling these types of hateful messages, pushing these types of policies [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=369.38s)]
*  that we know have a devastating impact on families. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=379.34s)]
*  And I think a part of what happens when you expose what these ideas look like in practice, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=383.14s)]
*  you see a lot of Americans say, no, I don't want any parts of that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=390.22s)]
*  You look at what happened since Dobbs was overturned, and even more Americans are saying [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=394.06s)]
*  they want to see abortion be legal in all instances because we're seeing the real impact [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=400.38s)]
*  of it. We're seeing kids who were raped having to cross state borders because they can't [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=408.14000000000004s)]
*  get an abortion in their state. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=413.74s)]
*  We're seeing women who are, you might have a miscarriage, who are now at risk of being [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=415.34s)]
*  investigated by the police, doctors who are having to consult a lawyer before they perform [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=421.5s)]
*  a medical procedure. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=426.94s)]
*  The same is true around these bigoted policies against the LGBTQ community. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=428.14s)]
*  In Texas, where that governor said that they were going to send child protective services [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=432.46s)]
*  after parents who just support their kids as who they are, child protective services [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=437.98s)]
*  said in a lawsuit that they are at a breaking point. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=443.02s)]
*  They're not able to actually investigate real child abuse because they're going after [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=446.21999999999997s)]
*  affirming parents. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=450.29999999999995s)]
*  Agenda PAC is going to show on TV, on digital, through text, through billboards, show people [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=451.5s)]
*  what that looks like in practice, because I do not believe that a majority of the American [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=458.38s)]
*  people want to go back to a place where who you love is decided by somebody else. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  A majority of the American people don't want to have fewer rights in the next 50 years [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=469.26s)]
*  than they had in the previous 50 years. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=474.62s)]
*  And Agenda PAC is going to show these bigots for the hateful monsters that they are. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=476.7s)]
*  And we believe that the American people are going to rally with us to beat them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=481.98s)]
*  And again, as I said, people every single day, Katie, I've been blown away by how many [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=486.14s)]
*  people are going to AgendaPAC.org to get involved in this work. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=490.21999999999997s)]
*  And we're excited for everybody to see this first ad in a couple of days. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=493.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwLzkyHEG0&t=499.26s)]
