Video Description: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange looks set to be extradited to the U.S. following a ruling by the U.K.'s high court.

Free press advocates also warn it sets a dangerous precedent for the safety and security of journalists' right to report freely.

# Calls For Biden Administration To Put A Stop To Assange Extradition
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 13, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw)
*  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange looks set to be extradited to the U.S. following a ruling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=0.0s)]
*  by the U.K.'s high court. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  The Australian whistleblower faces an array of criminal charges over the publication of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=7.12s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of classified military documents. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=11.64s)]
*  If convicted of espionage, he faces a 175-year prison sentence. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=14.64s)]
*  Now, Assange, along with his lawyers and advocates, have been locked in a court battle to try [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  to avoid his extradition to the United States, fearing for his safety in a U.S. prison as [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=26.04s)]
*  well as his mental health. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=30.04s)]
*  The repercussions of this decision could fall much farther, though, than just with Assange [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  himself. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=37.0s)]
*  Free press advocates also warn that it sets a dangerous precedent for the safety and security [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=38.0s)]
*  of journalists' rights to report freely. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=42.5s)]
*  My next guest has reigned extensively on this case back in February, imploring the newly [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=45.32s)]
*  inaugurated President Biden to drop the charges against Assange. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=50.22s)]
*  He also gave testimony in Julian Assange's extradition proceedings. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=55.14s)]
*  Jamil Jaff, our executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=59.019999999999996s)]
*  University, joins me now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=62.58s)]
*  Jamil, it's great to have you with us. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=64.3s)]
*  First, I just want to start by getting your reaction to this news and what you see as [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=65.98s)]
*  being the greater implication for this extradition and charges against Julian Assange. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's a really discouraging development. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=78.62s)]
*  The real issue is the underlying indictment. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=82.62s)]
*  The indictment charges Assange with—it's an 18-count indictment. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=85.7s)]
*  Most of the activity that is described in the indictment involves the kinds of activities [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=92.86s)]
*  that journalists engage in all the time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  National security journalists all the time communicate with government sources confidentially, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=102.46s)]
*  take steps to protect the confidentiality of their sources' identities, and publish [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=110.05999999999999s)]
*  classified information. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=115.05999999999999s)]
*  And those are the kinds of things that the indictment spends most of its time describing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=116.38s)]
*  And so the concern is that the indictment itself has a kind of chilling effect on national [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=122.5s)]
*  security journalism, and a conviction, I think, would require media organizations [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=130.26s)]
*  to significantly curtail their newsgathering activities, because the kinds of activities [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=136.26s)]
*  that journalists engage in all the time will suddenly be considered criminal. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=141.54s)]
*  Yeah, and the troubling thing in this is, aside from what you think of Julian Assange [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=144.78s)]
*  as the person and all the other legal challenges he's had to deal with, this is about a very [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  specific incident going back to 2010. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  And you've pointed out that much of the war on journalists actually stemmed from former [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=155.66s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=159.9s)]
*  And there was a Yahoo! [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=161.74s)]
*  News report that alleged there was discussions with inside the Trump White House about having [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=163.14s)]
*  Assange assassinated while he was still inside the Ecuadorian embassy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=167.62s)]
*  You made a plea to President Biden earlier this year asking him to intervene. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=172.16s)]
*  He obviously has not done that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=177.1s)]
*  Your thoughts on—and how disappointed are you that the Biden administration is actually [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=179.42s)]
*  following suit with what the Trump administration pursued? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=183.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think one thing that's important to note is that the Espionage Act has been [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=187.5s)]
*  used very, very aggressively since 9-11, predating the Trump administration, obviously predating [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=192.46s)]
*  Biden. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=198.3s)]
*  The Bush administration, the Obama administration used the Espionage Act very, very aggressively [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=199.58s)]
*  to go after journalists' sources. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=204.22s)]
*  But this particular prosecution is the first one in which the government has tried to use [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=206.58s)]
*  the Espionage Act against a publisher. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=211.74s)]
*  So it really does represent a very significant extension of this pattern that we've seen [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=214.74s)]
*  since 9-11. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  And the Obama administration actually considered filing charges against Assange, but ultimately [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=222.42s)]
*  decided not to because of what it called the New York Times problem. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=229.7s)]
*  It just couldn't satisfy itself that there was a meaningful legal distinction between [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=232.9s)]
*  it was alleging Assange had done and what organizations like the New York Times do every [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=238.06s)]
*  day. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=243.46s)]
*  Now, obviously, that didn't deter the Trump administration. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=244.46s)]
*  The Trump administration saw that as a kind of feature rather than a bug of this particular [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=246.82s)]
*  situation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=251.46s)]
*  And it went after Assange, knowing full well that the prosecution of Assange would have [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=252.46s)]
*  implications, broad implications, not just for WikiLeaks, but for organizations like [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=257.9s)]
*  the New York Times or the Washington Post or virtually any organization, media organization [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=262.78s)]
*  in the United States that engages in national security journalism. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=266.9s)]
*  So it's a Trump administration indictment, the first one under the Espionage Act to charge [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=271.09999999999997s)]
*  a publisher with violations of that particular act. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  And as you mentioned, press freedom organizations, not only my own, but virtually every press [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=281.34s)]
*  freedom organization in the United States has called on President Biden to drop the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  prosecution. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  Thus far, obviously, he hasn't done it, but it's not too late. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  And it's incredible when you think of all the wrongdoings that WikiLeaks has exposed [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=296.70000000000005s)]
*  in terms of U.S. military activities overseas. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=300.06s)]
*  Those individuals weren't prosecuted. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=303.22s)]
*  And yet here is Julian Assange being prosecuted for publishing that through WikiLeaks. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=305.66s)]
*  I do want to ask you really quickly, are you, do you have any confidence at all in the remainder [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=310.5s)]
*  of the process in the UK? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=316.0s)]
*  I believe there is a right of appeal for Assange to the UK Supreme Court based on what you've [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=317.78000000000003s)]
*  seen play out over the last two hearings or the last two decisions, to be more precise. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=324.5s)]
*  Is there any chance that this one will be reversed and that he would not be extradited? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't know the answer to that question. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=333.97999999999996s)]
*  It seems to me that they shouldn't turn on the actions of British courts, that this is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  actually in the hands of the U.S. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=343.9s)]
*  government. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=345.78s)]
*  The U.S. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=346.78s)]
*  government could decide today that this prosecution isn't going to go any further. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=347.78s)]
*  It could drop this indictment. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=352.02s)]
*  If it wants to pursue Assange under some other set of charges not involving the publication [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=353.66s)]
*  of classified information, it can do that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  If it believes that he is an agent of a foreign power, it can charge him with that and prosecute [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=361.3s)]
*  him and no press organization is going to complain about that if the government has [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=365.18s)]
*  the evidence to back it up. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=369.42s)]
*  The problem with this particular prosecution is that they are charging him for publishing [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  classified secrets and that is something that news organizations do all the time and that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=374.98s)]
*  we need news organizations to do all the time. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=379.62s)]
*  Yeah, it'll definitely have a chilling effect on our democracy and first speech if in fact [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=382.38s)]
*  he is prosecuted here. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=386.74s)]
*  It's certainly something I personally don't agree with. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=388.34s)]
*  Jamil Jaffer, thank you so much for your analysis and context. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=391.5s)]
*  Greatly appreciate it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR9zNFZYPw&t=394.53999999999996s)]
