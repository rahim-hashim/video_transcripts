# Strong views on both sides: Calls for Biden to step aside spark fiery panel debate
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g)
*  Democrats are facing an unavoidable consequence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=0.0s)]
*  Time is running out for President Biden and his party to change course. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=3.6s)]
*  This issue has to be settled this week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=9.16s)]
*  This has to be settled in the next week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=11.52s)]
*  This can't go on any longer. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=13.8s)]
*  How long can Democrats afford to be continuing to have this discussion? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=15.44s)]
*  I'd say just a couple of weeks. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  And even some of Biden's top supporters in Congress, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=23.68s)]
*  like Senator Chris Murphy and Congressman Adam Schiff, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  are saying Biden needs to make his case to voters now, this week, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=28.76s)]
*  or else making a tough decision. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=33.6s)]
*  And so I think this week is going to be absolutely critical. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  I think the president needs to do more. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=40.04s)]
*  But if he can't do that, then he's got a decision to make [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=42.28s)]
*  about what the path forward is. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=45.6s)]
*  How quickly does he have to make this decision, though? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=47.28s)]
*  The next week, the next 10 days? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=49.2s)]
*  It needs to be made promptly, but frankly, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  more important than speed is getting it right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=53.88s)]
*  And behind the scenes, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=56.96s)]
*  congressional Democrats are even more blunt on Biden's prospects. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=57.92s)]
*  One Democratic lawmaker who previously endorsed President Biden [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=61.32s)]
*  told NBC News they will be breaking their silence on his political future, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=64.72s)]
*  quote, soon. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=69.28s)]
*  Another House Democrat predicted there will be more calls for Biden [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=70.32s)]
*  to step aside in the coming days, and that is coming from House Democrats [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=73.32s)]
*  who remain anonymous with their dissent. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  However, NBC News can now confirm that four top House Democrats, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=79.36s)]
*  Joe Morrell, Jerry Nadler, Adam Smith and Mark Takano, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=83.2s)]
*  have now joined the ongoing list of congressional Democrats [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=86.8s)]
*  calling for Biden to step aside. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=90.0s)]
*  And that brings the total number to nine House Democrats. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=91.84s)]
*  These new calls came during a virtual meeting this afternoon [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=95.48s)]
*  with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries to discuss Biden's path forward. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=98.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden remains defiant on staying in the race, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=102.92s)]
*  telling ABC's George Stephanopoulos that it would only take, quote, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=106.36s)]
*  the Lord Almighty to get him to drop out of the race. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  We're only 120 days till the presidential election. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=112.68s)]
*  At the end of the day, the decision will come down to you, the voter. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=115.44s)]
*  And regardless of what happens with President Biden or the Democrats, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=119.48s)]
*  another clear question remains. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=122.52s)]
*  Are they listening to the people who elect them? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=124.84s)]
*  Here's what President Biden said when asked about his poor poll numbers. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=127.28s)]
*  You're behind now in the popular vote. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=131.72s)]
*  I don't I don't buy that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=134.6s)]
*  Is it worth the risk? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=137.28s)]
*  I don't think anybody's more qualified to be president [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=139.76s)]
*  over when this race to me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=142.2s)]
*  I don't buy the polls. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=144.88s)]
*  No one is more qualified than me. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=146.2s)]
*  It might sound familiar. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  It's clear from that answer that Joe Biden isn't listening to the people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  who helped him defeat Donald Trump. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=153.72s)]
*  And one of my next guests writes in The Washington Post that enough is enough. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=155.48s)]
*  Adam Frisch, Democratic congressional candidate for Colorado's third district, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=160.28s)]
*  says it is time for President Biden to step aside, saying, quote, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  he should put personal ambition aside and then stand up and announce [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=167.04s)]
*  he will withdraw from consideration. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=170.68s)]
*  The deep Democratic Democratic bench should work to nominate a younger slate. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  Adam Frisch is with us now, as well as Tara Sattmeyer, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=177.8s)]
*  co-founder and CEO of the Seneca Project and David Korn, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=180.84s)]
*  MSNBC political analyst and Washington bureau chief at Mother Jones. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=184.12s)]
*  Great to have all three of you with us. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=187.56s)]
*  Adam, I'll start with you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=189.36s)]
*  Give us the argument. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Talk to us about why you believe President Biden should step aside, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  given his track record, given the fact that he has beaten President Biden. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=195.88s)]
*  Sorry, President Trump previously and given the fact that he has delivered [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=200.52s)]
*  in his first three and a half years what the American people set him out to do. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=203.76s)]
*  Listen, great to see everyone and happy July 4th on Sunday. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=207.56s)]
*  You know, I'll leave the political analysis to some others, but I can say [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=210.68s)]
*  blatantly that 27 polls can't be wrong. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=214.68s)]
*  I thought they might have had the ability to change over the next couple of months. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=217.44s)]
*  But obviously, I think we've just run out of time. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=220.76s)]
*  I'm talking to steelworkers down in Pueblo and farmers in Mesa County [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=223.32s)]
*  and ranchers elsewhere in southwest Colorado. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=228.76s)]
*  And these are boots on the ground, ten dollar donors, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=232.36s)]
*  people that aren't really involved in politics. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=235.08s)]
*  And they just see what a lot of people see, except for the inner circle [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=237.56s)]
*  of the president, which is that he can't win and you don't govern if you don't win. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=240.88s)]
*  I've learned that much. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=244.8s)]
*  Why do they think he cannot win? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=246.04s)]
*  What do they tell you? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  These people that you're speaking to that are not interested in politics [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=248.76s)]
*  or not engaged in politics, but also you're saying they can see that he cannot win. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=251.68s)]
*  What are they basing that on? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=256.36s)]
*  And why can they? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  Why do they believe he cannot win? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=258.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think all of them watched the debate or they saw clips of the debate. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=260.8s)]
*  Some of them saw the ABC News interview or snippets of it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=264.88s)]
*  You know, his last line was one of the most damaging, I think, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=269.36s)]
*  that he seemed to be kind of non-plausive if all of a sudden he loses. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=272.56s)]
*  But as long as they gave it the old college try, that's not not much of a problem. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  And the argument that he and so many people are making about how important [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=281.16s)]
*  this presidential race is doesn't seem to square with what the president is saying. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=284.8s)]
*  And I think that you don't have to be a political animal to kind of get the vibe [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=289.44s)]
*  of what's going around and, you know, it's just going in the wrong direction. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=292.84s)]
*  And four years ago was a different story, was a different person, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=296.36s)]
*  was a different health conversation as well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=300.4s)]
*  Tara, give me your thoughts on the debate that's raging on right now, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=302.88s)]
*  whether President Biden should step aside. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=305.64s)]
*  And we can talk about the growing call of Democrats. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=307.56s)]
*  You know, some prominent names, including Jerry Nagler, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=310.64s)]
*  excuse me, a longtime Trump, excuse me, a longtime Biden ally saying that he should [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  drop out. But walk me through the counterarguments that why he needs to stay in the race [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=319.56s)]
*  and if whether or not, as he said, he is the most qualified person to beat Trump. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=324.56s)]
*  Well, I would ask all of these people, are they prepared to ask President [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=329.23999999999995s)]
*  Biden, who's had an extremely successful first term with a legislative [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=333.52s)]
*  accomplishments that we haven't seen in recent history for a first term president [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  with an economy that's actually booming in this country with unprecedented job growth, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=342.12s)]
*  low unemployment, number one energy producer in the world, stock market through the roof. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=347.32000000000005s)]
*  Are they prepared to ask him to step down? Because that's ultimately what these people [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=352.6s)]
*  are asking President Biden to do is to step down from the presidency because he can't step aside [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  and say, well, I'm not I don't have it together enough to go on as the candidate, but I can still [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=361.32000000000005s)]
*  remain president of the United States. There's no way that's going to happen. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=366.76000000000005s)]
*  So we need to have an honest conversation with what they're asking. I think that at this point [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=370.44s)]
*  that it's really up to President Biden. It's up to him what he decides to do. But the piling on, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=376.12s)]
*  particularly in the media and the punditry class for the last 10 days has not been helpful. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=381.4s)]
*  You can ask those questions. Sure. And you know what? President Biden has to prove himself. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=386.52s)]
*  Absolutely. That was a disastrous debate. Everybody acknowledges that he is on the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=391.48s)]
*  world stage next week and he will have to prove himself again. However, he has not demonstrated [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=396.12s)]
*  thus far that he's incapable of running the country. Are we in a crisis? Are we are a million [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=401.64s)]
*  people dying? Do we have, you know, portable morgues in the streets of New York City and mass [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=406.6s)]
*  graves like we did four years ago? Is the country in disarray? It is not. So I am just concerned [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=412.36s)]
*  about the way that this is now being reported on enough. Everybody gets it. We he needs to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=418.28000000000003s)]
*  prove himself. But in the meantime, we are losing focus on what's actually happening on the other [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=423.24s)]
*  side. There is more news than just that Joe Biden is old. And I think Democrats need to also [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=428.2s)]
*  recognize the impracticality of what they're asking to do. This is not an Aaron Sorkin West [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=433.08s)]
*  Wing episode. It doesn't work that way. We're doubt where President Biden just gets to walk away and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=437.8s)]
*  they get to write in a new candidate. There are a lot of issues and Democrats, no offense to my [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=443.16s)]
*  Democratic friends, but they're like herding cats. They can't agree on what time of day it is most [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=448.12s)]
*  of the time. And there were 700 uncommitted delegates for the DNC before this. They still [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=452.76s)]
*  weren't unified, even with President Biden winning overwhelmingly in the primary. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=458.36s)]
*  So they think we're going to go into a broker convention in August and everyone's going to come [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  out smelling like roses and they're going to be unified. That is unlikely and impractical. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=466.76s)]
*  And that's not even talking about ballot access in all 50 states, which is a problem too. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=471.88s)]
*  So this is something I think that needs to be a balanced conversation. And they need to know that [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=476.12s)]
*  President Biden's already proven himself to beat Donald Trump. It's not an unknown moving forward [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=481.88s)]
*  with him. You bring in another candidate, they have to be vetted. They always have skeletons [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  in their closet too. And we are only 120 days away from the election. Stay focused, eye on the prize [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=491.08s)]
*  and know that the enemy here is MAGA, Donald Trump and that extremism and the end of our democracy, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  not Joe Biden. All right, David, last but certainly not least, I want to bring you into the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=502.44s)]
*  conversation for your opinion on this and where you come down. Tara said the phrase, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=507.24s)]
*  he needs to prove himself a few times. He has proven himself as president, but you did say he [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=513.08s)]
*  needs to prove himself a few times, a few more times. But I do want to know what you think in [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=516.92s)]
*  terms of the window as to how long this conversation can drag out for before there is a unity among the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=520.84s)]
*  party behind the candidate. Is time of the essence here or can they afford to drag this out to the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=527.48s)]
*  convention through the next several weeks? Certainly not that long. To me, the issue is [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=534.12s)]
*  what happened at the debate. Was it an episode or a condition? And I just look at the odds here. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=540.28s)]
*  If Biden can get through the next few weeks and up to the election without having a repeat of that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=547.48s)]
*  in any sort of way, if, you know, and prove that this is not a debilitating condition, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=555.32s)]
*  the Democrats are kind of where they were at the beginning of this crisis or controversy. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=560.6s)]
*  But so far since the debate, I would give him a B minus B maybe on doing what he needs to do [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=566.12s)]
*  to demonstrate that that was just a one-off. He still, you know, the speeches he gave were forceful, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=574.2800000000001s)]
*  but he still hasn't had a lot of sort of unscheduled time with voters and reporters [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=582.2800000000001s)]
*  when you can really see him at work. I mean, he had a good day today campaigning. MSNBC has shown [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  the clips. They're all over social media. But I still think that his campaign hasn't forcefully [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=596.84s)]
*  enough put him out there to deal with the concerns, the real concerns. What would it take, David, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  specifically give us some give me some specifics as to what it would take to assuage those concerns. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=609.96s)]
*  What are you talking about here specifically about what you think needs to be done besides these [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=615.56s)]
*  scripted events with small groups of people? What do you want to see? Well, I want to see him engage [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=621.72s)]
*  with other people in an unscripted moment. It could be voters. It could be reporters. It doesn't [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=629.4s)]
*  happen, you know, but in a town hall meeting, perhaps would be a good way to do this, right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=635.0s)]
*  Talk to voters, take questions. Some might be difficult questions so that you can really see [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=640.5999999999999s)]
*  him. And I was surprised that the campaign, we talk about time here, has wasted time. They didn't do [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=645.88s)]
*  this immediately after the debate. He did a good speech about the Supreme Court decision making the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  president essentially a king, but they need to take questions afterwards. And it doesn't have [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=660.6s)]
*  to be with the media. I'm not saying that, but a town hall or something like that. And I think [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=665.08s)]
*  they need to do it soon because we're getting close to a dam breaking, you know, and if that happens, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=669.96s)]
*  you know, terror, you know, we're going to have this chaotic scenario out there with people, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=677.88s)]
*  you know, the Democratic Party split in half, essentially, which will not lead to easy decision [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=683.24s)]
*  making. But what comes next if something else has to come next? Adam, your thoughts on terrorist [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=689.8s)]
*  argument and more importantly, do you believe that Joe Biden on the ticket hurts down ballot races [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=696.28s)]
*  in swing states and other competitive races throughout this country? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=702.12s)]
*  Well, with respect to the other panelists on here, I just want to push back and get [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=706.8399999999999s)]
*  the punditory class. I've driven 57,000 miles in the past two and a half years. I'm home five days [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=710.28s)]
*  a month for the past two years. And I'm talking to independents and Democrats and Republicans. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=715.72s)]
*  And everyone's frustrated. I was one of the people of which 75 percent of the people did [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=720.6s)]
*  not want this rematch. I asked for two years ago to have an open primary. It's one thing for us [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=725.08s)]
*  to say that there is a cult leader going on there, but one party, with all due respect, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=729.64s)]
*  actually, I had an open primary, the one party decided to shut it down. And so I just think that, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=734.2s)]
*  you know, ideally, the time has sailed for a lot of different things, but we have to figure out [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=740.0400000000001s)]
*  what is the best way to build an anti-Trump coalition. And it's not a pro-Biden coalition. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=744.92s)]
*  And those are two different things. I'm just going to go back to what I'm hearing on the ground, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=749.4s)]
*  again, from farmers and ranchers. They're frustrated with both parties, candidates. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=753.16s)]
*  They would love to see a new generation. The Democratic Party has a great new diverse [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=758.8399999999999s)]
*  generation. And it's not too late to get something done. It's not ideal, but it's not late. And I [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=763.3199999999999s)]
*  think we need to focus on that, as opposed to believing that it's just a bunch of D.C. talking [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=768.68s)]
*  heads that are actually calling for this. I'm telling you, I guarantee you I've spoken to more [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=773.88s)]
*  people than probably everyone you've had on the television for the past three or four days, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=778.6s)]
*  if not the past three or four weeks, getting out there to the rural parts of the country, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=783.72s)]
*  listening to real people. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=787.56s)]
*  AARON MATE AARON MATE No, and certainly that's a valid point. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=788.68s)]
*  TARA HERNÁNDEZ That's fine. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=790.36s)]
*  AARON MATE That's a valid point. You are a candidate, after all, so we certainly hope that [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=790.6s)]
*  you are doing that. But go ahead, Tara, you wanted to jump in and make a point as well. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=793.8s)]
*  TARA HERNÁNDEZ Yeah, just a couple of things. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=797.64s)]
*  AARON MATE Sure. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=799.24s)]
*  TARA HERNÁNDEZ It's not news that the American people are frustrated with the two choices. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=799.4s)]
*  That's not news. But those are the choices. And if there was to be an open primary, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=803.16s)]
*  we can't wish-cast what should have been before. What happened is Joe Biden won the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=808.92s)]
*  Democratic primary, and we are in July. In 2008, Barack Obama only had 50 percent in the Democratic [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=813.24s)]
*  Party support when he was on his way to winning the nomination, 50 percent at this point in 2008. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=821.24s)]
*  And guess what? He won over 90 percent of the Democratic votes. So understanding that people [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=826.04s)]
*  are frustrated now, I hear you. Is it an ideal situation? It's not. But it's a binary choice [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=831.48s)]
*  right now, and you cannot. If you were to ask those same people if they understood what it took [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=836.6s)]
*  in order to switch out President Biden now, are they prepared? Do they want President Biden to [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=841.64s)]
*  resign the presidency? I would like to see what people think about that. Do they think that— [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=846.12s)]
*  AARON MATE Why is that the issue? Sorry, I just don't understand. Why are you asking people to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=850.6s)]
*  resign? Nobody is saying he should resign. People are worried that he's not going to be able to [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=854.04s)]
*  finish four more years. And if you let— TARA HERNÁNDEZ Because politically, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=857.08s)]
*  you can't keep him as president and expect him to step down away from the nomination. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=860.44s)]
*  There will be too much pressure on him to have to step completely away and let Kamala Harris [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=864.2s)]
*  ascend to the vice presidency so she can demonstrate to people that she's running. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=868.76s)]
*  AARON MATE David, go ahead. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=872.28s)]
*  TARA HERNÁNDEZ That's the political reality of that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=873.0s)]
*  AARON MATE Go ahead, David. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=875.88s)]
*  DAVID BROOKS Go ahead, Tara. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=876.52s)]
*  DAVID BROOKS Tara, I think you make a really good point about the dynamics of what would happen [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=876.9200000000001s)]
*  if you switch someone out. Running a presidential campaign is really one of the hardest things to do [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=881.88s)]
*  in campaigning for president ditto. And so very few people do this well. A lot of people try, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=886.36s)]
*  most fail. Putting somebody new in, Adam, who's young and fresh and dynamic at this stage of the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=892.44s)]
*  game, I don't think is practical. I think the only practical alternative to Joe Biden would be [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=898.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris. I don't think Biden has to resign the presidency. He can say, I worry about what [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=904.92s)]
*  I would be like in another year or two. I see myself slowing down. And I think you could hand [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=910.44s)]
*  it over to Kamala. She could inherit part of the organization. But having a new cast of characters, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=917.32s)]
*  Adam, at this stage of the game, who come in, they will fight each other, the convention will [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=923.5600000000001s)]
*  be chaotic, maybe chaotic on the outside, I think it's too late for that. I think you're down to... [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=928.9200000000001s)]
*  TARA HERNÁNDEZ And they can't transfer the money, David. You know that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=935.1600000000001s)]
*  AARON MATE They can't transfer the money. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=937.24s)]
*  AARON MATE Really quickly, Adam, do you think it should be Kamala Harris? If Joe Biden does [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=939.4s)]
*  take the decision to step down, would you be happy with, do you get a sense from voters that [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=944.6800000000001s)]
*  you've been speaking to that Kamala Harris would be a better replacement or one that people could [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=948.6800000000001s)]

*  competent. She has the experience. She's been in competitive campaigns. She knows the White House. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=958.92s)]
*  She knows the organizational infrastructure. She does check all of those boxes and concerns [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=963.4s)]
*  that David and Tara are raising. AARON MATE [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=968.28s)]
*  Listen, I don't think it's too late. France and England can run races. It might be helpful that [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=971.16s)]
*  actually there's a pushback against the political industrial complex to actually run a four-month [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=975.64s)]
*  campaign for the country. There are names out there that have been floating around. We can [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=982.68s)]
*  figure out how to do this. There's a way to set up town halls that should have happened, ideally, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=987.48s)]
*  a long time ago, but it's not too late to do it. Listen, I think if you want to really build a [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=991.48s)]
*  coalition, with all due respect, you grab a salt shaker, paint it blue, it gets 47 percent of the [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=995.56s)]
*  vote. Somebody has to figure out how to get the couple extra percent to win. This is not about [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1000.28s)]
*  starting from ground zero. There's enough funds out there to help it run the race it needs to [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1005.4799999999999s)]
*  get raced. I'm just telling you, people are sick and tired of new candidates, and I think it can be [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1009.56s)]
*  liberating for someone to actually stand up and make a stand, and that's what I and other people [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1015.2399999999999s)]
*  have been trying to do. We'll see how it goes on. Now, whether the vice president wants to put [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1020.04s)]
*  her name in the hat, I assume that she would, and I fully support that. I also fully support those [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1025.4s)]
*  five or ten names that everyone spends time talking about, and I think there's still a way, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1029.64s)]
*  through some town halls and some debates and candidate forums, to figure out some type of [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1033.96s)]
*  sortment as you run into the convention, which is in some time in a month or something like that. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1038.68s)]
*  I think it can be done. How do you raise the money? Adam, how do you raise the money? If it's not [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1043.8000000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris and it's some new slight slate of candidates, they have to start from zero, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1047.4s)]
*  from scratch. The money doesn't transfer over. The war chest does not because of campaign finance [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1051.32s)]
*  laws. And what about ballot access? What do you do about that with the deadlines for ballot access? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1055.8s)]
*  It costs billions of dollars to run for president. You think that's going to happen in four months? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1060.9199999999998s)]
*  You can't compare us to Europe. We're a completely different system. This is a fantasy, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1064.9199999999998s)]
*  and I think it's a disservice to tell the American people that it's practical for us to just switch [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1069.1599999999999s)]
*  out a president of the United States and just start a whole new campaign four months before [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1074.36s)]
*  the election when he's actually done a pretty damn good job. And at this point, until he [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1078.12s)]
*  demonstrates that he is incompetent of running the country, then I think that he only he can make [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1082.6s)]
*  that decision moving forward. And we need to start putting the focus back on Donald Trump [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1087.4799999999998s)]
*  and what he's doing and not let them get away with it. Women's rights are on the line. Our [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1092.04s)]
*  democracy is on the line. And we cannot keep doing this. We're handing this over to Magda. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1095.6399999999999s)]
*  All right, guys, we can keep having this conversation for such a long time. It is [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1100.4399999999998s)]
*  an important conversation. I promise you we're going to try to continue this conversation as [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1106.68s)]
*  much as we can. I certainly appreciate the three of you joining me tonight with all of your insights. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1109.64s)]
*  Also, some breaking news that we got while we were on the air, that scheduled call tomorrow [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1114.6000000000001s)]
*  with Senate Democrats by Senator Mark Warner. That is not taking place tomorrow. We don't know when [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1118.68s)]
*  it will take place, but it is a sign that that scheduled call will not be taking place. Tara [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gV6k8E467g&t=1125.0800000000002s)]
