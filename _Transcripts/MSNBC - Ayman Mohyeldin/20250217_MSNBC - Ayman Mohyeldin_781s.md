# JD Vance stuns world with embrace of Germany's far-right party
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4)
*  During his first international trip overseas as vice president, J.D. Vance has shown an inability or perhaps an unwillingness to acknowledge that horrors left unchecked are often doomed to repeat themselves. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=0.0s)]
*  The vice president and second lady, Uscha Vance, visited the longest operating concentration camp in Nazi Germany, walking throughout the grounds where tens of thousands of Jews were murdered and placing a wreath at the site. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=13.0s)]
*  You can see it right there. Here's what he said after that tour. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=25.0s)]
*  I've read a lot about the Holocaust in books, but being here and seeing it up close in person really drives home what unspeakable evil was committed and why we should be committed to ensuring that it never happens again. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=29.0s)]
*  Ensuring it never happens again. Unspeakable evils. That's important, right, that he said those words. But the thing is that it didn't take Vance that long to understand that those words he said back then actually didn't mean anything because this is what he had to say to European leaders the very next day in Munich. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=43.0s)]
*  I believe that dismissing people, dismissing their concerns, or worse yet, shutting down media, shutting down elections, or shutting people out of the political process protects nothing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=65.0s)]
*  In fact, it is the most surefire way to destroy democracy. There's no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don't. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=79.0s)]
*  So that speech shocked hundreds of attendees. Vance didn't mention the alternative for Germany party by name, but the same day he met with the group's leader. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=91.0s)]
*  Mainstream German politicians have a long-standing agreement to freeze out the far-right group, an approach that Vance criticized in his speech. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=101.0s)]
*  For decades, Germany has had mechanisms to shun out extremist political parties and to ban hate speech to prevent the rise of another Hitler. It makes sense. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=109.0s)]
*  But in the case of the AFD, it has at times downplayed the atrocities of the Holocaust under Hitler. Parts of the party have been classified as extremists by German intelligence, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=119.0s)]
*  and members have been arrested in connection with multiple plots to overthrow the government. But that party has gained traction with German voters. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=129.0s)]
*  It's second in the polls just a week out from the parliamentary election. So to have the vice president of the United States all but endorsing that far-right group on an international stage [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=137.0s)]
*  was a striking overstep that challenged long-time precedent. So here's how German Chancellor Olaf Scholz put it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=148.0s)]
*  We really reject any idea of cooperation between parties, other parties, and these extreme right parties. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=155.0s)]
*  It is absolutely sure and necessary to say it is not others to give us the advice to cooperate with these parties, which we are not working with for good reasons, especially when looking to the history of our country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=165.0s)]
*  Vance's comments were an alarming wake-up call, but not just for Germany, for all of Europe. Even worse, this is nothing new for those in Trump's inner circle. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=181.0s)]
*  Elon Musk has openly expressed support for AFD. He's interviewed one of the party's leaders and even spoke at a campaign event last month where he told voters there's too much focus on past guilt over Nazi sins and that it was time to, quote, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=191.0s)]
*  move beyond that. It's a horrifyingly familiar sentiment of attempting to erase history while all signs point to it repeating right in front of us. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=205.0s)]
*  Far-right movements have gained traction across Europe. In Hungary, there's Italy, Australia, and now Germany. There's a reason why there are laws to protect against the rise of extremism. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=217.0s)]
*  But we're getting a stark reality check here. People like Musk and Vance are trying to obliterate this long-established checks and actually boost those movements. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=227.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon, Trump's former top ally, said in an interview last month that Musk has proven that he has the money and influence to do so on a huge scale. In his words, there's not a centrist left-wing government in Europe that will be able to withstand that onslaught. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=237.0s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss are Amisha Cross, Democratic strategist, former Obama campaign advisor, and serious ex-Sem host, and Rick Wilson, co-founder of the Lincoln Project and author, of course, of Running Against the Devil, A Plot to Save America from Trump and Democrats from Themselves. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=254.0s)]
*  Amisha, I just want to start with your quick response to Vance's speech at the Munich Security Conference. What did you make of his approach? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=270.0s)]
*  It's disastrous, but it's not surprising. He's doing the same thing that Elon Musk did when Elon went to Germany and basically told people that they no longer needed to teach the lessons or the history of the Holocaust. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=280.0s)]
*  This is someone who is absolutely fine uplifting alt-right, far-right regimes and their political tactics, but he's doing it from the bench of the White House. He's doing it as the vice president. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=292.0s)]
*  He went to their turf and basically is uplifting some of the most extremist groups he possibly could, who Germany rightfully has moved to silence because they know what that can turn into. They lived through this process before. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=304.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, America is going for a round deuce right here in our own nation. But I think that it speaks to something a whole lot larger, and you alluded to it a little bit in your opening. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=315.0s)]
*  What we're seeing is a far-right latchhole that is not just one that is going to take hold in America. They see themselves as only successful if they also are able to expand the far-right, those views and those politics and policies across Europe. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=323.0s)]
*  That's what they ultimately want to do. They want to destroy anything that looks like a democracy, but moreover, they want to be able to eradicate people's civil and human rights. They also want to create authoritarian regimes. That's what we're seeing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=336.0s)]
*  Rick, how powerful are people like Stephen Bannon and Elon Musk in a moment like this? Like to Amisha's point, will they actually have an influence in Europe? Now, obviously, we know that Bannon has a lot of connections to right-wing parties across Europe, but how do you see all of this playing out? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=349.0s)]
*  Well, it's an order of scale difference now. You know, a few years ago, Bannon had his version of Nazi Hogwarts over in Italy, and it got closed down. He's tried to influence elections. But the scale to which Elon Musk can bring financial resources and the scale to which he can use his social media platform to alter the dialogue in a lot of these countries is quite dramatically different than Steve Bannon sort of trying to tape it together. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=366.0s)]
*  But I do think it's important to understand just how heartened. I communicated with somebody from the German CSU a little while ago. I asked her what she thought about what had happened with Vance, and the degree to which they were shocked and appalled and offended that Vance came there, daring to lecture Germany, one of the most free countries on Earth when it comes to expression, where America is now rated 55th in the world on freedom of expression, was appalling. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=390.0s)]
*  And it was insulting to people who have been our allies now since World War II and who have, as few other nations ever have, taken the hard look at their past, done the work that's necessary to prevent a repeat of the past. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=419.0s)]
*  You know, ignoring it is what the Germans did in the 30s. And that's what Vance and Musk and a lot of the alt-right folks that now infect the Trump administration view this as. They see this as 1936. They really want to drive hard, impose this authoritarian worldview. It's not even conservative anymore. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=434.0s)]
*  It's radical authoritarianism fueled by an oligarchical little clack of billionaires like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. And so what they're trying to do is race to a finish line that we know what starts when they get to that line. We know what happens when they get to that line. It is not pretty. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=453.0s)]
*  And the fact that JD Vance could go to Dachau and then turn around and do this. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=471.0s)]
*  I mean, Amisha, talk to me about exactly what Rick is saying right now. You see this sort of split screen of JD Vance. Here he is, right, posing that wreath. And then he's out there making these extremely dangerous comments. I mean, does he mean what he says? Is he playing politics? Like, how do you make sense of that? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=478.0s)]
*  He's absolutely playing politics. This is a very tragic situation. We think about the history of the Holocaust, which I think is one of the worst tragedies the world has ever seen. It deserves its memorialization. But we also reserve the right to make sure that something like that never happens again on our watch. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=501.0s)]
*  And what we see in JD Vance is a guy who just 24 hours prior can honor those victims and remembrance ceremonies. But then the very next day amplified the same types of voices that allow for that level of atrocity to begin in the first place. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=518.0s)]
*  What I think he's doing is understanding, one, Elon Musk and his money, and Musk and his money will never part. But more importantly, I think, is that the Trump administration writ large wants to create a masterclass of extreme alt-right politicians across the entire globe. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=531.0s)]
*  And they have a keen sense on Europe. That is what they are pushing for, because he recognizes that the strength of this white supremacist, anti-civil rights, anti-equity regime, one that doesn't support democracy, one that is authoritarian, it can only work if they also have partners in crime, so to speak, who also exist in other nations. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=552.0s)]
*  He is bringing together a band of buddies that he is literally putting together while he's running this thing at the nighttime. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=571.0s)]
*  Rika, I think it's interesting, this relationship or this bromance between Steve Bannon and Elon Musk. But the one thing, you know, that Steve Bannon does seem to understand is that Elon Musk has the ability to install populist governments across Europe. Does he? What role do you think Elon Musk is playing right now? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=577.0s)]
*  Listen, I've done politics in Europe before, and they are not accustomed to money at scale in these elections. They are not accustomed to somebody who would come in and say, I'm going to spend $100 million, $200 million, $300 million, because Elon has that capability at this moment. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=597.0s)]
*  As long as Tesla stock prices up, Elon Musk has that ability. But they would love to assemble. And Bannon and Musk have a bit of a rivalry, because Bannon is more of a hyperpopulist and less of a money guy, but they are working in a common cause right now. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=612.0s)]
*  You saw Pete Hegseth bring along one of the most notorious alt-right figures, Jack Posobiak, with him to Europe as an advisor on this trip. These are people who are all pulling for one person in the equation. It's not Donald Trump. They're trying to pull together a Europe that looks like what Vladimir Putin wants in his dreams. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=630.0s)]
*  And my German friend, when she texted me back, she said, I'm sure JD's speech sounded better in Russian when they worked it up the first time. It just was not anything but a pro-Putin vision of Europe. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=650.0s)]
*  How do you think all of this plays out, Amisha, in Europe? You know, thinking about a continent that has always been a huge ally and cornerstone of obviously our relationship with them, like, how do you see this playing out in Europe? I'm thinking of France, or Macron, someone that is just trying to get emergency meetings set up because of what they see in the United States. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=664.0s)]
*  I recall before the election, Europe was also talking about essentially Trump-proofing, the same thing that we've heard from Democratic governors here in the United States, not only for NATO, but also for some of their own countries. I think that they're going to continue to do that. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=685.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, what we have seen spread across Europe is large anti-immigrant sentiment, which is quite similar to what we've seen here in the U.S., that has driven some of their policies. And I think that what Trump and his folks are going to do is continue trying to scratch away at that, making sure that they are emboldening individuals who are blaming immigrants from everything, from housing crisis to their economic situation, the cost of groceries, so on and so forth. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=700.0s)]
*  But beyond that, it depends on the stability, I think, of the economies of the European nations we're speaking of, because what we've known from history is that when the economy looks shaky, that is a time where authoritarian regimes come in and they take off. That is a time when populism builds. That is a time when people are looking to outgroup. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=722.0s)]
*  And when you're looking to outgroup, point of finger, expand a level of hatred, then it automatically lets in the darkest sides of any country. And I think that for Donald Trump, him and Elon Musk and any of the rest of his core, that's what they're looking to do. And unfortunately, across Europe right now, there are far too many countries that are still in a very dire spot in this post-pandemic, new normal era. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=738.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRjm9CdJ-a4&t=768.0s)]
