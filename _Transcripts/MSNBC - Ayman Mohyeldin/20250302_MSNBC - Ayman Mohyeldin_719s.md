Video Description: When it comes to the House GOP budget, Trump’s new “Gold Card” visa for wealthy foreigners, or any other policy coming out of the White House, there is a common denominator: good for the extremely wealthy, bad for everyone else. MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin is joined by Francesca Fiorentini, Co-Host of the “America Unhinged” podcast and Imara Jones, Founder and CEO or TransLash Media to discuss the all-out class warfare being waged by the GOP and what can be done about it.

# How Trump and Musk’s agenda is shaping up to be full-on class warfare
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU)
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk's domestic agenda became much easier to understand this week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=0.0s)]
*  Now they talk a lot about waste and fraud and abuse. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=5.0s)]
*  Yes, we do hear them talk about it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=7.92s)]
*  And they've created a bogus new government agency that's supposedly making the government [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=9.6s)]
*  more efficient. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=13.88s)]
*  But it seems that's just marketing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=15.88s)]
*  It seems it's a cover story. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=18.52s)]
*  As we said last week, for all of Trump's fake populism, he is continuing the American corporate [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=20.44s)]
*  elites 40 plus year class war on the working class and poor in America. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=25.0s)]
*  And this week's House GOP budget, which could slash Medicaid funding by as much as $880 [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=30.48s)]
*  billion, is exhibit A. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=35.44s)]
*  Nearly 80 million Americans are covered by Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=38.4s)]
*  Program. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=43.0s)]
*  Medicaid covers nearly four in 10 American children. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=44.8s)]
*  So why do this? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  What's the gain? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=49.0s)]
*  Why would the man who was the first Republican to win the working class vote in decades crush [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=50.22s)]
*  the government backed health care plan that covers 41% of all births in the U.S., nearly [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=55.06s)]
*  half of all children with special needs and five in eight nursing home residents? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=62.14s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  To cut the deficit? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=68.7s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=69.7s)]
*  Because the House Republicans are also working to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts for the rich. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=72.34s)]
*  And that will cost $4.5 trillion and obviously raise the deficit that Republicans used to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=78.22s)]
*  pretend to care about. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=84.02s)]
*  And exhibit B in Trump's so-called class war this week, his gold card visa plan. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=85.78s)]
*  We know how hostile Trump is to immigrants, but it seems, and we now have a clearer idea, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=91.82s)]
*  not all immigrants, wealthy foreigners with $5 million to be specific, would be able to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=97.82s)]
*  purchase permanent residency in the United States under Trump's new proposal. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=104.48s)]
*  So whether it's his budget priorities or his immigration priorities, there is one common [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=109.36s)]
*  denominator. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  This is simply government of the rich for the rich and by the rich. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  But these policies aren't popular. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=120.94s)]
*  There will be political costs to anyone in the GOP who supports them. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  A poll by Heart Research this week showed that 71% of Trump voters said cutting Medicaid [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=126.4s)]
*  would be unacceptable. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=131.6s)]
*  Overall, 82% of voters oppose it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=133.04s)]
*  We're already seeing some Republican lawmakers starting to squirm at the idea of going back [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=136.23999999999998s)]
*  to their districts and having to explain why the MAGA movement just took away their health [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  care. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=145.0s)]
*  It is a third rail. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=146.0s)]
*  And speaking of third rails, first buddy Elon Musk is now getting close to one. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=147.66s)]
*  This is what he had to say to Joe Rogan yesterday about Social Security. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=152.6s)]
*  Social Security is the biggest policy scheme of all time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=157.68s)]
*  Explain that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh, so, well, people pay into Social Security and the money goes out of Social Security [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  immediately. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=170.0s)]
*  But the obligation for Social Security is your entire retirement career. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=171.0s)]
*  So you're paying, like if you look at the future obligations of Social Security, it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=176.48s)]
*  far exceeds the tax revenue. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  Far. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=189.83999999999997s)]
*  Have you ever looked at the debt clock? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=191.76s)]
*  That is an incoherent answer. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=196.52s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=198.72s)]
*  It doesn't even explain, nor does it accurately describe what a Ponzi scheme actually is. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=199.72s)]
*  And it's kind of surprising that Elon Musk would not know that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=204.52s)]
*  While convincing, trying to convince Joe Rogan, it is actually frightening to 20 million Americans [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=207.88s)]
*  who are lifted out of poverty every year thanks to Social Security and to the rest of us who [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=213.04s)]
*  pay into it and want to see it continue to help the elderly in America not go broke, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=217.12s)]
*  it still does matter. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=223.28s)]
*  When he first ran for office in 2015, Donald Trump pretended to be a different type of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=224.96s)]
*  Republican. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=228.88s)]
*  And 10 years later, and we all know that's not the case, while he's promised to never [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=229.88s)]
*  cut Medicaid and never cut Social Security, he has turned the government over to this [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=235.24s)]
*  man, his top donor, the world's richest man and someone who thinks that the backbone of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=240.32s)]
*  America's social safety net for the past century is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=244.52s)]
*  And to this man, the head of the Office of Budget and Management, Russ Vogt of the Heritage [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=250.84s)]
*  Foundation, the conservative think tank that has been gunning for Social Security for decades. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  These policy ideas, if enacted, will hurt millions of people. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  The social safety net in this country is already pitiful compared to other wealthy Western [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=264.76s)]
*  nations. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=269.8s)]
*  These policies must be confronted if only there were a political party willing to fight [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=271.0s)]
*  for the other side in this class war. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=276.16s)]
*  Kicking us off this hour, Francesca Furentini, comedian and co-host of American Unhinged [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=278.92s)]
*  on YouTube and Amara Jones, founder and CEO of Translash Media. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=283.16s)]
*  It's good to have both of you with us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  Francesca, it's not just Medicaid, SNAP benefits are also now on the chopping block. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  Do Republicans not see how unpopular these cuts will be with their voting base or do [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  they simply not care? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=299.28s)]
*  I think it's the latter. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=301.52s)]
*  I think that they know the class war is on and unless they actually meet opposition from [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=302.96s)]
*  the Democratic Party or from the people in the streets or through the ballot box, they're [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=308.96s)]
*  going to keep doing whatever they're doing, which is, again, a pneumonic tube sucking [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=314.4s)]
*  the money from the poorest to the richest, two people who are straight up right now trying [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  to write off their private jets. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=325.2s)]
*  That was happened in the first Trump tax cuts. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=328.68s)]
*  If they are made completely permanent, that's what they're going to do. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=331.32s)]
*  I guess my thing is this, Aiman, and I think this is what we have to talk about. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=335.6s)]
*  There's no going back to normal discussions about the deficit. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=339.88s)]
*  The deficit has always been a false flag, red herring distraction. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=343.72s)]
*  Whenever we actually talk about things like universal health care, whenever we actually [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=349.56s)]
*  talk about something like a Green New Deal that gives people jobs but also addresses [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=352.52s)]
*  the climate chaos, the answer is, what's it going to do? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=356.8s)]
*  The deficit, how's it going to add to the deficit? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=359.76s)]
*  I don't ever want to hear a Democrat ever again say the word deficit because you see [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=361.88s)]
*  these plutocrats, you see these oligarchs just straight up when they get into power [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=367.68s)]
*  adding $4.5 trillion so they can write off their private jets. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=371.88s)]
*  And lastly, the reason we're here is because of the amount of money that has flowed into [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=376.56s)]
*  system and because Democrats sadly have often capitulated to the framing that yes, these [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=383.24s)]
*  so-called entitlement programs are the reasons that we're here. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=389.16s)]
*  And while we should try and find ways to make Social Security more solvent, oh, maybe we [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=392.88s)]
*  should cut a little bit of Medicaid, or maybe we should have work requirements even though [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  the majority of people on Medicaid already work. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=401.8s)]
*  It is all the capitulation that has led us down this Primrose path to plutocracy. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=404.6s)]
*  Yeah, and you're absolutely right about the framing of this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=409.6s)]
*  The Democrats continuously fall into the framing that Republicans want to create for them on [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=412.04s)]
*  this issue and they need to look beyond that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  Amar, do you think we will actually see a divide within the Republican Party on this [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=420.04s)]
*  budget? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=423.96s)]
*  The Musks and Trumps of the world are obviously not in touch at all with the needs of the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=424.96s)]
*  working class and working poor, but a lot of House Republicans acknowledge that they [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=428.52s)]
*  have a lot of their constituents who depend and who rely on all of these programs to get [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=434.64s)]
*  by and they have to go back to those districts. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=442.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that what you're going to see is a tremendous amount of tension, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=445.0s)]
*  but the question is whether or not that tension is going to manifest in votes. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=449.8s)]
*  I mean, this is the tension at the heart of the Republican Party right now, which is even [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=453.56s)]
*  on something like Medicaid, other government programs, that it's going to be, you know, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=458.74s)]
*  to use a phrase, the people versus the powerful. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=463.92s)]
*  And we know that so far the powerful are winning out. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  And we know that for two reasons. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=471.04s)]
*  We know, according to Vanity Fair, that members of Congress are afraid of political violence [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=472.84s)]
*  that has increased with the release of Proud Boys. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=478.92s)]
*  I mean, these essentially constitute, you know, a private army, for lack of a better [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=482.8s)]
*  word or phrase, that is sort of on the side of the president of the United States that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=487.8s)]
*  has stoked real fears on people who, within his own party, stand up and vote against their [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=493.32s)]
*  interests. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=499.0s)]
*  And there's been a tremendous hoovering up of information by Elon Musk that can be [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=500.0s)]
*  weaponized against them as well. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=505.68s)]
*  And so, you know, this combination of the possibility of political violence and sort [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=507.96s)]
*  of this digital hoovering up, digital authoritarianism and the weaponization of that information [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=513.28s)]
*  constitute a real threat to democracy overall. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=519.3s)]
*  I mean, you know, these are essentially weapons of mass destruction that have been unleashed [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=522.2s)]
*  on our democracy. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=526.92s)]
*  And so far, they're having a really deleterious effect. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=528.32s)]
*  And we wouldn't have even gotten this far. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=532.0s)]
*  I mean, so many of the people, for example, who were voted and confirmed upon as secretaries [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=533.72s)]
*  of the Cabinet wouldn't have made it without this kind of twin threat that's out there. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=541.6s)]
*  So there is this hidden force that's at work in democracy right now. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=545.4s)]
*  And I think that it raises real questions of whether or not the normal process of something [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=549.24s)]
*  like this that would impact constituents. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=553.6s)]
*  We know that red states disproportionately are a benefit for Medicaid, whether or not [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=555.88s)]
*  those normal forces are able to work because of what we've unleashed in American democracy [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=560.92s)]
*  right now. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=566.64s)]
*  You know, Francesca, I want to go back to a point that you touched upon, and that's [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=567.64s)]
*  the Democrats in this, because Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, these are some of the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=570.76s)]
*  biggest social and political achievements in America over the past 100 years, all passed [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=575.36s)]
*  by Democrats. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=582.28s)]
*  Why can't the party that got these done, that created this social safety net that has sustained [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=584.12s)]
*  millions upon millions of Americans for decades, why are they not able to basically rebuild [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=591.1s)]
*  their image around these programs, their expansion, their modernization, their reform, but at [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=598.32s)]
*  the core, maintain what these programs are about and what they do for the American people? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=603.48s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a really good question. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=610.28s)]
*  There's a number of ways to answer that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=612.88s)]
*  I mean, one of them is not wanting to piss off their corporate donors, right? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=614.28s)]
*  If they're going to receive money from folks who are really, you know, reliant on things [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=619.4s)]
*  like SNAP benefits or social safety nets, you know, companies like Walmart, who, you [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=626.36s)]
*  know, many, many of the employees who work there are also reliant on SNAP benefits. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=632.28s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=636.48s)]
*  Maybe it's because they don't pay a living wage for people to actually afford rent and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=637.48s)]
*  food and gas and childcare, on and on and on. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=644.64s)]
*  But I think what's, God, if there's a silver lining about Donald Trump, it's that he breaks [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=646.12s)]
*  things that everyone's like, oh, yeah, that was kind of important. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=650.6s)]
*  And the real thing with Democrats is you have to be messaging on this stuff all of the time. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=654.8s)]
*  They allow it to become the sort of, let's talk about pay go. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  How are you going to pay for it? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  We'll put it in a budget bill. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=665.16s)]
*  We'll nibble around the edges. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=666.68s)]
*  No, just if you're not expanding the social safety net, what have you been doing for the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=668.92s)]
*  last 40 years? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=673.9599999999999s)]
*  As you rightly said, the other side has been planning on dismantling it, right? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=674.9599999999999s)]
*  And the whole thing of third rail. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=679.64s)]
*  No, no, no, man. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=680.8s)]
*  Third rail been touched. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=681.9599999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=682.9599999999999s)]
*  They are like electrifying. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=683.9599999999999s)]
*  They're toasting their testicles over on that third rail. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=685.52s)]
*  You know, that's like some Tucker Carlson stuff over there. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=688.4s)]
*  They love it because they know they're not going to get the fight back. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=691.04s)]
*  And I do think the point about political violence is well taken and needs to be understood more. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEYQgq1VfXU&t=693.96s)]
