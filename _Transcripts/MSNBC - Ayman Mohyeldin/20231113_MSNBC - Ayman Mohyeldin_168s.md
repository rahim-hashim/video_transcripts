**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM)
*  History and hatred, the Bedouins say, has left them with no place to call home. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=0.0s)]
*  More than 100,000 living in the Negev Desert, their villages, unrecognized by Israel, which [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=8.36s)]
*  means no power, water or paved roads, permanent buildings are considered illegal and, they [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=13.48s)]
*  say, often demolished by government crews. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=18.64s)]
*  TALAB EL-SANA, Former Member of the Israeli People's Union of the Arab World We suffer [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  as Israeli citizens. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  We suffer as Arab citizens. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  We suffer as a Bedouin. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Talab El-Sana is a Bedouin lawyer and former member of Israel's Knesset. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=26.24s)]
*  He worked to have more than a dozen Bedouin communities recognized by the state and says [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=31.52s)]
*  this war has tightened what was already a suffocating grip on his people. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=36.32s)]
*  If it's quiet, we suffer from discrimination, and if it's war, we suffer from rocket. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  That's not so nice to be in this situation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=48.04s)]
*  It's no win. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=52.8s)]
*  Just to lose. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=54.36s)]
*  You can't win. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=56.16s)]
*  The losses include 15 Bedouins killed in the October 7 attacks, and community leaders say [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=57.16s)]
*  seven more taken as hostages, including Samar Talanga, whose family says they came across [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=63.44s)]
*  this picture of him, which NBC cannot verify, on social media after he was captured. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=69.08s)]
*  For a month, we have been praying to God for him to return to us in good health. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=75.4s)]
*  We have not been able to sleep, eat or do anything. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=79.42s)]
*  This community, with so little struggling long before the war, now pushed to the edge [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=84.36s)]
*  wrapped in fear. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=89.36s)]
*  The war has been tough on everyone. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=92.2s)]
*  Yousef Otraj tells us his 10-year-old daughter Zanep has trouble speaking at times stammering [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=95.0s)]
*  and stuttering, others rambling incoherently. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=100.46s)]
*  The girl is not doing well. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=107.6s)]
*  She got scared and traumatized from the missiles that vibrate the whole area like an earthquake. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=109.04s)]
*  In a place that has no protection from Israel's Iron Dome, no warning sirens and no shelters. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=115.2s)]
*  After two missile strikes that killed four in this village, the Defense Ministry delivered [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=120.8s)]
*  these concrete drainage pipes to use as shelters for a hundred people here. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=125.8s)]
*  Like so much about their existence in this Israeli desert, the Bedouins say. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=132.3s)]
*  Too little. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=138.12s)]
*  Too late. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=139.12s)]
*  Jay Gray, NBC News, Negev, Israel. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKCguuLhKM&t=140.12s)]
