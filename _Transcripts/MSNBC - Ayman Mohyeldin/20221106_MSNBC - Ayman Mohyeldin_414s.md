# How Far-Right Rhetoric Can Lead To Real-World Violence
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E)
*  State Senator McMorrow, thank you so much for making time for us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=0.0s)]
*  It's great to see you again. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=5.72s)]
*  Earlier this year, you went viral for hitting back at one of your Republican colleagues [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=6.72s)]
*  after they accused you of wanting to groom and sexualize children. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  During that experience, were you ever afraid that the extremist rhetoric against you could [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  lead to the kind of violence we're talking about? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Of course, and this is the moment that we're living in right now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=27.2s)]
*  I have friends who moved from D.C. to Michigan, and when they saw this language about grooming [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  and pedophilia, a language that's straight out of QAnon, they were worried that something [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=36.2s)]
*  like the Comet Ping Pong event would happen to me. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=40.8s)]
*  Their worry was that somebody would come over to my house with a gun and start shooting. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=44.4s)]
*  And it has kept going. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=49.16s)]
*  We have Matt DiPerno, who's the Republican candidate for attorney general, accusing our [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=50.72s)]
*  attorney general, Dana Nessel, of being a groomer and using this anti-Semitic, hate-filled [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=56.46s)]
*  language knowing that they are stoking the flames and keeping it going because it's a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  political strategy that's winning for them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=67.58s)]
*  Conservatives have also, to a smaller degree, been the subject of attacks. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=72.18s)]
*  Most recently, a man was arrested outside of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home after making [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=75.58s)]
*  threats. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=80.18s)]
*  Yet, Democrats immediately condemned that attack. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=81.18s)]
*  They approved increased spending for the justices' security. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=83.62s)]
*  The reaction to it is very different than what we're seeing come out of the Republicans. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=87.86s)]
*  Why are we not seeing the same kind of united reaction from Republicans and the leadership [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  of the Republican Party following the attack on Paul Pelosi? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=97.98s)]
*  You know, if I had that answer, I think we'd be in a much better place. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=101.54s)]
*  But the reality is we have three days left to prove them wrong because whether we know [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  why they're doing it or not, they're doing it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=112.5s)]
*  And they're doing it because it's the tone that Donald Trump set that you have to align [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=115.1s)]
*  yourself with people who are violent, with hate groups, with anti-government extremists, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=120.13999999999999s)]
*  and toying with that ability to carry out violent acts because that's what the base [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=125.86s)]
*  wants. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  And they're afraid of turning against that base. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  So we don't fight back with violence. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=133.82s)]
*  We fight back with votes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=136.34s)]
*  And it's really easy to feel like we can't, to feel like it's helpless. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=137.66s)]
*  They're trying to wear us down until we quit. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=142.1s)]
*  But we can't quit. Not now when we're so close to Election Day. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  There was this new Washington Post poll that found 88 percent of Americans are concerned [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=149.02s)]
*  about politically motivated acts of violence. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=153.58s)]
*  As you mentioned, with just days to go until an election, what's your reaction to that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=157.62s)]
*  number? What scares you the most in these final days? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=162.66s)]
*  It doesn't surprise me at all. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=167.02s)]
*  It's what I hear on the ground when I'm talking to constituents. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=168.54s)]
*  It's what I hear with my colleagues. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=172.3s)]
*  We are a state that is run by three women at the top of our ticket with Gretchen Whitmer, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=174.26s)]
*  Jocelyn Benson and Dana Nessel. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=179.58s)]
*  And we're the state that had the plot to kidnap and potentially kill the governor, carry out [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=182.02s)]
*  public executions of elected officials on our state Capitol. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=186.62s)]
*  It's real and it's real at home. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=189.54s)]
*  And it is scary. It's scary for a lot of people and a lot of families. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=192.82s)]
*  We had a really horrific event outside of the political arena of a dad in Oakland County [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=196.74s)]
*  who was radicalized by QAnon, shot and killed his wife, tried to kill a daughter, and it's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=202.94s)]
*  really spilling out into real life. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=208.82s)]
*  So there's this sense here on the ground in Michigan that we have to win and beat back [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=211.06s)]
*  this really ugly, violent turn that the modern GOP has taken. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=216.70000000000002s)]
*  Let me shift gears for a moment, if I can, and talk about Michigan. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=221.06s)]
*  Abortion is literally on the ballot this Tuesday. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=225.54000000000002s)]
*  Voters will decide whether to codify the right to an abortion into the state's Constitution. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=229.02s)]
*  How do you expect that vote to go? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  What how do you see it playing out right now? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=236.10000000000002s)]
*  You know the lay of the land better than I do. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=238.02s)]
*  I do, and it has been incredible to see the energy on the ground here maintained. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=240.94s)]
*  I know that there's a lot of hand-hanging around the country right now about Democrats on this issue, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=246.26000000000002s)]
*  but I know that there are people who are turning out specifically to vote for Prop 3 and then [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=251.10000000000002s)]
*  asking who are the candidates that support their will on the ballot. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=256.94s)]
*  It is really incredible how motivated people are. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  We know that around two thirds of Michiganders wanted to keep row, didn't want to see it [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=263.58s)]
*  overturned. And there's a sense of excitement, frankly, that we have the ability as a state [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=268.54s)]
*  to put this into our state Constitution and protect this right once and for all. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=276.02s)]
*  This year Democrats' best chance at flipping a state legislator actually lies in your state, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=280.18s)]
*  in Michigan. Your party hasn't had a majority in the House since 2010 or in the Senate since 1984, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=287.14s)]
*  but this year both are considered toss-ups. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=292.34s)]
*  What would Democratic control mean for the people of Michigan? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=296.41999999999996s)]
*  It's incredible. I mean you mentioned it, the state Senate where I serve hasn't been [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=300.74s)]
*  under Democratic control since 1984, which is slightly longer than I've been alive. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=304.82s)]
*  So there's 40 years of an agenda that we're ready to enact, protecting the right to vote, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=309.62s)]
*  protecting the LGBTQ community, repealing our 1931 abortion ban, even if this passes [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=315.86s)]
*  into the state Constitution to make sure it's protected in the statute as well, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=322.18s)]
*  fully funding our education. This is the home of Betsy DeVos, so making sure we do not go to a [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=326.1s)]
*  privatized education system and ensure that this is a state that has opportunity for everybody. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=331.3s)]
*  There's so much good work we can do to keep the state moving forward, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=336.98s)]
*  and we're really excited about the possibility. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=340.98s)]
*  We were saying at the top of the hour we're less than 72 hours from the closing of the polls. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=343.22s)]
*  What is your closing message to the voters as we enter the final days of the election? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  Just keep going. Get off of Twitter, especially right now. Get off of the news. I know that it's [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=353.54s)]
*  really easy just to feel hopeless, but I've been at more than a dozen [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=358.58s)]
*  Canvas kickoffs and events over the past few days, and the energy is really exciting. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=362.58s)]
*  It's going to make you feel good to get out there and vote, make a few phone calls, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  volunteer at Canvas, and we're going to have so much good work to celebrate after Election Day. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=371.06s)]
*  Get off the news, but just finish this hour and then get off the news, right? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=376.74s)]
*  Finish this hour and then find volunteering opportunity. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=380.02s)]
*  All right. Michigan State Senator Mallory McMar. Thank you so much. Always a pleasure. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=383.53999999999996s)]
*  Thanks, Eamon. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjd3MbmY4E&t=387.38s)]
