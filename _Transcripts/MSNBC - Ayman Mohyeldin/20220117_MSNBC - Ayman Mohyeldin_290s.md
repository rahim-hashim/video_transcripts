Video Description: Almost six decades ago, Martin Luther King Jr. warned about the dangers of the filibuster. This week, Democrats latest attempt at voting rights legislation is almost certain to fail, as Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) show no signs of waiving on their support for the filibuster. MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin examines how “lukewarm” liberalism is damaging democracy.

# U.S. Marks Martin Luther King Jr. Day, As Battle Over Voting Rights Continues
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U)
*  Could the U.S. government be training its own insurrectionists? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=0.0s)]
*  On Thursday, the Department of Justice charged 11 members of the Oath Keepers, a far-right [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=5.08s)]
*  militia group, with seditious conspiracy for their role in the January 6 attack. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=9.32s)]
*  Now, inside those indictment documents are new details on how the militia group used [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=13.88s)]
*  military skills to advance their extremist plots. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=19.82s)]
*  Here, you can see a group using a formation known as Ranger File. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=22.8s)]
*  It's a standard procedure combat teams use as they prepare to breach a building, and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=28.4s)]
*  it's instantly recognizable to any soldier or Marine who has served. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=33.48s)]
*  Looking at that level of coordination, it's frightening to see just how close we came [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  to a coup. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=42.32s)]
*  And a year later, our democracy remains at risk. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=43.32s)]
*  Today, that risk isn't from a group of men making their way up the Capitol steps, but [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=47.0s)]
*  from a coordinated nationwide attack on voting rights in this country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=51.4s)]
*  Tomorrow, the U.S. will mark Martin Luther King Jr. Day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=56.28s)]
*  Every year, we celebrate the life, work and legacy of the civil rights giant. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=59.32s)]
*  But tonight, on the heels of yet another federal voting rights failure, I want to play these [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=64.0s)]
*  words from King in 1963. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=68.92s)]
*  I think the tragedy is that we have a Congress with a Senate that has a minority of misguided [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=71.44s)]
*  senators who will use the filibuster to keep the majority of people from even voting. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=83.48s)]
*  They won't let the majority of senators vote. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=89.04s)]
*  And certainly, they wouldn't want the majority of people to vote because they know they do [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=91.68s)]
*  not represent the majority of the American people. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=95.12s)]
*  Now, that tragedy King spoke of almost six decades ago is still plaguing our country [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=99.12s)]
*  today almost down to a word. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=105.4s)]
*  This weekend, King's family rallied in Arizona, pushed for voting rights. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=108.62s)]
*  The home state of the filibuster in chief, Senator Kristen Sinema. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  Their King's son, MLK III, poked holes in Sinema's reasoning for protecting the antiquated tactic. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  What is being done in all of these states, it's about the filibuster. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  And yet every last one of these states that have passed these regressive laws have done [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=128.88s)]
*  it with all Republican legislators, not bipartisan. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  So that to me seems to be not a sufficient argument. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=136.96s)]
*  And he's right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=142.24s)]
*  Republicans across the country have launched a partisan all out assault on voting rights. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=143.04s)]
*  In 2021 alone, look at this, 19 states passing 34 laws that to some extent restrict access [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=148.16s)]
*  to voting in this country. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=155.36s)]
*  And there's more. Right now, at least 163 Republicans who have embraced Trump's big lie [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=156.72s)]
*  are running for statewide positions. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=161.6s)]
*  And those positions would give them authority over the administration of elections in this country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=163.72s)]
*  So what are Democrats? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=169.84s)]
*  The party that actually holds power and control in Washington at the moment, what are they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=171.16s)]
*  doing to counter this assault on our democracy? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's put it up on the screen for you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=178.88s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=181.32s)]
*  Literally nothing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=182.56s)]
*  On the federal level, no concrete action has been taken to protect voting rights in America. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=184.24s)]
*  That's because two, I'll use King's words here, misguided senators, two misguided senators [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=190.16s)]
*  would rather protect the filibuster than protect the right to vote. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=196.88s)]
*  And in 1957, Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=201.28s)]
*  speech, he delivered one of his major thoughts titled Give us the ballot. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=204.24s)]
*  And in that speech, King called out what he described as a sort of quasi liberalism, which [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=209.32s)]
*  he said was based on the principle of looking sympathetically at all sides. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=214.44s)]
*  Quote, it is a liberalism so bent on seeing all sides that it fails to become committed [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  to either side. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=226.0s)]
*  It is a liberalism that is so objectively analytical that it is not subjectively committed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=227.44s)]
*  It is a liberalism which is neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=233.4s)]
*  And it's that lukewarm liberalism King warned about in 1957 that is infecting our country [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=238.44s)]
*  today. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=244.52s)]
*  Make no mistake about it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=245.72s)]
*  Senators Manchin and Sinema are so committed to this all sides nonsense that they're standing [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=247.04s)]
*  idly by as GOP-led state legislators carry out an assault on our democracy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=252.72s)]
*  And if there's anyone in this country who thinks that Republicans in Congress are going [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=258.4s)]
*  to sign on to a bipartisan watered down voting rights bill, call me. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=263.0s)]
*  I have a bridge to sell you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjIlaPJP8U&t=268.15999999999997s)]
