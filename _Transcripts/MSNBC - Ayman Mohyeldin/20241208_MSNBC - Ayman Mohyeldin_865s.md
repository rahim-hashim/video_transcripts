# Maddow: Trump's family separation policy was 'chaotic, intentionally cruel mess'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM)
*  Back as promised with my friend and colleague Rachel Matta as we count down to the documentary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=0.0s)]
*  separated right here on MSNBC. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Rachel, it is great to have you on the show. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=6.46s)]
*  Of course, we wanted to get you on ahead of tonight's film because I think you have reporting [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  on the actions that helped stop the cruelty that has been the focus of this for several [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=14.3s)]
*  years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=19.06s)]
*  Walk us through it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=20.06s)]
*  Amy, first of all, thanks very much for having me. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=21.06s)]
*  I appreciate getting some of your real estate on your show here on Saturday night. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=23.54s)]
*  I'm really grateful to be here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=27.66s)]
*  I've also just been really excited for a long time that we are finally now premiering this [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  new documentary separated. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=33.92s)]
*  I think most folks watching at home may have heard something about this film. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=36.0s)]
*  You should know that it is by America's most celebrated living documentary filmmaker. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=40.6s)]
*  This film was made by Academy Award winning master of the genre, Errol Morris. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=46.64s)]
*  Any Errol Morris film on any subject you should see. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=52.6s)]
*  This one though is really, it's really important. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=55.46s)]
*  It's really something it's been showing in theaters and sold out screenings all over [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=58.3s)]
*  the country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=61.32s)]
*  It's aired at big film festivals like Venice and Telluride. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=62.32s)]
*  But tonight it is here on MSNBC. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=66.64s)]
*  And there's a couple things I just I think folks should should keep in mind in terms [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=70.3s)]
*  of this current moment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=75.02s)]
*  When you watch separated tonight, it's going to start just a few minutes from now. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  But I think the first thing to keep in mind is that this is not a done story. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=81.46s)]
*  It is not over. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=84.84s)]
*  MSNBC viewers are probably familiar with the basic fact that in the first Trump administration [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=86.14s)]
*  in 2017, 2018, they took somewhere between 4500 and 5000 kids away from their parents [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=92.14s)]
*  before a court ordered them to stop doing it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=101.06s)]
*  And one of the heroes of the film, who you will see when we show the film tonight, again, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  it's about 20 minutes from now it starts. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=108.5s)]
*  One of the heroes is Lee Gellert from the ACLU. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=110.62s)]
*  He brought the class action lawsuit that shut down the policy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  And that itself is an incredible story. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=116.84s)]
*  In advance of the film premiering here tonight on MSNBC, we spoke with Lee Gellert this week. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=119.64s)]
*  He stressed to us that although the policy was stopped by the courts in the first Trump [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  term, the effect of what the policy did still has not been fixed. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  There are still families that the government never managed to put back together after U.S. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=133.56s)]
*  government officials forced them apart. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  We can't be totally sure to a one. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=141.33999999999997s)]
*  And that's because the policy was such a mess. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=148.54s)]
*  It was such a chaotic and intentionally cruel mess. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=152.06s)]
*  And so that's, I think, one thing to keep in mind. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=156.5s)]
*  Now that Trump has been reelected, I think sometimes people talk about their expectations [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=160.38s)]
*  for a second Trump term. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=164.06s)]
*  You'll hear people say things like, oh, maybe one of the things that might mitigate the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  worst potential harm and damage is that at least in the first Trump term, we saw things [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=170.82s)]
*  were pretty shambolic. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, you hear people argue this all the time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  Whatever their intentions, they just weren't that good at doing any of the things they [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=179.6s)]
*  wanted to do. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=182.6s)]
*  And conceptually, I get that that makes sense, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  If somebody's coming after you, you want them to be tripping on their untied shoelaces [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=186.64s)]
*  or forgetting their keys or whatever. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=190.32s)]
*  But in real life in the government, the shambolic and disorganized nature of the Trump administration [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=193.6s)]
*  policy to take kids away from their parents, specifically their disorganization, their [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=200.24s)]
*  messy incompetence, didn't make things better. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  It made things profoundly worse for so many of these families. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=208.96s)]
*  It made it so that today, still in 2024, some kids have not been reunited with the parents [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=212.62s)]
*  from whom they were stolen. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=218.58s)]
*  So that's one thing to know in watching Separated Tonight. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=222.08s)]
*  The problem caused here, still an ongoing problem for some families. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  The other thing to know about Separated is that to the extent that the government has [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=229.48s)]
*  been able to reunify kids with their parents, it's because there were some heroes in this [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=234.32s)]
*  story. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  And it wasn't just outside lawyers like League Alert, who stopped the policy thanks to the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  courts. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=245.16s)]
*  It was also some people inside the government, career civil servants, who realized what was [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=246.54s)]
*  happening at the time. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=251.88s)]
*  And these were not people who felt like they had the capacity to stop the Trump administration's [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=252.88s)]
*  policy overall. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=257.34s)]
*  But they did mitigate it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=259.7s)]
*  They did come up with ways, for example, to track the kids who had been taken away from [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  their parents. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=265.97999999999996s)]
*  And they did this even when their bosses didn't want them to. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=267.38s)]
*  While the policy was still in effect, what those civil servants did, among other things, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  it made it possible for the public to see what was happening and to demand that it stop. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=275.73999999999995s)]
*  This, for example, was on the front page of The New York Times, April 2018. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=280.29999999999995s)]
*  You see the headline there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=285.05999999999995s)]
*  Hundreds of immigrant children have been taken from parents at U.S. border. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=286.18s)]
*  Caitlin Dickerson reporting for The New York Times. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=290.86s)]
*  Her report said, quote, officials have repeatedly declined to provide data on how many families [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=293.1s)]
*  have been separated, but suggested that the number was relatively low. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=298.62s)]
*  New data revealed by The New York Times, however, shows that more than 700 children have been [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=302.94s)]
*  taken from adults claiming to be their parents since October, including more than 100 kids [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=307.46s)]
*  under the age of four. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=312.82s)]
*  The data was prepared by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of the Department [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  of Health and Human Services that takes custody of children who have been removed from migrant [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=319.82s)]
*  parents. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=324.7s)]
*  Senior officials at Homeland Security initially denied that the numbers were so high. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=325.7s)]
*  But after the numbers were confirmed to The New York Times by three federal officials [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=330.66s)]
*  who worked closely with these cases, a spokesman for Health and Human Services on Friday acknowledged [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=335.02s)]
*  in a statement that there were, quote, approximately 700. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=340.02s)]
*  So, of course, now we know it was much more than 700 kids. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=346.94s)]
*  It was thousands of kids. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=352.02s)]
*  But when that story broke in The New York Times in April 2018, that was the truth beginning [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=353.38s)]
*  to emerge. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=360.74s)]
*  And the reason that much truth was able to emerge was because despite the shambolic and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=361.82s)]
*  incompetent nature of the Trump administration generally and around this policy specifically, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=366.86s)]
*  there were some people, some career civil servants, professionals working inside the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  government who made sure they made lists of some of the kids to whom this was happening. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=378.7s)]
*  And as civil servants, they were supposed to do that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=385.54s)]
*  But Trump's horrific and morally repugnant policy kind of depended on them not doing [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=388.86s)]
*  it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=393.5s)]
*  We know that because we know what happened when the boss of these civil servants found [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=394.7s)]
*  out that they were keeping lists. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  There was a Trump political appointee whose actions are documented in detail in Jacob [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=402.86s)]
*  Soboroff's book Separated, on which the film is based. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=407.94s)]
*  And in the book, Soboroff reports that what that boss, that political appointee, did when [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=411.18s)]
*  he learned that civil servants were keeping lists of the separated kids. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=417.14s)]
*  Well, Scott Lloyd's first thought was a drastic one. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=421.62s)]
*  Let's get rid of the list. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=425.7s)]
*  If he followed the idea through, it would destroy the critical linkage between the 700 [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=428.42s)]
*  separated children in his custody and their parents. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=433.26s)]
*  The list was the best hope of reuniting them. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=436.21999999999997s)]
*  This list, this critical list compiled by career staff inside the government, ended [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=441.38s)]
*  up being key to 700 families being made whole, right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=447.94s)]
*  This was a civil servant. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=452.02s)]
*  His colleagues referred to this list as Jim's List because his name was Jim. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=453.42s)]
*  You will hear that in the movie tonight, Jim's List, this list that would allow these kids [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=457.9s)]
*  to ever be given back to their parents. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=461.98s)]
*  That list, Jim's List, is what Scott Lloyd, the Trump appointee, wanted to get rid of. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=464.82s)]
*  And unbelievably, in the film you're about to see here tonight on MSNBC, Scott Lloyd, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=469.86s)]
*  the Trump appointee, talks at length and on camera to Director Errol Morris. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=475.54s)]
*  Whether he agreed to talk to Errol Morris out of shame or in defense or because he didn't [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=480.42s)]
*  know how he would sound in his interviews, I can't say you will want to judge for yourself. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=485.58000000000004s)]
*  It's a remarkable thing to see. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=490.18s)]
*  But in terms of how this worked out in real time, the fact that there weren't just Scott [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=494.06s)]
*  Lloyds around, there weren't just Trump political appointees, there were career civil servants, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=499.5s)]
*  that ends up being critically important over and over again. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=504.92s)]
*  For example, when this news about this policy started to emerge in 2018, Scott Lloyd and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=507.88s)]
*  his boss floated the idea that the government should record just numbers of kids taken away [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=512.7s)]
*  from their parents and they should specifically not record any identifying details about who [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=518.04s)]
*  the kids were or how their parents could be found again. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=522.76s)]
*  And they brought this concept to a career staffer, one who you will meet in the documentary [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=525.16s)]
*  tonight from Jacob Soboroff's book. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=531.38s)]
*  Quote, Jalen Sewalog, who has a master's degree in clinical psychology and 20 years of child [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=532.78s)]
*  welfare experience, knew she never could or would let that happen because of the consequences. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=537.24s)]
*  So she said as little as possible to her boss. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=544.18s)]
*  She said, quote, okay, I'll see what I can do. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=547.16s)]
*  But then rather than getting rid of the list, she talked to her colleague, she talked to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=550.7s)]
*  list keeper Jim from Jim's List, and she told Jim what the bosses wanted to do with the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=555.46s)]
*  list he had been compiling. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=561.1s)]
*  Quote, if Scott Lloyd expected Sewalog to instruct Jim to stop keeping the list, she [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=563.1s)]
*  never did. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=568.5s)]
*  Nor did Jim do anything of the sort. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=569.5s)]
*  On the contrary, he continued adding to it as the number of separated children rapidly [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  grew. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=576.26s)]
*  So Jim's List, which started at dozens, went to hundreds, ultimately thousands of entries. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=579.26s)]
*  That would end up being all that stood between many of those kids and the abyss. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=586.06s)]
*  And it was career staffers who kept that list alive against the wishes of Trump's political [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=590.9399999999999s)]
*  appointees. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=596.54s)]
*  And importantly, those career staffers also kept their jobs. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=597.54s)]
*  And that's important because it meant they could keep doing this work, this work that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=603.62s)]
*  we now know saved some of these families. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=607.3s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=613.26s)]
*  I mean, today we're on the verge of a second Trump administration. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=614.74s)]
*  That outcome of the career civil servants keeping the list, that outcome would be far [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=618.66s)]
*  from assured. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=622.34s)]
*  Trump is returning to power now with new promises, not just to put millions of people in camps [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=623.64s)]
*  in the United States, not just promising mass deportations, but also Trump promising to [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=629.1s)]
*  take a chainsaw to the federal workforce to get all the career staff professionals [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=634.46s)]
*  out of government. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=639.62s)]
*  Trump appointees have pledged that they're going to fire half of all government workers [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=641.3000000000001s)]
*  instantly. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=645.5s)]
*  They've been bragging about, quote, deleting whole parts of the government. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=646.5s)]
*  Trump himself has promised he's going to dismantle and shatter what he and his people call the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=650.22s)]
*  deep state, which just means the government. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=654.74s)]
*  He wants to reclassify career civil servants under something called Schedule F. And while [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=658.26s)]
*  that is the world's most boring terminology, what it means in real life is it would clear [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=665.3s)]
*  the way for Trump to fire tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people who are [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=668.78s)]
*  career professionals who work for the government. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=672.9799999999999s)]
*  Schedule F would have affected people like Jaylen Sewellog, who protected the list of [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=675.66s)]
*  separated kids in 2018 because she knew what would happen if that list were destroyed. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=679.6999999999999s)]
*  Sewellog works in the private sector now, but she told us this week in advance of the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=687.6999999999999s)]
*  film premiering tonight on MSNBC, she told us this week that her friends at her old job [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=691.86s)]
*  are really afraid, not so much about losing their jobs, although that's a very reasonable [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=696.5799999999999s)]
*  fear. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=700.42s)]
*  She says they're worried about what would happen in another circumstance like this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=701.42s)]
*  Who would be there to do something like protecting that list of kids? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=705.66s)]
*  In advance of the film premiering tonight here on MSNBC, Ms. Sewellog told us this week, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=712.14s)]
*  quote, we were mission focused and we knew what our job was. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=716.54s)]
*  Had we not had the protections, meaning civil servant job protections, I'm not sure you [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=719.18s)]
*  would still do it knowing you'd be fired on the spot. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=724.54s)]
*  The world would be different had Schedule F been in place. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=727.42s)]
*  When I say that the story you're going to see tonight, it's separated, is not over. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=731.18s)]
*  Part of what I mean by that is the thousands of families who are torn apart. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=738.18s)]
*  There are still efforts underway to fix that now. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=742.78s)]
*  It was only late last year that the Biden administration reached a settlement with the [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=745.78s)]
*  ACLU to, among other things, try to reunite all the remaining families who had their kids [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=750.26s)]
*  taken away. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=755.8199999999999s)]
*  That settlement is in effect still, and it will stay in effect under the new administration. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=758.98s)]
*  The job of fulfilling that settlement will now go back to the same president, Donald [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=763.8199999999999s)]
*  Trump, who created this mess deliberately in the first place. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=767.6999999999999s)]
*  But it will also go to his political appointees and to career professional staff in the government [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=771.86s)]
*  who will try to carry on with the work of the country, regardless of who is in the White [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=778.58s)]
*  House. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=782.38s)]
*  ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt told us this week, quote, the role played by the government employees [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=783.38s)]
*  was absolutely critical in ensuring that we could reunify thousands of families. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=788.9000000000001s)]
*  I think my job will become much more difficult going forward if these types of courageous [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=793.62s)]
*  civil servants are no longer there or they are too scared to speak up under the incoming [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=798.3s)]
*  administration. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=803.0999999999999s)]
*  Among was essentially hijacked and white career officer in the U.S. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=807.0999999999999s)]
*  Public Health Service at great risk to himself. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=812.9799999999999s)]
*  Captain Jonathan White has spoken out about family separation before Congress and in this [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=816.06s)]
*  film, Captain Jonathan White still serves in the government tonight. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=821.5s)]
*  Still at risk, still trying to help. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=826.0999999999999s)]
*  But how long will that be true? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=828.8199999999999s)]
*  And what is it going to take for the country to stand up for civil servants like him not [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=830.26s)]
*  being fired, not being removed from every one of these jobs? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=835.42s)]
*  That is worth appreciating tonight. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=839.3s)]
*  That may be next steps here when you watch this film. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=842.5799999999999s)]
*  Amen. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLdTIpEEmM&t=844.78s)]
