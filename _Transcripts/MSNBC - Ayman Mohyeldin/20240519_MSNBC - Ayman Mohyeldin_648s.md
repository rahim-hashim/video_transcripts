# Rep. Jamaal Bowman on being AIPAC’s top target
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk)
*  Why has a primary race in one of the country's safest congressional districts garnered national [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=0.0s)]
*  attention all of a sudden? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  For decades, Oregon's third district, which includes much of Portland, has been represented [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=8.02s)]
*  by this man, Democratic Congressman Earl Blumenauer. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=13.1s)]
*  Last year, Blumenauer announced his plans to retire, setting up a race for his replacement. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=17.46s)]
*  And Oregon's third district is in solid Democratic territory, meaning whoever wins next week's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=22.18s)]
*  primary will certainly likely cruise to victory in November. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=26.9s)]
*  And for much of the race, Sushila Jayapal, the former Multnomah County Commissioner and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=31.84s)]
*  sister of Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, has been the clear frontrunner. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=37.68s)]
*  However, over the last few weeks, things have actually shifted, with millions of dollars, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=41.6s)]
*  certainly of dark money dollars, pouring into this race in support of Jayapal's opponent, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=46.78s)]
*  Maxine Dexter, a state representative and a local doctor. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=51.96s)]
*  Much of that money came from 314 Action Fund, a group that says it is on a mission to elect [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=56.52s)]
*  more scientists into office. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  So far, 314 Action has spent almost $2 million in support of Dexter, equal to what the PAC [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=65.54s)]
*  spent on candidates during the entire—yes, the entire—2022 election cycle. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=72.58s)]
*  And since 314 Action waited until April for this last-minute spending blitz, they've [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=78.48s)]
*  actually been able to delay disclosing the group's donors until May 20th, just one [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=84.24s)]
*  day before the election. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=89.08s)]
*  And it's important to keep in mind that in Oregon, since Oregon votes—Oregonians [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=91.96s)]
*  vote by mail—many of the votes will actually be cast ahead of that deadline. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=96.44s)]
*  However, thanks to new reporting from The Intercept, we now know exactly who is behind [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=101.0s)]
*  this effort. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=105.69999999999999s)]
*  According to two sources familiar with the arrangement, the American Israel Public Affairs [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=106.69999999999999s)]
*  committee, also known as AIPAC, has been secretly funneling money into the race through 314 Action. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=111.64s)]
*  It is a move intended to directly target Jayapal, who has called for a ceasefire in Israel's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=118.24s)]
*  war on Gaza, and it's part of a much larger effort from the pro-Israel lobby. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=122.56s)]
*  In 2024 alone, AIPAC is threatening to spend $100 million against congressional candidates, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  primarily Democrats, that they deem as insufficiently supportive of Israel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  This week, the group secured its first major victory of the election season after state [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=139.56s)]
*  Senator Sarah Alfret won the crowded Democratic primary for Maryland's third congressional [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=143.56s)]
*  district. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=149.0s)]
*  Alfret benefited from more than $4 million in spending from another super PAC funded [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=150.0s)]
*  by AIPAC, giving her a last-minute leg up over her closest opponent, somebody that many [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=155.68s)]
*  people in this country know, former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=161.24s)]
*  Dunn had a far, far higher name ID and even secured an endorsement from former House Speaker [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=164.52s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=170.4s)]
*  But that was no match for AIPAC and its pack of Republican billionaire backers. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=172.4s)]
*  Alfret's win shows the sheer power of the group's influence and its growing kingmaker [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=177.12s)]
*  status, if you will, among Democratic politics. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=181.68s)]
*  And fresh off of that victory, AIPAC has already set sights on its next target, New York Democratic [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=185.08s)]
*  Congressman Jamal Bowman. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=189.84s)]
*  On Thursday, the group dropped nearly $2 million on attack ads against Bowman. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=191.56s)]
*  With that influx of funds and a challenger handpicked by AIPAC, it is no surprise that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=196.68s)]
*  New York Magazine has dubbed Bowman, quote, the most endangered Democrat in America. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Congressman Jamal Bowman joins me now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=208.16s)]
*  Congressman, it's great to have you back on the show. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=209.96s)]
*  Thank you so much for making it here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=212.08s)]
*  So let me just get your reaction. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=214.36s)]
*  I want to kind of mention a little bit of this ad. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=216.0s)]
*  I mean, there's an interesting dynamic that is playing here, because AIPAC obviously wants [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=219.4s)]
*  to strengthen the American-Israel relationship. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=223.6s)]
*  They want politicians who believe in that relationship. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=226.72s)]
*  And notably, the ads that they are running against you and others make no mention of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=229.76s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=234.72s)]
*  In fact, in this Politico article, someone, a spokesperson for the PAC told Politico, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=235.72s)]
*  "...we run ads on the issues voters are most focused on." [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=239.4s)]
*  And yet, if this issue is not the issue that voters are focused on, that they're not even [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=243.32s)]
*  mentioning Israel, why are they going after you by primarying you and others who are apparently [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=247.84s)]
*  more pro-Israel, not even talking about it? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=255.36s)]
*  Yeah, because they don't want Israel to be criticized, they don't want Israel to be held [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=257.2s)]
*  accountable. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=261.32s)]
*  They don't want anyone to mention Palestine or speak up for Palestinian rights and lives. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=262.32s)]
*  We fight for the lives of all people, Israeli and Palestinians, Jewish, Christian, Muslim. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=267.0s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=272.36s)]
*  But the people in the district, they decide, we decide, as the people, who's going to govern [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=273.48s)]
*  this district and what issues matter most to us. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  And because they cannot, and AIPAC doesn't know the district, so they're literally trying [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=281.72s)]
*  to work with, they're funded by Republican right-wing racist billionaires, the same people [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=286.24s)]
*  who fund Donald Trump, the same people who are going after our voting rights, our reproductive [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=292.88s)]
*  rights. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=297.76s)]
*  Those are the people who fund AIPAC. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=298.76s)]
*  So they're literally coming in to black and brown communities, black and brown districts, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=300.04s)]
*  trying to buy racists from the people who live there. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=304.4s)]
*  And it's not going to work. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=308.16s)]
*  They don't know Co-op City, they don't know the Bronx, they don't know Mount Vernon, they [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=309.16s)]
*  don't know Yonkers, New Rochelle, Port Chester, White Plains, Greenberg, the River Towns. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=312.68s)]
*  They don't know these areas. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=317.84s)]
*  They try to bully their way into elections. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=319.08s)]
*  We beat their guy, Elliot Engel, in 2020, we're going to beat their guy in this race [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=322.24s)]
*  as well. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=326.76s)]
*  They're still backing people who are election deniers in other districts. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=327.76s)]
*  I mean, the consistency that they have is that for them, it is about Israel. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=330.4s)]
*  It is not about reproductive rights. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=333.76s)]
*  It's not about resources into these communities. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=335.32s)]
*  It's not about the integrity of American elections or the security of our elections, because [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=338.36s)]
*  they're all over the place. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=343.32s)]
*  They focus on this singular issue. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=344.52s)]
*  You say that is not an issue that people in your district care about, or something that's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=348.12s)]
*  going to work with the people in your district, this kind of like voting manipulation. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=352.4s)]
*  What do the people of your district care about? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=356.24s)]
*  And certainly, what do they care about when it comes to the issue of Israel and Gaza? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=357.92s)]
*  Correct. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=361.92s)]
*  So with regard to this issue, 69% of my district supports a permanent ceasefire. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=362.92s)]
*  69%. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=369.8s)]
*  The majority of the district, they don't want our taxpayer dollars and weapons and billions [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=371.04s)]
*  of dollars to go to Israel to bomb children and women and babies. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=376.64s)]
*  They want that money to come to their district so they can build affordable housing, have [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=380.6s)]
*  universal child care, universal pre-K, programs for kids, mental health supports, reducing [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=385.28s)]
*  gun violence, fighting climate change, fully funding our public schools. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=390.56s)]
*  That's what the people in the district want. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=394.52s)]
*  And APEC, to your point, their number one issue is Israel, but they pay to run ads on [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  other issues because they're an organization that lies to the American people. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=400.84s)]
*  And the people in my district, the ads just started running this week. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=406.0s)]
*  I was outside all day today. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=408.88s)]
*  They're frustrated by the ads. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=411.08s)]
*  They're pissed by the ads because they know I've done 10 years of deep work in the district [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  as a middle school principal. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=419.0s)]
*  The people know my record, and they know my record from when I first got to Congress and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=420.82s)]
*  brought in over a billion dollars to support the issues they care about. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  So they're upset that this group and my opponent are trying to be smirched by name and take [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  down my reputation. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  So their ads are not going to work. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=435.94s)]
*  Do you get the support that you need from the Democratic Party at a whole? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=437.47999999999996s)]
*  Because you think, at least for those of us on the outside, that somebody who is an incumbent [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=440.82s)]
*  like you, somebody with a track record, should have at least some party, institutional party [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=444.3s)]
*  support and not allow you to get attacked by an outside lobbying group like APEC. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=449.5s)]
*  So we're endorsed by Hakeem Jeffries, Leader Jeffries. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=455.6s)]
*  We're endorsed by Catherine Clark. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=458.02s)]
*  We're endorsed by Pete Aguilar, which is great. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=459.46s)]
*  Both are very, all three are very well regarded in the district, particularly Leader Jeffries. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=462.74s)]
*  We continue to remind voters that Leader Jeffries has endorsed us. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=468.09999999999997s)]
*  We're also endorsed by Planned Parenthood. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=472.0s)]
*  We're endorsed by All of Labor, DC 37, 1199, and Nurses. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=474.78s)]
*  So we have a diverse, multiracial, multiethnic, multi-background coalition supporting our campaign. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=479.4s)]
*  We have people, they have money. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=486.94s)]
*  And unfortunately, when you have money, you can lie, cheat, steal, bully your way to power, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=489.18s)]
*  which is what they've done for the last 60 years. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=494.5s)]
*  But the people ain't having it anymore. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=496.96s)]
*  Let me ask you about this report from The Washington Post, speaking of billionaires [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  and their influence. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=501.91999999999996s)]

*  in the wake of the October 7th attack. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=507.4s)]
*  According to that reporting last month, several of those billionaires pressed New York City [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=509.88s)]
*  Mayor Eric Adams to send police to disperse pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia universities. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=512.76s)]
*  Are these outsiders working to influence campus protests that Mayor Adams warned us about? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=519.12s)]
*  I mean, on one hand, this is a dangerous situation if you're thinking of the mayor being influenced [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=523.28s)]

*  This is big money in politics. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=542.56s)]
*  This is oligarchy. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=544.3399999999999s)]
*  This is exactly what we're trying to end in Congress and in the entire political arena. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=545.9s)]
*  This is my opponent taking more money from AIPAC than anyone else in the country. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=552.38s)]
*  This is big money in politics. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=556.86s)]
*  And big money is trying to withhold and maintain power because the people are resisting that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=558.6600000000001s)]
*  power and pushing back against that power. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=564.82s)]
*  Dr. King told us, fight back against capitalism, militarism, and racism. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=567.0600000000001s)]
*  That's exactly what's happening now in Gaza, at the border, as we try to deport Latino [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=572.52s)]
*  migrants with mass incarceration that's continuing with police brutality without any accountability. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=578.82s)]
*  The three things Dr. King told us to fight against, we are not doing it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=585.7s)]
*  We're not doing our job as elected officials if we're listening to what the corporate elite [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=589.5s)]
*  and the oligarchy and special interests are trying to control in our elections. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=593.94s)]
*  We don't govern for them. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=597.98s)]
*  We govern for the people. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=599.62s)]

*  resource in our country, reminding us of what happened during the civil rights movement [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=606.24s)]
*  that got us civil rights and voting rights. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=611.48s)]
*  It was protest, reminding us what happened during that time, what got us out of the Vietnam [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=614.16s)]
*  War. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=618.2s)]
*  They're trying to fight for peace and we should be supporting them. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNXJIH7mBk&t=619.2s)]
