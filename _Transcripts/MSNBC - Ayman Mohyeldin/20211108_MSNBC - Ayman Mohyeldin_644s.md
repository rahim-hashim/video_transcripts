Video Description: Georgia’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has written a new book detailing the January 4th phone call from Donald Trump where the then-president pressured Raffensperger to “find” him the votes to win. In the fallout from the 2020 election, Raffensperger refused to go along with Trump's big lie. By doing so, he became public enemy number one for Trump's supporters. However he’s still blaming both sides of the aisle for the trouble in Georgia. MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin challenged Brad Raffensperger over the differences between Trump and the Democrats.

# GA Secretary of State Called Out Over Attempts To Compare Trump, Stacey Abrams
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ)
*  Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger joins me now. Mr. Secretary of State, thank you so much for your time this evening. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And I wanted to start with that infamous phone call and in your book you say [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=6.28s)]
*  you felt then you still believe today that the former president threatened you and I know that prosecutors [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=10.24s)]
*  in Fulton County opened a criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the election results last February. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=16.32s)]
*  I know that you have not been interviewed for that investigation, but you have expressed a willingness to do so. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  If you tell investigators the same details that you've shared in your book that I've read, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=28.52s)]
*  do you believe that it is enough to charge the former president with criminal charges? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=32.84s)]
*  Well, good evening. Well, I'm a structural engineer and I know numbers, but I don't [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=39.92s)]
*  you know pretend to practice law. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=45.64s)]
*  So we'll let the lawyers decide on what that arises to or doesn't rise to. But I put the full [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=47.72s)]
*  one hour and 10 minute conversation in my book and then with my observations at various points [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=54.12s)]
*  because during that conversation with President Trump, I wanted to be respectful, but also let him know that he just did not win the state of Georgia. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  He said in that phone call that 5,000 dead people voted. There was actually less than five and we've run those numbers down. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=66.76s)]
*  They said there was thousands of felons that voted, but there's less than 74. They said 66,000 underage voters. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=73.16s)]
*  There weren't a single one. And so point by point, we responded to all that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=79.88s)]
*  And actually on January 6th, I was writing a letter with my general counsel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=84.52s)]
*  We got it up to our congressmen and women and also our senator and rebutted every single allegation that was made [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  post-election. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=98.12s)]
*  I know that earlier this year you blamed, quote, both sides for tolerating a climate of violence that has in part led to death threats against [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=99.96s)]
*  election officials and against you and your own family. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=108.36s)]
*  The people who stormed the Capitol on January 6th, to be clear, and forced you to evacuate your own office on that same day in Georgia, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=111.96s)]
*  they were not people from both sides, sir. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=119.96s)]
*  The few congressional Republicans who have spoken out against the president like you have [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  have either been stripped of leadership positions or they've retired because they don't feel that they can win primaries. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=127.16s)]
*  How do you justify remaining a Republican in a party that punished those who don't embrace Trump's big lie? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=133.88s)]
*  Well, first off, I back to blue, so I don't support any violence against law enforcement, be it the Capitol or out in Portland. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=141.4s)]
*  But as it relates to the election process, I want to make sure that we have fair and honest elections that we fought hard to do that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=149.48s)]
*  But we've been fighting this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=155.56s)]
*  narrative of stolen election claims from both Stacey Abrams and President Trump. He just ramped it up the whole hot [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=157.64s)]
*  higher level, but she really set the platform. In fact, many of Trump's court cases [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=163.16s)]
*  were almost word for word what Stacey Abrams people were [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=168.52s)]
*  alleging. Hers was voter suppression, his was voter fraud. Neither one of them were supported by the truth. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=171.94s)]
*  And the candidates, when they lose, they really need to learn how to lose gracefully. And if they want to run again, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  then that's their decision, but they have to really accept the will of the people when they do come up short. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=182.76s)]
*  I've been watching a lot of your interviews this week. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=188.44s)]
*  I've seen that you've been referencing Stacey Abrams, and so I anticipated that you were going to make that reference. And [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  for me, it just seems, you know, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  it's a bit of a stretch, to be honest with you. Stacey Abrams did not [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=199.16s)]
*  call you, did not threaten you, did not ask you to find votes. She did not call on her followers to storm [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  the Capitol. I know that you said that you've been [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=208.11999999999998s)]
*  that Donald Trump came along and ramped up [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=210.83999999999997s)]
*  the rhetoric that you say Stacey Abrams started. I want to just, if I can, play for you the reaction from Stacey Abrams [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=213.96s)]
*  and Donald Trump. Watch this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=221.56s)]
*  As I've always said, I acknowledged at the very beginning that I, that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=224.6s)]
*  Brian Kemp [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=230.04s)]
*  won under the rules that were in place. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=231.4s)]
*  What I object to are rules that permitted [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=234.12s)]
*  thousands of Georgia voters to be denied their participation in this election or to have their votes cast out. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=237.24s)]
*  And so I will continue to disagree with the system until it is fixed. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=243.16s)]
*  And let me play for you what Donald Trump said speaking to you in a phone call last December. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=248.76s)]
*  So look, all I want to do is this. I just want to find [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  11,780 [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=260.74s)]
*  votes, which is one more that we have, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=264.44s)]
*  because we won the state. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=267.72s)]
*  Again, to be clear, it was never Stacey Abrams' goal to overturn the election but change rules for future elections. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  And Trump asked you to quote, find votes to overturn the results. You do accept that difference, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=278.04s)]
*  You know what I do accept is that both of them know what they've done is really [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  under, try to undermine the legitimacy of the election process. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm sorry, that point of distinction though, if I can, sir, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=293.96s)]
*  if I can just make that point of distinction, you do acknowledge, you do acknowledge [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=299.23999999999995s)]
*  she's not asking to overturn the results of an election. You do acknowledge that, right? She's not asking to overturn the results of an election. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, what she said in her statement that she played was not based on [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=311.56s)]
*  anything that could be supported by facts. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=315.64s)]
*  And what she hit us with was nine lawsuits and we won every single one of those lawsuits. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=317.79999999999995s)]
*  Pushed back because they weren't supported by the facts. Just like with President Trump, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  he had all of his team had lawsuits and none of it was fact based. And so we kicked, it got kicked out in the court of law [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  and we prevailed in every single case. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  But what it does is it destabilizes and it really destroys voters trust in the election process. And that's not helpful for America. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=334.6s)]
*  Sorry, so the exact match lawsuit that Stacey Abrams has filed, that is still working its way through the courts, no? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=349.96s)]
*  No. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  What's working through the courts right now is actually going back to the old DRE machines. Right. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  But what I'm saying is her argument about claims in Georgia have still and are still working their way through legal [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  proceedings in Georgia. They're not resolved. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  Let me put this up for you on the screen just to show you because [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  if you look at what Donald Trump did on the day of his challenge to the results in Georgia, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  they were dismissed the very next day. Is that correct? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  Virtually the very next day in all cases. Yes. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=376.92s)]
*  Exactly. So there's a difference because when you look at what Stacey Abrams did, again, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  some of the things that she was arguing for in the state of Georgia actually worked their way through legal proceedings, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=384.6s)]
*  which I think you would concede is a normal process in elections that if you have a complaint, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  you have the legitimate right to pursue those challenges in legal courts. Is that not correct? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=395.24s)]
*  And we make sure that before we reach out to the courts, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=401.72s)]
*  before we reject anyone's in with the old rule with signature match that you actually would have a set of eyes other sets of eyes to review [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=405.8s)]
*  to make sure that the signature truly was them and then actually they give people an opportunity to cure that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  But that's one of the reasons we moved away from signature match because we've been sued by both the democrat party and the republican party of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=418.92s)]
*  signature match. We've gone to an objective measure that they've been using now [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  in Minnesota for over 10 years. Driver's license number and photo ID. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=429.32s)]
*  So it is something that the courts have essentially agreed with with Stacey Abrams that that was something that could have been done better. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=433.88s)]
*  Well, we're always looking at how to improve the process. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=442.68s)]
*  Right, but again, I go back to the point, sir, that you're making an equivalency and moral equivalency between Donald Trump and Stacey Abrams. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=445.24s)]
*  And I'm saying is that not part of the problem that you are trying to equate [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=450.84s)]
*  somebody who tried to overturn an election with somebody who's trying to improve an election? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=455.32s)]
*  And I just I'm surprised that you can't see the similarities. I'm sorry the differences between those two arguments. You think they're one in the same? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=460.36s)]
*  Well, Stacey Abrams in three weeks ago in Virginia said just because you win doesn't mean you won. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=468.44s)]
*  And so right there it really tells you she still hasn't conceded that she did lose. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=473.88s)]
*  And it's just really not helpful and really destabilizes society left or right. I think we really need to hold both sides accountable. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=478.2s)]
*  All right. Listen, I know a section of your book outlines why you had the strength to stand against all those attacks and misinformation. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  I know that you write your parents instilled values in, you know, you think it's important to have grit, honesty, courage, integrity, hard work, respect, loyalty, faithfulness, manners, perseverance. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=491.74s)]
*  Those are words that you used in your book just to button this up real quick. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=504.14s)]
*  I want to read a tweet you sent out last week after the Braves won the World Series. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=506.94s)]
*  You wrote, congrats to the Braves on becoming World Series champs. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  Let's hope Stacey Abrams accepts the results. Does that feel like good manners to you? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=514.7800000000001s)]
*  Is this all just a strategy to appeal to the base with the party that you're on the outs with? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=519.74s)]
*  I mean, I see that you're laughing, but quite honestly, you didn't go after Donald Trump. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=526.3000000000001s)]
*  You went after Stacey Abrams. Does that sound like good manners to you? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=529.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, every once in a while, it's fun to sweet people. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=534.0600000000001s)]
*  We lost probably, they say, $100 million. We lost the All-Star game, all based on untruths that she talked about when she talked about SB 202. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=538.06s)]
*  We actually increased the number of days early voting from 16 to 17. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=547.18s)]
*  So you don't think that was good manners is what I'm asking. I'm not asking you to talk about SB 202. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=552.14s)]
*  I mean, I understand what you're saying about SB 202. We can talk about that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=555.5799999999999s)]
*  And I don't mind getting into that, but I'm just asking, do you think that was good manners not to go after the president who tried to overturn the elections, but going after Stacey Abrams, who was trying to improve elections? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=558.38s)]
*  Well, she's used to really getting people questioning her resolve and her wisdom at some of her decisions. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=568.14s)]
*  And that was a little dry humor. And if you don't find it funny, well, perhaps you're just too serious about life. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=578.38s)]
*  It's not about whether I find it funny or not. I was just using your words. You said you cared about good manners. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=585.18s)]
*  And I was just asking if you thought that was good manners. So that's really what I was asking. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=591.42s)]
*  Well, when the left begins to really clean its house up and the right, it cleans up his house, that's really what needs to happen. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=595.58s)]
*  The left loves to talk about the right. And sometimes the right likes to talk about the left. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=603.4200000000001s)]
*  But we really need to clean up our house and we need to clean up your side of the aisle. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=607.34s)]
*  And then we can really start coming together and have honest conversations. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=610.86s)]
*  And when we don't have honest conversations and it's not building trust, nothing happens. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=614.46s)]
*  All right. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Rappensburg, we're going to have to leave it at that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=619.58s)]
*  Thank you so much, sir, for your time. I greatly appreciate it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=622.3000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QrLxIRhqQ&t=624.94s)]
