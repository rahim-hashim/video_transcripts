# Gov. Phil Murphy talks National Governors Association, New Jersey, & GOP priorities
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE)
*  Next week, President Biden will welcome governors from both parties to Washington, D.C., for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=0.0s)]
*  the NGA's winter meeting. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  New Jersey Governor and National Governor's Association Chair Phil Murphy is set to attend. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=9.52s)]
*  He'll have plenty to discuss with the president, including three tough races, election races [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=14.0s)]
*  taking place later this year. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=18.72s)]
*  I spoke with Governor Murphy earlier about those elections, his conversations with the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=21.0s)]
*  president, and much more. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=25.64s)]
*  Senator Phil Murphy, chair of the National Governors Association, sir, thank you so much [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=29.6s)]
*  for joining us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=33.56s)]
*  I wanted to actually start with your role leading the National Governors Association. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=34.88s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about what your priorities will be as you take over this position. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=40.2s)]
*  Yeah, good to be with you, Eamon. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=46.0s)]
*  The NGA is, I think, one of the few bipartisan organizations that actually get stuff done. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=48.92s)]
*  I can give you a bunch of examples, but one I think embodies this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=57.16s)]
*  When you're the chair, you get to pick an initiative that is supported by both sides [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=62.28s)]
*  of the aisle. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  And I became chair last July, and the initiative I chose was to strengthen mental health among [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=69.16s)]
*  our young people with broad support across the country from governors in all corners. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=75.0s)]
*  And then you go around the country during the year of your chairmanship, and you convene [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=82.36s)]
*  experts and other governors, stakeholders, and supporters to try to develop a playbook. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  And next July, we'll end up in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and we will have, God willing, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  a playbook for all states to feed off of in terms of how to deal with strengthening the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=99.0s)]
*  mental health of our kids, which have been so impaired over the past several years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=104.8s)]
*  So that's one example of many I could give you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=108.91999999999999s)]
*  And a very important one. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=111.84s)]
*  And I also know that you're the chair of the Democratic Governors Association and have [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=113.0s)]
*  a role in the elections on that front. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=117.36s)]
*  There are three major gubernatorial elections this year. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  Two of those seats are currently held by Democrats. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=123.52s)]
*  I know you have spoken about Governor Andy Beshear in Kentucky being one of the top priorities [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=127.24s)]
*  for you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  Talk about what you're hoping to do to get him re-elected in this traditionally very [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  red state. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=137.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=138.2s)]
*  So we've got three states up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=139.2s)]
*  We've got Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=140.76s)]
*  Andy Beshear in his re-election in Kentucky is priority number one. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=143.56s)]
*  He's done an amazing job. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=148.72s)]
*  He is broadly supported, including by a good chunk of Republicans. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=150.88s)]
*  And I think the reason is he's focused on issues that matter in Kentucky, kitchen table [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=155.04s)]
*  issues. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=160.4s)]
*  You look at the jobs he's brought. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=161.4s)]
*  Ford Motor Company, a great example. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=163.2s)]
*  He's also had to deal with some awful natural disasters. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=166.32s)]
*  Tornadoes, flooding, and he's been masterful in the face of real challenges. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=176.0s)]
*  John Bel Edwards in Louisiana is a great governor, but he's term limited. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=183.0s)]
*  So we're in the process of finding somebody to step into his shoes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=187.44s)]
*  That will be easy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=191.48s)]
*  But that's a state we've proven as a party we can win. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=193.6s)]
*  And I think we've got a real shot. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=196.44s)]
*  The sleeper for me is Mississippi, a very unpopular governor. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=198.24s)]
*  Our candidate is likely to be Brandon Presley, Elvis's cousin, statewide elected, a guy with [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=202.96s)]
*  a lot of credentials who speaks again to that kitchen table. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  So it's going to be an exciting year. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=212.56s)]
*  We'll be playing aggressively in all three of those states. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=214.4s)]
*  And of course, part of your role as the National Governor's Association chair is as a conduit. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=217.4s)]
*  If you will, between the White House and the governors of this country, you're set to meet [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=223.48s)]
*  with President Biden at the White House next week. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  What are you hoping to come out of that event? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=230.28s)]
*  Very excited about this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  This is our annual winter meeting. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  It's been a little bit sideways the past several years because of the pandemic. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=238.72s)]
*  But this is finally we're full on several days of meetings, including a half a day with [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=243.56s)]
*  senior cabinet officials and other senior administration officials in the White House, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=250.44s)]
*  dinner with the president and vice president and their first lady and second gentleman. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=255.56s)]
*  Listen, the president understands government probably unlike perhaps anybody else in this [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=260.76s)]
*  country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  And while he was not a governor, he's lived in our shoes in so many other respects. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  I was just with him this past week with Governor Hockel in New York, kicking off a huge piece [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=274.76s)]
*  of the Hudson tunnel projects that will finally update the tunnels under the Hudson River. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=281.64s)]
*  He's a guy who cares deeply. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=289.16s)]
*  He understands that governors really matter. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=291.48s)]
*  It's not either or, federal government or governors, but it's and both. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  He's been an incredible partner and as his administration over the past couple of years, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=299.36s)]
*  so much of what has gone through Congress that he signed has huge positive impact on [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=304.64s)]
*  states. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=310.8s)]
*  So it's going to be a chance, I think, to both acknowledge, celebrate on the one hand, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=311.8s)]
*  but also acknowledge we have a lot more work to do as a country and as governors. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=315.76s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about your state, the great state of New Jersey. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=321.64s)]
*  This week, a federal judge blocked part of your state's new gun carry law from being [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=324.96s)]
*  enforced, effectively, temporarily at least, lifting the blanket prohibition on carrying [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=329.28s)]
*  guns in public parks or beaches and casinos. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=334.09999999999997s)]
*  Give me a reaction to that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=337.4s)]
*  Is your administration prepared to fight this ruling? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=338.76s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=342.2s)]
*  My reaction would be not happy, but not surprised. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  We respected judiciary. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=348.96s)]
*  We don't agree with the conclusion and we will fight it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=350.5s)]
*  I promise you, you know, this is the concealed carry law that we very carefully structured [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=353.44s)]
*  with our legislature so that it fit into a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which, by the way, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=360.36s)]
*  we also don't agree with, but we accept that it's the law of the land. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=366.04s)]
*  I remain optimistic, and I'm happy to say that every casino in our state has affirmatively [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  said they will communicate that guns are not allowed on their premises, which you're allowed [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=376.92s)]
*  to do, by the way. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=382.62s)]
*  If you can, if it's a private property, you can communicate through signage, through other [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=383.62s)]
*  forms of communication. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  So if you're a casino, a bar, restaurant, not withstanding an adverse opinion from the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=390.94s)]
*  federal bench, you can still take your own steps to keep guns off your premises. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=396.14s)]
*  Of course, America is still reeling from the death of Tyree Nichols, another killing of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=402.64s)]
*  a black man at the hands of police. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=408.36s)]
*  Talk about the reforms that you have passed to tackle police use of force in your state [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=411.26000000000005s)]
*  and whether or not there is anything that can be learned from that experience nationwide. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=415.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we've done a lot, and I've said a lot since this awful, ugly tragedy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=420.26000000000005s)]
*  Tyree Nichols should be alive and well as we speak here. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  That at every tragic moment like this, we've looked in the mirror and asked ourselves, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=431.70000000000005s)]
*  can we learn? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=438.6s)]
*  Can we be better? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=439.6s)]
*  And we spent an enormous amount of time and energy on deepening the relations between [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=440.68s)]
*  law enforcement on the one hand and the communities they serve on the other. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=445.24s)]
*  So we were early on body cameras. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=449.48s)]
*  We now require members of law enforcement to be licensed. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=452.32000000000005s)]
*  We have an independent prosecutor law that I signed, meaning if there's a shooting in [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  some form involving a law enforcement officer or if there's a death of any kind, that automatically [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=463.16s)]
*  gets independently reviewed and it must end up in a grand jury. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=468.68s)]
*  We put out some very explicit guidance on use of force and updated that for the first [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  time in decades. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=481.24s)]
*  So we've taken a whole lot of steps. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  We're not perfect. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=485.68s)]
*  We remain on a journey. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=486.8s)]
*  But as you rightfully point out, when you see something awful like this, you've got to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=489.24s)]
*  look in the mirror and ask yourself, are there other steps you could take? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=493.96s)]
*  And we're doing that right now. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=497.32s)]
*  Let me get your thoughts on what is happening down south in Florida. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=499.96s)]
*  This week, the College Board announced that it had, in effect, watered down an advanced [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=503.11999999999995s)]
*  placement African-American studies course. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=508.35999999999996s)]
*  It came after the course was criticized by another governor, Republican Governor Ron [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=510.76s)]
*  DeSantis of Florida, who seems to be really doubling down on a lot of these culture war [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  issues in this country. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=519.56s)]
*  What do you make of this move? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=521.12s)]
*  What do you think about this debate that's raging around African-American studies in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=522.6s)]
*  high schools? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=526.76s)]
*  So, first of all, the College Board got rolled. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=527.96s)]
*  There's no other way to put it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm a former ambassador, former diplomat. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=532.92s)]
*  I'd like to be more diplomatic, but they got rolled. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=534.92s)]
*  And I think it's outrageous. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=537.84s)]
*  And, you know, Governor DeSantis, I'm sure others are, you know, trying to go down paths [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=540.16s)]
*  that all they do is divide us. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=548.52s)]
*  All the only thing that will come out of this is division. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=551.84s)]
*  And apparently, he thinks that's a smart political playbook. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=556.1999999999999s)]
*  I take a different tack. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=559.9599999999999s)]
*  We're actually expanding dramatically our African-American AP curriculum in New Jersey. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=562.04s)]
*  We believe that our history ought to be told to our kids, the good, the bad and the ugly. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=569.76s)]
*  Most of it's good, by the way. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=576.24s)]
*  You know, we're proud to have that flag behind us. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  We're proud to live in the greatest nation on Earth. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=582.28s)]
*  But as President Obama used to say, we wake up every morning trying to perfect our union, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  recognizing we're not perfect. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=590.76s)]
*  Our history is not perfect. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=592.6s)]
*  New Jersey's history, as it relates to slavery, is particularly imperfect. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=594.12s)]
*  Our kids need to know that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=599.0s)]
*  And I think we're a stronger nation and we're stronger as individuals if we've got all the facts. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=601.48s)]
*  And that's the side of history that we're on. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=610.0s)]
*  The more we know, the better we will be as a country. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=611.04s)]
*  Let me stay on the education front for a moment because you recently signed into law a bill [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=613.4s)]
*  requiring public schools in New Jersey to teach media literacy to K-12 students. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=618.24s)]
*  That's pretty interesting. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=624.76s)]
*  What do you hope to achieve with this? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=625.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's, Aiman, I think it's the first of a nation. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=627.64s)]
*  And we're really proud of that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=631.52s)]
*  There's a nonprofit civics association, which I think is also only of its kind in the nation, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=633.28s)]
*  which I want to give a lot of credit to. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  The really good thing about that bill that I signed, and I think this is a statement about the fact [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  that we actually can still come together as a country, is it was bipartisan sponsored and supported, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  which I think is a really important point because when you hear media literacy, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=652.88s)]
*  probably folks default to, well, that's one side of the aisle calling out fake news. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=657.4799999999999s)]
*  It was actually both sides of the aisle acknowledging that in these fraught times in our nation, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=663.28s)]
*  it's really important again that our kids understand that they need to parse the real from the fake [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=669.64s)]
*  and they need to understand that the information coming at them, they've got to have these skills [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=677.64s)]
*  to be able to, as I say, to parse that from the good from the bad, not necessarily good in the sense [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=685.36s)]
*  that they want to hear it, but accurate. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=692.4s)]
*  And I'm really proud that we signed this and our districts now are putting their pen to paper [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=695.16s)]
*  in terms of what that curriculum around the state will look like. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=701.24s)]
*  And I think it's a really good thing. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=704.84s)]
*  And I'm again, particularly happy it was bipartisan supported. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=706.8s)]
*  Yeah, again, as somebody who works in media, I think this is a great initiative and wish your state [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=711.52s)]
*  and everyone involved in it the best of luck. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=715.24s)]
*  This country definitely needs more media literacy. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=716.8s)]
*  Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, sir, thank you so much for your time. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=719.24s)]
*  I greatly appreciate it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=722.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Eamon. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7jnzuaruIE&t=723.84s)]
