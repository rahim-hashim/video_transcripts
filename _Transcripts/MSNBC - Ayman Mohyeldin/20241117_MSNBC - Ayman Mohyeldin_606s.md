# Fox host turned Trump Defense Secretary pick's plans to 'clean house' at the Pentagon
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48)
*  NBC News exclusive reporting that Donald Trump's transition team is exploring whether military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=0.0s)]
*  officials directly involved in the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 can be court-martialed. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=5.76s)]
*  Trump's pick for defense secretary, Fox News host Pete Hegseth, has been a staunch critic [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=12.24s)]
*  of the Afghanistan withdrawal, saying that the United States lost the war and wasted [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  billions of dollars in the process. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=22.16s)]
*  Hegseth was a junior officer in the Minnesota Army National Guard. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=24.64s)]
*  He served overseas, but he has never actually held a senior military position. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=28.64s)]
*  He also has never served in government and has no experience in government. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=33.68s)]
*  What Hegseth is known for is his war on woke, which includes arguing against women serving [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=39.08s)]
*  in combat roles and regularly mocking and misgendering transgender service members. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=45.28s)]
*  He also says that the next president should, quote, clean house at the Pentagon by getting [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=51.08s)]
*  rid of woke generals and claims that the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion at the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=56.12s)]
*  nation's service academies has made the military, quote, effeminate. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=61.6s)]
*  Now during Trump's first term, we also saw a steady stream of Fox personalities turned [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=67.08s)]
*  White House officials. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=72.2s)]
*  There was John Bolton and Kayleigh McEnany and Monica Crowley. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=73.2s)]
*  But many observers noted that Fox's efforts to paint Trump and his government in the best [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=76.86s)]
*  possible light was augmented by those hardliners in the White House. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=82.76s)]
*  But where it really took a hard line was in events like Charlottesville in the January [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=87.04s)]
*  6th insurrection, where Fox and those hardliners in the White House tried to put a good face [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=90.68s)]
*  on the Trump administration's missteps and lapses. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  Network stars like Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro literally campaigned for Trump, making [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=100.02000000000001s)]
*  clear the connections between the network and the administration and campaign. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=104.72s)]
*  And while Donald Trump flirted with fringe conservative outlets like OAN and Newsmax, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=110.1s)]
*  it's always clear that Fox was in the pole position as the administration's preferred [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  mouthpiece. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=119.82s)]
*  Now, as we enter Trump's second term, the right-wing media landscape has changed considerably [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=120.82s)]
*  and to the incoming administration's profound advantage. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  Trump will now have the support of fringe podcasters like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=131.5s)]
*  who have already spread conspiracy theories on his behalf. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=136.5s)]
*  And then there's the whole new world of podcasting, which includes pro-Trump host Charlie Kirk [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=140.14s)]
*  and Ben Shapiro and the hugely influential anti-woke podcast machine headed by Joe Rogan. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=144.86s)]
*  This time around, Trump will also have the backing of Elon Musk, who has successfully [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=151.42s)]
*  managed to transform Twitter slash X into a right-wing echo chamber that aids Trump [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=155.62s)]
*  and the Republican Party. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=161.5s)]
*  What makes Trump's incoming second term more frightening than the first is the fact that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=163.7s)]
*  the new president-elect will have an empire of far-right voices in his ear, but also in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=168.54s)]
*  the country's ear, to defend him at all costs. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=174.82s)]
*  And now one of those voices may have command over the U.S. military, second only, of course, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  to Donald Trump's command. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss all of this is Angela Carzon, the president of Media Matters, as [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  well as Danielle Moody, the host of the Danielle Moody Show and co-host of Democracy-ish on [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=192.38s)]
*  YouTube. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=197.38s)]
*  And finally joining us, Rick Wilson, the co-founder of The Lincoln Project and the author of the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=198.38s)]
*  bestselling book Running Against the Devil, a plot to save America from Trump and the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=203.3s)]
*  Democrats from themselves. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=208.18s)]
*  Rick, I'll start with you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=209.46s)]
*  What's your reaction to this new NBC News exclusive reporting about the military withdrawal [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=211.7s)]
*  from Afghanistan? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=216.34s)]
*  How does this fit in to the nomination of Pete Hegseth, both in terms of his reputation [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=217.34s)]
*  and his public comments? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=222.74s)]
*  Look, I mean, I think that everyone who's objectively looked at this recognizes that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=224.34s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, although he was a platoon commander when he served in the National Guard, has [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=228.66s)]
*  zero experience. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=234.62s)]
*  He's not qualified to run a Waffle House. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=235.74s)]
*  He has no managerial experience at all. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=238.46s)]
*  And you're asking to go in and manage a $900 billion operation with 2.5 million men and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=240.22s)]
*  women who serve in the active reserve and National Guard, 750,000 civilian employees [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=245.54s)]
*  around the world, the most complex and difficult assignment in government. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=252.3s)]
*  I can tell you, I worked as a very, very junior aide to a secretary of defense, and this is [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=257.06s)]
*  the biggest job in the world. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=261.58s)]
*  This is a guy who reads off a teleprompter. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=263.58s)]
*  He is a complete lightweight. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=266.98s)]
*  He lacks the intellectual skills, but he does have what Trump wants, which is malice and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=268.46s)]
*  obedience. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=274.9s)]
*  I think that if you end up with this guy bringing retired military officers into court marshals, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=276.02s)]
*  you're going to shatter the cohesiveness and effectiveness of leadership in the military. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=281.38s)]
*  They're going to recognize that the long tradition of nonpartisan military leadership will be [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=285.58s)]
*  broken and that the authoritarianism of Trump has infected one of the most important institutions [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=290.73999999999995s)]
*  in our country. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=296.94s)]
*  Angela, you and your colleagues at Media Matters have documented much of Hegseth's extremism, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=297.94s)]
*  including his history of Islamophobic rhetoric. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=304.70000000000005s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit more and maybe augment what Rick has said about the significance [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=307.1s)]
*  of someone who has taken such extreme positions as Hegseth has, being considered for this [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=311.82000000000005s)]
*  top position in an institution that is populated by a very diverse group of people? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=317.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'll start there. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=322.70000000000005s)]
*  Part of it is, one of the important parts of the military is readiness, is to be prepared. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=324.86s)]
*  And two of the things that he represents sort of undercut that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  One is this idea, the misogyny and sort of the reduced role that women would play in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=333.42s)]
*  the military, that everyone universally accepts that doing that would actually reduce the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=337.86s)]
*  military's readiness. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=342.7s)]
*  So that's the first thing that will absolutely have an effect. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=343.7s)]
*  But then beyond that, it's his world view. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=346.3s)]
*  It is poisoned by not just Islamophobia, it's something even broader and bigger than that, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=348.18s)]
*  which is that he sees the world through crusader terms. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=352.9s)]
*  And he sees the military, the United States military, sort of as a flaming sword for Christ, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=357.82s)]
*  that it is engaged in a, not just as national security, it's also engaged in a religious [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=362.3s)]
*  battle. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=368.18s)]
*  And that is important to sort of stamp out and snuff out the rise of Islam across the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=369.18s)]
*  globe. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=376.18s)]
*  And one of the things he's lamented on several occasions is that Muslims are simply having [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=377.18s)]
*  too many babies by comparison to Christians, and that that presents a problem for cultural [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=380.62s)]
*  dominance down the road, and we need to be thinking about this threat now. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=385.62s)]
*  So that to me is the two big pieces. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=389.18s)]
*  Aside from all of the experience questions, there are plenty of people that sort of assess [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=390.86s)]
*  that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=393.86s)]
*  For me, it's those two things. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=394.86s)]
*  It's both what he represents in terms of unit readiness, and the second is a world view [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=395.86s)]
*  that is poisoned by this grand narrative that presents the military as an instrument, not [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=400.3s)]
*  just for sort of Trump's authoritarianism, which is extremely scary, and he is fully [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=406.34000000000003s)]
*  obedient, but also for this broader sort of Christian world view. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=410.82s)]
*  So Danielle, I appreciate Angela making the connections with this Christian evangelicalism [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=415.5s)]
*  and theocracy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=419.85999999999996s)]
*  I want to then sort of further this by talking about the war on woke and Hegseth's assaults [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=421.46s)]
*  on certain aspects of the military that he views as being unnecessarily attentive to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=426.97999999999996s)]
*  DEI. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=431.74s)]
*  Post-911, one of the things that was identified as a real vulnerability in the military was [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=432.74s)]
*  its failure to be a diverse institution, that you had to have individuals who were capable [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=437.74s)]
*  of translating Farsi and Urdu and whatnot. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=442.46s)]
*  It couldn't be your standard military or intelligence community. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=444.85999999999996s)]
*  It had to be more diverse. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=448.38s)]
*  How is this war on woke going to affect our preparedness and readiness and perhaps make [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=450.06s)]
*  us more vulnerable going forward? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=454.9s)]
*  I mean, that's exactly the point, is that it is going to make us more vulnerable around [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=456.5s)]
*  the world. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  We are living in extraordinary dangerous times where we have multiple wars that are happening [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=461.53999999999996s)]
*  globally. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=466.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we're going to have somebody whose main qualifications is going on television [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=467.21999999999997s)]
*  to talk about women being in combat and needing to be in the home or somebody that is talking [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=471.82s)]
*  against transgender people and saying that that's the biggest problem in America. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=476.78s)]
*  What disturbs me about this man the most is the fact that he wants to use the U.S. military [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=481.06s)]
*  against American citizens. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=485.9s)]
*  That's what he has said. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=487.82s)]
*  He has said that we need to source out the deep state, that we need to get rid of the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=488.94s)]
*  people that are liberal, that are progressive, that we have been paying too much attention [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=494.98s)]
*  to what's been happening overseas and not enough attention to what's been happening [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=499.38s)]
*  in America. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  So for the first time in our nation's history, we are up against a possible secretary of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=503.78000000000003s)]
*  defense that sees the American people as the enemy. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=509.54s)]
*  And that is something that is incredibly, incredibly dangerous. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=513.1s)]
*  And that is what authoritarianism looks like. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=516.3s)]
*  So Rick, not only is this someone who has made noise about using the military against [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=519.02s)]
*  individual citizens, protesters, he's someone who doesn't have a lot of experience. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=525.0200000000001s)]
*  And that really is something that stands out. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=529.5400000000001s)]
*  How will that lack of experience really change things at the Department of Defense? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=531.58s)]
*  Look, it will be catastrophic for the department. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=536.1800000000001s)]
*  It will be catastrophic for our men and women in uniform. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=539.34s)]
*  This job requires that you have the ability to be a diplomat, that you have the ability [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=541.9000000000001s)]
*  to manage an enormously globe-spanning enterprise, not only on the military side, but on the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=546.62s)]
*  procurement side, on the acquisition side, on the personnel side. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=553.5s)]
*  This job is so much bigger than a lightweight like this guy. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=557.82s)]
*  He is a nobody who Donald Trump has noticed because he's on Fox News. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=561.94s)]
*  No one would hire this guy in a senior C-suite position in any firm in the country. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=566.62s)]
*  And the Department of Defense is at a scale and a complexity that is so far beyond this [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=572.14s)]
*  wet-brained example of Fox News personalities that it is indescribable how much bigger this job is than this little man. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBV9HXCsR48&t=576.86s)]
