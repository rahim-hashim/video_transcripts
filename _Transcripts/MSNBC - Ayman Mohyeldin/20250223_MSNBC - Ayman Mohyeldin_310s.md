Video Description: The Trump administration is taking aim at DEI, and who's unexpectedly caught in the fire? None other than MAGA's own JD Vance. MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin looks at how the Department of Defense is reviewing his infamous memoir "Hillbilly Elegy," which may be too woke with his administration's flurry of anti-DEI executive orders.

# JD Vance becomes latest victim in MAGA's anti-DEI crusade
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4)
*  All right, we are back now with our worst of the week this time [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=0.0s)]
*  It is the severe GOP book bands that often target and censor diverse authors who write about marginalized communities [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=2.7s)]
*  The latest potential victim of this movement [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=9.3s)]
*  JD Vance. Yes, you heard that correctly the vice president's infamous memoir [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=12.42s)]
*  Hillbilly elegy is one of more than a dozen titles that have been removed from schools serving the kids of the US military service [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=16.92s)]
*  Members across the globe it has not been outright banned yet [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=23.96s)]
*  But the book has been flagged for a compliance review [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  It turns out that Vance's account of growing up in a white working-class family contains profanity [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  it contains references to LGBTQ plus community and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  Some passages that briefly celebrate diversity at least enough to conflict with executive orders issued by the Trump administration [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=40.0s)]
*  DEI has become MAGA's favorite boogeyman [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=47.92s)]
*  We all know that but haven't things gone too far if Trump's own vice presidential book is deemed too [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=50.28s)]
*  woke [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=57.16s)]
*  Jason and Dean are back with me your thoughts Jason [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=58.04s)]
*  Vance's days in the Trump administration seem to be numbered if his books are gonna be if he's considered woke and his books are gonna [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=61.16s)]
*  Be under review. He is a tree hugging liberal [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=68.2s)]
*  It seems like because he talks about diversity in a book [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=71.88s)]
*  It is very ironic and it's it honestly is a little bit of inclusion that we're doing right now [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=75.16s)]
*  Just by talking about JD Vance because he's been kind of the third wheel in the White House [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=80.32s)]
*  Musk and Trump in that in that order. Yeah. Yeah, so I think it's I think it's funny and ironic and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=85.64s)]
*  Maybe this means Vance is gonna run as a Democrat and just go full force into this in in 2028 [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=93.0s)]
*  JD Vance the Democratic Social Justice Warrior the nominee for the 2028 presidential. It's the woke, right? This is what's happening [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=100.16s)]
*  It's the whole right there waking up, but they're like, oh my god this [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=106.58s)]
*  JD Vance mistake. He referred to people [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=110.96s)]
*  The diversity of white actually expanded like someone was beige like that books gotta go [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=113.56s)]
*  What do you think nobody actually did mention like black Canadian in the book the daughter of an Indian immigrant and that? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=118.16s)]
*  Di doesn't allow that the idea that's what they want. Everything has to be white [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=124.28s)]
*  I mean when you teach slavery now, you can't mention the skin color of the enslaved people or the slave owners [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=128.04s)]
*  That's what teachers have said that they're afraid of being fired [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=132.68s)]
*  They literally have to teach slavery in American schools racially neutral. It wasn't about race. It was about economic development [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=135.0s)]
*  They would say where did you study? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=143.72000000000003s)]
*  Rod DeSantis is seem to think there was some kind of economic benefit for for slaves [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  Let me guess [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=154.08s)]
*  Let me play for you this clip from Senator Jim Banks at CPAC this week [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=155.84s)]
*  De I is a fundamental attack on the American dream [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  Let me tell you as the son of a factory worker who grew up in a trailer park [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=168.12s)]
*  Now serving in the United States Senate [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=172.28s)]
*  That American dream is very personal to me [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=175.76s)]
*  Dei is the biggest threat to the American dream, but the golden age of America means the death of Dei [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=179.28s)]
*  so not only [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=187.12s)]
*  does the American dream not apply to people of color who are often [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=188.84s)]
*  the marginalized people in this country [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=193.72s)]
*  but they are according to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  Senator Jim Banks a threat to the American dream [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean if you listen to Donald Trump and you get your news from Donald Trump [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=203.08s)]
*  You would know that Dei cause plane crashes [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  It's responsible for probably the economy not doing as well as he would have wished it to be doing right now [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  so it's a very easy thing for people to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  Talk about just like critical race theory was now they have this this phrase that they can blame everything and make people who voted for [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  Trump feel like oh, this is the reason I [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=225.52s)]
*  Am where I am right now [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=227.84s)]
*  It is that the cars are stacked against me and you see that over and over again [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=229.52s)]
*  It's a weird it's weird to see it more from the critical race theory to Dei [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=234.36s)]
*  I wonder what the next thing is gonna be if it's just gonna be like outright saying something terrible [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=239.12s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of what they're doing. We're on our way. We're started with George Wallace [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  It's over George Wallace segregation today tomorrow and forever right now it's changed to CRT ban to Dei bans [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=258.35999999999996s)]
*  They're getting more emboldened. They're gonna just say white power. You have Elon Musk and Steve Bannon doing the fascist salute [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=265.0s)]
*  I mean, let's be blunt. This is what we're dealing with right now and Elon Musk and Pete Hexen Secretary of Defense saying [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=272.41999999999996s)]
*  Diversity is not our strength. That's one of the worst things to say but the military [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=277.52s)]
*  Do you want an all-white military? I mean, that's what you're to a whole white male military [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=280.52s)]
*  We are moving backwards as a society that's what's really going it's a push and pull and they want to take us backwards [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xw3nV66_4&t=284.52s)]
