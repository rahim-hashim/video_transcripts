# E.U. Ambassador to U.S. talks one year of Russian war in Ukraine
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY)
*  ... around the world continue to stand with Ukraine, because we all recognize that if [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=0.0s)]
*  we abandon Ukraine, we abandon the UN Charter itself and the principles and rules that make [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=8.92s)]
*  all countries safer and more secure. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=14.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  That was U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the United Nations this week. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=18.88s)]
*  Earlier, I spoke with the European Union ambassador to the United States, Stavros Lembronidis, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=22.68s)]
*  about the Ukraine War and what Vladimir Putin and his allies are planning next. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=27.48s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=32.16s)]
*  Let's start with this latest announcement of sanctions by the United States. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=36.6s)]
*  The U.S. announced a new round of sanctions to mark one year of the war. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=41.2s)]
*  The sanctions, as I understand it, will target more than 200 individuals and entities, including [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=45.96s)]
*  both Russians and third-party actors across Europe, as well as Russian officials, proxy [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=51.12s)]
*  authorities illegitimately operating in Ukraine, and a dozen Russian financial institutions. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  And of course, these follow months of sanctions from the United States and other European [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  countries and countries around the world. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=67.56s)]
*  But over the last year, the Russian economy fell just 2.2 percent. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=70.72s)]
*  The ruble is nearly as strong as it was before the war. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=75.64s)]
*  Do you think these sanctions are having a legitimate impact on the war and the Russians? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=80.22000000000001s)]
*  They're certainly having a huge impact on Russia itself. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=86.14s)]
*  We never thought they were a magic bullet to stop Putin's neocolonialist expansion, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=90.82000000000001s)]
*  at least not immediately. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=96.86000000000001s)]
*  But the point was to cripple his capacity to finance in an unlimited way his war machine [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=97.86000000000001s)]
*  and to ensure that his economy falls generations back. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=105.14000000000001s)]
*  And this is exactly what's happening. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=108.38000000000001s)]
*  The European Union announced itself yesterday a new massive, the 10th package of sanctions [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=109.86s)]
*  against Russia. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=114.74s)]
*  And if you look at the Russian economy and what Putin has to do to prop it up, because [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=115.74s)]
*  what you announce as figures is really just him dipping deep into his reserves to try [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=120.94s)]
*  to save the ruble from its total collapse. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=126.1s)]
*  These are measures that are crippling the Russian economy and its capacity to come into [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=129.74s)]
*  the 21st century. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=133.14s)]
*  The more he keeps this war going, the more his economy is going to be suffering for years [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=139.78s)]
*  Let me ask you about China and Iran here for a moment. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=142.54s)]
*  China and Iran have helped prop up the Russian economy and Vladimir Putin this year. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=145.22s)]
*  The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken just said this week that he is very concerned [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=150.54s)]
*  about this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=154.94s)]
*  He said, quote, China is considering providing lethal support to Russia in its aggression [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=156.22s)]
*  against Ukraine. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=161.18s)]
*  How concerned is the European Union about this? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=162.98s)]
*  Are you concerned that this is spilling over and becoming a proxy war of sorts? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=166.5s)]
*  And what can the EU and the U.S. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=171.45999999999998s)]
*  do to prevent China's support to Russia? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=173.73999999999998s)]
*  We are seriously concerned and we're talking to the Chinese about this, but the ones who [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=177.45999999999998s)]
*  are particularly concerned are the Chinese and the Russians as well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=180.42s)]
*  China has been trying very hard to portray itself as a neutral actor in this war, as [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=185.38s)]
*  if it is possible to be neutral when a country violently invades another one without an excuse [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=189.94s)]
*  or a reason. But anyway, it's been trying to do this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=194.98s)]
*  And the moment it starts supplying military support, assuming that's what it decides it's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=198.29999999999998s)]
*  going to try to do, its hands are bloodied as well. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  But Russia also and Putin himself have made one more serious miscalculation with this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  war when it comes to China as well. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=212.7s)]
*  They thought, he thought, they would just walk over the Ukrainians and take over the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  country in a few days. They're now a year from this war being pushed back with no prospect [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  of them winning at all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=224.06s)]
*  They have suffered tens of thousands of deaths, hundreds of thousands of injuries. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=225.82s)]
*  And so when Putin goes to China in a desperate move to ask for weapons, that shows you how [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=230.74s)]
*  poor his campaign is going. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=236.78s)]
*  Because believe you me, one thing that the imperialist Putin never had in mind when this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=238.5s)]
*  war began is that he would become even more so the laptop of China. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=244.02s)]
*  For the proud Putin and the proud Russian people, this information is deeply disturbing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=249.22s)]
*  It will become more so if China gets more involved in this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=255.58s)]
*  Will there be consequences for China if they do get involved by providing Russia lethal [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  weapons? Would they be subject to any measures by the EU and the United States? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=265.54s)]
*  Have you have you considered that? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=269.86s)]
*  Well, we're constantly considering all the alternatives. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  It's not the time to get into this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=275.38s)]
*  We haven't done this yet. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  We've made it very clear to them that it would be a bad idea to do it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=278.62s)]
*  Let me get your thoughts on just the war itself and how it's going. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=283.26000000000005s)]
*  I mean, as you mentioned, after failing in his initial goal of quickly taking Kiev, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=287.3s)]
*  Vladimir Putin appears to be placing his new bet on winning this war through attrition. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=292.1s)]
*  What do you consider to be Putin's long game here now that he has not been able to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=297.1s)]
*  strategically achieve what he set out to do? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=301.94s)]
*  How do you see the war evolving over the next year? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=304.94s)]
*  I'm afraid that Putin has not given up on his initial goal. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=308.98s)]
*  His initial goal was to take over Kiev, to destroy Ukraine, to wipe it off the map. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=311.58s)]
*  And for us and everyone else who are looking for possibilities to be able to move to a [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=319.14s)]
*  just peace, it is very clear that Putin is not there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=324.82s)]
*  And the problem is that that, of course, he's not there because he has failed [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=328.3s)]
*  dramatically in all his strategic objectives. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=333.38s)]
*  And it is a decision he will have to make at some point because we will not stop [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=336.3s)]
*  supporting Ukraine in this battle. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=341.34s)]
*  And as long as Putin continues fighting, we will continue making sure Ukraine [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=345.06s)]
*  survives. Now, what does he want to do? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=350.98s)]
*  It's very difficult to be in Putin's head. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=355.78s)]
*  But I'll tell you, at least what I think he may be able to achieve in whatever [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  thoughts he has. As I said, he wanted and he was sure he was going to take over [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=363.26s)]
*  Ukraine in a matter of days, failed dramatically. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=367.78s)]
*  He was sure he was going to divide and split up the European Union. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=371.14s)]
*  We need 27 countries unanimously to approve sanctions, 27 unanimously. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=375.21999999999997s)]
*  And he was sure at least one or two would vote no. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=380.34s)]
*  And for 10 separate packages, the last one just yesterday, every single European [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=383.06s)]
*  country and leader has voted against. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=389.74s)]
*  He was sure he could use energy to blackmail us and the world. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=392.78000000000003s)]
*  And instead, Europe has decoupled massively from Russia already. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=396.02000000000004s)]
*  And Russia is losing every day half of what it was making before the war by selling [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=399.5s)]
*  gas and oil. This is a huge hit to his capacity to finance his war machine. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=404.5s)]
*  And, you know, he was also helping. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=409.5s)]
*  He was going to somehow win the rest of the world around. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=411.54s)]
*  But the rest of the world in Africa and elsewhere does not like colonialism. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=415.58000000000004s)]
*  It most certainly does not like neo-colonialism. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=418.94s)]
*  And just a few days ago at the United Nations, 141 countries, 141 countries, that's [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=421.54s)]
*  the overwhelming majority, voted and told Putin to get his troops out of Ukraine now. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=427.18s)]
*  They voted against this colonialism. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=433.98s)]
*  And this is another major strategic failure of Putin. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=436.74s)]
*  So I'm not arguing here that this is and I'm not arguing that I know when it's going [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=439.82s)]
*  to end, but I am confident it's going to end with Ukraine's victory. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=444.3s)]
*  You obviously represent the European Union here to the United States. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=449.14s)]
*  So you have a good sense of the American sentiment and the discussion that's happening [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=453.42s)]
*  here in America. There's a new poll from the Associated Press that shows American [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=457.42s)]
*  support for sending weapons to Ukraine is considerably down from last year. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=462.26s)]
*  Are you at all concerned about that waning support, especially as it relates to a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=468.42s)]
*  growing number of Republican leaders who now control the House and they control the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=474.26000000000005s)]
*  money that can be sent to Ukraine, expressing their concern that America is spending too [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=479.38000000000005s)]
*  much on this war? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=485.18s)]
*  I have heard some members of Congress say that, but frankly, that's a very small [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=487.26000000000005s)]
*  minority that I've heard. And I've been speaking to Republicans and Democrats from [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=491.62s)]
*  Congress almost every day. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=495.02000000000004s)]
*  And what I hear from the leadership of Republicans and Democrats, absolute commitment [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=497.22s)]
*  to continue and even to increase the support to Ukraine. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=502.3s)]
*  Now, to everyone listening, I have to tell you this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=505.90000000000003s)]
*  I understand this is a difficult story to follow every day, a brutal story to follow [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=510.74s)]
*  every way. I understand how some people may be getting tired. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=515.74s)]
*  But I will tell you this. Although this fight, this war that is happening thousands of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=520.22s)]
*  miles away from this part of the world, there is no safe distance when an autocrat [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOMEshC_BY&t=525.02s)]
