# The 10 Most Consequential Days Of The Obama Presidency
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM)
*  All right, so just 30 days from the midterms, polls are tightening in critical states like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=0.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  One of these reasons, Republicans have ramped up their negative attacks, hitting Democrats [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=7.68s)]
*  on issues like crime and inflation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=12.94s)]
*  And in a moment, I'm going to speak with former chief speechwriter for President Obama, Cody [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=14.64s)]
*  Keenan, on his messaging advice for Democrats in the final days of this election cycle. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  But before that, we're going to discuss Cody's new book, Grace, President Obama and 10 Days [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=23.84s)]
*  in the Battle for America, which focuses on 10 days in 2015 that forever changed our country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=29.04s)]
*  Cody Keenan joins us now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=36.0s)]
*  Cody, it's great to see you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=37.92s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=39.52s)]
*  So tell us a little bit about these 10 days and their importance and the importance they [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=40.52s)]
*  had on America as well. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  Thanks, Avin. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=47.0s)]
*  Yeah, everybody remembers the events these 10 days, but not necessarily that they were [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=48.0s)]
*  all in the same 10 days. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=52.16s)]
*  They began with a racist terror attack in Charleston when white supremacists shot up [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=54.28s)]
*  eight parishioners and their Bible study group and their pastor. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=59.0s)]
*  And then they unfolded through the extraordinary act of grace on behalf of the victims' families. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=62.2s)]
*  They forgave the killer. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=65.92s)]
*  And that actually inspired President Obama to go give the amazing grace eulogy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=67.64s)]
*  And at the same time, we were comparing, my team and I, all these speeches for whether [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=70.76s)]
*  or not the Supreme Court would uphold marriage equality, whether or not the Supreme Court [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=75.56s)]
*  would uphold Obamacare. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=78.36s)]
*  So in just these 10 days, all these questions about America, who we are, what we believe [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=80.6s)]
*  in, what we stand up for, all came to head at the same time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=84.44s)]
*  Yeah, and you write that the famous amazing grace moment when President Obama sang during [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=87.72s)]
*  the funeral service for one of the Charleston church shooting victims almost didn't happen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=92.72s)]
*  How did that come to be? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  You know, he and I had written so many eulogies after mass shootings at that point. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  The origin of him not wanting to do it at first went back to 2013, where Republicans [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=106.2s)]
*  in the Senate blocked a vote on background checks. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  And this was after the school shooting in Newtown, when 20 little kids were murdered, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=112.64s)]
*  along with six their educators. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=115.56s)]
*  And when Republicans blocked that vote with the parents of those kids looking on from [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=117.92s)]
*  the gallery, it's about as cynical as I've ever seen the president. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=121.44s)]
*  And he said, you know, the next time this happens, I don't want to speak. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  If we're going to decide as a country that we're not going to do anything about this, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=127.2s)]
*  then I don't want to just perpetuate this cycle of giving a eulogy and letting us move [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=130.4s)]
*  on. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=133.52s)]
*  As the week unfolded and those families forgave the killer and that extraordinary act of grace, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  he ultimately decided, you know what, that's what I want to speak about. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=139.44s)]
*  And I want to go down there and hug those families. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=142.52s)]
*  And I want to talk about grace and how it can help us, you know, see where we've been [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  blind and maybe give people the chance to change. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=148.56s)]
*  It's undeniable that President Obama is perhaps one of the greatest orders of our lifetime. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  I mean, he's certainly up there among the best speakers in American political history. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=156.68s)]
*  Have you or how have you seen the president evolve as a speaker since he left office? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=162.52s)]
*  Not only how he speaks, but what he chooses to speak about? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=168.24s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=172.12s)]
*  He laid down a marker. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=173.12s)]
*  You know, I stayed with him for four years after the White House. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=175.24s)]
*  He laid down a marker early that he'd always speak up when our universal values were threatened [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=177.52s)]
*  about the things we care about as Americans when they're at stake. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=181.12s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of his office. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=184.8s)]
*  I don't know his plans for the midterms. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=185.8s)]
*  I assume you'll hear from him in some way. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  But he's been choosy with when he goes out to speak, and especially now, you know, he'll [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=191.28s)]
*  defer to President Biden. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=194.24s)]
*  And like I said, you know a thing or two about communicating, and we've now realized how [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=196.28s)]
*  important it is for our leaders to communicate clearly and effectively about the important [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=202.12s)]
*  things that our country faces. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=208.0s)]
*  So I wanted to get your thoughts on that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=209.56s)]
*  I mean, how do you communicate? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  How do you write for a Democratic candidate ahead of the midterms in this final stretch [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=212.44s)]
*  of the 30 days with everything that you are seeing happening across the country? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=218.88s)]
*  How do you crystallize a clear message to the American voters about what is at stake? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=221.44s)]
*  It's always different in the midterms. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  It's difficult in the midterms. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=230.28s)]
*  You know, I remember in 2010, our first midterms, we knew we were in for a rough ride. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=231.28s)]
*  The economy was still hovering near 10 percent unemployment, and no matter what, it was going [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  to be a referent about President Obama. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  This year, President Biden's done something different. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=242.0s)]
*  He's been able to make it a choice election, and it helps that President Trump has inserted [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=243.92s)]
*  himself into it at every step. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=247.34s)]
*  But he's given candidates across the country, and they'll all run their own message strategies, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=248.74s)]
*  the chance to say there are significant things about democracy at stake. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=252.9s)]
*  And you've got to decide who is it that's fighting for us? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  You know, is it the people that have been trying to criminalize abortion and trying [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=260.06s)]
*  to overturn the last election and promising to overturn the next and pledging violence [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=263.42s)]
*  in the streets if they don't get their way? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=267.3s)]
*  Or is it Democrats who've actually been fighting to lower prescription drug costs, lower energy [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=269.26s)]
*  jobs, let people decide when to start a family, let people decide, you know, they can marry [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=273.38s)]
*  whoever they love? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=279.14s)]
*  It's hard to make that message stick and break through when Republicans are just going to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=280.78s)]
*  do the same thing they do every two years, which is run on crime and immigration and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=284.78s)]
*  try to scare the heck out of everybody. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  But these midterms are just critical. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=290.02s)]
*  You know, I want people to think back to 2014 when Democrats lost the Senate. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=292.41999999999996s)]
*  That's what freed Mitch McConnell to take the unprecedented step of denying President [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=296.9s)]
*  Obama a Supreme Court appointee. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=300.62s)]
*  And then they got to ram through 300 President Trump. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=302.82s)]
*  And that's how you got the Dobs decision over turning Rose. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=304.74s)]
*  So these midterms are just critically important. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=307.06s)]
*  And, you know, I'll tell you, some of my favorite feedback to this book so far, and it's only [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=309.78000000000003s)]
*  been out a few days, is when people message me and say, it got me so fired up that I just [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=313.74s)]
*  signed up to go knock on some doors. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=318.02s)]
*  You know, no speech, no book is going to change everything or make everything better. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=319.66s)]
*  But if you can just inspire some people to get out there and fight for this democracy, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=323.94s)]
*  nothing could be more important. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=328.42s)]
*  Let me just get a final thought. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=330.02000000000004s)]
*  Just because you had such incredible access, do you think that a president needs to be [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=332.18s)]
*  a compelling speaker to be an effective leader? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=336.54s)]
*  I think it helps. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't think it's necessary. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=342.70000000000005s)]
*  You know, it's not critical to it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=343.70000000000005s)]
*  I think that's actually something that all of us need to keep in mind. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=345.26s)]
*  We're not always going to have inspirational leaders. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=348.26s)]
*  We're not always going to have people who can go out and give a soaring speech. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=351.26s)]
*  Sometimes you just get people who like doing the work and trying to move the ball forward [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=354.54s)]
*  every day in democracy. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=358.54s)]
*  And that's just as important. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=360.1s)]
*  You know, we don't we shouldn't need leaders to inspire us. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=361.58000000000004s)]
*  It's nice when we get that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=364.18s)]
*  We all need to dive in and show up and protect this democracy at every step. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=365.82s)]
*  Yeah, couldn't agree with you more on that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=369.62s)]
*  Congrats on the book. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  The book is Grace, President Obama and 10 Days in the Battle for America. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  Cody Keenan, I greatly appreciated this conversation. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=377.14000000000004s)]
*  Extremely fascinating. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=380.3s)]
*  Thanks, Amy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRW-04nuMNM&t=381.3s)]
