*  No filmmaker writer or artist should ever have to tell the story of their own [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=50.620000000000005s)]

*  variety film critic [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=63.14s)]
*  one film critic writes from ground zero exists from more in the tradition of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=65.14s)]
*  photographers Henrik Ross and Mendel Grossman [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=71.10000000000001s)]
*  Inhabitants of Poland's Jewish ghettos who not only documented daily life with their cameras [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=73.1s)]
*  But imbued it with a familiar beating humanity in that vein [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=78.61999999999999s)]
*  It is hard to ignore just how much from ground zero feels like history unfolding and tragedy being memorialized [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=82.82s)]
*  Right before our eyes. I'm joined now by the producer and director of the film Rashid Masharawi. Thank you so much Rashid for joining us [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  Incredible and powerful movie. These are the images from the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=98.41999999999999s)]
*  Makeshift Gaza red carpet premiere of from ground zero that happened last year [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=101.94s)]
*  It's very inspiring and still speaks to the humanity of the people in Gaza who were involved in this [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  The most obvious question I have for you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  How do you shoot a movie or 22 short movies in the midst of what is called a genocide? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=114.22s)]
*  Yes [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=121.78s)]
*  For sure, it was very difficult because [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=123.78s)]
*  We start almost January 24, it was really [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=126.06s)]
*  It's been very tough in Gaza. All the filmmakers were under bombing. They were refugees [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=131.18s)]
*  They were living in tents most of them lost the houses and lost families and relative and friends [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=137.38s)]
*  And then I come with the idea to say, okay, let's go and document. Let's go and make cinema [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=145.06s)]
*  Let's go and make cinema [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  It means it was very difficult first to encourage everybody to make cinema priority to risk his life for [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=153.82s)]
*  shooting and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=161.7s)]
*  It takes us really time to make them able to shoot but also [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=163.34s)]
*  To get out the material it was another big story also because we were based on [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=170.1s)]
*  Electricity and the internet and most of the time no electricity and for sure no internet [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=177.0s)]
*  It was really really difficult [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=183.36s)]
*  But because I believe and they believe it's very important to tell the story [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=185.64s)]
*  It's better. It's very important to get these images outside of Gaza and also [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=191.36s)]
*  We want to tell another story. Not only the story that everybody saw in the news [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=199.08s)]
*  We want to turn all these numbers because we were killing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=204.46s)]
*  They kill us as numbers in Palestine in Gaza, especially [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=209.78s)]
*  It's been every day 200 300 500 our project was [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=214.34s)]
*  To tell these numbers. They are human being they have names, you know, they are kids. They have dreams. They have life [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=220.06s)]
*  This is why we went into cinema not into news [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=227.06s)]
*  So what do you want viewers who have not seen this movie but who may see it [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  But what do you want viewers to take away from this endeavor and the circumstances that you under which you made this movie? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=236.54s)]
*  It's very simple. It's mean the people that outside Gaza [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  They must understand that people in Gaza. They are a human being like any others [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=251.34s)]
*  It's mean they are not terrorists [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=258.14000000000004s)]
*  Let's say they are kids and women and people they are killed because they were there at this time in this [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=260.1s)]
*  Location it means I want to think make the people to think about humanity, you know about the human being [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=268.62s)]
*  because [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=276.86s)]
*  People must know that they are killing everybody in Gaza [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=278.18s)]
*  They are killing you the one who is sitting in Europe in America as a human being [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=282.18s)]
*  They are killing you in Gaza because we are all having the same needs. We are all [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=288.02s)]
*  Sharing this world. We are all having the same dreams as a human being [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  it's mean because [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=300.94s)]
*  You know, it's it's a big disappointment because today we are more than [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=303.3s)]
*  450 days and the killing still going on the genocide still going on [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=308.5s)]
*  It's mean people must move must cut this silence [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=315.74s)]
*  This is part of the aims and at the same time we want to say in Gaza. There is artist there is filmmakers [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=319.70000000000005s)]
*  There is people wanted to make cinema also. I [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=327.86s)]
*  Wanted to get your thoughts on the reception the movie has had so far as I mentioned it has received [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  Rave reviews in some of the screenings that have taken place here in the United States. It has been sold out [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=336.85999999999996s)]
*  It has been receiving recognition elsewhere around the world [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  As I mentioned Oscar-winning director and filmmaker Michael Moore is now joined as an executive producer [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=345.9s)]
*  But what does it mean for you the filmmakers involved in this to see that it has gotten the attention that it has received and for it [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=350.94s)]
*  to possibly be [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=358.26s)]
*  nominated for an Oscar [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=359.85999999999996s)]
*  First to be nominated for an Oscar [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=362.22s)]
*  It's very important for us because actually what we want [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  It means we want also more intention more media more people to see these films more people [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=368.18s)]
*  To talk about it to write about it to share to share all this stories because the people in Gaza [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=374.74s)]
*  They feel alone and was all what? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=381.58000000000004s)]

*  Especially when we are dealing with people who believe like us [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=397.18s)]
*  I believe all my life that cinema also [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3InJBpbk-k&t=401.78000000000003s)]
