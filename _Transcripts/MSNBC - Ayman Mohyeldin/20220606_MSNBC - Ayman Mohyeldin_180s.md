Video Description: With the country experiencing yet another weekend of horrific gun violence, bipartisan efforts at gun control are at the mercy of Sen. Mitch McConnell, who President Biden believes is one of the "rational Republicans" willing to address the seemingly endless series of massacres. But McConnell has a decades-long history of blocking gun control, as MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin highlights.

# MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin Breaks Down Sen. Mitch McConnell’s Long History Of Blocking Gun Reform
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA)
*  All right, so we begin tonight with details of even more gun violence in America. At least [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=0.0s)]
*  seven people are dead, more than two dozen injured after shootings in Philadelphia, Chattanooga, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  South Carolina. This as funerals are still being held in both Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=14.68s)]
*  New York. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=21.72s)]
*  Now, it's a sad and infuriating ritual to tick through this ever-growing list of mass [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=22.72s)]
*  shootings every time we come on the air. This week, President Biden said enough. He said [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=27.1s)]
*  enough 12 times in a rare prime time speech to the nation. But apparently enough isn't [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=32.14s)]
*  enough because no substantial legislative solution appears on the horizon. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=39.1s)]
*  The president believes there are some, quote, rational Republicans who might be willing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=44.56s)]
*  to address the scourge of gun violence. And Senator Mitch McConnell got some favorable [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=48.46s)]
*  headlines when he suggested a willingness to work with Democrats on this. But don't [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=53.56s)]
*  be fooled. He's had a decades-long history of blocking gun control. This is not the first [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=58.940000000000005s)]
*  mass shooting that he's been involved in. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=64.78s)]
*  The Washington Post provided a detailed list of times he spent working to, quote, delay, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=67.78s)]
*  obstruct or prevent most major firearm restrictions from being approved by Congress. Now, his [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=72.86s)]
*  story begins back in 1989 after a mass shooting rocked his own hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=79.46s)]
*  McConnell said he was, quote, deeply disturbed and said, quote, we must take action to stop [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=85.63999999999999s)]
*  such vicious crimes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=91.08s)]
*  But then he followed it with a now familiar phrase for the Republican Party. We need to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  be careful about legislating in the middle of a crisis. And McConnell has been nothing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=98.52s)]
*  when it comes to making that same talking point over the years. Here he was years later, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=104.04s)]
*  in 2017, after a Las Vegas massacre left 58 people dead. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=110.62s)]
*  I think it's particularly inappropriate to politicize an event like this. It just happened [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=116.34s)]
*  within the last day and a half. It's entirely premature to be discussing about legislative [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  solutions at the end of the day. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=127.4s)]
*  And after Yuvaldi, Texas, McConnell made no mention of guns or any possible legislative [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=131.22s)]
*  solutions, but he did declare himself sickened and outraged. Thank you. And said, quote, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=135.56s)]
*  words simply fail. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=141.36s)]
*  I agree, Senator. Words fail in exactly the same way all attempts to protect Americans [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=144.28s)]
*  from gun violence fail whenever you are in the room. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2E641D6zA&t=150.16s)]
