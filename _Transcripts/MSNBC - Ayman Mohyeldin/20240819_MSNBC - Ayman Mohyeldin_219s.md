# Ayman: Harris faces huge test on Gaza at DNC
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0)
*  Tomorrow, all eyes will be on Chicago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=0.0s)]
*  The Democratic National Convention kicks off, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=2.6s)]
*  and this morning, the party released their roster [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=4.94s)]
*  of prime-time speakers. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=8.2s)]
*  In addition to Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=9.6s)]
*  and Governor Walz, Bill and Hillary Clinton, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=11.44s)]
*  Barack and Michelle Obama, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  many others will be taking the stage at the United Center. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=16.04s)]
*  Harris and Walz joined forces in Pennsylvania today [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=19.28s)]
*  to kick off a bus tour, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=21.84s)]
*  and they did so in a race that polls continue to show [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=23.68s)]
*  has shifted in the Democrats' favor [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  since Biden dropped out and the party rallied around Harris, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=29.0s)]
*  the latest being this one from the Washington Post and ABC [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=32.84s)]
*  showing Harris with a four-point lead, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=35.84s)]
*  and yes, that is within the margin of error. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=38.24s)]
*  Now, the emergence of Harris and the selection of Walz [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=40.84s)]
*  as her running mate has breathed new life [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=43.3s)]
*  into the Democratic Party, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=46.24s)]
*  and it has undoubtedly injected supporters with excitement, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=47.44s)]
*  with hope, and even, yes, joy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=50.92s)]
*  But she is still in a neck-and-neck race [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  with a convicted felon who tried to violently [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=55.82s)]
*  overturn our democracy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=58.22s)]
*  So the stakes of this convention could not be higher. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=60.42s)]
*  In her first few weeks as the Democratic nominee, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=64.22s)]
*  Harris has already proven herself capable [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  of making big and bold decisions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=69.02s)]
*  When most Democratic strategists, for example, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=71.5s)]
*  wanted her to pick a running mate [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=74.1s)]
*  with the pundit-approved label of a centrist or moderate, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=75.7s)]
*  she didn't. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=79.5s)]
*  She went her own way and selected Walz, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=80.5s)]
*  who has successfully passed a progressive populist agenda [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=82.14s)]
*  as governor. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=86.3s)]
*  And this week, knowing that Republicans stood ready [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=87.64s)]
*  to label her as a socialist or even a communist, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=90.08s)]
*  she unveiled a populist economic agenda, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=93.44s)]
*  including a plan to combat price gouging [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=96.02s)]
*  by grocery store chains. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=98.92s)]
*  But there's one issue where she has not yet displayed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=101.36s)]
*  this boldness or this willingness [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=104.58s)]
*  to confront powerful interests, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=107.06s)]
*  and it is the same issue that had sung Joe Biden [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=109.1s)]
*  in the polls long before his disastrous debate performance. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=111.6s)]
*  As Farah Stockman wrote in the New York Times, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  there is perhaps no issue that divides the Democratic Party [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  more than the US government's support for Israel's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=122.06s)]
*  retaliation following the brutal attack by Hamas [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=124.5s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=127.28s)]
*  If the Harris campaign is unable to address [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=129.28s)]
*  this thorny issue in a way that feels like substance, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=131.48s)]
*  then Democrats may not get the unity they'll [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=134.94s)]
*  need to win in November. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=137.24s)]
*  And the key word here is substance. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=139.78s)]
*  Harris has already proven adept at showing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=143.01999999999998s)]
*  more compassion and empathy towards Palestinians [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=145.22s)]
*  more than Joe Biden, who came across as cold, cruel, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=147.92s)]
*  and clueless. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  But that bar is extremely low, and empty slogans [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=153.2s)]
*  won't bring back the more than 40,000 Palestinians, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=156.04s)]
*  including more than 16,000 children who have now [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=159.2s)]
*  been killed by the Israeli military in less than 10 months. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  The American position on Palestine [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=166.38s)]
*  can't be, I feel your pain, while at the same time [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=168.4s)]
*  being the country supplying the bombs that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=172.14s)]
*  is causing that pain. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=174.44s)]
*  And that's why more than 150 groups nationwide [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=176.38s)]
*  have joined a coalition to march at the DNC with estimates [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=178.98s)]
*  that tens of thousands will be there to protest. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=182.54s)]
*  How Harris and the Democrats deal with this, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=185.48s)]
*  not just the protests on the outside themselves, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=187.62s)]
*  but the substance, the core of this issue, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  may be her biggest test heading into Chicago. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=193.56s)]
*  The stakes could not be any higher. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4JAA1DyT0&t=197.04s)]
