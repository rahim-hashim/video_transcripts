Video Description: Kevin McCarthy might be on the cusp of a humiliating defeat, as he scrambles to secure the 218 votes needed to become House Speaker next month. Navigating a razor-thin majority, the California Republican can lose just a handful of votes -- and the "NOs" are stacking up. Meanwhile, Democrats just selected a new House leadership team with apparently no drama whatsoever. Rep. Nanette Barragán spoke with MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin after nominating Rep. Hakeem Jeffries to be the next leader of the Party.

# Congressional Dems Show A United Front Amid Chaos Within The GOP
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA)
*  Kevin McCarthy should be very afraid. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=0.0s)]
*  He might be on the cusp of a humiliating defeat as he scrambles to secure the 218 votes needed [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=9.18s)]
*  to become House Speaker next month. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=15.38s)]
*  Navigating a razor-thin majority, the California Republican can lose just a handful of votes, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=17.62s)]
*  and the No's, well, they are stacking up against him. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=23.26s)]
*  McCarthy faces a mounting challenge from members of the Freedom Caucus. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=26.22s)]
*  This is the far-right pro-Trump faction that has several members publicly vowing to vote [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=29.76s)]
*  for anyone but McCarthy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  McCarthy for his part says that he is prepared to fight till the bitter end, telling reporters [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  he will not drop out if he loses the first vote, promising a floor fight, meaning the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  House could have its first multi-ballot Speaker election in 100 years. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=46.18000000000001s)]
*  When in 1923, Congressman Frederick Gillett went through two days and nine rounds of votes [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=51.8s)]
*  in order to be re-elected Speaker of the House. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=58.099999999999994s)]
*  It's in stark contrast to the smoothness of the transition on the other side, the one [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=61.419999999999995s)]
*  taking place in the leadership for House Democrats. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=65.92s)]
*  This week, Democrats elected their new leadership team without a hitch. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=69.06s)]
*  Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York is now the first black lawmaker to lead a congressional [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=73.82s)]
*  caucus. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=78.14s)]
*  Catherine Clark of Massachusetts is the new whip, and Congressman Pete Aguilar of California [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=79.14s)]
*  is the new caucus chair. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=83.66s)]
*  He is the highest-ranking Latino ever in the House. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=85.3s)]
*  Here's Congressman Jeffries just after that historic vote thanking his predecessors. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  Stand on their collective broad shoulders, building upon the incredible work that they've [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=92.7s)]
*  done, excited about the opportunities to advance the ball for everyday Americans as we move [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=102.06s)]
*  forward into our future. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=110.34s)]
*  All right, let's bring in to the conversation Democratic congresswoman Nanette Baragon of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  California. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=118.14s)]
*  Congressman Jeffries to be Democratic leader. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=119.9s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for your time. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  Let's start with your party's new leadership. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=124.78s)]
*  Tell us why you believe Congressman Jeffries is the man for the hour or for the job and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=127.14s)]
*  what you think both Congresswoman Clark and Congressman Aguilar will perform as his number [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=131.98s)]
*  two and number three respectively. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=137.06s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=138.54s)]
*  I have to say it was quite an honor to be able to nominate Hakeem Jeffries, somebody [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=141.06s)]
*  who I've gotten to know since my time in Congress. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=145.9s)]
*  He is a defender of democracy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=149.42s)]
*  He's a masterful messenger, a sophisticated legislator, and he's a compassionate champion [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=151.42s)]
*  for the people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  He led us in 2018 on our messaging. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  He's led our caucus as the chair through the darkest of time, through a pandemic, through [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=162.06s)]
*  the January 6th insurrection. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=167.46s)]
*  And I know he's going to bring us back stronger than ever in the majority. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=169.74s)]
*  So I think he's the man that's going to lead us. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=173.34s)]
*  And we're followed by, of course, Katherine Clark, who when I think about her and I think [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=177.61999999999998s)]
*  about what she's done as a woman who has reached out to me and many of the members of Congress [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  has come to my district and just the historic nature of this generational change. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=190.61999999999998s)]
*  And of course, Pete Aguilar, who's the highest ranking Latino now as the chair of the Congressional [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=195.1s)]
*  Hispanic Caucus, as the, well, I should say the incoming chair of the Congressional Hispanic [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=200.42s)]
*  Caucus. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=205.26s)]
*  It's something that we're all very proud of to see Pete there and to see him at the table, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  at the leadership table. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=211.17999999999998s)]
*  We've got to continue to make sure that we are supporting people who look like America [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=212.34s)]
*  and bring a perspective like this new leadership does. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=217.7s)]
*  It is not a surprise that the right has already started attacking Congressman Jeffries. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=221.06s)]
*  Here's what Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Wednesday. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=226.06s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=228.26s)]
*  The newly elected incoming leader of House Democrats is a past election denier who basically [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=230.26s)]
*  said the 2016 election was, quote, illegitimate and suggested that we had a, quote, fake president. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=238.38s)]
*  He's also mounted reckless attacks on our independent judiciary and said that justices [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=249.66s)]
*  he didn't like have, quote, zero legitimacy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  Unfortunately, when it comes to attacking our independent judiciary, the Democrats' [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=261.53999999999996s)]
*  new leader isn't an outlier. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=266.53999999999996s)]
*  He's a representative sample. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=269.41999999999996s)]
*  So we saw how Republicans targeted Nancy Pelosi for decades, making her public enemy number [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=271.86s)]
*  one. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=277.14s)]
*  Do you expect them to do the same for Hakeem Jeffries? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=278.26s)]
*  How should he respond now that he is in this leadership position? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=281.38s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=285.74s)]
*  This is a party that associates itself with bigots, with anti-Semites, with a former president [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=286.74s)]
*  who wants to throw out the Constitution and put him back in power. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  This is a party who is supporting and going to put back on a committee a woman who wants [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=297.3s)]
*  to get rid of the Department of Justice, who prosecutes organized crime and terrorism, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=301.62s)]
*  is critical to our national security. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=306.06s)]
*  So I'm not surprised they've done this with President Obama attacking him under every [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=309.14s)]
*  possible way they could. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=313.94s)]
*  Stop their agenda. That's all they do. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=315.06s)]
*  They have no policy that they move forward. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  They just want to investigate. They want to attack. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=320.94s)]
*  They want to bring people down. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=322.94s)]
*  We saw what Democrats were able to do in the last two years, whether it was passing the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=324.65999999999997s)]
*  American Rescue Plan and passing an infrastructure bill and a jobs bill and making sure [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=329.9s)]
*  that we're investing in climate change. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=335.46s)]
*  We're not going to see anything like that from the other party. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=337.26s)]
*  It's a sad thing. And we know that we've got to continue to fight to make sure we come [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=339.58s)]
*  back stronger than ever in the majority in two years to make sure we're there fighting for [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=343.46s)]
*  the American people. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=347.41999999999996s)]
*  That's what the country needs and that's what they want. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=348.78s)]
*  Let me get your thoughts on what is happening across the aisle with the leadership fight on [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=351.5s)]
*  the other side. Do you believe Kevin McCarthy will have enough votes to secure the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=355.65999999999997s)]
*  speakership? I mean, what kind of impact does this scramble that we're seeing up top have [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=360.58s)]
*  on the rank and file members of the Republican Party, given the extremist nature of a big [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=365.29999999999995s)]
*  faction of the Republican Party? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=370.38s)]
*  Well, it's interesting to see the fight play out publicly, but we've seen the true colors of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=373.78s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy and who he's willing to sell out to the soul of our country and the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=379.34s)]
*  Constitution willing to go back to the man who led this insurrection inside of the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=383.85999999999996s)]
*  insurrection of January 6th on our Capitol and our democracy. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  So I'm not going to be surprised if last minute he sells out to make sure he has the votes on the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=393.06s)]
*  floor. But, you know, if it doesn't happen, we're certainly going to see how that turns out [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=398.54s)]
*  and see what the Republicans do. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=404.58000000000004s)]
*  But for now, we just got to continue on our side to make sure we're prepared to fight back [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=407.14000000000004s)]
*  against what we expect to be just a lot of investigations, not a lot of productivity for the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=412.94s)]
*  American people. And I hope I'm wrong about that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=418.86s)]
*  This morning, you probably saw Donald Trump saying what I think a lot of people have [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=421.90000000000003s)]
*  interpreted over the years, his actions to reflect calling for the Constitution to be [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=425.74s)]
*  suspended in order to overturn the 2020 election results. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=429.62s)]
*  This is the man who is by a lot of accounts, the front runner for 2024 for the Republican [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=433.82s)]
*  Party. He is certainly the standard bearer for the Republican Party. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=439.1s)]
*  And yet it seems like it isn't making any news in this country anymore because people just kind of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=443.1s)]
*  say, oh, he's the crazy old guy and nobody's listening to him. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=448.94s)]
*  Well, that's something we can't allow to continue to happen. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=452.22s)]
*  Everybody should speak out and against this, including our colleagues on the other side, in [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=455.1s)]
*  making sure we're protecting the Constitution, our democracy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=459.38s)]
*  That's what America is built on. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  So to allow this to just go and not speak out against it, I think just tells you how afraid the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=464.94s)]
*  other side is of this man who we know does not support the values of democracy in our Constitution [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  as he wants to throw it out. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=478.78000000000003s)]
*  So I hope my colleagues will grow backbone and make sure to speak out and not support somebody like [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=480.1s)]
*  this. We can't afford it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=485.82s)]
*  Certainly this country cannot afford it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=487.5s)]
*  Before we go, I just want to ask you about a push for immigration advocates, for Democrats to take [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=489.46000000000004s)]
*  action on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=494.82s)]
*  It's the program known as DACA. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=498.94s)]
*  During this lame duck session, they're trying to get some things done in this lame duck session. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=501.3s)]
*  That is something immigration advocates want to see done. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=504.62s)]
*  They warned that the Supreme Court is all but certain to terminate the program, leaving hundreds of [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=507.46000000000004s)]
*  thousands of immigrants at risk. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=511.62s)]
*  Do you think something can get done before January in this lame duck session? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=513.7s)]
*  DACA recipients need us to act and they need us to act in this Congress. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=519.82s)]
*  The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has been leading this effort and we are seeing a push across all our [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=523.54s)]
*  colleagues. We've got to get something done, whatever we can do. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=529.82s)]
*  I know there's a huge push. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=533.46s)]
*  I know there's a huge push. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=534.98s)]
*  I'm hopeful. I have to remain hopeful for the DACA recipients, for our country. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=536.58s)]
*  But it's not going to be easy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=541.74s)]
*  So let's continue to keep our voices up and make sure to continue to push. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=542.9000000000001s)]
*  And we're doing that with our congressional leaders and trying to see some action now, because clearly [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=547.3000000000001s)]
*  in the next two years, I think we're going to see an anti-immigration agenda for our colleagues across [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=552.6600000000001s)]
*  the aisle. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=557.7s)]
*  Congresswoman Nanette Baragon, thank you so much for your time. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=558.94s)]
*  I greatly appreciate you joining us this evening. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=561.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5_7WjEaOA&t=564.82s)]
