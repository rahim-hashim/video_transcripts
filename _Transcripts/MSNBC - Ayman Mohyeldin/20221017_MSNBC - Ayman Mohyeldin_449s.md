# AZ Secretary of State Candidate Adrian Fontes' Warning To Voters On The GOP's Election Denialism
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM)
*  So, the state that might best represent Republican sprawling election denialism movement in America [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=0.0s)]
*  right now is probably Arizona. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=11.08s)]
*  The swing state has three major races with election deniers that are on the ticket. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=13.0s)]
*  And just today, the Republican candidate for governor, Kari Lake, refused to commit to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=17.72s)]
*  accepting the results of her own election. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=22.64s)]
*  The Republican candidate for Senate, Blake Masters? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=26.04s)]
*  Well, he has preemptively claimed that his election will be stolen and accused machines [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  of flipping the vote, despite that not being an actual thing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=34.68s)]
*  And possibly the most dangerous is Secretary of State candidate Mark Fincham, who's already [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=40.08s)]
*  suggested that he wouldn't certify a Biden victory in 2024. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=45.28s)]
*  Now, all three of these candidates have been endorsed by the big liar himself, Donald [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=48.8s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=54.52s)]
*  Arizona is one piece of this growing election denialism movement. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=55.64s)]
*  And Reuters now reports that there have been multiple incidents of voter intimidation across [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=60.2s)]
*  the country from an expanding army of election observers, many of them recruited by prominent [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  GOP figures and activists echoing Trump's election lies. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=70.16s)]
*  Just in the time for the midterms. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  On that cheery note, let's bring in Adrian Fontes, the Democratic candidate for Arizona [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=76.66s)]
*  Secretary of State. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=81.0s)]
*  It's great to have you with us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  You know, as I just laid out there, it's kind of alarming to see what is happening in your [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=84.08s)]
*  state. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=88.28s)]
*  Let me just start with the comments we heard this morning. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=89.28s)]
*  These alarming comments from Kerry Lake, as well as Masters and your opponent, Mark Fincham, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=91.64s)]
*  about not accepting the results of the elections. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=98.72s)]
*  I can't hear the comments, but I'm here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=110.12s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=112.72s)]
*  I can hear you, Amy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  OK, so let me let me repose that question. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=116.64s)]
*  I was saying, what is your reaction to some of these troubling comments that we have heard [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=117.64s)]
*  come out of the candidates in Arizona that effectively? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=121.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm not surprised by it at all. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=124.64s)]
*  I don't think anybody should. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  These folks are, you know, they're not just bought into the big lie. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=129.6s)]
*  They are part of the big lie. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=133.9s)]
*  And that's what's dangerous. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  And it's not so much because they're spilling out these lies. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  It's who that they're lying against. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=141.84s)]
*  They're lying against regular Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, the regular folks [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=143.58s)]
*  who actually ran these elections, partially under my charge when I was the Maricopa County [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=147.62s)]
*  recorder. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=151.98000000000002s)]
*  But in all counties in all of the United States of America, they're destroying the faith that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  we have in one another. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  And that's a real problem. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=159.46s)]
*  Do you think that the country is taking these threats seriously? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=160.94s)]
*  We're seeing reports that states like Michigan and Colorado are seeing a surge in election [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=165.3s)]
*  deniers looking to be poll workers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=169.44s)]
*  Are people not taking this threat seriously? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=172.38s)]
*  Well, I think people are starting to take it seriously, but we should have been taking [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=174.98s)]
*  it seriously about a year or so ago when we found out that the RNC was going to be spending [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=179.5s)]
*  one hundred and fifty four million dollars training people to get out there and try to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  intimidate voters at polling places. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  That's why we're encouraging all Arizonans to vote early. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=190.6s)]
*  So if you're an Arizona voter, your voting has already started October 12th. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=194.22s)]
*  The ballots went out in the mail. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=198.22s)]
*  If those opportunities exist across the country, we're encouraging folks to vote early. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=200.17999999999998s)]
*  Please make sure you get your ballots cast so that you know that they will be in the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=206.42s)]
*  hands of elections officials and tabulated just to avoid any of this nonsense on Election [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=209.14s)]
*  Day. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=213.94s)]
*  Yeah, and I was going to say, and despite that early voting, your opponent has said [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=214.94s)]
*  that he doesn't care for mail in voting and prefers going to the polls. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=218.17999999999998s)]
*  But the irony and the hypocrisy, as Republicans have now become famous for, is his own voting [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=222.98s)]
*  history file from Prima County shows that he's voted by mail 28 times since 2004. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=227.9s)]
*  Again, it's OK for him to vote by mail, but not for everyone else. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=235.18s)]
*  Look, here's the problem that we have with my opponent. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=239.46s)]
*  He was paid six thousand dollars by Donald Trump to put on a fake hearing on November [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=242.74s)]
*  30th, 2020, from which he gathered supposedly evidence that he was going to take on January [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=248.06s)]
*  6th. But he was an organizer of the January 6th insurrection against our Constitution, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=255.1s)]
*  as indicated by Ali Alexander himself. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=261.38s)]
*  This guy is an oath keeper since 2014. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=263.86s)]
*  He is an anti-Semite. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=266.14s)]
*  He's called for a civil war and the stockpiling of weapons and munitions ostensibly to kill [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=267.3s)]
*  other Americans. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=272.02s)]
*  He is dangerous and not just dangerous because of the politics. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=273.3s)]
*  He's dangerous because of what he might not do. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=276.94s)]
*  He's also called for a complete hand count of all ballots, which is not only less accurate [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=279.82s)]
*  and less secure, but it will take forever here in Arizona. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=284.7s)]
*  We're going to have well over four million eligible voters by the time we get to looking [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=288.58s)]
*  at our final rolls. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=292.86s)]
*  This is a real problem. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=294.3s)]
*  I want to get your reaction, sir, to the startling promise that Jim Marchant made. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=296.26s)]
*  He's obviously the GOP secretary of state candidate in Nevada. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=301.18s)]
*  And he made this to Trump supporters last week. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=306.98s)]
*  So we have something in common. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=309.58s)]
*  President Trump and I lost an election in 2020 because of a rigged election. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=312.78s)]
*  And when I'm secretary of state of Nevada, we're going to fix it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=318.97999999999996s)]
*  And President Trump is going to be president again in 2024. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=322.38s)]
*  It sounds like to me he wants to subvert our democracy and install himself and President [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=328.14s)]
*  Trump as, you know, former President Trump as the president in 2024. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=332.58s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=337.58s)]
*  Well, look, it's exactly the same thing that we saw in the debate I had. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=338.58s)]
*  Against my opponent, where they asked him what was different between 2020 and the primary [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=342.46000000000004s)]
*  in 2022, he said the candidates because there were no other problems, I guess, in August [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=346.98s)]
*  of 2022. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=352.02000000000004s)]
*  Look, these guys are Donald Trump bootlickers. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=353.82s)]
*  The whole thing comes from one lost election, one guy's hurt feelings, one set of snowflakes [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=356.18s)]
*  who cannot I guess they didn't play organized sports when they were kids or something [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=362.82s)]
*  because they just they're acting like children. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=367.22s)]
*  And that's a significant problem here. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=369.26s)]
*  But it's not just a problem for elections. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=371.46s)]
*  Elections, as I've said, are the golden thread that run through the fabric of our whole [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=373.34s)]
*  society. And everything is impacted by education, business, medicine, law, the arts and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=377.06s)]
*  sciences. All of that society is impacted. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=382.82s)]
*  If you pull that golden thread out, it all disintegrates. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=385.7s)]
*  And that's why we're hoping people will go to electfontus.com and help us out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  If you want to volunteer from around the country, that's great. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=394.06s)]
*  If you want to donate, that's really necessary to help get our message out, to make [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=396.97999999999996s)]
*  sure that we've got honor and integrity in the Arizona Secretary of State's office. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=401.06s)]
*  Adrian Fontes, it's a pleasure. Thank you so much for coming on. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=405.74s)]
*  Greatly appreciate you highlighting what's at stake for your state and certainly for [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=408.14s)]
*  our democracy nationwide. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=412.18s)]
*  Best of luck, sir. Thank you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=413.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=415.14s)]
*  Up next, there is stiff competition in our Worst of the Week series. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=416.14s)]
*  You got to stick around to find out who wins that one. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqAemBm6bvM&t=420.18s)]
