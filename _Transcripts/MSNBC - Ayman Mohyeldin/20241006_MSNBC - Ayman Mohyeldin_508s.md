**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY)
*  It's time for our worst of the week the delusional JD Vans defense edition the drama began in Tuesday's vice presidential debate when JD Vans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=0.0s)]
*  Continued his racist lies of Haitian immigrants overwhelming the community of Springfield, Ohio prompting a comment from the moderators [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=7.84s)]
*  Just to clarify for our viewers Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  temporary protected [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=24.68s)]
*  Thank you senator we have so much to get to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=27.24s)]
*  The rules were that you got a fact check [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=32.68s)]
*  The rules were that you guys weren't gonna fact-check aka you're supposed to let me lie and not interrupt my lying now [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=37.8s)]
*  CBS did say the onus was on the candidates to correct each other [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=45.36s)]
*  But the moderators made no promise to stay out of the fray completely well right on cue [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=49.32s)]
*  Vance's right-wing allies lashed out unsurprisingly we got the unexpected sexist rhetoric with Donald Trump referring to CBS moderators [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=55.0s)]
*  Margaret Brennan and Nora O'Donnell as young ladies on his failed social media site or this classy comment from Fox's alleged [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=62.4s)]
*  resident funnyman Greg Gutfeld [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=70.44s)]
*  Right yeah, they were nagging him and he was mansplaining them [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=74.08s)]
*  But it wasn't just the men [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  conservative women rushed to denigrate the moderators in Vance's defense case in point former Fox host turned MAGA [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  podcaster Megan Kelly [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=88.08s)]
*  The moderators are gross Margaret Brennan not only do you desperately need some bronzer [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=91.08s)]
*  You need to understand how to moderate a fair debate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  Lara Loomer demanded Vance put these broads in their place and MAGA commentator Ann Coulter came out of the woodwork with an old standby [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=101.24s)]
*  bimbos [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=110.24s)]
*  My panel is back with me [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=112.24s)]
*  I'll start with you Hayes. I mean, what do you think who do you out of all of these one? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=114.24s)]
*  It's pretty rich that blackface Megan Kelly is [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=118.24s)]
*  I mean [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=120.24s)]
*  like [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=122.24s)]
*  All of those were bad [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=124.24s)]
*  They were all bad this morning [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=126.24s)]
*  All of those were bad they were all bad this week [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=128.28s)]
*  I gotta say that the bronzer common is gonna stick with me just in terms of sheer but why yeah [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=131.4s)]
*  But why did you need to say that like a lot of the other insults were ridiculous? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  My favorite of the worst though was Donald Trump's young ladies though because it serves to remind us all that he is very old [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  right like like if like it is it is very grandpa calling like his grandkid who is in her like [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=149.24s)]
*  30s by now young lady energy out of him to do such a thing. What do you make of it? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=157.8s)]
*  I mean, it's again, you know the conservative women going after [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=163.16s)]
*  Other women in this kind of vulgar and demeaning way [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=166.68s)]
*  I nobody nobody actually debated the merits or countered the point or the merits of the argument [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=169.48s)]
*  Which means a it is a lie that they know that Springfield what they're saying about Springfield is a lie [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=176.36s)]
*  Demonstrably but they didn't actually try to argue the merits of the of what is being said about Springfield [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  They just attacked them whether it's about their looks or broads or bimbos or young or you know [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=189.32s)]
*  Not looking the way that Megyn Kelly wants them to look I [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  Mean, it's just [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=199.6s)]
*  Megyn Kelly is rich, you know in her commentary that she has as well as Laura Loomer because they believe that their proximity to maleness [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=201.44s)]
*  To the patriarchy to white men is going to save them [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=208.88s)]
*  They are the handmaids right like of white supremacy [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=211.6s)]
*  and so when you listen to the language that they use and I'm just like this is what like [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=215.0s)]
*  Megyn Kelly was part of the lawsuit at Fox right for sexual harassment [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=220.84s)]
*  And this is and people came people who were not Republicans came to her aid on social media [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=225.44s)]
*  And now I'm just like why would you do that? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=231.44s)]
*  Megyn Kelly is so destructive and disgusting as well as Laura Loomer [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  But this is who they are and they're being used and they like to be used frankly as these puppets [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  For white male supremacy so that they can be seen as like the good ones, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=246.2s)]
*  Like they're Trump's women and they like that tag just like he points to the blacks over there and he's just like oh my blacks [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  Those are his broads and he loves that and they love it, too [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=258.8s)]
*  Hayes let me we've seen some bizarre displays of fealty towards Vance this week, but this one from GOP congressman Mike Collins [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  It really takes the cake. I'm sure you guys have seen this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=269.22s)]
*  It's a GOP congressman Mike Collins posting this photo of Vance [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=272.92s)]
*  And let's pause and scrutinize this. I don't even know what to say about that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=277.04s)]
*  I mean looks like a couple of things happened here one they ran it through a literally yassified filter [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=282.48s)]
*  Like just a suck in those cheeks put that jawline out there make those eyes pop a little more or they just put in AI [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=288.16s)]
*  I mean I request for JD Vance, but you can't really tell [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=295.48s)]
*  What this is what makes me like fearful is that this is how they see [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=302.0s)]
*  Themselves it's like they're looking at themselves inside of a funhouse mirror. It doesn't make any sense [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=308.6s)]
*  Right like when they put Donald Trump on the Rambos body [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=315.44s)]
*  right like it's just that's what you see cuz that's not what I think the rainbow thing is kind of like whatever cuz it's it's I [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  Mean I get it the symbolism of it like they're trying to make him sound like this like tough guy American guy [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  But that this this is creepy that like that's cultish and it's weird and it's not normal [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=328.52s)]
*  I'm just curious who found that picture for Collins's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=339.28s)]
*  Twitter [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=344.12s)]
*  He might have made it he might have just typed into chat GPT or whatever give me [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=347.12s)]
*  Wow, I your words not my name and I'm just saying that's what the picture looks like I'm not like saying [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=354.76s)]
*  There's the bronzer that Megyn Kelly was looking for [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=361.08s)]
*  Let me play I got one more for you. Let me show you guys Jesse waters what he had to say about Vance's performance watch this [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=364.76s)]
*  JD Vance he looked beautiful tonight. He looked humble. He looked earnest sharp [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=371.48s)]
*  20 years younger than walls [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  There we go I'm sassed with the aesthetics of it all what do you I mean, what do you call? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  What do you think of JD Vance being called beautiful 20 years younger by Jesse waters? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=385.88s)]
*  I just don't I don't know what to say. I don't want to laugh at it because I feel like laughing trivializer [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  But it's like I get it's very cold, but it's very cultish. It's actually quite sad [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  Actually quite scary like this is how they see themselves and I've been following them on social media where they're just like, you know [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=399.96s)]
*  Oh now the gays love JD Vance and that's just like what gays like who? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=407.32s)]
*  Are you talking about? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=414.28s)]
*  Baffled by that I had a whole point I was going to make but that just threw me entirely off [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=419.96s)]
*  What were you gonna say about it? I was going to say I [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=426.52s)]
*  Honestly, I have completely blanked it just because I'm trying to struggle to think of who the gays are like the law [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=429.56s)]
*  Is it the law cagan kevin republicans literally because I am just gone at that statement [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=434.68s)]
*  This is what they want the aesthetics. They want this like look of of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=440.68s)]
*  But for jesse waters, he's beautiful for mike collins and the yassify [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=446.36s)]
*  I [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=451.02s)]
*  Is wild because jd vance did do a good job up there [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=453.9s)]
*  But as a like trumpish performance and just saying whatever the audience wanted here to go back to her point about [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=456.94s)]
*  Making up a fake republican party described right up there and do and he stylistically he was smooth [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=462.94s)]
*  He talked so he did talk well [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=469.5s)]
*  He's talking to me. I mean he was articulate to use a certain word [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=471.97999999999996s)]
*  But I mean the bar is low when you're being compared to trump your running mate [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=475.02s)]
*  If you can just get a coherent sentence out and not go spastic the way he did in the debate with kamala harris [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=478.38s)]
*  You know people are like, yeah jd vance actually did well compared to what trump has been doing [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzVZYU2cXY&t=483.74s)]
