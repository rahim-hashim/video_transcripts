# Amir Locke Family Attorney: Minneapolis Police Department Has A “Credibility Problem”
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ)
*  Joining me now is Antonio Romanucci. He is one of the lawyers representing Amir Locke's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=0.0s)]
*  family. He also represented George Floyd's family in their civil case against the city [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=5.2s)]
*  of Minneapolis and the four police officers involved in Floyd's death. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=8.76s)]
*  Mr. Romanucci, thank you so much for joining us this evening. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  In the statement that Minneapolis police put out on Wednesday, they referred to Locke as [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=15.48s)]
*  a suspect and said his gun was, quote, pointed in the direction of officers. We now know [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=20.8s)]
*  Locke was not listed on that warrant and the body camera footage really doesn't clearly [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=26.66s)]
*  show the gun pointed at an officer, at least certainly not from what I have seen of it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=31.86s)]
*  Do you think the Minneapolis police department deliberately misled the public or is misleading [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=35.86s)]
*  the public with that statement? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=41.2s)]
*  Well, Aiman, first of all, you did a great job setting up the scene in which Amir was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=43.14s)]
*  killed. It's a tragic circumstance without question. I'm really bothered by the narrative. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=48.42s)]
*  Not only am I bothered by the narrative that we heard from the Minneapolis police department, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=54.64s)]
*  but look, I have to tell you, I'm bothered by the narratives that police departments [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=58.82s)]
*  put out after people are killed because the narratives always are used as a means to justify [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=63.08s)]
*  the shooting. And that's what happened here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=68.92s)]
*  So the words were written deliberately. Whether or not they were deliberate in what they meant [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=72.52s)]
*  to say, we have to admit, we have to say what it is. Those words were put on there deliberately [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=78.0s)]
*  because if indeed the gun was pointed at a police officer, they're trying to use that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=83.98s)]
*  as a means of justification. And even if the gun was pointed under these circumstances, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=89.78s)]
*  this was an unjustified killing of a young man on a no-knock warrant, which he wasn't [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  named in way early in the morning when he was surprised within a matter of seconds. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=103.02000000000001s)]
*  So yes, I am very bothered by this narrative. And I think this is where police departments [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=109.54s)]
*  need to change immediately in order to show transparency. They're not transparent when [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=114.58000000000001s)]
*  they come out with narratives which speak police language and which only attempt to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=119.92s)]
*  justify their actions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I wanted to hone in on that for a moment because it's a very important point. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  And as I mentioned, you also represented George Floyd's family. And what's interesting in [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=130.46s)]
*  that case as well is that the first police statement also did not match up with what [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=134.5s)]
*  we later saw when the footage was ultimately released, that cell phone footage and all [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=138.17999999999998s)]
*  the documenting evidence surrounding it. This doesn't seem like an isolated incident. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=143.61999999999998s)]
*  The Minneapolis Police Department here clearly has a credibility problem. And just as a member [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=148.5s)]
*  of the community there, what kind of impact does that have on the community? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=153.66s)]
*  Well, I mean, obviously, when you don't have trust, it creates mistrust between both police [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=159.33999999999997s)]
*  and community. And so many times we hear police departments say, well, we need the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=165.9s)]
*  community's assistance in either solving crimes or keeping crime down. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, you can't have it both ways. You have to have the cooperation both ways. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=175.82s)]
*  And right now, Minneapolis has a credibility problem. We heard after George Floyd was [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=180.62s)]
*  killed, the first narrative we heard there was that Mr. Floyd had a medical emergency. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, the medical emergency was somebody choking him to death for nine and a half [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=192.22s)]
*  minutes here with a mirror. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=196.54000000000002s)]
*  We hear the police say that they were continuously announcing their office and their [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=198.62s)]
*  purpose for being there while a mirror was pointing a gun at somebody. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=202.58s)]
*  And the body worn camera that we see does not match up at all. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=206.10000000000002s)]
*  So we have to straighten out this narrative in order to gain trust and be credible [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=210.46s)]
*  with the community. That is one of the simplest things that can be done for police [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=217.5s)]
*  departments in order to engage their community. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=221.82s)]
*  And we see how hard it is for departments to do that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=224.34s)]
*  Can you shed some light on what you've been able to ascertain so far, either from the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=229.34s)]
*  family's conversation with the Minneapolis Police Department surrounding this? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=233.34s)]
*  And more importantly, do you have confidence that this investigation can be carried out by [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=236.9s)]
*  the Minneapolis Police Department? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=241.98s)]
*  It seems counterintuitive to me that a police department that is involved in a shooting [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=243.26s)]
*  of a potentially innocent man on a couch is also asked to carry out that investigation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=248.18s)]
*  Are you seeking an independent investigation from a jurisdiction beyond the Minneapolis [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=253.7s)]
*  Police Department here? What do you and the family want to see happen right now? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=259.42s)]
*  I'm sorry, I asked a lot of questions surrounding this, but I'm just trying to get as much [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=262.62s)]
*  information in terms of what the family wants to see and how the investigation should [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=266.58s)]
*  proceed from here on out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=270.54s)]
*  Well, the one thing we do know is that Attorney General Keith Allison will be investigating. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=272.58s)]
*  I think that is a good thing because that is independent. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=277.5s)]
*  Although the attorney general is technically not a police agency, they are the highest [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=280.9s)]
*  legal authority in the state of Minnesota. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  So I do have confidence that the attorney general office will conduct a very thorough [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=289.82s)]
*  investigation. So let's see what they have to say. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=295.29999999999995s)]
*  Secondly, what does the family want? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=298.46s)]
*  Well, the family clearly requires is not not asking, but they require and they demand [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=300.3s)]
*  justice. They demand criminal justice. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=306.82s)]
*  They demand administrative justice and they will demand civil justice. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  They want everything across the board here because there is no way that a mirror should [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=313.3s)]
*  be done right now. Had the police department done what they should have done? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=318.58000000000004s)]
*  Had they really articulated the reason, the dangerousness for a no knock warrant? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  Which we see did not exist. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  A mirror would be alive right now. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=332.5s)]
*  One of the points that people have brought up, certainly activists, is that the lessons [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=335.82s)]
*  of what happened to Breonna Taylor were not learned, if you will, by other police [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=339.22s)]
*  departments across the country. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=344.14s)]
*  And it's part of the reason why people are calling for a national effort to reform [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=345.5s)]
*  police departments in this country. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=349.94s)]
*  We know that has been fought and pushed back against. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=351.66s)]
*  People say it has to happen in a different community. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=354.98s)]
*  Local communities have to make these decisions. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=357.06s)]
*  Had there been a lesson learned from the Breonna Taylor that no knock warrants were not [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=359.14s)]
*  necessarily effective or could have prevented a mere locks death, would we have found [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=364.18s)]
*  ourselves in this situation if Minneapolis would have learned its lessons following [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=367.82s)]
*  what happened to Breonna Taylor? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=371.82s)]
*  Very likely not. What we do know is recent statistics show that there are over [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=375.14s)]
*  sixty thousand no knock raids carried out per year. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=379.78s)]
*  That's exorbitant. It's extraordinary. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=383.78s)]
*  And once we learn a lesson, and I heard your prior show before before the top of the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=386.62s)]
*  hour, when will the lessons be learned? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=391.22s)]
*  See, we take too much time in trying to learn lessons. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=394.58s)]
*  Municipalities that run police departments where police officers are sworn to uphold [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=398.62s)]
*  the law and they wear a badge and they carry a gun and they can they have the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=404.02s)]
*  authority to kill people when necessary. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=408.58000000000004s)]
*  If you don't learn lessons when there is bad policing, then you cannot carry out [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=411.82s)]
*  good policing because then it turns into this right here. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=416.53999999999996s)]
*  We're having this discussion. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txuMzbEETQ&t=419.74s)]
