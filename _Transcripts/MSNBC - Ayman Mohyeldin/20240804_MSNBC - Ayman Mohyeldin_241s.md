# Elon Musk ramps up efforts to tip the election to Trump, including misleading PAC website
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q)
*  Donald Trump and his Republican allies have long accused social media platforms like X [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  of helping to tip the scales toward President Biden in 2020. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Now this baseless claim was even furthered by Elon Musk, the billionaire who went on [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=10.16s)]
*  to buy X. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  In fact, he began his reign in 2022 by accusing the previous leadership at X of interfering [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=16.8s)]
*  in elections. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Musk vowed that the site would be, quote, far more effective, transparent, and even [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=24.8s)]
*  handed under his watch. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, he's now failed that standard spectacularly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=32.2s)]
*  Let's go through some of these developments from just this past week. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=36.16s)]
*  Last weekend, Musk, who recently endorsed Donald Trump, shared a parody Harris campaign [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=39.8s)]
*  ad with his more than 192 million followers. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  The DPEC video contained deceptively altered audio of Harris referring to herself as a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=49.6s)]
*  quote, ultimate diversity hire. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=54.52s)]
*  Musk posted it without labeling it as misleading. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=57.32s)]
*  That's an apparent violation of his own platform's policy on sharing manipulated data. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=60.88s)]
*  Gavin Newsom was quick to condemn it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=67.44s)]
*  The California governor said manipulating a voice in an ad should be illegal and vowed [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=69.0s)]
*  to sign a bill that would ban such practices. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  Now Musk, in his typically petulant fashion, attacked Newsom while defending the post as [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  a form of parody. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=83.36s)]
*  Since then, he has seemingly upped his efforts to help Trump using his social media platform. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=86.0s)]
*  On Monday, after the pro-Harris group White Dudes for Harris raised more than $4 million [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=92.0s)]
*  on a fundraising call, their X account was suspended for several hours. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Company said it was initiated by a user report and was due to quote, evading suspension rules. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=102.8s)]
*  Our account was reinstated the next day following a backlash. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=109.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, Musk has started to add an important caveat when discussing a potential Harris [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=113.08s)]
*  win in November. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=117.88s)]
*  In an interview published on Thursday, Musk told the Atlantic quote, if there are questions [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=119.8s)]
*  of election integrity, they should be properly investigated and neither be dismissed out [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  of hand nor unreasonably questioned. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  If after review of the election results, it turns out that Kamala wins, that win should [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=133.32s)]
*  be recognized and not disputed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=138.76s)]
*  The key word there is of course, if. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=140.28s)]
*  And that takes us to the new CNBC report yesterday on a pack created by Musk called America Pack. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=144.84s)]
*  The piece focuses on its website, which ostensibly helps register people to vote. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=151.84s)]
*  But depending on where you live, results may vary. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  If the user lives in a state that is not considered competitive, like Wyoming or California, they [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=162.44s)]
*  are prompted to enter their email address and zip code before being quickly directed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=168.44s)]
*  to a voter registration page for their state. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=173.04s)]
*  But if a user lives in a battleground state like Pennsylvania or Georgia, they are prompted [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=176.56s)]
*  to give highly personal information. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=181.76s)]
*  Instead of being directed to a voter registration page, they're shown a simple thank you page [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=184.16s)]
*  instead. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=188.4s)]
*  That swing state user won't get any help registering, but they will have handed over [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  personal data to a political operation created by the richest man in the world who happens [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=194.16s)]
*  to be endorsing Donald Trump. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=199.52s)]
*  America's Packs website does not disclose any political innings, but in federal filings, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=203.16s)]
*  the group says its work is designed to either help Trump or hurt his opponent, much like [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  we see Elon Musk's doing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=213.6s)]
*  Now keep in mind, everything we shared tonight happened over just seven days. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWpCsEsj0Q&t=215.2s)]
