# Jim Jordan attempts to counter-program Trump's legal drama
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM)
*  The world may have been busy looking at Donald Trump's mugshot this past week, but that did [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=0.0s)]
*  not stop the GOP's relentless attempts to counter-program the ex-president's legal drama [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=7.48s)]
*  in a move that surprised no one. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=12.92s)]
*  Republican House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan demanded that information from Fulton County [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=15.24s)]
*  DA Fannie Willis' office about her probe that resulted in those criminal racketeering charges [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=19.8s)]
*  for Trump and his allies be handed over. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=25.14s)]
*  In the letter obtained by NBC News, Jordan writes, there are questions about whether [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=28.48s)]
*  and how your office coordinated with DOJ Special Counsel Jack Smith during the course of this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=32.44s)]
*  investigation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=38.84s)]
*  To be clear, there is no evidence of coordination. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=40.32s)]
*  He is asking Willis to submit all documents related to her office's use of federal funds [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=43.8s)]
*  and all communications with DOJ and executive branch officials regarding her investigation [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=48.2s)]
*  due by September 7th. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=54.52s)]
*  Of course, you may recall that Jordan issued a similar demand of New York DA Alvin Bragg [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  after Trump was charged in his hush money probe. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=60.92s)]
*  And of course, not to be outdone, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy now warning that Republicans [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=63.92s)]
*  could move forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Biden if they don't receive [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  documents they are now demanding from Biden family members. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=73.48s)]
*  That includes bank statements and credit card statements. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=76.98s)]
*  And just this morning, he called it a quote, natural step forward. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=79.72s)]
*  This is, of course, again, all part of the House GOP's long running obsession to prove [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=83.4s)]
*  President Biden benefited from his son Hunter's foreign businesses by taking a bribe from [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  a Ukrainian energy company. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=94.68s)]
*  Again, there's no evidence of that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=96.56s)]
*  In fact, White House Republicans have found, you know, what they have found contradicts [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  their own theories. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=104.12s)]
*  As Philip Bump writes in the Washington Post, any freshman year philosophy student can identify [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=105.44s)]
*  the flaw here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=110.10000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden could turn over years of bank records, submitting them to endless scrutiny. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=111.56s)]
*  But McCarthy and his allies could simply insist that something was still missing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=117.0s)]
*  And there you have it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=122.76s)]
*  Republican counterprogramming 101. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=124.58s)]
*  But at the end of the day, the ex-president is still facing 91 charges across four criminal [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=127.04s)]
*  cases and jurisdictions and no amount of political stunts by Jim Jordan or Kevin McCarthy or [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=131.2s)]
*  anyone else is going to change that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=136.44s)]
*  Joyce Vance and Christina Greer are back with me. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=139.48s)]
*  Joyce, legally, what is Jim Jordan hoping to find here and what obligations does Fannie [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=142.12s)]
*  Willis have to send it over? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=147.72s)]
*  Because last I checked, there is nothing wrong with her talking to Jack Smith, who is investigating [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=149.14s)]
*  the same crime, the attempt to overturn an election. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  You're 100% correct about that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=160.84s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with federal and state prosecutors coordinating. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  It happens all the time, every day in this country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=167.12s)]
*  Jim Jordan knows that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  He knows that Fannie Willis will not comply with his demands because they are improper, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=172.28s)]
*  just like the ones made to Alvin Bragg in Manhattan were. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=177.44s)]
*  So our only possible takeaway here is that Jordan is not engaging in some form of legitimate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=181.0s)]
*  congressional oversight. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=187.12s)]
*  This is just political posturing at its worst. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=189.28s)]
*  He's hoping he can cast aspersions. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=192.08s)]
*  He can convince people who are poorly informed that something inappropriate happened. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=194.66s)]
*  It's really a desperate last gasp at trying to delegitimize Fannie Willis' prosecution. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=200.34s)]
*  Christina, I want to turn now to this warning of an impeachment inquiry from Speaker McCarthy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=205.7s)]
*  Philip Bump in the Washington Post put it like this, that if an impeachment inquiry [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=211.06s)]
*  were to move forward, one might hope that it would be conducted with an eye toward fairness, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=214.66s)]
*  objectivity and impartiality, all of which McCarthy demanded of then Speaker Nancy Pelosi [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=218.82s)]
*  in 2019. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=223.82000000000002s)]
*  We know that is not going to happen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=225.24s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=228.86s)]
*  I mean, as Joyce just laid out, we're not dealing with a party that is in a rational [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=229.86s)]
*  mind. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=233.58s)]
*  And so this is the party that said even before Joe Biden was elected as president of the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=234.58s)]
*  United States, they said they were going to impeach him. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  The questions were, well, for what? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=241.58s)]
*  And they were like, don't worry about it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  We'll figure it out later. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=244.22s)]
*  But we're definitely going to impeach him. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=245.22s)]
*  These are plans that they had well before he even took office. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=247.26000000000002s)]
*  But I do want to circle back, Aimen, to something Joyce said. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=250.46s)]
*  We need to put our cards on the table here and recognize that Jim Jordan's a part of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=253.46s)]
*  his reticence to try and delegitimize Fannie Willis is also the fact that she's African [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  American, as is Al Bragg, as is Tish James. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=262.02s)]
*  And so all he has to do is go back to his Trump supporters and say, look, these very [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=265.3s)]
*  educated, highfalutin African Americans are clearly trying to attack our president. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=270.06s)]
*  And that's all his supporters need to hear. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=274.86s)]
*  This is the same reason why Donald Trump wanted to move one of his trials from D.C. to West [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=276.46s)]
*  Virginia, because he wanted a more diverse jury pool, meaning he wanted to move it from [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=282.1s)]
*  a territory that has 45 percent African Americans to a place in West Virginia where there are [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=287.06s)]
*  what, three or four percent African Americans. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=293.38s)]
*  So this goes back to a larger racialized, racist ideology that Donald Trump has had, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=295.54s)]
*  not just as president, but well before he was elected. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=300.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=302.42s)]
*  And the thing is, I mean, Christina, this is something we've seen them do with Hillary [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=303.42s)]
*  Clinton time and time again. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=305.74s)]
*  Of course, everyone here remembers Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=306.94s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy spelled it out. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=310.26000000000005s)]
*  He said, clear as day, he said, look what we did with her poll numbers after we created [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=311.54s)]
*  this select committee on Benghazi. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=315.46s)]
*  And that's what it seems they're trying to do with this Hunter Biden probe and trying [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=316.94s)]
*  to connect it to the president when we know that most Americans do not connect Hunter [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=321.46s)]
*  Biden's legal issues with President Biden. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=326.08s)]
*  Absolutely not, Eamon. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=329.98s)]
*  And don't forget, this is the same thing that they did with Barack Obama's birth certificate. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=330.98s)]
*  As you said, it will never be enough. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=335.5s)]
*  So as much as Joe Biden can show every single receipt from 1972 to the present, it will [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=337.14s)]
*  never be enough. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=344.3s)]
*  And so I think if you sort of keep that in mind, you recognize that you're not dealing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=345.3s)]
*  with a good faith effort with the Republican Party. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=349.3s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say never play into their hands. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=351.5s)]
*  Christina Greer, Joyce fans, thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=353.78s)]
*  Greatly appreciate it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=356.53999999999996s)]
*  And your insights as always. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWcS2IiB2RM&t=357.65999999999997s)]
