Video Description: The White House and Senate Democrats had two pieces of legislation they wanted to pass before the midterms. One was the so-called CHIPS bill, which would provide funding for American-made semiconductors. The other was a re-negotiated, slimmed-down version of President Biden's Build Back Better proposal from last year. As MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin explains, thanks to some brilliant, backroom negotiating between Senators Manchin and Schumer – along with a little sleight of hand – it now appears Democrats will have their cake and eat it too.

# Senator Hickenlooper Breaks Down How the Surprise IRA Compromise Came About
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g)
*  Senator Hickenlooper, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=0.0s)]
*  According to Axios, sir, you had an integral role in getting senators Schumer and Manchin [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=6.2s)]
*  back to the negotiating table on reconciliation, which is great for us and really great for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=11.78s)]
*  the climate. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=16.16s)]
*  Tell me what you were saying to them to get them back to the table. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=17.16s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, let's be clear that Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin are the ones [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=20.12s)]
*  that created this and negotiated it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=26.68s)]
*  I just tried to be the positive, optimistic force that any time there was disruptions, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  I try to push through them and make sure that everybody else was kind of coming along. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  For a while there, Democrats all over the country were giving up, and it was just too [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=41.76s)]
*  important for us to give up. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=47.64s)]
*  Yeah, no, absolutely. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=49.68s)]
*  And I think that's why a lot of people are appreciative to your efforts and certainly [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Senator Schumer and Manchin as well for getting this deal done. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=55.92s)]
*  Do you think Senator Sinema will get on board? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=60.28s)]
*  Oh, I think so. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=63.28s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=65.28s)]
*  I haven't talked to her, but she is a real patriot in terms of climate rescue. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=66.28s)]
*  She understands the sense of urgency that we all need to have, that the clock is running [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=72.92s)]
*  on how we are heating up the planet. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=77.84s)]
*  I know she has issues with, she's a very detail-oriented person and very smart, but I think they'll [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=82.48s)]
*  work out. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=89.6s)]
*  She and Senator Schumer are going to work through to get to a solution, I hope. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=90.6s)]
*  Do you, based on what you've been able to see either in these negotiations and broadly [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=96.6s)]
*  speaking, do you feel that you can get any of your Republican colleagues or your Republican [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  counterparts, rather, on board as well? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=105.68s)]
*  I don't know if we will. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  Probably not because they've locked down. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's the word. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=115.08s)]
*  They're going to oppose this at every single level. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=116.63999999999999s)]
*  But when you talk privately to a lot of Republicans, they believe that climate change is real, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  and they understand that we've got to take some bold action. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  When we do these kinds of initiatives, start building solar energy at scale, the prices [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  drop dramatically, which really helps the entire world. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  If you look at solar now over the last 10 years, it's dropped almost 90 percent. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=137.04s)]
*  Look at wind has dropped 80 percent. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=140.88s)]
*  These are huge benefits of these kinds of government incentives. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=143.32s)]
*  Let's if we can talk, sir, about the specifics of the reconciliation deal. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=149.84s)]
*  There are big investments, as we were just saying, on climate change, on prescription [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=154.16s)]
*  drug pricing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=159.28s)]
*  Walk me through some of the specific contours of the reconciliation bill that you think [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=160.28s)]
*  are important to highlight. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think, again, three hundred and sixty nine billion dollars to address climate climate [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=167.56s)]
*  rescue is huge. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  There's three hundred billion dollars to reduce the deficit. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  People talk about the inflation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=177.4s)]
*  One way to address inflation is to go at the at the deficit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=178.52s)]
*  You're going to have a hundred billion dollars towards renewable resource energy, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  ten billion dollars to help working families get rooftops, solar or heat pumps in their [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=188.4s)]
*  houses, you know, help them afford electric vehicles. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=193.96s)]
*  This is really the first comprehensive step to going at climate change head on. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=199.4s)]
*  And yet we have to remember this is just the beginning. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=206.24s)]
*  This is not the end of anything. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=208.84s)]
*  We we're still not dealing with transmission lines at the scale we're going to need to. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=210.36s)]
*  We've done so much, but there's still so much that needs to be done. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  Sadly, one of the reactions from your counterparts, the Senate Republicans, was to delay to this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=219.96s)]
*  deal was to stall and delay legislation to actually help veterans exposed to burn pits. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=225.8s)]
*  Your reaction to that? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=232.52s)]
*  I think most Americans understand that politics can be a difficult game, but this is a this [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=233.52s)]
*  is a particularly gruesome low by the Republicans to not help veterans exposed to burn pits [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  just because Democrats struck a deal on reconciliation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=246.16s)]
*  Well, to say that I'm disappointed is an understatement and I don't understand how they connect in politics. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=251.0s)]
*  Sometimes things don't connect, but I'm hopeful that we'll get another vote this week, this coming week, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=257.44s)]
*  and we can make sure that veterans get the support they need. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=262.68s)]
*  I mean, these people are fighting to protect us, to protect our freedoms. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=267.44s)]
*  And when they come when they come down with these horrible diseases, various cancers, all kinds of respiratory issues [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=271.20000000000005s)]
*  that are clearly the result of having lived close to these burn pits, toxins of all, I mean, medical waste supplies, old cars all burning in these pits. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=278.16s)]
*  Some of them have the size of have a football field. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  We need to support them. How can we question that? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=292.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and there's also growing concerns, sir. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=296.44s)]
*  And I'm sure you've seen this Senator Susan Collins saying that some Senate Republicans might now oppose codifying same sex marriage because of this reconciliation deal. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=299.2s)]
*  Have you heard anything to that effect? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=310.08s)]
*  I mean, is she serious about this? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=312.12s)]
*  And again, what would this mean for that effort? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=313.56s)]
*  Well, I don't really understand. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=318.52s)]
*  Chuck Schumer never said that by getting you seek a done, you know, the Chips Act, that we weren't going to do reconciliation. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  And as Joe Manchin said consistently all the way along, he hadn't stopped negotiating. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=329.0s)]
*  He said, I'm done to a group of reporters on a Thursday or Friday. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  But that just meant he was done talking to them. Now he's just had enough. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=339.92s)]
*  But I saw him the next Monday and he said, no, no, I'm still negotiating and working on this stuff and willing to talk to Chuck. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=343.64s)]
*  And, you know, let's take this thing forward. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=349.32s)]
*  So if if if Joe Manchin and Chuck Schumer were always still working on this and Joe Manchin was openly in several media was was quoted as saying he was still working on it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=351.56s)]
*  The Republicans are getting so angry that, you know, that somehow the Chips Act passed and then the reconciliation went forward. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=363.68s)]
*  I don't think that was a political device that Chuck Schumer put together. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=371.12s)]
*  I think that was just how things broke. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=375.2s)]
*  Maybe they waited a couple of hours or or not. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. But I don't see what it has to do with same sex marriage. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=379.72s)]
*  I don't see what it has to do with medical benefits for our veterans. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=383.24s)]
*  How do Democrats take on this achievement, you know, if it does get passed and ultimately signed into law and build on the momentum going into the midterms? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=389.52s)]
*  Because the truth is, Democrats are getting things done, but it doesn't necessarily seem they're good at selling that they're getting things done to the American voters. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=399.88s)]
*  And so there's this perception that nothing is getting done in Washington. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=408.52s)]
*  How do you change that dynamic ahead of the midterms? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=411.28s)]
*  Well, part of it is talking about what we've got done. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=415.4s)]
*  That's why Joe Manchin came up with the the name of this bill is the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=418.12s)]
*  And, you know, it is going to I'm not sure how much it will reduce inflation, but it will certainly slow it down. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, giving relief to people when they're buying prescription drugs is going to be a big deal. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=432.36s)]
*  Three hundred billion dollars to reduce the deficit. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=436.76s)]
*  That's a big deal. Looking at ways to help working people afford a electric vehicle. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=439.16s)]
*  Four thousand dollars for used vehicles. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=444.8s)]
*  Electric vehicles are for sale used out there for twelve, fourteen thousand dollars. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=446.68s)]
*  This will help people afford that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  These are all clear ways that were that this is going to help people in their in their monthly household budgets. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=452.6s)]
*  And we should talk about it. We haven't. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=459.32s)]
*  The Democrats are too busy throwing stones at each other sometimes than to recognize how much we as a group have done for this country. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=461.32s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And can't let the Republicans as well define define the narrative for what the Democrats are doing on the Hill as well. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  They seem to be doing that quite consistently. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=477.72s)]
*  I think that the the really the Republicans have become the party of chaos and Democrats are really the party of stability. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=481.28s)]
*  That's a that's a big switch over the last several decades ago. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=488.64s)]
*  Senator John Hickenlooper, sir, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=493.84s)]
*  I greatly appreciate your time. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=496.2s)]
*  No, my pleasure. Thank you. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpikr3ige3g&t=498.44s)]
