# Meet the county official debunking & dismantling Elon Musk's election lies
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg)
*  I want to tell you about a guy from Arizona, a guy who's in charge of a lot of documents, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=0.0s)]
*  and you probably won't know his name, and you probably won't know what his job title even means. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=4.64s)]
*  He's a Republican, and he's become one of MAGA's top targets in their war on truth. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Stephen Richer is the Maricopa County recorder in charge of maintaining voter files for more than [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=14.4s)]
*  2.6 million active registered voters. And in this position, he's had to fend off attacks from some [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=19.12s)]
*  of Trump's most unhinged allies, including failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=25.36s)]
*  who baselessly accused him of sabotage that led to her loss against Governor Katie Hobs. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=31.04s)]
*  And Shelby Bush, chair of the state's delegation to the Republican convention, who said this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=36.0s)]
*  But if Stephen Richer walked in this room, I would lynch him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=41.84s)]
*  His most recent adversary, ex-owner and infamous Trump suck-up Elon Musk, back in April, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=46.0s)]
*  Musk reposted a totally false claim that more than 200,000 illegal immigrants had registered [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=51.6s)]
*  to vote in Arizona. Richard took Musk to task, politely eviscerating him with facts on his own [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=57.28s)]
*  platform, pointing out that there is zero validity to his suggestion. Then in July, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=62.56s)]
*  Musk continued his voter fraud obsession, posting, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=67.76s)]
*  Once again, Richard responded, this time with a more than generous offer to give Musk a tour [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=70.56s)]
*  of the Maricopa County election facility to show him the security steps that are already in place. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=82.48s)]
*  He even offered to take recommendations from Musk afterwards, writing, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=88.16s)]
*  And then finally, just this past week, more trolling from Musk, who asked on X, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=101.28s)]
*  Arizona is refusing to remove illegals from voter rolls? Referencing a baseless lawsuit filed by [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=106.08s)]
*  Stephen Miller's MAGA law firm against all 15 Arizona counties. Once again, and by this point, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=112.4s)]
*  he has the patience of a saint. Richard responded, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=118.48s)]
*  He went on to explain that more than 50 lawsuits alleging voter fraud have been [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=131.28s)]
*  filed against him and his office since he took the job, and they have not lost a single one. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=136.24s)]
*  Maricopa County recorder Stephen Richard joins me now. A pretty impressive record, I have to say, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  with all the victories that you've managed. And I have to give you mad props for being, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=151.04s)]
*  for having the stamina to respond to all of these people. But it really speaks to a testament to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=155.36s)]
*  the people who work in this country on the front lines of protecting our democracy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=161.36s)]
*  But I want to get you I want to get to the lawsuit first. I got to ask what made you want to take on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=164.8s)]
*  Elon Musk in this way? Well, it was just flabbergasting that he would just take as complete truth. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  Lawsuit that had been filed by a very partisan, very politically motivated group that has lost [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=177.68s)]
*  many lawsuits in the past without even bothering to look at our response or any of the things that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=184.56s)]
*  we post to social media. And so ordinarily, I would say that's not problematic. But when it comes from [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=190.24s)]
*  an account that has two bazillion followers, and some people take it as gospel. So tell us a little [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=195.68s)]
*  bit about the lawsuit that's been launched against you by America First Legal. Why is your county, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=201.84s)]
*  along with these 14 other counties in Arizona, being sued? Why are they so obsessed with you [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=206.64s)]
*  and Arizona? Well, I think they're obsessed with Arizona because Arizona is a battleground state, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=212.32s)]
*  and Arizona was the locus of so many of the allegations that there was a stolen election in [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=219.04s)]
*  2020. Now, I'm sure that they would say, well, Arizona is a border state, and so we have a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=225.28s)]
*  particular interest in maintaining the integrity of the process. Well, fortunately, and something [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  that Musk fails to note, Arizona is one of few states in the country that has a documented [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=236.88s)]
*  proof of citizenship law in order to be able to vote a full ballot. So while Arizona, according [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=243.44s)]
*  to Musk, is way behind every other state and is refusing to do these basic securities, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=250.64s)]
*  we're actually ahead of most states. And the numbers that were cited in Musk's post were just [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=255.68s)]
*  wildly inaccurate. So aside from that, I guess it was a productive post. Yeah, I mean, you bring up [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=260.48s)]
*  such a good point. I'm so glad that you kind of just dismantle it like the way that you just did. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  And it raises the point that, I mean, it's one thing for Republicans to be spreading [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=270.56s)]
*  these voter fraud lies. But when you're one of the richest men in the world and you have a platform, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=274.8s)]
*  as you said, hundreds of millions of followers, Elon Musk platforming these conspiracy theories, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  not to mention the attacks from people like Stephen Miller, it actually is not just about [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  the disinformation. I mean, what kind of danger does this put you and your colleagues? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=290.16s)]
*  No. Well, I don't remember whether it was Spider-Man or George W. Bush who said, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=294.88s)]
*  with great power comes great responsibility. But I think there's some truth to that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=301.44s)]
*  And when people like Mr. Musk post on Twitter or speak to various news outlets, and it's just [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=306.88s)]
*  filled with innuendo or filled with lies or filled with inaccurate information, then it's offices [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=314.24s)]
*  like mine and the 150 full-time employees that are in my office who see the downstream effects [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=320.16s)]
*  of that. And I will tell you that while some downstream effects take the form of, hey, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=326.72s)]
*  I'd like to know more about what Mr. Musk is posting, some take a very ugly and very violent form. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=331.68s)]
*  And I'm just here to say to those leaders and people like Mr. Musk, please be a little more [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=338.88s)]
*  judicious. Please do a little more information on the front end so that we don't have to witness [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=344.32000000000005s)]
*  this ugliness and these attacks on our institutions on the back end. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=349.52s)]
*  And I want to talk to you more broadly about the attacks, because as I mentioned, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  you're a Republican. You famously have stood up against Trump's election lies. And for that, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=358.32s)]
*  you have become a target in the MAGA world in 2021. He accused you of deleting files from the 2020 [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=363.28s)]
*  election. We played that clip of Shelby Bush, the Maricopa County Republican Party vice chair, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=369.2s)]
*  saying that she'd lynch you, an act of political violence, a threat. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=375.84s)]
*  Tell us what it's been like for you as a Republican becoming a major MAGA target. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=380.08s)]
*  It's disappointing. It's disillusioning. It's bizarre. I would say I line up with [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=386.64s)]
*  traditional conservative values on at least 18 out of 20 items. But the reality is that the facts, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=394.0s)]
*  the truth, the law was never on the side of the people who want to allege mass fraud in our [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=402.96s)]
*  electoral system, was never on the side of the people who want to say that the 2020 election [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  was stolen. And you said at the outset, very kindly, thank you, that my office has faced more [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  than 50 lawsuits and that we've won all those. And it's not because we're brilliant or we went to, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=420.0s)]
*  you know, I went to University of Chicago, which I like to think is the best law school, but it has [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=425.84s)]
*  nothing to do with that. It has to do with the facts and the law being on our side. And it's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=430.08s)]
*  really just that simple. And I have been stubborn in pointing out those facts. And for that, it has, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  of course, provoked much ire. And it is just saddening to see what has come. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  How alarmed are you at the reality that Arizona Republicans are still supportive of these [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=447.76s)]
*  election lies almost four years on? I mean, last month, you lost your primary race to state [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=454.08s)]
*  representative Justin Heap, who was endorsed by many prominent Arizona Republicans who refused to [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=459.2s)]
*  accept Joe Biden's victory, including Kerry Lake. Yeah. I mean, we're the party of Abraham Lincoln. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=464.24s)]
*  We're the party of Ronald Reagan. We're the idea set of Milton Friedman, of F. A. Hayek, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=473.28s)]
*  and Bill Buckley. And we've bastardized all of that to just fixate on this one falsity, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=477.76s)]
*  which is that the election was stolen. But yet that has become so central to what it means to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=484.4s)]
*  be a Republican here in Arizona, such that when I didn't want to get on board with that, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=490.4s)]
*  it was disqualifying in the primary in 2024. It was disqualifying for many Republicans in [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=495.68s)]
*  the primary in 2022 in terms of gubernatorial U.S. Senate. But the sort of the catches is that [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=501.28s)]
*  it also makes it very hard to win a general election in a competitive state like Arizona. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=508.88s)]
*  And so not only have we bought into this falsity full, full, full stop, but we're also losing [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=514.32s)]
*  general elections left and right. And so the Republican Party of McCain, John Kyle, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=520.8s)]
*  Jeff Flake, Doug Ducey has been hollowed out. And I think that's one of the other of the many side [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=527.2s)]
*  of sad side effects of Trump's presidency is the destruction of the Arizona Republican Party. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=533.2s)]
*  Can I ask you really quickly before we go, just because this week there have been Republicans, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=538.48s)]
*  big name Republicans like Dick Cheney and his daughter who've come out to endorse the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=542.32s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris. You don't have to answer this question, but have you made up [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=547.44s)]
*  your mind on who you would vote for given what you've outlined, what you've personally experienced [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=552.0s)]
*  as a defender of our democracy? So in my role as an election minister, I don't typically talk about [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  races too much, but I have made up my mind and I will never vote for anyone who gives purchase [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=563.5200000000001s)]
*  to these lies about something as fundamental to our system of governance as was the 2020 election [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=570.96s)]
*  storm. Steven Richer, I greatly appreciate your time and your insights. Thank you for everything [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=577.2s)]
*  you're doing to protect our democracy in Maricopa County. Thank you very much. Thank you for having [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=581.44s)]
*  me. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0ZStAispg&t=600.96s)]
