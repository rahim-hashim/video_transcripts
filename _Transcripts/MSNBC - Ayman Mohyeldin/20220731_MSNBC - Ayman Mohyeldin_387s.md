# Mothers Against Greg Abbott’s Viral Ad A New Messaging Model?
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA)
*  When you think of the term MAGA, you most likely think of Donald Trump. But there is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=0.0s)]
*  a different group that is now using that same acronym that wants you to think of something [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=8.16s)]
*  else, Mothers Against Greg Abbott. The group is a collection of Democrats, moderate Republicans [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=12.64s)]
*  and independents in Texas working together in the hopes of ousting the Texas governor [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=18.88s)]
*  come November. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=23.28s)]
*  And just this week, the group released a new powerful ad hitting Abbott's anti-abortion [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=24.34s)]
*  policies. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=29.12s)]
*  My Saturday night panel is back with me. We all know who that Greg that they're talking [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=56.4s)]
*  about is, Texas Governor Greg Abbott. Dean, your reaction to this ad from Mothers Against [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=60.48s)]
*  Greg Abbott? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=65.36s)]
*  This is great. Democrats, if you're watching, you got to do more of this. It was funny. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=67.98s)]
*  It made a great point. It made the point that Republicans don't want to come between you [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=73.28s)]
*  and your doctor. Republicans want to control your decisions. And that's what this is about. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, earlier in your show, and I did watch earlier, Eamon, because again, I didn't [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=81.6s)]
*  win the lottery. If I did, I wouldn't have been watching it. But I watched it. And you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=85.36s)]
*  had this segment on ads by Gavin Newsom and John Fetterman. Again, this is what Democrats [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=88.72s)]
*  need to do. And Gavin Newsom is framing this perfectly. It's about our freedom. And Republicans [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=93.68s)]
*  want to ban abortion. They want to ban books. They want to ban black history. They want [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=98.08s)]
*  to ban transgender rights. And they're coming from banning birth control and marriage equality. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=101.56s)]
*  They're coming for your freedom. And this ad made a great point. It made it funny. And [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=106.18s)]
*  look, folks, in 101 days, not only is our democracy on the ballot, your freedoms are [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=109.44s)]
*  on the ballot literally. And this ad does a great job of making you laugh and making you think [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=113.64s)]
*  about it at the same time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  Betsy, this ad, as Dean was saying, reminiscent of both John Fetterman and Gavin Newsom ads [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=119.36s)]
*  in recent weeks that have been also highly effective. Why do you think we're not seeing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=124.44s)]
*  more left leaning politicians or groups leaning into these cases like these with this [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  style of ad taking the fight to the Republicans on their turf with their style of what they [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=134.2s)]
*  are doing to this country? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=139.32s)]
*  It's a good question. And I don't know that I have an answer at hand for that as to why [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=140.4s)]
*  this isn't a more common tack when it comes to Democratic politicians. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  It's important to remember that many of the Democratic politicians in the most vulnerable [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=151.52s)]
*  districts are in districts where even now, after the overturn of Roe v. Wade, the issue [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  that voters still say is top of mind for them tends to be jobs, the economy and inflation. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  Some Democrats, I would think, would be concerned that not presenting themselves as supporting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=169.76s)]
*  Biden's agenda, Biden's efforts to strengthen the economy and working to lower gas prices [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=174.16s)]
*  and focus on on those financial issues could potentially result in blowback. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  But what I can tell you is that on the right, Republicans have real concern that the reversal [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=184.44s)]
*  of Roe v. Wade was kind of to use to use sort of patling, which was something of a wildcard. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  They didn't know it was going to happen. Then it happened. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  And what looked like was guaranteed to be a wave election year for Republicans suddenly [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=197.52s)]
*  got a little dicier whenever Republicans are talking about anything other than jobs, the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=203.16000000000003s)]
*  economy, inflation and to a lesser extent, the border. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=208.84s)]
*  They're nervous and they're not on their home territory. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  So for Democrats to lean into this issue in a way that's accessible to a wide audience is [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  the sort of thing that creates real challenges for many Republican candidates. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=224.0s)]
*  Eugene, your thoughts on these ads in this particular group, how they are effective in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=229.44s)]
*  their messaging. That is really direct and it's really funny. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=233.96s)]
*  And it commands your attention. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=240.16s)]
*  And a lot of Democrats haven't had the knack for whatever reason for that sort of political [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=243.48s)]
*  advertising, that sort of that very effective way to connect with voters. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=253.12s)]
*  I would love to see more of that and more groups around the country adopting this sort of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=259.08s)]
*  method. You talk about Federman's ads, his trolling of Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=266.52s)]
*  You talk about Newsom's ads. I mean, so maybe maybe finally, after years and years of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=272.48s)]
*  complaining about Democratic messaging and how it's boring and they bring a briefing book to a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=278.8s)]
*  knife fight, maybe they're actually bringing knives to the knife fight now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=284.0s)]
*  And that can mean some points in a close election. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=288.8s)]
*  So more of it, please. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And speaking of the politics of it, Betsy, we have about 30 seconds, but we're seeing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=300.48s)]
*  record fundraising from Beto O'Rourke, Abbott's challenger. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=305.76s)]
*  There's always talk of Texas turning blue, but it seems hard to imagine that someday is this year. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=308.2s)]
*  Yeah. And major Democratic donors historically have been pretty nervous about pouring money into [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=314.76s)]
*  Texas because they've long felt that Democratic operatives and activists there have been [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  exaggerating or overstating the extent to which Democrats are making progress in that state. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=324.4s)]
*  That said, there's no question that a significant number of people moving from blue states to Texas [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=330.28s)]
*  is a major source of optimism for Democratic donors. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=336.32000000000005s)]
*  And the fact that money is going there is a big deal. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=340.16s)]
*  Sometimes fundraising dollars are sort of self-fulfilling prophecies. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=343.92s)]
*  Sometimes they're not. We'll have to wait and see. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=348.52000000000004s)]
*  But the fact that the donor money is getting drawn to Texas is itself no question a sign of growing [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  Democratic optimism. And it's something that concerns the GOP. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQ0A2u4hGA&t=358.64000000000004s)]
