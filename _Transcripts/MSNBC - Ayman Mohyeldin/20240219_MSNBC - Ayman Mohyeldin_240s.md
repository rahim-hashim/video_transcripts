# Ayman: Anger over Beyoncé's new songs is part of long history of racism in country music
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ)
*  This ain't Texas, ain't no Hold'em. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=0.0s)]
*  So lay your cards down, down, down, down. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=4.96s)]
*  You're welcome, folks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=10.44s)]
*  That is going to be stuck in your head all night, and as I said, you are welcome. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=12.16s)]
*  That was Beyoncé's Texas Hold'em, one of two songs she's dropped in advance of her [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=17.5s)]
*  much-anticipated country album, stated to be released on March 29th. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=21.6s)]
*  But not everyone is thrilled about the icons foray into the genre. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=26.78s)]
*  In fact, one Oklahoma-based radio station sparked outrage this week for initially refusing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=30.740000000000002s)]
*  to play Beyoncé's new single. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=36.14s)]
*  A fan who requested the song received an email reply that read, quote, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=38.38s)]
*  Hi, we do not play Beyoncé on KYKC as we are a country music station. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=42.58s)]
*  Well, the station's owner later told NBC News that it was unaware Beyoncé had released [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=48.82s)]
*  when the request was made. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  But let's take a step back here for a moment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=56.86s)]
*  According to Forbes, as of Tuesday, only eight of the 150 stations that report to Billboard's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=59.540000000000006s)]
*  country airplay chart reported having played Texas Hold'em in its first day. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=66.94s)]
*  And none said they had put her other single, 16 Carriages, on the air. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=72.06s)]
*  And this is not the first time the country music industry has been at odds with Beyoncé. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=77.18s)]
*  She faced an intense backlash in 2016 for daring to perform at the CMAs alongside the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=82.34s)]
*  chicks. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=88.54s)]
*  Let's be very clear here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  This is just the very latest flashpoint of the long and ugly history of racism within [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=91.54s)]
*  the country music establishment. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=96.58s)]
*  You're probably familiar with some recent episodes, like when rapper Lil Nas X saw his [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=98.54s)]
*  viral hit, Old Town Road, removed from Billboard's Hot Country Songs on the grounds that it, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=103.64s)]
*  did not embrace enough elements of today's country music. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=109.46s)]
*  And there have been even more foul and even more outrageous controversies. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=113.74s)]
*  After it was reported in 2021 that country superstar Morgan Wallin was caught yelling [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=118.7s)]
*  the N-word on camera, he immediately saw a 1200% increase in digital album sales. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=123.08s)]
*  And just last year, Jason Aldean filmed a music video for his infamous grievance anthem [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=129.98s)]
*  decrying Black Lives Matter outside a Tennessee courthouse where a black man was attacked [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=134.58s)]
*  by a mob and lynched in 1927. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=140.22s)]
*  For years, for decades really, white country music fans have sent a clear message. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  Black artists do not belong in this genre, which is racist, obviously, but also ironic [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=150.06s)]
*  given how musicologists speculate that the precursor to the banjo, the cornerstone of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=155.34s)]
*  country music, originated in Africa and arrived on American shores during the 17th century [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=161.5s)]
*  with enslaved people taken from West and Central Africa. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=167.54s)]
*  According to Alice Randall, professor of African American studies at Vanderbilt University, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=172.22s)]
*  black country music goes back to the arrival of the first black child to an enslaved African [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=177.18s)]
*  woman in the Americas. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=181.68s)]
*  Black people have always been a part of folk and country music. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=184.22s)]
*  Ray Charles, Tracy Chapman, Charlie Pryde, Darius Rucker, and to the conservatives who [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=188.1s)]
*  claim that Beyonce is stealing your genre, you're making her point for her. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  This new album, Act II, is the second installment of a three-volume project that is literally [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=198.78s)]
*  about reclaiming black roots in musical genres that have been co-opted and whitewashed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=204.0s)]
*  So do yourself a favor. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=210.34s)]
*  Go listen to Texas Hold'em. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=212.68s)]
*  It's good country music, and to anyone who says otherwise, well, bless your heart. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBluj0U0LQ&t=214.86s)]
