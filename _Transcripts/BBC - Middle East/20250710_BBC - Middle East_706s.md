# Israel launches fresh strikes on Iran after hitting nuclear and military sites | BBC News
**BBC - Middle East:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI)
*  Hello and welcome to Verified Live on a day totally dominated by Israel strikes on Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=0.0s)]
*  The magnitude of these attacks are on a completely different scale to what we saw last year. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=6.4s)]
*  Israel says they targeted Iran's nuclear programme, claiming it was their very survival that was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  at stake. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=16.84s)]
*  Tehran, though, has described it as an act of war. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=17.84s)]
*  Explosions were heard in the capital Tehran and at the Natanz nuclear facility, around [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=21.92s)]
*  200 miles to the south. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=26.64s)]
*  Iranian nuclear scientists and military commanders have been killed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=29.56s)]
*  Iran's state TV is reporting that civilians, including children, are among the dead. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=33.56s)]
*  The scale of the damage to the nuclear facilities like this in Natanz is not yet clearly known. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=39.2s)]
*  Much of the Iranian programme is carried out deep underground. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=45.44s)]
*  Israel says its military action is continuing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=49.64s)]
*  Its secret service Mossad has taken the rare step of releasing this footage, which it claims [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=52.96s)]
*  was filmed inside Iran, showing its operatives preparing to launch an attack. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=58.32s)]
*  Iran has already retaliated, sending a wave of drones towards Israel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=64.16s)]
*  Israeli forces say all of them were intercepted. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=68.4s)]
*  In the next 60 minutes, we'll bring you the latest reaction from various capitals. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=71.88s)]
*  We'll also look at what was hit, who was hit. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=76.08s)]
*  We'll also examine the various strategies being carried out by Israel and Iran. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=79.08s)]
*  Let's talk to our correspondents in Jerusalem. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=85.6s)]
*  Ione Wells is there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Our North America correspondent, Nomiye Iqbal, is there at the White House. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=89.56s)]
*  And our political correspondent, Helen Catt, is at Westminster. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  But I want to go straight to the White House and straight to Nomiye, because over the last [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=96.72s)]
*  couple of hours, Nomiye, a number of lines the president has given several interviews. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=101.12s)]
*  What is the general thrust of what Donald Trump is saying? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=107.56s)]
*  To be quite straight with you, it is incredibly confusing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=111.2s)]
*  Initially, we were told by the Trump administration, via the Secretary of State, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=115.88s)]
*  Marco Rubio, that the US was not involved in this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=120.48s)]
*  Mr Rubio really distancing the US from Israel's actions, calling them [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=124.0s)]
*  unilateral. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=127.4s)]
*  Donald Trump then appears to have contradicted that, saying a few [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  moments ago that we knew everything. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=132.2s)]
*  Exactly what they knew, we don't know. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=134.44s)]
*  The White House is still saying that we knew everything. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=137.0s)]
*  The White House is still saying they didn't green light it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=140.2s)]
*  They may not have officially approved of the attack, but they certainly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=143.28s)]
*  approve of it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  In his social media posts, Mr Trump appears to basically be saying to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  Iran, start negotiating, and if you don't, there will be more of this to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=155.16s)]
*  come. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=159.48s)]
*  I suspect the US is using this as some sort of leverage to push Iran to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=160.48s)]
*  the negotiation table. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=165.12s)]
*  There is an emergency meeting right now being held by President Trump [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=167.16s)]
*  here at the White House with his Cabinet. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=170.55999999999997s)]
*  We understand that he will be talking to the Israeli Prime Minister [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=172.76s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu later this afternoon, but there are also reports [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=175.64s)]
*  that he and Mr Netanyahu were talking yesterday in several phone calls. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=179.16s)]
*  So there is some confusion about exactly what the US knew, how much [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=184.32s)]
*  it is involved in all of this, but I do think looking at the social media [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=189.04s)]
*  posts that Mr Netanyahu has been posting, he clearly approves of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=192.64s)]
*  what Israel is doing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=195.92s)]
*  I will return to you in a moment, but let's go to Jerusalem and Ioni [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=197.72s)]
*  Wells. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  In the last few minutes, reports are coming in that there are [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  multiple blasts that have been heard in Tehran. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  There are also blasts to the west of Tehran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  That fits with what the Israeli authorities and perhaps what Donald [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=211.88s)]
*  Trump was alluding to in his social media posts, that this is ongoing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  It is simply the start of things. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=220.28s)]
*  That is right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=222.0s)]
*  In the last couple of minutes, as you say, Iranian state TV have [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=225.48s)]
*  confirmed that they are intercepting missiles over Tehran. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=228.76s)]
*  That doesn't really come as a surprise. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=233.0s)]
*  As you say, it was expected that there would be further escalation in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=234.84s)]
*  this conflict after Israel launched severe strikes last night on Iran. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=238.04s)]
*  I think it is worth just recapping just how much of a devastating shock [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=243.2s)]
*  those strikes were to Iran. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  They came in the middle of the night attacking some of Iran's most [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  senior military commanders as well as nuclear scientists, more than 200 [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=257.36s)]
*  planes striking more than 100 sites in Iran as well as that Mossad, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=261.92s)]
*  Israel's intelligence agency, launched missiles from inside of Iranian [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=268.44s)]
*  territory. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=273.08s)]
*  So it is clear that this was a severe escalation and that attacks are [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=274.08s)]
*  expected to continue between the two sides in the coming hours but also [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=278.16s)]
*  in the coming days. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  One thing that both sides agree on is that this is just the beginning. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  The IDF, Israel's military, has said that this is war. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=287.48s)]
*  Iran's foreign ministry has described Israel's actions yesterday as a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  declaration of war and both sides are expected to continue these attacks, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=295.56s)]
*  as I say, in the coming days, coming hours. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  That is something which was reiterated, as you mentioned there, by [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=303.44s)]
*  the US President Donald Trump, who said in a statement that if Iran [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=306.12s)]
*  did not agree a deal, that more brutal attacks were coming. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=310.2s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been speaking to foreign [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=314.12s)]
*  leaders, including in expected conversation with President Trump. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=317.96s)]
*  So it may be that we get more indication once those calls are [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  complete about some next steps expected. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  I will be back to you in a moment or two but I want to bring in Helen [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=326.88s)]
*  Catt in Westminster because Helen, we were hearing earlier about the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=331.0s)]
*  upcoming phone call between Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump, also [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=334.56s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, but we know from the Prime Minister's office, he's also [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=338.4s)]
*  spoken to the leaders of Germany, India and France, the obvious omission [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=342.0s)]
*  is number 10. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=347.44s)]
*  We know that relations have been strained over recent days but, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=348.76s)]
*  interestingly, no apparent call to Sikhiastama. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=353.16s)]
*  This was brought up at the daily briefing for reporters in Westminster [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=357.48s)]
*  and the Downing Street spokesperson couldn't or wouldn't say whether [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=361.24s)]
*  there had been any call between Sikhiastama and Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=364.44s)]
*  Now, Sikhiastama has addressed that since in an interview with Bloomberg. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  He had said that he was planning to call Mr Netanyahu this afternoon. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=372.64s)]
*  We don't yet know if that call has taken place. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=376.56s)]
*  But as you said, there's been a real effort, I mean, the government here [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=378.96s)]
*  to focus on de-escalation and diplomacy and specifically working with [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  allies to try and put the pressure on to reach a diplomatic solution. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  So as there was a call between Sikhiastama this morning and the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=392.68s)]
*  president of France, Emmanuel Macron, and the German Chancellor, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=397.56s)]
*  Friedrich Merz, now in that call, the leaders discussed what were [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=400.12s)]
*  described as their long-held grave concerns about Iran's nuclear programme. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=403.64s)]
*  They called on all sides to refrain from further escalation, which they [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=408.84s)]
*  say could destabilise the region. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=412.96s)]
*  So that certainly does seem to be the focus from the government here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=414.68s)]
*  I should say that there's a slightly different tone coming out from the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=418.2s)]
*  leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=421.04s)]
*  She had declined to say Israel's action, she said, as an escalation [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=423.2s)]
*  and instead said it should not be condemned if it was stopping Iran [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=429.16s)]
*  from getting nuclear weapons. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=432.68s)]
*  Helen, thanks very much. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=434.56s)]
*  Let's head back to the White House and Nomiyeh Iqbal. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=435.72s)]
*  And Nomiyeh, one of the things that Donald Trump has said in the last [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=438.2s)]
*  hour is that he's pretty confident that there won't be a regional war. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=441.12s)]
*  But the very fact he has to say a phrase like that underlines what is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=445.44s)]
*  at risk here. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  It does. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  And bear in mind, this is a president who has made a big point in his [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  campaigning that he doesn't believe in wars. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  He's a no-war president, he doesn't want any foreign intervention, he [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=459.48s)]
*  wants countries to get on with whatever they want to do, he doesn't [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  want the US intervening. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=466.44000000000005s)]
*  And so certainly those who support him, his coalition, his base, will be [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=467.92s)]
*  split on this. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=471.8s)]
*  They'll be thinking, hang on a minute, how much is the US involved in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=472.8s)]
*  this? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=477.2s)]
*  And as we were talking earlier, even though the White House is saying [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=478.2s)]
*  that they didn't officially greenlight this, it does appear that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=482.2s)]
*  Donald Trump hugely approves of this. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=485.92s)]
*  And it is going to be somewhat of a balancing act for him because, of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=488.03999999999996s)]
*  course, Israel is the US's greatest ally in the Middle East and they [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=491.64s)]
*  want to protect Israel. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=496.03999999999996s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump is very adamant about that, but at the same [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  time have to deliver on that promise that he's going to be a [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  great ally in the Middle East. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=506.0s)]
*  And he's going to deliver on that promise that he has constantly made [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=507.96s)]
*  to his supporters about no wars. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=511.84s)]
*  And I just want to also add, Matthew, we understand that the Pentagon is [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=513.84s)]
*  now moving US destroyers to the eastern Mediterranean as Israel [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=518.32s)]
*  obviously braces for that potential retaliation. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=522.84s)]
*  Now, these ships are capable of defending against ballistic and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=525.84s)]
*  cruise missile attacks. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=530.12s)]
*  They were already in the region, but they're now rerouting because of [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=531.72s)]
*  the nuclear war. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=535.88s)]
*  They're now using the nuclear war as a counter-terrorism attack on Iran [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=537.16s)]
*  to provide the US with that extra layer of security. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=541.6s)]
*  The US is obviously very concerned about any retaliation on US targets [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=544.64s)]
*  and US personnel and have made it quite clear to Iran that they will [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=548.68s)]
*  not accept that if it happens. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=552.88s)]
*  Nomiya, thanks very much. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=554.88s)]
*  Let's head back to Jerusalem and Ioni Wells. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=556.88s)]
*  We were listening to Danny Danon there at the UN a short while ago and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=559.88s)]
*  he was repeating what the IDF had said to me earlier in the day, which [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=563.88s)]
*  is that Israel perceived that there was a realistic threat imminent. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=567.88s)]
*  That is their position as to why they launched this attack. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=572.88s)]
*  But the truth is that over decades Benjamin Netanyahu has wanted to do [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=576.88s)]
*  action like this, isn't it? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=582.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=584.88s)]
*  This is something that Benjamin Netanyahu has been talking about [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=586.88s)]
*  since the 1990s, not just about a threat of nuclear weapons from Iran [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=591.88s)]
*  being imminent but a desire to neutralise them. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=597.88s)]
*  It seems that now the Prime Minister felt emboldened to try to do so. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=600.88s)]
*  As you say, Netanyahu, shortly after these strikes were made last night, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=606.88s)]
*  said that his justification for this was that Iran had now kind of [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=611.88s)]
*  developed nuclear material sufficient to make nuclear weapons, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=616.88s)]
*  enough to make nine nuclear bombs. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=620.88s)]
*  Iran has always continuously denied that its nuclear capabilities are [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=623.88s)]
*  for weaponry and said that they are for civilian use only. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=628.88s)]
*  But one extra factor this week was that the International Atomic Energy [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=632.88s)]
*  Agency had said that Iran for the first time in 20 years was breaching its [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=638.88s)]
*  anti-proliferation obligations, which is something that has also been [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=643.88s)]
*  cited by the Israelis today. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=648.88s)]
*  Ione, thanks very much. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=650.88s)]
*  I'm going to quickly go back to Westminster because there's been a [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=652.88s)]
*  development just as we were having the conversations with our [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=655.88s)]
*  correspondents. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=658.88s)]
*  Helen, there is an update from Downing Street. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=659.88s)]
*  There is, yes. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=661.88s)]
*  You were talking about whether or not there had been a call between [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=662.88s)]
*  Kirstama and Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=665.88s)]
*  We understand that that has now happened, although, as you mentioned [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=668.88s)]
*  earlier, quite a long way it would appear down the list of world leaders [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=671.88s)]
*  this afternoon. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=674.88s)]
*  In that, we're told that Kirstama said that he recognised that Israel had [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=675.88s)]
*  a clear right to self-defence. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=681.88s)]
*  He was clear that Israel had a right to self-defence, sorry, and that he [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=683.88s)]
*  again expressed his grave concerns about Israel's nuclear programme. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=686.88s)]
*  Helen Catt there at Westminster, thanks very much. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=690.88s)]
*  And thanks to Ione Wells and thanks to Naomi Iqbal at the White House. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=693.88s)]
*  Plenty more on that, our main story coming up in a moment or two, but [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=698.88s)]
*  around the world and across the UK. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=701.88s)]
*  You're watching BBC News. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=703.88s)]
