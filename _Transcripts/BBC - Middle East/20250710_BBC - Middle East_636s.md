# Iran launches about 100 drones towards Israel, IDF says | BBC News
**BBC - Middle East:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y)
*  Israel's military says Iran has fired around 100 drones towards its territory [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  after Israel launched a major attack on Iran overnight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=5.0s)]
*  Let's just run through some of the pictures we have here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=13.0s)]
*  These are showing Israeli air force jets taking off before the attack. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=16.0s)]
*  Israel says it's targeting the country's nuclear programme. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=21.0s)]
*  And this is the moment a blast hit the capital, Tehran. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=24.0s)]
*  Iranian media say residential areas have been hit there and across other cities too. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=31.0s)]
*  Iranian state media says the head of the armed forces, Mohammed Abagheri, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=38.0s)]
*  and the top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, Hossein Salami, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=44.0s)]
*  were killed in the Israeli strikes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=49.0s)]
*  Two senior nuclear scientists were also killed, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=51.0s)]
*  the former head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=54.0s)]
*  and the president of the Islamic Azad University in Tehran. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=58.0s)]
*  It follows days of speculation that Israel was planning to launch military action [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=62.0s)]
*  despite US efforts to negotiate a nuclear deal with Tehran. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=66.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the operation could last several days. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=70.0s)]
*  We targeted Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=75.0s)]
*  We targeted Iran's leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=79.0s)]
*  We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile programme. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=84.0s)]
*  Last year, Iran fired 300 ballistic missiles at Israel. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=88.0s)]
*  Each of these missiles carries a ton of explosives and threatens the lives of hundreds of people. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=92.0s)]
*  Soon, those missiles could carry a nuclear payload, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=99.0s)]
*  threatening the lives not of hundreds, but of millions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=103.0s)]
*  Iran is gearing up to produce 10,000 of those ballistic missiles within three years. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=107.0s)]
*  Now, just imagine, imagine 10,000 tonnes of TNT landing on a country the size of New Jersey. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=114.0s)]
*  This is an intolerable threat. It too must be stopped. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=122.0s)]
*  Let's get a sense of some of the geography here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=127.0s)]
*  In the early hours of the morning, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=130.0s)]
*  Israel announced it launched a major military operation against Iran's nuclear programme [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=132.0s)]
*  and senior military commanders. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=137.0s)]
*  Israeli military targeted dozens of sites in the country. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=140.0s)]
*  Iranian state media says parts of Tehran have been hit, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=143.0s)]
*  and the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=147.0s)]
*  confirmed Iran's main nuclear enrichment site at Natanz was also hit in the Israeli strikes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=150.0s)]
*  Well, Tehran now appears to have responded, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=157.0s)]
*  Israel says Iran launched around 100 drones at its territory. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=160.0s)]
*  Warning sirens have been heard in major cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=164.0s)]
*  I speak now to Shashank Joshi, who is defence editor at The Economist. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=169.0s)]
*  Thanks for coming on the programme. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=173.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=175.0s)]
*  We'll get into some of the details very quickly, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=176.0s)]
*  but just firstly, your headline thoughts about what's happened overnight. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=178.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, this is perhaps something of a surprise [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=183.0s)]
*  because it preempts US-Iran nuclear talks that were due for this weekend. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=186.0s)]
*  So clearly, Israel preferring the element of surprise [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=191.0s)]
*  rather than waiting for those talks to conclude. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=194.0s)]
*  Secondly, the Americans very, very clearly stating that they were not involved [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=197.0s)]
*  and trying to stay out of this, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=201.0s)]
*  although they may well be dragged into the aerial defence of Israel from any retaliation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=203.0s)]
*  And I think the third point is, this is critical, this is very early days. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=208.0s)]
*  We are probably only seeing the first waves of what will be a multi-day Israeli campaign. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=212.0s)]
*  So, for instance, I note with interest, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=219.0s)]
*  Israel has not yet attacked Iran's most deeply buried nuclear site, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=221.0s)]
*  which is in a place called Fordow, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=225.0s)]
*  but I would be surprised if that remains the case in the coming hours and days. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=228.0s)]
*  So you mentioned there that the timing took many by surprise. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=232.0s)]
*  What about the reasoning behind striking like this now? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=238.0s)]
*  The Israeli public claim is that Iran was accelerating work towards a nuclear bomb. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=243.0s)]
*  In my opinion, whilst Iran has conducted some weapons-related activity since 2003 [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=249.0s)]
*  when it shut down its formal weapons programme, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=256.0s)]
*  I don't believe that is the real trigger for this attack. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=259.0s)]
*  I believe the real trigger is that Israel sees a historic opportunity to act politically [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=262.0s)]
*  at a period where US-Iran talks were looking relatively unsuccessful, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=267.0s)]
*  in which Iran was looking exceptionally weak, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=272.0s)]
*  in which its principal ally in the region, Hezbollah in Lebanon, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=275.0s)]
*  had been decimated by Israel last year, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=279.0s)]
*  and in which Iran's nuclear programme, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=282.0s)]
*  particularly its stockpile of enriched uranium, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=285.0s)]
*  was expanding dramatically. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=289.0s)]
*  And all of those factors together, I think, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=291.0s)]
*  made Israel decide this was the time to take the great risk of attacking those nuclear sites, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=294.0s)]
*  but also clearly, much more widely than just nuclear sites, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=299.0s)]
*  also Iran's military leadership. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=303.0s)]
*  And just give us an assessment of the words overnight from Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=306.0s)]
*  describing, of course, the repeated line that we know about [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=312.0s)]
*  the country facing an existential threat from Iran. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=316.0s)]
*  What about your assessment of the state of the nuclear programme in Iran right now? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=321.0s)]
*  Well, Iran has had a nuclear weapons programme since the 1980s, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=327.0s)]
*  and in the 1990s, it authorised a decision to build a number of nuclear bombs and to test them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=332.0s)]
*  But in 2003, American intelligence judges that they halted that programme, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=339.0s)]
*  possibly because America was, of course, at that time, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=344.0s)]
*  invading countries on both sides of Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=347.0s)]
*  And so that programme was halted. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=351.0s)]
*  And in fact, as recently as March, the director of national intelligence in America, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=353.0s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, said that American intelligence judged it was still halted, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=358.0s)]
*  that Iran had not made a decision to build a bomb. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=362.0s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that Iran was not dabbling in elements needed for a nuclear bomb, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=365.0s)]
*  if we can introduce that nuance. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=371.0s)]
*  It was, for example, looking at things like computer modelling of how a nuclear implosion might work. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=373.0s)]
*  It was looking at plastic explosives for use in a nuclear device. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=379.0s)]
*  And so for the Israelis, that was viewed to be an unacceptable progress towards a bomb. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=383.0s)]
*  I think, in general, Iran has not moved significantly closer to a bomb in the last few months. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=390.0s)]
*  It's accumulated more uranium. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=397.0s)]
*  But the key change took place in 2018 when Donald Trump pulled out of a nuclear deal, the JCPOA. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=399.0s)]
*  And at that point onwards, Iran's enrichment capacity and its stockpile of uranium has grown. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=406.0s)]
*  And that was the real shift after 2018, I would say. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=412.0s)]
*  Shashank Chonky, thank you very much for your analysis. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=416.0s)]
*  That's Shashank Joshi, defence editor at The Economist. Thank you. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=420.0s)]
*  Let's speak now to our Middle East correspondent, Hugo Peshageh, who's in Jerusalem. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=425.0s)]
*  Hugo, just talk us through what we know and what we don't know right now about what happened overnight. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=429.0s)]
*  Hello. So we know that the Israelis carried out a large-scale attack on a number of facilities in Iran related to the country's nuclear programme. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=437.0s)]
*  So we're talking about military facilities, nuclear sites, also air defence systems, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=447.0s)]
*  and crucially, also senior military leaders and also scientists. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=452.0s)]
*  So I think the strategy here is very similar to the Israeli strategy in Lebanon against Hezbollah last year, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=456.0s)]
*  not only to attack and destroy infrastructure, but also to attack the leadership, to destroy the chain of command. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=463.0s)]
*  So we're still getting reports about the identities of those who have been killed. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=470.0s)]
*  State media in Iran has confirmed that at least two senior military officers have been killed, have been assassinated as a result of these attacks. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=475.0s)]
*  Now, the Israeli military said more than 200 planes were used in this operation. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=483.0s)]
*  More than 300 bombs were dropped at 100 sites. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=489.0s)]
*  So we've seen that a number of locations across Iran, at least six cities, were hit as a result of those attacks. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=493.0s)]
*  They happened in several waves during the morning, including the capital, Tehran. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=503.0s)]
*  We're still trying to understand the scale of the damage, of the destruction on the ground in Iran. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=509.0s)]
*  State media is also saying that a residential area of Tehran was hit. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=516.0s)]
*  It is reporting that civilians were killed as well. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=521.0s)]
*  But I think the details and the statements coming from the Israeli authorities suggest that, in their view, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=525.0s)]
*  this has been a very successful operation to really damage and destroy the capabilities, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=531.0s)]
*  the ability of Iran's, of these facilities being used by Iran in its nuclear program. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=538.0s)]
*  I think we're also getting indications from the Israeli authorities that this could be just the beginning of a prolonged offensive. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=544.0s)]
*  So these attacks are likely to continue in the next few days and even weeks. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=551.0s)]
*  And Hugo, what about people there? Because you mentioned the timescale there expected to continue. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=557.0s)]
*  What does that mean for people living in Israel? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=563.0s)]
*  Yes, so there is a state of emergency that's been declared in Israel, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=569.0s)]
*  and the authorities have been warning the population that they are expecting a large response from Iran in terms of drones and missiles being fired. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=573.0s)]
*  Earlier this morning, the military said more than 100 drones had been fired by the Iranian military, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=583.0s)]
*  and that reports now in the last few minutes suggest that all drones had been intercepted by the Israeli army. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=590.0s)]
*  I think the concern here is that this could be just the beginning of this Iranian response that could involve not only drones but also missiles, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=598.0s)]
*  an attempt to try to overwhelm the country's air defense systems. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=606.0s)]
*  Remember, this is a country that has a very sophisticated system of protection. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=610.0s)]
*  But again, what the authorities are telling the population is that they should expect a large response from Iran following these attacks. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=614.0s)]
*  Now, gatherings have been banned in Israel. Schools are closed. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=623.0s)]
*  The main airport has also canceled all its flights as the authorities are making preparations for this possible Iranian response. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ8EuuVr-Y&t=627.0s)]
