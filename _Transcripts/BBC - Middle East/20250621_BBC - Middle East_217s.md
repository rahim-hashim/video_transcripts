# President Trump says US has bombed Iran nuclear sites | BBC News
**BBC - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8)
*  A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=0.0s)]
*  key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime, Fordow, Netanj and Esfahan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=16.36s)]
*  Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=24.08s)]
*  the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=44.16s)]
*  Iran the bully of the Middle East must now make peace. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=50.08s)]
*  If they do not, future attacks would be far greater and a lot easier. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=54.0s)]
*  For 40 years, Iran has been saying, death to America, death to Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=58.8s)]
*  They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs with [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=64.28s)]
*  roadside bombs. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=68.24s)]
*  That was their specialty. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=70.42s)]
*  We lost over a thousand people and hundreds of thousands throughout the Middle East and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=71.84s)]
*  around the world have died as a direct result of their hate. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=77.28s)]
*  In particular, so many were killed by their general, Qassem Soleimani. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=80.64s)]
*  I decided a long time ago that I would not let this happen. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=87.6s)]
*  It will not continue. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=91.64s)]
*  I want to thank and congratulate Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=93.6s)]
*  We worked as a team like perhaps no team has ever worked before. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=98.6s)]
*  And we've gone a long way to erasing this horrible threat to Israel. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  I want to thank the Israeli military for the wonderful job they've done. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=107.64s)]
*  And most importantly, I want to congratulate the great American patriots who flew those [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=112.6s)]
*  magnificent machines tonight and all of the United States military on an operation the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=116.6s)]
*  likes of which the world has not seen in many, many decades. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=122.64s)]
*  Hopefully we will no longer need their services in this capacity. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=127.08s)]
*  I hope that so. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=131.0s)]
*  I also want to congratulate the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan Raisen [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=132.72s)]
*  Kane, spectacular general, and all of the brilliant military minds involved in this [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=137.96s)]
*  attack. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=143.44s)]
*  With all of that being said, this cannot continue. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=147.56s)]
*  witnessed over the last eight days. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=153.4s)]
*  Remember, there are many targets left. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=155.8s)]
*  Peace was the most difficult of them all by far and perhaps the most lethal. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=160.2s)]
*  But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=166.28s)]
*  speed, and skill. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=174.76s)]
*  There's no military in the world that could have done what we did tonight, not even close. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  There has never been a military that could do what took place just a little while ago. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=183.04s)]
*  Tomorrow, General Kane, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will have a press conference [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  at 8 a.m. at the Pentagon. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=194.76s)]
*  And I want to just thank everybody and in particular, God. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=197.32s)]
*  I want to just say we love you, God, and we love our great military. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  Protect them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  God bless the Middle East. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=208.12s)]
*  God bless Israel. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  And God bless America. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=213.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19AOMO-U8&t=214.79999999999998s)]
