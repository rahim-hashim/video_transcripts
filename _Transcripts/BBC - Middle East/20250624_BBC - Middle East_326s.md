Video Description: US President Donald Trump has warned Israel "do not drop those bombs" after it ordered "powerful strikes" on Iran.
 
Trump said further strikes would be a "major violation" of the ceasefire agreement he announced between the two countries on Monday evening.
 
Israel said it had agreed to the proposal, while Iran said it would stop attacking if Israel did the same.
 
Israel's military subsequently said it had intercepted a missile launched by Iran. Tehran denied fresh attacks.
 
Overnight both sides exchanged fire, with local officials saying nine people were killed in northern Iran.
 
Israel's emergency service said four people were killed in Beersheba.

# US President Donald Trump warns Israel after it vows ‘powerful strikes on Iran’ | BBC News
**BBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA)
*  President Trump has been speaking in the last few minutes just as he left the White House on the way to Joint Base Andrews. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=0.0s)]
*  Just a very short ride by helicopter from the White House, a matter of five or six minutes or so. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=6.88s)]
*  But before he boarded the helicopter he did make his first remarks since [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=13.48s)]
*  posting about the ceasefire between Iran and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=19.68s)]
*  Israel saying he was unhappy with Iran. He was also unhappy with Israel. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=23.64s)]
*  But he was more unhappy, he said, with Israel than Iran. Let's have a listen to those remarks. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=29.64s)]
*  They didn't have to unload and I didn't like the fact that the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=34.92s)]
*  retaliation was very strong, but in all fairness Israel unloaded a lot and now I hear Israel just went out because they felt it was [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=39.16s)]
*  violated by one rocket that didn't land anywhere. That's not what we want, I'll tell you. And I'm telling you I'm not happy about that Israel either. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=47.72s)]
*  All I do is play both sides. I'm going now as you know to NATO. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=54.84s)]
*  Some of you are going with me, and I think it's going to be [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=61.720000000000006s)]
*  successful. We'll see. I'll let you know. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  Are you going to send to the agreements, when you got in the Middle East to send to the agreements you managed to achieve? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  What are your future plans for the region, for Saudi Arabia, Israel, Gaza, the hostages? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  Look, you're asking me about women in the Middle East. It's getting a lot better. Things are happening at a high level. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=79.12s)]
*  As you know, Saudi Arabia has done a really good job. It's coming out [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=85.64s)]
*  far, far faster than I thought. So we're very happy about what's happening with women in the Middle East. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=90.08s)]
*  No, I'm talking about the new zone in the Middle East that you managed to achieve last night. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=95.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=99.8s)]
*  You know, the region is going to a new place with the decision to send to the agreements. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=100.3s)]
*  That's true. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=104.3s)]
*  Can you tell us what your future plans are for Gaza, for the hostages? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=104.8s)]
*  It's a new dawn. I appreciate the question. You're very nice. Who are you? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=108.7s)]
*  Thank you. I'm Nariya Kroll from Israeli Sunnel Research Unit. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=112.02s)]
*  All right, good. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=114.02s)]
*  Well, we have to have Israel calm down because they went on a mission this morning. I gotta get Israel to calm down now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=114.78s)]
*  Can you get to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=121.14s)]
*  Did he talk to Prime Minister Netanyahu last night? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=123.14s)]
*  I spoke to everybody. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=125.14s)]
*  You urged both sides not to violate the ceasefire, but reports coming from the region suggest that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=127.14s)]
*  the sides accuse each other for violating the ceasefire. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  I think they both violated it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  And I'm going to see if I can stop it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  So as soon as I get away from you, I'm going to see if I can stop it. Okay? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu, sir, I just spoke to you this morning. How long has it been argument for what? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  I think it's been completely demolished. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  I think the reason we're here is because those pilots, those B-2 pilots did an unbelievable job. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=163.22s)]
*  And you know, the fake news, like CNN in particular, they're trying to say, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=170.22000000000003s)]
*  well, I agree that it was destroyed, but maybe not that destroyed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=175.22000000000003s)]
*  You know what they're doing? They're really hurting great pilots that put their lives in the line. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=179.22000000000003s)]
*  CNN is scum. And so is MSDNC. They're all. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=183.22000000000003s)]
*  And frankly, the networks aren't much better. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=187.22000000000003s)]
*  It's all fake news, but they should not have done that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  Those pilots hit their targets. Those targets were obliterated. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  And the pilots should be given credit. They're not after the pilots. They're after me. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=196.86s)]
*  They want to try and demean me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=200.86s)]
*  Do you believe that Iran can rebuild its nuclear program? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=202.86s)]
*  No, I mean, Iran will never rebuild its nuclear. From there? Absolutely not. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=204.86s)]
*  That place is under rock. That place is demolished. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=208.86s)]
*  The B-2 pilots did their job. They did it better than anybody could even imagine. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=212.86s)]
*  They hit late in the evening. It was dark with no moon. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=217.5s)]
*  And they hit that target with every one of those things. And that place is gone. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=221.5s)]
*  But when I see CNN all night long, they're trying to say, well, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=225.5s)]
*  maybe it wasn't really as demolished as we thought. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=229.5s)]
*  It was demolished. You take a look at the pinpricks and you see that place is gone. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=232.5s)]
*  And I will say, I think CNN ought to apologize to the pilots of the B-2s. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=236.5s)]
*  I think that MSD and CO2 apologize. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=243.14s)]
*  I think these guys really, these networks and these cable networks are real losers. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=246.14s)]
*  You really are. You're real losers. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=252.14s)]
*  Is it real sense that you buy one of those movies? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=254.14s)]
*  You're gutless losers. I say that to CNN because I watch it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=258.14s)]
*  I have no choice. I've got to watch it garbage. It's all garbage. It's all fake news. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=262.14s)]
*  But I think CNN is a gutless group of people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=266.14s)]
*  And the people that run it, nobody even knows it's been sold so many times. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=270.78s)]
*  But the people that run it ought to be ashamed. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=274.78s)]
*  MSD and C, a guy named Brian Roberts, he heads it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=276.78s)]
*  He's a disgrace. He's a weak, pathetic disgrace. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=279.78s)]
*  The Press. Do you believe that Iran violated the peace agreement and the ceasefire agreement? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=282.78s)]
*  Do you believe that Iran is still committed to peace? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=287.78s)]
*  Yeah, I do. They violated it, but Israel violated it too. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=290.78s)]
*  Are you questioning if Israel was committed to it? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=293.78s)]
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=295.78s)]
*  the likes of which I've never seen before. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=300.41999999999996s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=302.41999999999996s)]
*  You know, when I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  and just drop everything you have on them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=310.41999999999996s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=315.41999999999996s)]
*  because the one rocket that didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=318.41999999999996s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHpy0sv_VZA&t=324.41999999999996s)]
