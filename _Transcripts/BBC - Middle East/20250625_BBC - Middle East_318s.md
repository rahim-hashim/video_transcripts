Video Description: At least 46 people waiting for aid have been killed by Israeli fire in two incidents in central and southern Gaza, according to rescuers and hospitals.
UN agencies have condemned the US and Israel-backed food distribution system, with one official calling it "an abomination" and "a death trap".
Such deadly incidents have recently become a near daily occurrence but have attracted relatively little attention outside Gaza since Israel attacked Iran more than a week ago.
Meanwhile at a Nato press conference, US President Donald Trump suggested that "great progress" is being made to resolve the war in Gaza.
"Even before this I think we were very close to making a deal on Gaza; I think this helped," he added.

*  12 days of the Iran war. Some 868 people killed according to the local health officials in Gaza [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=13.92s)]
*  while waiting for humanitarian aid and also killed by Israeli soldiers. Let us speak to our Gaza [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=23.12s)]
*  correspondent Rushdie Abou Alouf. Rushdie, good to talk to you. Just tell us more about the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=29.92s)]
*  casualties in the last 24 hours alone from Gaza and also over the last 12 days that the media [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=36.96s)]
*  has been so much focused on Iran. About 23 people were killed since midnight. The latest three people [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=42.96s)]
*  near the Gaza humanitarian institution in Rafah. Three people were killed taken to the hospital [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=54.32s)]
*  early morning about six people in different distribution, humanitarian distribution center, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=63.36s)]
*  but also about 14 or 16 people were killed in different airstrikes and about 12 days of the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=70.4s)]
*  escalation or the mini war between Iran and Israel. The war in Gaza continued, you know, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=77.76s)]
*  about 860 or something people were killed. Maybe half of them were near the distribution centers, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=83.12s)]
*  which Palestinians now say that this became killing points for the people. What happened is that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  every night thousands of people gather in big groups near these centers and they wait [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  for the center to distribute some food because there is a lack of food, medicine, and fuel and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  everything in Gaza. What happened is that the three or four centers are located in an area [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=111.28s)]
*  within under Israeli control. There are active Israeli troops in the place. There are always [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=118.64s)]
*  tanks around the place and people often say that Israel is using drones, quadcopter drones to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=124.4s)]
*  shoot people. The hospitals are overwhelmed by the number of people they receive every day from [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=132.16s)]
*  this kind of was the every day they ask people to donate the blood and also the RGB will not to go [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=138.96s)]
*  too close to this centers. Rushdie, there are reports emerging in the news agencies that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=144.88s)]
*  the US State Department is giving a 30 million dollar grant to the Gaza humanitarian foundation [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=153.36s)]
*  that coming from the US agency for international development which was effectively shuttered by [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=164.64s)]
*  Donald Trump but reports that the US is giving 30 million dollars so very much kind of investing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=169.36s)]
*  in this Gaza humanitarian foundation. Just explain what is the core issue here? Is it the mechanism, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=175.2s)]
*  the way in which this new mechanism operates by giving out aid? Is it the fact that they are set [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=183.6s)]
*  up in areas of conflict? Is it the fact that it is the Americans and the Israelis kind of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=188.8s)]
*  working together in this new mechanism? Why are so many people dying as they are waiting for aid? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=193.84s)]
*  Well look we have like three or four centers for the GHF and they all in places under fully Israeli [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=201.68s)]
*  control especially the ones in Rafah. They are real active Israeli combat operation in the place [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=209.2s)]
*  since March so the people would go in a very huge number. Thousands of people will walk from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=217.44000000000003s)]
*  Khajounis. Sometimes they walk seven eight kilometers to reach this area and it's always [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=223.52s)]
*  dark. There is always risk. Israeli soldiers in the place, Israeli drones above them. People are [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=230.24s)]
*  pushing to get into the center so what the people are saying when we did ask them they said we have [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=236.0s)]
*  no other option to get food but to walk to this dangerous area. I asked one person like you have [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=241.44s)]
*  your friends killed yesterday. Why you are going today again? He said because my son and daughters [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=248.64s)]
*  are starving so the mechanism itself is not sufficient because the people in Gaza used to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=254.0s)]
*  receive aid from UN agencies even before the 7th of October and before this were about 900,000 people [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=259.68s)]
*  so the UN agencies they have the capability the centers that stuff to do it instead of people [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=266.72s)]
*  walking in a very dangerous area to a center to get very few items of food people used to get it [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=272.64000000000004s)]
*  distributed within their neighborhood in every single neighborhood there is a distribution center [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=278.72s)]
*  for the UN so that's why every day like people are killed around this area about the 30 million [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  dollars. I think what is Gaza needed according to the people who closely work with the agencies [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=289.28s)]
*  that they need about 500, 600 trucks every day into Gaza for at least two months to be able to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=297.28s)]
*  meet the needs of the people and each truck of them cost about half million dollars and so even [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=303.52s)]
*  this money is very little comparing to what Gaza really need. Rushdie Aboulof our Gaza correspondent thank you very much. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASjI6s-657o&t=309.35999999999996s)]
