Video Description: Donald Trump says a ceasefire between Israel and Iran is now in effect, after 12 days of deadly attacks that raised fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East.
Israel says it agreed to the ceasefire after "eliminating the Iranian nuclear threat"; Iran earlier said it would only stop its attacks if Israel did the same.
Hours before the ceasefire came into effect, Israel and Iran continued launching deadly attacks.

# Israel agrees to ceasefire with Iran | BBC News
**BBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ)
*  In the last half an hour, Israel has confirmed it has agreed to a ceasefire with Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump, who announced the ceasefire agreement, has told both countries, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=7.44s)]
*  please do not violate it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=12.0s)]
*  Well, let's show you the scenes live this morning as we keep you across all the very latest developments. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=14.8s)]
*  For example, we could take you to Beersheba in Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=20.8s)]
*  This is not far away from Jerusalem, where we saw some strikes on the part of Iran that managed to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=25.28s)]
*  penetrate through hitting targets in Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=33.84s)]
*  Four people are reported to have been killed, but seemingly a very ferocious night in the other direction as well. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=38.64s)]
*  Some nine people killed, 33 injured in northern Iran, according to local officials there. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=45.2s)]
*  So what's been described as a very ferocious night on both sides in the final hours up to the agreement of this ceasefire. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=53.76s)]
*  Let's now bring in Dan Johnson, our correspondent who is in Jerusalem. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=62.72s)]
*  So, Dan, Israel have agreed to the ceasefire. Tell us more. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=67.36s)]
*  Yes, the Israeli government announced about half an hour ago that it had agreed to the ceasefire proposals, the plan. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=74.64s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily mean that the ceasefire is in place right now and being respected by both sides. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=80.72s)]
*  We understand the terms of this agreement are that Iran would stop firing at 7am local time this morning, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=86.48s)]
*  and that does appear to have happened. That's almost three hours ago now and there hasn't been any significant reported fire from Iran since then. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=92.64s)]
*  But it gives Israel another three hours from now until it comes under the same terms of that agreement. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Having seen those Iranian attacks in the two or three hours before 7am this morning, four people have been killed in Be'er Sheva, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  there are 22 people injured across the south of Israel. There was the potential for the Israeli military to respond to retaliate in some way. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  Now, perhaps this statement is a sign that they don't feel that they need to do that, but there is still a potential window open to them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  So we could still see a tense few hours ahead to see if this ceasefire is actually respected by both sides. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  Israel has warned that any violation of this ceasefire would be met with a forceful reaction. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=135.92s)]
*  It has warned its citizens to continue adhering to the safety restrictions and orders that are in place [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  until it can confirm that this ceasefire is being properly adhered to by both sides. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=148.72s)]
*  But certainly the hope is that this does now mean some sort of peace in this region after 12 days of conflict with intense airstrikes on both sides, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=153.92s)]
*  widespread damage and destruction and so much loss of life that we've seen over the last 12 days. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=163.76s)]
*  And Dan, just remind us of what happened to get us to this point because it was on Sunday of course, or late Saturday, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=168.32s)]
*  we had the news of US direct attacks on nuclear facilities in Iran. We were all waiting for Iran's response. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=175.2s)]
*  That followed and now we're at this point where both countries appear to be adhering to a ceasefire. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  Yes, an awful lot has happened since the US got involved in this conflict with those strikes on Iran's nuclear sites over the weekend, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=193.92s)]
*  back and forth by both sides. It was an intense night of strikes last night. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=201.44s)]
*  The hope is now that both sides have given what they've got, done what they need. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=205.84s)]
*  They can claim to have achieved their aims and that the ceasefire will now be respected. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=209.84s)]
*  Dan Johnson, thank you so much. That's all from us on BBC News. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVxAiwlFeQ&t=213.6s)]
