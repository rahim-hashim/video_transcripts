# Iraq avoided involvement in Israel-Iran war, says Iraqi prime minister | BBC News
**BBC - Middle East:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c)
*  Hello, I'm Lucy Hockings. The Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shah Al Sadani has told the BBC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=0.0s)]
*  his government will not allow the country to be dragged into any conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=5.92s)]
*  During the recent 12-day war between the two countries, Israeli jets used Iraqi airspace to attack targets inside Iran, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=11.58s)]
*  while pro-Tehran militias in Iraq threatened to attack US assets if Washington intervened directly. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=18.26s)]
*  And even though Iran and Israel have now agreed to a ceasefire, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=24.44s)]
*  the Iraqi Prime Minister has told the BBC's Nafisah Kournawad that there are fears the truce might not hold. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=28.18s)]
*  Nafisah joins us from Baghdad to talk us through her interview. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=35.18s)]
*  But first, you arrived there in Iraq at a very tense moment, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  right when Iran fired missiles at the Al Udeid military base in Qatar. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  This is the biggest US military base in the Middle East, of course. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  But what was the mood like at that moment in Iraq? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  Lucy, just before that, eyes were on Iraq specifically. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=54.98s)]
*  During these 12 days of war between Iran, Israel and Iran, eyes were on Iraq. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=60.98s)]
*  But those days, specifically, everyone was focusing that maybe something will happen in Iraq, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=68.97999999999999s)]
*  especially that the US Baghdad embassy, which is right behind me, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=74.97999999999999s)]
*  had officially announced that they have almost evacuated their personnel and staff. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=79.98s)]
*  So there was a state of panic that maybe the attack, Iran's retaliatory attack in response to the US attack on its nuclear sites, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=85.98s)]
*  will happen here in Iraq, which previously also US military bases had been attacked by Iran-backed groups [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=95.98s)]
*  and the IRGC, Iran's Revolutionary Guard, itself. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=103.98s)]
*  So when that attack happened and it was confirmed that the attack only was against Al Udeid, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=108.98s)]
*  and it was very kind of calculated and there was a lot of warning behind that, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=115.98s)]
*  so here it was a relief because there was a mood of relief that, okay, for now Iraq was able to save itself. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=122.98s)]
*  But still there was concern because the country's airspace was being used by Israeli jets [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  at which Prime Minister Sudani told me that they were worried that this will drag Iraq to a war that they don't want to be part of it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=137.98s)]
*  Also, there was concern about possible Israeli or US attack on Iran-backed groups if they attack or if they target Israel or US bases here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=146.98s)]
*  So I ask about that from Prime Minister Sudani and also ask that if he believes the ceasefire between Israel and Iran can last. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=163.98s)]
*  The Netanyahu government is searching for any justification to expand the conflict. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=178.98s)]
*  Our position is clear. We are not party to any war. We will not allow any side to use Iraqi territory to attack others. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=183.98s)]
*  At the same time, we will not allow anyone to violate Iraq's sovereignty or the safety of its citizens. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=192.98s)]
*  The roots of the problem in the region are still unsolved, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=199.98s)]
*  whether it's the American-Iranian relationship and the ongoing controversy or the Iranian nuclear program or the situation in Gaza. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=202.98s)]
*  The presence of a person like Netanyahu is a source of worry for the whole region. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=211.98s)]
*  This personality's survival strategy is to expand conflicts and prolong wars. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=216.98s)]
*  So he creates a problem with all the countries of the region. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=222.98s)]
*  The Gaza ceasefire did not last and he did not honor the truce in Lebanon and he attacks Syria whenever he wants. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=226.98s)]
*  This is why there are worries about this truce lasting. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=233.98s)]
*  So, Nafis, there are clear concerns there from the Prime Minister and from others in Iraq that the conflict will reignite between Israel and Iran. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=237.98s)]
*  But what would that actually mean for the country? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=248.98s)]
*  Well, the country is still worried because especially if the Strait of Hormuz, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=254.98s)]
*  which is very vital for Iraq's oil export to be closed, which Iranians repeatedly threatened regarding that, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=260.98s)]
*  that will have a massive impact on the country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=268.98s)]
*  The general mood here is that, Lucy, that this conflict will erupt again and this was only that the previous one was the first round only, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=272.98s)]
*  and they are not sure that they can escape from the second round if it happens. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=283.98s)]
*  And right now, as a journalist that have been here in and out since 2003, right after Saddam fall, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=287.98s)]
*  I can say, Lucy, that this is the first time I see a lot of construction, reconstruction, building the streets, building bridges. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=295.98s)]
*  A lot of beautiful buildings have been erupted here in Baghdad, which I had never have seen in the past 20-something years. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=303.98s)]
*  And now the government is worried that now that they have started all these changes across the country, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=314.98s)]
*  this conflict will stop and drag the country to another conflict that they don't want to be part of it and they keep repeating this in different occasions. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=322.98s)]
*  But also, Prime Minister confirmed to me that they are thinking to buy more air defence system, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=334.98s)]
*  not to let not Israelis, not anyone else, probably he means Iran, to use Iraq's airspace to carry out any attack against any other countries in the region. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=340.98s)]
*  A great interview with the Prime Minister, Nafase. Thank you so much. Good to see you in Baghdad. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62UI34-q3c&t=352.98s)]
