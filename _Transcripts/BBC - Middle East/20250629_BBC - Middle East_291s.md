Video Description: Iran has the capacity to start enriching uranium again - for a possible bomb - in "a matter of months", the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog has said.
Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said US strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites had caused severe but "not total" damage to the enrichment programme.
That contradicts claims by US President Donald Trump that the US bombing had “totally obliterated” the nuclear facilities. 
Meanwhile Iran’s deputy foreign minister has told the BBC that the US must rule out any further strikes on Iran if it wants to resume diplomatic talks.  Majid Takht-Ravanchi says the Trump administration has told Iran through mediators it wants to return to negotiations, but had "not made their position clear" on the "very important question" of whether they might conduct further attacks while talks are taking place.
Israel attacked nuclear and military sites in Iran on 13 June, claiming Iran was close to building a nuclear weapon.
The US later joined the strikes, dropping bombs on three of Iran's nuclear facilities: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan.
Since then, the true extent of the damage has been unclear.
The IAEA assessment comes after a leaked US intelligence report also concluded that the strikes had probably only set back the programme by months. 
Trump retorted furiously to that, declaring that Iran's nuclear sites were "completely destroyed" and accusing the media of "an attempt to demean one of the most successful military strikes in history".

*  A city in the eyes of the world, Tehran, where the fragile truce holds. On the streets, reminders [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=41.300000000000004s)]
*  of the 12-day war, of the decades-long tension with the US and Israel. But one of Iran's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=52.66s)]
*  top diplomats wants to make clear when bombs fell this month, they were negotiating with [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=61.26s)]
*  America. He insists that can't happen again. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=66.66s)]
*  We are hearing from Washington telling us that they want to talk. So, by the way, no [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=70.17999999999999s)]
*  date has been set. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=78.42s)]
*  President Trump talked about this week. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=80.38s)]
*  I'm telling you, I'm telling you that we have not agreed to any date. We have not agreed [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=81.66s)]
*  to the modality. Right now, we are seeking an answer to this question. Are we going to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=88.46s)]
*  see a repetition of an act of aggression while we are engaging in dialogue? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=97.06s)]
*  Satellite imagery shows Iran's nuclear sites were badly damaged. But Iran still says it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  won't stop enriching uranium. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=110.06s)]
*  Why should we agree to such a proposal? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=112.9s)]
*  Because Iranians on this visit have told us that Iran has paid too high a price for enriching [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=116.7s)]
*  uranium, causing suspicions even among your European partners about why you were enriching [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=123.72s)]
*  to 60 percent. It wasn't necessary. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=129.82s)]
*  First of all, 60 percent is something which is being used for peaceful purposes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=133.1s)]
*  But it did create this situation of suspicion. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=139.06s)]
*  The level of that can be discussed. The capacity can be discussed. But to say that you should [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=142.18s)]
*  not have enrichment, you should have zero enrichment, and if you do not agree, we will [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=149.46s)]
*  bomb you, that is the law of the jungle. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=153.7s)]
*  But they would say Iran has to do more to reassure the world that its nuclear program, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=156.3s)]
*  its ballistic missile program, isn't threatening. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  We were discussing with Americans. We were in the middle of talks. All of a sudden, we [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=162.82s)]
*  faced a clear act of aggression. And those who are criticizing us, they should criticize [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=170.42s)]
*  the way that we have been treated. They should criticize the Americans. They should criticize [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=177.45999999999998s)]
*  the Israelis. And if they do not have the guts to criticize America, they should keep [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=182.42s)]
*  silent, not try to justify the aggression. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=187.66s)]
*  Iranians worry the dark of war will return. Their days lived with no guarantee life will [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=193.82s)]
*  get better or worse. Their lives held hostage to age-old enmities. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, Lise, Iran has stated its case to you. But what sort of pressure is it under? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=209.82s)]
*  Well, they've certainly seen what kind of military pressure can be brought to bear. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  They've seen the military might of the United States and Israel. They've seen how Israel [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=221.94s)]
*  can assassinate at will so many of its top military commanders, so many of its leading [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=226.82s)]
*  nuclear scientists. The Deputy Foreign Minister told us that they have received messages in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=232.74s)]
*  private. They've heard them in public, that the United States want to stop military action, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  at least for now. They've also said that they have been assured by the Americans, at least [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=243.62s)]
*  for now, that regime change is not on the agenda. But they are under pressure at home, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  under pressure from hardliners who've long accused the moderates, the diplomats, of being [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=254.78s)]
*  naive, that they shouldn't have ever put their trust in negotiations with the United States, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=260.14s)]
*  which they have never trusted and trust even less now. But they're also under pressure [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=266.3s)]
*  from their own people. And the question is whether or not they're listening. A people [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=271.26s)]
*  who for it's long been said, the majority of whom want a better relationship with the United States [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=275.42s)]
*  and the world beyond. They want these tensions which have been entangling their lives generation [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=282.22s)]
*  after generation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baq7SJN8VQ8&t=289.18s)]
