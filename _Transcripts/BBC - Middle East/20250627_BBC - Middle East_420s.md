# Iranian foreign minister acknowledges serious damage to nuclear sites from US strikes | BBC News
**BBC - Middle East:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E)
*  The US defence secretary has called the recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=0.0s)]
*  the most complex and secretive in military history, but he gave few new details about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=5.2s)]
*  their impact. The Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has now acknowledged what he called [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  serious damage from the strikes, saying an assessment was underway. But he disputed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=16.8s)]
*  President Trump's assertion that there would be US-Iranian talks next week, saying no such [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=22.16s)]
*  plan had been set. Our chief international correspondent Lise Doucet is in the Iranian [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=27.44s)]
*  capital Tehran. She's being allowed to report from there on condition that none of her coverage [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=32.32s)]
*  is used on the BBC's Persian service, which broadcasts to the people of Iran. This law [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=37.04s)]
*  from the authorities applies to all international media agencies operating in Iran. This is the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=42.24s)]
*  report Lise said earlier. Iran's state TV, the studio where the supreme leader's speeches are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=48.08s)]
*  aired, but not today, not after Israel attacked it, forcing the newsreader to flee her desk [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=56.56s)]
*  devoured by fire. Today, a fiery message of his own from the Ayatollah said to have sheltered in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=70.64s)]
*  a bunker during the war. Iran, with its iron national resolve, rejects surrender. For a country [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=80.72s)]
*  like this, the idea of surrender is laughable to anyone who truly knows the Iranian nation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=89.52s)]
*  For now, a fragile ceasefire. Tehran starts to look like itself. Its infamous traffic, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=96.32s)]
*  its beautiful bazaars. Residents slowly returning to a city they left to escape the bombs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=103.84s)]
*  But for some, it's still a battle just to breathe. In this ward, there are civilians, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=112.64s)]
*  not soldiers. Murtaza shows his scars. He was working in the transport department when the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=120.08s)]
*  entrance to the notorious Evin prison was bombed. Israel lies, saying they are only hitting military [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=127.84s)]
*  and nuclear sites. They hit a prison. I was there. I was hurt. And I'm amazed countries like England, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=138.64s)]
*  France, the U.S. and the U.N. don't condemn Israel. The abandoned American embassy, a monument to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=144.8s)]
*  Iran's troubled relationship with the West, accused of sponsoring terrorism, of trying to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=154.88s)]
*  develop a nuclear bomb, charges Tehran denies. But even inside this former embassy, a cafe [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=160.88s)]
*  serving iced Americanos. Amir tells me he wants to see a better relationship between America [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=172.72s)]
*  and Iran, so many Iranians do. But in this dark time, there's still not much light. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=182.72s)]
*  The message in public was defiant. But this blackened studio symbolizes this dark moment [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=193.6s)]
*  in Iran. The most difficult and dangerous decisions confronting the supreme leader. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=201.04s)]
*  The most fateful choices in his nearly 40 years in power. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=208.0s)]
*  A new, uncertain chapter in an old, long-standing war. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  Lise Doucet, BBC News, Tehran. Well, Lise joined us live from Tehran a short while ago, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  and she told us it's still unclear just how much damage was done to Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, as we've been reporting on the news, there's been so many different assessments [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  coming from different capitals. The United States continues to use the exact description, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=236.96s)]
*  starting with President Trump, who in the immediate aftermath of those unprecedented strikes and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=242.32s)]
*  Iran's three main facilities, talked about how the American bombs had obliterated Iran's nuclear [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=247.92s)]
*  program. Then you had the intelligence assessment saying it was more limited, that it's only been [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=255.92s)]
*  set back a few months. And then yesterday, the supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=259.76s)]
*  made his first speech since President Trump announced a ceasefire, accused the United [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  States of exaggerating the extent of the damage. Perhaps the clearest assessment came from the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=270.24s)]
*  foreign minister of Iran, Abbas al-Aqshari, who did say there had been serious damage. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=277.36s)]
*  But the big question everyone is asking is just how far does that damage go? And the question [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=282.64s)]
*  the rest of the world is asking is how in what way and how soon can Iran resume the nuclear [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=287.28s)]
*  enrichment? That was Lise Doucet speaking to us a little bit earlier. Well, let's speak to our [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=294.0s)]
*  correspondent, Dan Johnson, who's in Jerusalem. Dan, we heard a defiant tone from Iran's supreme [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=298.96s)]
*  leader around 18 hours ago, but today hearing from the foreign minister that serious damage [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=305.28s)]
*  was caused, how close will we ever get to knowing the truth of how much Iran's nuclear program has [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=311.84s)]
*  been set back? It's really difficult to see if we'll ever get firm evidence or clear answers on that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=318.64s)]
*  Iran is at the moment subject to monitoring and inspections by the International Atomic Energy [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=327.67999999999995s)]
*  Agency, but there have been moves since this conflict in the Iranian parliament for Iran to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=333.28s)]
*  drop out of IEAE monitoring. So in terms of how that's going to be observed in the future, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=339.68s)]
*  how Israel, the Americans and the rest of the world is going to reassure itself that Iran isn't [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=345.92s)]
*  rebuilding its nuclear program, that is something that will have to be negotiated and agreed. And [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  at the moment the Iranians are saying they won't participate in those talks until they themselves [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=356.16s)]
*  have a full assessment of exactly what the level of damage is. So in the meantime, you've got this [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  war of words and this fight to control the narrative over exactly what has happened here, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=365.92s)]
*  and it may not in reality actually matter what happened on the ground. The Israeli leadership [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=370.8s)]
*  is trying to tell its people that this conflict was justified and worthwhile, that the US strikes [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=375.92s)]
*  were necessary and that they have achieved their aim. The Iranians are trying to tell their own [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=380.48s)]
*  people that their nation isn't weakened and that they could rebuild their nuclear program if indeed [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=385.44s)]
*  they choose to, although they maintain that it's not in pursuit of nuclear weapons, it's just for [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=390.32s)]
*  nuclear power. The rhetoric's completely swapped over if we go back two weeks to the start of this [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=394.32s)]
*  conflict when the Israelis were saying that the Iranians posed an existential threat, the Iranians [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=398.64s)]
*  were saying nothing to worry about, we're of no threat, there's nothing to be concerned about here. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=403.76s)]
*  Now you've got the Americans and the Israelis saying that the threat has been neutralised, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=407.68s)]
*  but the Iranians maintain they could potentially rebuild their nuclear program. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=411.84s)]
*  Dan, thank you. That's our correspondent Dan Johnson in Jerusalem for us. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwfLSkRt3E&t=415.92s)]
