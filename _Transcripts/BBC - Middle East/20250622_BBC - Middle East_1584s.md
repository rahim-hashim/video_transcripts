Video Description: Iran has warned Donald Trump that there will be a response to the US bombing of three key nuclear enrichment facilities.  
Iran's foreign minister warned of "everlasting consequences" to the "outrageous" strikes.   Its elite military force, the Revolutionary Guard, warned that US bases and forces in the region were “vulnerable”.     Iran’s Parliament backed the closure of the Strait of Hormuz - a key transit route for global oil supplies. S
Iran’s immediate response was to fire a new barrage of missiles at Israel, which began the war when it attacked Iran’s nuclear sites ten days ago.   Iranian missiles hit residential buildings in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa, injuring around 80 people. 
President Donald Trump claimed the US strikes had “totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, and told Tehran to "make peace" or face "far greater" attacks in future. 
Jane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith, Gordon Corera, Faisal Islam, Chris Mason, Siavash Ardalan, Orla Guerin, Lucy Williamson and Lyse Doucet.

# Iran threatens oil supplies and warns US bases “vulnerable” after strike on nuclear sites | BBC News
**BBC - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I)
*  The Trump administration has bombed Iran with strikes President Trump claims have obliterated the country's nuclear enrichment facilities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=0.0s)]
*  Ten days after Israel launched its attacks on the country [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=8.4s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister denied that the US strikes had caused a major blow and accused the US of breaking international law [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Tehran is threatening retaliation including closing a strategically important sea passage [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  The UN Security Council is holding an emergency meeting now [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=24.86s)]
*  The Secretary General said dialogue must prevail to stop the Middle East falling into a cycle of retaliation [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=29.22s)]
*  Well the US struck three key uranium enrichment sites one of them for dough [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=36.7s)]
*  These are the latest satellite images of that area [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  Difficult to assess the extent of the damage because the site is built deep under mountains [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=45.7s)]
*  The US also bombed the nuclear sites of Natanz and Isfahan [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=51.14s)]
*  this is Isfahan before the US strikes and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=55.78s)]
*  Afterwards you can see the damage inflicted by the bombing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=60.019999999999996s)]
*  We're dedicating most of our program to looking at how the US carried out the attack to global reaction [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  Chris Mason will be here to tell us about a phone call that's just happened between Donald Trump and Keir Starmer and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=70.98s)]
*  Crucially we look at what may happen next we also report from Israel after Iran launched another barrage of missiles today [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=76.97999999999999s)]
*  Our BBC Persian colleagues have been hearing from people inside Iran and we report from Turkey's border with Iran as people leave [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=84.46s)]
*  First tonight, let's go to Sarah Smith in Washington, Sarah [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=93.13999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump has just posted on social media that the damage to Iran's nuclear strikes is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  Monumental but at the same time he is trying to stress that he doesn't believe his country is now at war with Iran [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=105.7s)]
*  The vice president JD Vance has said they are at war with Iran's nuclear program [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  But not with the country and you've got officials emphasizing that they're not trying to topple the ruling regime in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=116.62s)]
*  Tehran and the Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying it's time to get back to direct [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=124.06s)]
*  Negotiations between the US and Iran and that America would be ready to talk tomorrow [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=128.66s)]
*  All of this is very clearly aimed at trying to stop this spiraling out of control and becoming a full-scale war between [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=133.3s)]
*  America and Iran [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=140.9s)]
*  Donald Trump who promised to end foreign wars went on live television to announce the attacks that may have just made him yet another [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=144.22s)]

*  In the White House Situation Room with his top security officials [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  President Trump making the final decision to attack had to calculate what the consequences might be [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=180.1s)]
*  Will air strikes against Iran's nuclear sites result in attacks on US forces that could start a full-scale war [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=185.94s)]
*  In these pictures from Istifan you can see and hear the air strikes hitting one of the three nuclear sites attacked [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  Iran obviously knew this was a possibility, but may not have been expecting it so soon [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  President Trump had said he would take up to two weeks to decide whether to take military action [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=206.14s)]
*  At the Pentagon they want to say this operation is already over Iran should not respond [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=211.3s)]
*  The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=216.74s)]
*  Showing the world that American deterrence is back when this president speaks [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=222.46s)]
*  The world should listen this Pentagon map shows warplanes taking off from Missouri in the American heartland and flying a 40-hour [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=229.82000000000002s)]

*  after the air strikes [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=251.02s)]
*  The b2 bombers totally obliterated the site claimed Donald Trump [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=252.86s)]
*  The US military haven't actually made a final assessment, but say the facility has been severely damaged not destroyed [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=257.26s)]
*  Iran has said it will respond in self-defense. It hasn't said how it is an outrageous [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=264.82s)]
*  grave and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=271.18s)]
*  unprecedented [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=274.1s)]
*  international law [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  the warmongering a lawless administration in Washington [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=280.98s)]
*  is solely and fully [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=286.54s)]
*  responsible for the dangerous consequences and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=289.22s)]
*  for reaching implement implications of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=292.06s)]
*  its act of aggression [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  World leaders have hastily convened crisis meetings in international capitals aware that a growing conflict would affect them all [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=299.34s)]
*  The UN Security Council is in emergency session deeply concerned about military escalation in the Middle East [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=307.58s)]
*  the people of the region cannot endure another cycle of destruction and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=314.18s)]
*  Yet we now risk descending into a red hole of retaliation after retaliation [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=320.5s)]
*  The US Congress was not consulted before the strikes the president can take limited military actions without it only [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=328.74s)]
*  Congress can authorize going to war [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=336.34s)]
*  Democrats claim mr. Trump has acted [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=339.18s)]
*  Unconstitutionally, this is the US jumping into a war of choice at Donald Trump's urging [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=341.86s)]
*  Without any compelling national security interests for the United States to act in this way particularly without a debate and vote in Congress [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=347.9s)]
*  As these b2 bombers are seen returning to their American base their commanders [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=357.74s)]
*  Don't know if they have undertaken a specific limited mission or started a war [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=362.7s)]
*  How will Iran retaliate for these airstrikes and what will the u.s. Do then? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=367.7s)]
*  This is a delicate and dangerous moment in the Middle East and around the world [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=372.18s)]
*  And let's talk to Sarah in Washington [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=377.82s)]
*  What's your sense Sarah of whether the Trump administration that thinks this operation is over? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=382.5s)]
*  Well as far as they're concerned yes, they want this to be an end to it [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=390.42s)]
*  But of course it's not entirely up to them how Iran responds to this and that's why there is such deep [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=394.86s)]
*  Concern all the way around the world that this could easily get out of control with disastrous [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=400.26s)]
*  Consequences that would actually go beyond the Middle East you've got the leaders for instance of Britain France and Germany coming together to urge Iran [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=405.34000000000003s)]
*  Not to do anything that would further destabilize the region because just think about it [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=412.82s)]
*  Iran could in retaliation easily try to hit one of the many nearby US bases if any [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=418.14s)]
*  Americans were to be killed Donald Trump would feel compelled to respond to that and you can see easily how this could then begin to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=424.58000000000004s)]
*  Escalate it's important also to watch what's being said from Russia and from China because those are allies of Iran [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=432.42s)]
*  So far both countries have condemned the airstrikes and said that they've breached international law [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=440.06s)]
*  But they also are urging a return to diplomacy not more fighting and neither of them have getting in given any [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=445.18s)]
*  Indication so far that they would do anything to help Iran which is important when we look at the way that this could possibly [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=452.34s)]
*  escalate around the world [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=458.98s)]
*  Sarah thank you for now Sarah Smith well more than a hundred US warplanes including stealth bombers [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=461.02000000000004s)]
*  We used to carry out the attacks code named Operation Midnight Hammer [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=466.94s)]
*  As we've heard President Trump said in his TV address that Iran's nuclear facilities were [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=471.3s)]
*  Obliterated our security analyst Gordon Carrera has been working with BBC verify to assess whether that really is the case [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  American B2 stealth bombers returning home today after a strike that took Iran and the world by surprise [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=484.78s)]
*  And having dropped weapons never used before in conflict [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=492.14s)]
*  One group of B2s had flown from their base in the US out west towards the Pacific they were a decoy [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=497.86s)]
*  Seven more flew east for 18 hours refueling on the way [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=505.7s)]
*  Minimizing their communications to stay silent [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=509.82s)]
*  Just before they reached Iran a US submarine launched more than two dozen missiles [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=513.06s)]
*  Towards a nuclear site at Isfahan then the B2s entered Iranian airspace [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=518.06s)]
*  Apparently without being spotted before striking two more target areas that included dropping 14 [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=523.0999999999999s)]
*  So-called massive ordnance penetrators or bunker buster bombs [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=529.74s)]
*  Final battle damage will take some time but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=534.62s)]
*  Sustained extremely severe damage and destruction [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=541.02s)]
*  So how successful were the US strikes? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=545.42s)]
*  The key target was a place called Fordo [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  The B2 bombers flew a route that took them high above the site where Iran enriches uranium which could be used in nuclear bombs [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=552.62s)]
*  It's buried in tunnels and deep under a mountain [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=560.0600000000001s)]
*  Now this is what Fordo looked like before the attack and this image is the B2 bomber [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=563.98s)]
*  Confirmed by BBC verify is just hours after the strike and you can see over here these holes [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=570.94s)]
*  That looks like where the bombs impacted before burrowing down and then exploding and the white you can see around it [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=577.42s)]
*  It's probably concrete dust thrown up by the resulting explosion [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=584.3000000000001s)]
*  Now here is the Isfahan site before the bombing [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=589.1s)]
*  And this is what it looks like now [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=592.86s)]
*  So far the international atomic energy agency says it's seen no radiation leaking from the sites [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=595.58s)]
*  And one possibility is that that's because the nuclear material might not have been there [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=601.98s)]
*  These images were taken just a couple of days before the attack at Fordo and they show a large number of trucks [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=609.02s)]
*  It's possible they could have moved some of the uranium as iran has claimed [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=616.22s)]
*  This was an intense nuclear facility before the attack and the question is whether after it [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=621.8199999999999s)]
*  Iran retains the nuclear material equipment and scientists some of whom have been killed to rebuild [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=627.7399999999999s)]
*  Or even race for a nuclear bomb if so, then we may see even more strikes [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=634.6999999999999s)]
*  There is no doubt this attack is a violation of the united nation charter and as well as [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=640.4599999999999s)]
*  Uh one aggression arm aggression to the iranian national sovereignty and iranian territorial integrity [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=647.26s)]
*  But international law will not stop this conflict escalating [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=654.54s)]
*  Iran could hit back by firing missiles at us bases in neighboring iraq or in barrain or kata [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=658.3000000000001s)]
*  It could even close the strait of hormones. That's an economically vital route through which shipping and especially oil flows [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=665.42s)]
*  As american b2s landed back at base in missouri this mission may be over [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=672.94s)]
*  But the war they are now part of may only have just begun [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=679.5s)]

*  Well, we can talk now to our economics editor faisal islam and our political editor chris mason and faisal picking up on what gordon was saying there [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=686.7800000000001s)]
*  I mean that threat to potentially close the straits for moves. I mean that would have a huge economic impact, wouldn't it? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=693.58s)]
*  Absolutely, we're on the pathway to potential serious economic consequences [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=699.26s)]
*  The interesting thing is up until this point over the past couple of weeks since israel and iran started trading missiles [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=704.3000000000001s)]
*  We have had a pretty calm markets oil price up about nine percent, which would have an impact on price [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=710.38s)]
*  But you know definitely not any sort of crisis [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=715.9s)]
*  The oil market opened in about an hour and all focus on some words coming out of terran from the parliament not from the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=718.78s)]
*  government saying that they [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=726.6800000000001s)]
*  Will close the straits now. What does that actually mean? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=729.1800000000001s)]
*  Uh, it depends. There are some [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=732.46s)]
*  Reasons why you might think terran would have some restraint here [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=735.26s)]
*  They export their oil to china, for example already seeing the americans saying to china [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=739.26s)]
*  You need to talk to iranians tell them not to do this [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=743.82s)]
*  But you get 20 percent of the world's oil 20 percent of the world's gas coming from qatar increasingly important for europe [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=746.46s)]
*  since the russia ukraine war [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=753.74s)]
*  All of this obviously depends on the cycle of diplomatic and military escalation, too [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=756.62s)]
*  But unlike russia ukraine in this case, it wouldn't be a side product of the conflict [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=760.7s)]
*  This would be a weapon in iran's armory to try and internationalize the crisis through the world economy [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=765.74s)]
*  All right, fazl and we'll pick up chris on some of that in a moment before I talk to you though [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=771.9s)]
*  Let's just hear a little of uh, kiastama the prime minister with some of his responses just a little earlier today [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=775.66s)]
*  We've long had concerns about the iranian nuclear program [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=782.86s)]
*  and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=786.78s)]
*  Um being very clear that iran cannot have a nuclear weapon the u.s has now taken action to alleviate that threat [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=787.5s)]
*  Uh, it is important [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=795.74s)]
*  That we now de-escalate the situation [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=797.74s)]
*  Um stabilize the region [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=800.78s)]
*  Um and get the parties back around the table to negotiate [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=803.02s)]
*  The [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=806.7199999999999s)]
*  That was part of what he said earlier and chris. I mean really treading quite a difficult line here [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=808.06s)]
*  Yeah, so the prime minister has spoken to president trump tonight, but crucially jane there wasn't that call [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=813.4399999999999s)]
*  Beforehand which could have been demanding a yes or no answer from the prime minister [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=820.38s)]
*  In other words whether the uk was willing to get involved in any way [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  So for instance granting permission to use the air base at diego garcia in the indian ocean [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=827.1199999999999s)]
*  And that would have been a real dilemma for the prime minister because on the one hand he's been talking about de-escalation [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=832.9599999999999s)]
*  The suggestion that there were concerns raised privately about the legal basis for being involved [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=837.52s)]
*  So saying yes would have been difficult but then saying no would have been difficult when he's been assiduously building a relationship [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=842.56s)]
*  With president trump. So how do we assess the uk's position tonight? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=848.4s)]
*  It is willing the ends that america is pursuing which is removing iran's nuclear threat, but it is conspicuously not [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=852.4799999999999s)]
*  Explicitly endorsing the means in other words america's attacks now the conservatives say that this is equivocation that it is moral cowardice [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=860.22s)]
*  President trump was openly dismissive earlier in the weekend on european efforts at diplomacy [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=868.24s)]
*  Those efforts though continue as I say the prime minister talking to the president by phone [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=874.1600000000001s)]
*  Tonight the foreign secretary has spoken to marco rubio the u.s secretary of state [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=878.1600000000001s)]
*  During the attacks while they were taking place and again today as well as speaking to the iranians the israelis [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=882.48s)]
*  And others the uk position is one that diplomacy is the long-term path [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=888.1800000000001s)]
*  To a long-term solution that ensures that iran doesn't have nuclear weapons [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=894.02s)]
*  The thing is america wasn't willing to listen to europe beforehand [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=899.3000000000001s)]
*  The question now is whether it'll be willing to listen in the future [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=902.58s)]
*  And in the next couple of days president trump the prime minister and plenty of others getting together the nato summit in the netherlands [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=906.9000000000001s)]
*  To work out what to do next amongst other things [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=913.7s)]
*  Chris thanks very much chris mason faizal islam. Thank you [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=916.58s)]
*  Well iran's president has said that his country won't be bullied and that the u.s must receive a response to its aggression [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=920.02s)]
*  So what are the options now for iran's leaders? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=927.62s)]
*  The bbc isn't currently allowed to broadcast from inside the country [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=930.58s)]
*  But the bbc has a persian service that reports on what's happening there [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=933.7s)]
*  This report is from sylvas adlan of the bbc persian service here in london [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=937.86s)]
*  Iran [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=942.5s)]
*  In the center of the crowd iran's president surrounded by hundreds of party faithful [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=945.3s)]
*  Venting their fury at the united states [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=953.38s)]
*  What america did is truly unforgivable says this woman iran is stronger than they perceive [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=958.82s)]
*  But after last night's u.s attacks the regime here is seriously weakened [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=967.06s)]
*  So what comes next [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=973.3s)]
*  The iranian supreme leader ali khamenei could swallow his pride and possibly save his regime and the country [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=976.66s)]
*  From further damage or he could fight on and risk everything [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=983.54s)]
*  Domestic public opinion is now divided and confused [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=988.74s)]
*  The response must be firm and decisive what's at stake here is the very identity of being iranian [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=994.98s)]
*  In my opinion iran needs to engage in some reflection and contemplation [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1002.58s)]
*  As for the country's revolutionary guard it responded by saying u.s military bases in the region are vulnerable [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1009.14s)]
*  But they know retaliation would invite further u.s attacks [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1016.9s)]
*  This is a state tv reporter who went to fordough. I can't see much damage. He says [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1022.34s)]
*  For now, it's america's word against iran's [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1027.86s)]
*  weakened and humiliated [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1031.94s)]
*  The iranian regime will struggle to maintain its credibility and grip on power in the face of widespread discontent [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1033.7s)]
*  Syabash Ardalan bbc news [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1041.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, some people in iran have chosen to cross to bordering countries [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1044.9s)]
*  Our correspondent ola gherian reports now from turkey's border with iran at the capakoy border crossing [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1049.06s)]
*  Where she's been speaking to people as they arrive [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1055.22s)]
*  Turkey's border with iran [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1058.42s)]
*  flanked by mountains [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1062.18s)]
*  And now a gateway to and from a country under attack [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1064.66s)]
*  At the capakoy crossing this morning. We found movement in both directions [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1069.78s)]
*  Some fleeing the bombing by israel and america [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1075.22s)]
*  Others rushing back home to be with loved ones [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1079.3s)]
*  Amir a retired british iranian had just fled terran and what was your feeling when you got across the border here? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1083.46s)]
*  Feeling relieved really to be honest with you. I feel relieved. Yes [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1092.26s)]
*  How dangerous was the situation in? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1096.74s)]
*  It is bad the sky belongs to to to the israelis [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1099.86s)]
*  So they can't do what they like. They're just coming in. They just bomb and go [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1104.42s)]
*  And nothing there to stop them because they've got this guy and that's it [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1109.06s)]
*  Very scary for you very very scary for everyone [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1114.6599999999999s)]
*  Amir says he got out with no help from the british embassy [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1117.9399999999998s)]
*  but all of a sudden [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1122.34s)]
*  embassies closed staff are gone [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1124.26s)]
*  phone is cut off [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1127.3799999999999s)]
*  And nobody answered [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1129.2199999999998s)]
*  So I had to get my way out of the country. That's the way i'm here now. You had to come on your own [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1131.62s)]
*  I had to yes [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1137.0600000000002s)]
*  This is what he left behind a country under fire a regime that is holding on [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1138.8200000000002s)]
*  And a war that may now escalate [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1145.3000000000002s)]
*  But some like 13 year old daria are hoping that a new iran may emerge from the ashes [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1149.0600000000002s)]
*  He crossed the border today with his younger brother and his mother [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1156.18s)]
*  He told me he'll go home if change comes [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1161.14s)]
*  Is [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1164.18s)]
*  God willing iran will be free [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1166.3400000000001s)]
*  Soon all of us will live in freedom. He says and the islamic republic will be gone [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1170.02s)]
*  But among those going back into iran today there was more caution [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1178.66s)]
*  We found no one willing to speak on camera [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1183.46s)]
*  One man told us we're too afraid [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1186.8200000000002s)]
*  Well in the last half an hour or so we've seen a few more people coming out from iran bringing their suitcases [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1190.1200000000001s)]
*  What we witnessed today was not a flood by and large [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1196.22s)]
*  It was people leaving who had the means to do so who had a place to go to [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1199.72s)]
*  One man told us he had friends and relatives who wanted to leave but didn't have passports and couldn't get out [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1204.68s)]
*  Now on the critical question of what happens to the regime [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1210.92s)]
*  We heard very differing opinions [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1214.36s)]
*  One government employee who was going back in said he believed the regime would fall in the end not now [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1216.36s)]
*  But he feared that at that point there would be a takeover by the military [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1223.3999999999999s)]
*  A younger man said to us look the leadership has hung on for decades. They can probably hang on now [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1227.7199999999998s)]
*  And even among those who were hoping for change wishing for change believing it would come [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1234.12s)]
*  There were also fears being expressed about how many people might be killed and tonight just across the border behind me inside iran [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1239.4s)]
*  No one has any idea what is coming next and that holds true across the region [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1246.92s)]
*  Ola, thank you. Ola Geirin [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1253.72s)]
*  As we've heard iran says it's keeping all options open in terms of retaliation [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1256.3600000000001s)]
*  But its immediate response today was to launch more missile strikes on israel [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1260.8400000000001s)]
*  Which began direct hostilities when it attacked iran 10 days ago [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1265.56s)]
*  Iranian missiles struck Haifa and Tel Aviv injuring more than 80 people [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1269.4s)]
*  Tonight president Netanyahu has said israel will keep going until it achieves its goals [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1274.28s)]
*  Lucy Williamson reports from Tel Aviv [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1279.32s)]
*  Iran once saw its ballistic missiles as a deterrent against israeli attacks [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1284.28s)]

*  It now faces the critical decision of whether negotiations offer a better chance of protection than a nuclear weapon [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1358.04s)]
*  Israel's prime minister said today that america's intervention was a turning point in the war [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1366.3600000000001s)]

*  To a future of prosperity and peace [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1387.96s)]
*  But not all american intelligence agencies shared israel's assessment that iran had suddenly begun racing to build a nuclear weapon [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1391.48s)]
*  All I know is that from an israeli perspective [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1399.72s)]
*  Our margin of error on iran and its nuclear program is exactly zero [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1403.3999999999999s)]
*  And all we have to do is make one mistake and we're dead [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1410.52s)]
*  And if the israeli government concluded that it was going to err on the side of survival it was going to err on the side of survival [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1414.04s)]

*  Well, we'll get the thoughts of lisa set in just a moment our chief international correspondent [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1435.32s)]
*  But just to tell you what president trump has been saying on truth social [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1439.9599999999998s)]
*  His social media platform just in the last few moments in relation to regime change and that's why we're bringing this [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1445.1599999999999s)]
*  To you. It's not politically correct to use the term regime change says the president [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1452.28s)]
*  But if the current iranian regime is unable to make iran great again, why wouldn't there be a regime change? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1456.44s)]
*  let's [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1464.92s)]
*  Talk to lease [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1466.2s)]
*  Lots to look ahead to in terms of what's happening next week lease [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1468.52s)]
*  But i'm interested in your thoughts on that as well just in the last few moments [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1471.16s)]
*  Yes in the midst of this escalating military pressure the r word regime change keeps coming up [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1476.04s)]
*  At the briefing of the pentagon early this morning. It was the first question [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1481.72s)]
*  Asked by journalists who said is this about regime change like where is this going to go and peter hagg said the defense secretary was adamant [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1485.24s)]
*  One line answer. This is not about regime change [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1492.04s)]
*  And never mind that prime minister netanyahu the first day that he began esrael's military operations 10 days ago [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1496.2s)]
*  He made it clear that he would like it to be about regime change [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1501.72s)]
*  But I think putting aside truth social the real question on everyone's mind tonight jane is what is iran going to do? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1505.24s)]
*  Next and it does seem clear that at some point in some way iran will want to retaliate [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1511.8s)]
*  But can it do it without ratcheting up the pressure because there is this danger [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1517.0s)]
*  In these febrile times of a dangerous miscalculation [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1522.04s)]
*  Because the other thing that president trump said today [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1525.56s)]
*  He seemed to suggest this these strikes were what we call them a one and done in other words in his words [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1528.3600000000001s)]
*  We've obliterated iran's nuclear program. So this is this is over [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1534.1200000000001s)]
*  But that's not likely to be the reality and certainly not the view of prime minister netanyahu of israel [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1539.32s)]
*  His new partner in these strikes who's likely to want to draw the u.s [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1545.32s)]
*  And even more so that he can cement his success [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1549.7199999999998s)]
*  In having the united states play a key role [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1553.08s)]
*  But this week jane finally is going to be a week where many are going to be [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1556.28s)]
*  At president trump's here most of all at the nato summit at the hag as chris mason mentioned european leaders are going to say you've got to [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1559.9599999999998s)]
*  Desc the escalate take the path to diplomacy arab and european allies are going to be also on the phone to iran [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1566.44s)]
*  Iran says it won't talk while the bombs are falling while the bombs are falling [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1574.2s)]
*  Tension will only keep rising [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1579.24s)]
*  Please thanks so much least is set [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJUa_KDe_I&t=1581.4s)]
