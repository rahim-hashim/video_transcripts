# Iran launches missiles at US bases in Qatar and Iraq, state media reports | BBC News
**BBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ)
*  This is BBC News, I'm Lewis Thorne-Jones. We are bringing you continuing coverage of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the latest breaking news, the developments, the reports that Iran is striking a US-run [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=9.36s)]
*  military base in Qatar. Let me run you through some of the details that we have, what we [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=17.88s)]
*  know right now and what we're still waiting for confirmation on. We know that Qatar closed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=23.44s)]
*  its airspace, diverted planes away from it. We know that the reports are that the White [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=29.12s)]
*  House accepted that there were credible threats to this airbase, this US-run airbase. Then [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=36.68s)]
*  reports came through from AFP journalists initially of explosions over Doha. These [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=46.24s)]
*  are the live pictures over Doha, of course, the capital of Qatar. So just to remind you [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=55.3s)]
*  that this credible threat that was reported a short time ago is to the Al-Udeid US-run [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=62.9s)]
*  airbase in Qatar. It's basically the biggest US-run airbase in the Middle East, in the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=69.82s)]
*  region and was seen as a likely logical potential target for Iran to retaliate against US forces [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=76.7s)]
*  after the US attack on its nuclear facilities over the weekend. So there had been receipts [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=85.22s)]
*  of a credible threat to this US airbase and in the last few minutes explosions heard over [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=93.7s)]
*  the capital Doha. Let's take a look at these pictures from a little bit earlier and let's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=101.14s)]
*  take a listen as well. So those pictures were just from the last 20 minutes or so. We are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=108.02s)]
*  back now to the live pictures just to explain the geography and the timing of all this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=123.58s)]
*  These are the live pictures of Doha, just gone 8 o'clock in the evening as you can see [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=129.26s)]
*  and within the last 30 minutes those pictures that we just ran showing those explosions [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=134.5s)]
*  near, being heard near Doha. Now we understand that the credible threat was to the Al-Udeid US-run [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  airbase, not directly the civilian areas of Doha itself, but instead this US-run military [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=151.74s)]
*  airbase. Now we understand precautionary measures have been taken at this airbase, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=160.26s)]
*  planes potentially have flown out the way and of course defences at the ready. This comes after [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  the shelter-in-place order for US citizens in Qatar a little earlier. And one new line to bring [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=174.42s)]
*  just in the last couple of minutes, just since I've sat in the chair here and taken over from my [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  colleague, Donald Trump we understand from the Reuters news agency citing CNBC, citing an admin [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=187.94s)]
*  official. Slightly convoluted there but I just wanted to give you where we're getting this from. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=198.18s)]
*  The line is this, Donald Trump is currently in the Situation Room with the Defence Secretary and the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=202.74s)]
*  Joint Chiefs. So Donald Trump currently in the Situation Room with the Defence Secretary and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=209.66s)]
*  Joint Chiefs. That is from CNBC, American Network, citing an official in the administration, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=216.3s)]
*  getting to us here via the Reuters news agencies. Our team in the US will be following that up. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=223.82s)]
*  So if you have just joined us in the last few minutes, these are the live pictures that we are [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=231.46s)]
*  showing you right now over Doha. The reason being that explosions were heard over Doha. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=236.74s)]
*  Potential credible threat was suspected at the Al Udeid US-run military base. It's the biggest US [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=244.06s)]
*  base in the Middle East, in the region, and was seen as a potential target for Iran to retaliate [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  after those strikes when the US got involved over the weekend and of course hit those nuclear [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=260.46s)]
*  facilities. So all these developments reaching us in the last 20-30 minutes or so. So let's just try [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=268.5s)]
*  and pause for breath for a moment now. We've established the live pictures and we've established [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=277.78s)]
*  those pictures of the explosion that we have. Let's speak now to the BBC World Service, Nafisa Konev. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=282.18s)]
*  So just bring us up to date, given what we've just been learning over the last few minutes of how [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=291.3s)]
*  things stand there where you are. Right now in Iraq also we heard and confirmed that Iraq's Al [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=299.46000000000004s)]
*  Asad base, which housing US troops, has been attacked by but apparently according to sources [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=311.34000000000003s)]
*  that talk to us and two missiles were fired towards Al Asad, which is the US's biggest base [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  in Ambar province and these two missiles, as our military sources are saying, has been intercepted. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=328.34s)]
*  We still don't know that if this is the first wave of attack or this is all that Iran wanted to do, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=340.78s)]
*  but we can confirm that Iran has carried out this attack calling it its naming tidings of victory. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=348.62s)]
*  And it doesn't say more, Iran's news agencies, that what comes next, but they say that Iran [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  simultaneously has attacked US bases in Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and here in Iraq. It was expected [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=366.54s)]
*  all these countries were in high alert and this morning most American citizens in Qatar, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=377.58s)]
*  they received first email from US embassy asking them to stay in sheltered area and not to come [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=385.02s)]
*  out until further notice and then after that a few hours after officially the US embassy posted that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=394.14s)]
*  warning to on its platform and then that was followed by the UK warning to its British citizens [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=402.54s)]
*  in Qatar asking the same precautionary step to take and stay in sheltered area. So step by step, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=413.02s)]
*  hours by hours, we could feel in the region that that is coming. But as I said, it is not clear [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=421.82s)]
*  that it is the whole thing that Iran wanted to do, but or it is only the first wave. I remember [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=429.5s)]
*  in 2020 when the US killed in Quds forces commander, IRGC Quds forces commander Qassem Soleimani here [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=436.38s)]
*  in Baghdad and assassinated him, Iran answered, retaliated by firing two or three waves of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=448.14s)]
*  ballistic missiles towards Al-Assad air base and also Erbil air base housing US and coalition troops. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=457.66s)]
*  So it can be expected that this is only the first wave or it can be only the thing that Iran just [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=466.38000000000005s)]
*  wanted to send a message to the US that it can reach its bases. Although this Al-Odeid base, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=475.90000000000003s)]
*  which is you mentioned that it is the biggest and the most important base in the region is [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=483.98s)]
*  massive, is a massive and a very well protected bases. I have traveled to several US bases and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=489.58000000000004s)]
*  that is the most protected base I can tell. And before this attack, there was a lot of alarms and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=496.94s)]
*  warnings so that led to US forces evacuating their fighter jets and also some other equipments to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=505.42s)]
*  safer areas. And Nafi say more broadly now then given these strikes, how does that change the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=516.14s)]
*  international geopolitical balance of power there? How does it change relations between Iraq and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=525.98s)]
*  Iran and potentially here Qatar and Iran? To be honest, I think Iran is in odd with all these [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=532.3s)]
*  countries right now. Iran is in a very difficult situation and no one can deny that. Tehran is in [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  a difficult delicate situation that has lost its trust to neighboring country as well, including [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=548.8599999999999s)]
*  Iraq. Despite that Iraqi government multiple times has said that they oppose the Israeli jets [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=555.42s)]
*  using its aerospace to attack Iran, but they can't do anything more than that. And there are reports [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=563.0999999999999s)]
*  that even US, some of the US fighters has used and then they have used Iraqi aerospace, which is [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=569.8199999999999s)]
*  closest country to Iran and Iran had once open time, it had a very deep influence in this country. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=576.9399999999999s)]
*  But still its aerospace was open to these jets to fly over and reach Iran and target. Although Iraqi [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=584.38s)]
*  government says they cannot do much about these jets, they are opposing, they have complained [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=595.18s)]
*  against this to the UN, but not for the steps they can take. And other countries, other Arab countries [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=601.74s)]
*  in especially Iran, the Persian Gulf, despite that they have built a very close relationship [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=610.46s)]
*  recently with Iran, but also when it comes to the US, they have other calculations, even in their [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=619.02s)]
*  statements regarding US attack on Iran's nuclear sites, they were so cautioned, they were so [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=627.26s)]
*  delicate in putting in words that they are condemning this attack. Their behavior was different of how [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=634.94s)]
*  they put statements out when Israel attacked Iran. So you can feel that how Tehran can feel regarding [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=644.22s)]
*  the situation. And I think Tehran is in the situation that it feels that there is no reason to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=652.94s)]
*  step back and think about its neighboring countries and its relationship right now with [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=661.98s)]
*  Persian Gulf countries. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=669.1800000000001s)]
*  Avisa, thank you very much for the moment. So this is a fast moving, fast developing situation, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=671.34s)]
*  of course. I just want to bring you again those latest pictures we have showing the explosions [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=676.94s)]
*  in the skies of Qatar. We will have them in just a minute. Apologies for that. We will just get those [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=681.58s)]
*  lined up again. They are the only pictures we have so far. Let's take a look and listen. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=688.14s)]
*  So we are just going to play those through for you again because it is [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=705.5s)]
*  clearly quite tricky to see. Let's take a look. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=709.34s)]
*  So that is the second time through there of those pictures. We will keep playing those pictures as [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=718.14s)]
*  well as keeping across the live pictures for you. So this is a developing situation. My colleague [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=726.38s)]
*  Siavash Adlan is with me here. Siavash, just talk us through the very latest, if you would. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=732.62s)]
*  Well, I am just going to give you the reactions coming out of Iran. A few minutes ago, Iranian [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=737.26s)]
*  state TV confirmed the attack as well. And then we had a statement coming out from the IRGC, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=741.74s)]
*  which is Iran's Revolutionary Guards. They confirmed that they have carried out a missile [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=746.46s)]
*  attack against the U.S. bases in Qatar. But nothing about Iraq. There were some reports about attacks [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=750.94s)]
*  on U.S. bases in Iraq as well. They didn't mention Iraq. It was just about Qatar itself. They said [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=756.22s)]
*  that we have launched these missiles. They didn't speak of whether they had any reports of impacts [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=762.38s)]
*  or so on. They just described their attacks as very successful. And then you had another body in [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=768.14s)]
*  Iran, which is the High National Security Council. They also issued a communique. And they went into [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=773.26s)]
*  more details saying that they fired six rockets. Six is the same number of bombs that were used by [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=779.18s)]
*  the U.S. to attack the Fort Oslo. They specifically mentioned that. So I guess it was a symbolic [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=786.7s)]
*  gesture firing exactly six missiles. And they also stressed that we tried to avoid any civilian [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=792.54s)]
*  casualties. Our target was specifically the U.S. base. And they also went at some length to say [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=799.34s)]
*  this has or should not have any impact on what they described as Iran's friendly and brotherly [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=806.62s)]
*  relations with our Qatari neighbors. So these two institutions have confirmed the attacks [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=812.7800000000001s)]
*  and the motives behind it. We haven't had any report yet of moments of impact, though some [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=819.98s)]
*  Iranian outlets are showing videos, which we don't know, where they haven't been verified yet, showing [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=825.66s)]
*  one impact from the missiles as well. But that's not confirmed. So that's as much as we can tell you so far. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=831.02s)]
*  Interesting. Really interesting. And just give us a sense of background. Those sources and the media [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=838.78s)]
*  in Iran. Just talk us through how credible they are, how they operate, and what kind of freedom [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=845.42s)]
*  reminds us of the situation in the country. Well, the state media is obviously completely under the [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=854.14s)]
*  control of the state. So we just look at that mainly for confirmation of what we already want [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=858.22s)]
*  to get official confirmation from. So that's state media as a criteria of confirmation of [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=863.66s)]
*  certain kinds of news. Otherwise, the Iranian authorities have instructed the press and other [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=869.66s)]
*  media outlets other than state-run TV to be very careful of what they report. Very much similar to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc23hxQFMdQ&t=875.5s)]
