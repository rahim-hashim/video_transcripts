Video Description: An Israeli official said his country would agree a permanent end to its offensive in Gaza if the Palestinian group Hamas agrees to an initial 60-day ceasefire and disarms.
The official said Israel would continue its attacks if they didn't do so.Â 
Hamas said ongoing talks were difficult and accused Israel which ended a previous ceasefire agreement of "intransigence".
In Gaza, Israeli attacks are continuing across the territory, reportedly killing 23 people, including several children.
The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington on Wednesday, where he said he and President Trump were in lock-step to secure a hostage deal, but not at any price.
 
Four days of talks in Doha, Qatar, have not resulted in a breakthrough, but President Trump suggested on Wednesday a deal was close.

# Israel will continue attacks on Hamas if they don't agree to ceasefire - Israeli official | BBC News
**BBC - Middle East:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4)
*  Let's turn to Gaza now. An Israeli official has said his country will consider a permanent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=0.0s)]
*  end to its offensive in Gaza if Hamas agrees to an initial 60-day ceasefire and disarms. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=6.9s)]
*  The official said Israel would continue its attacks if the Palestinian group didn't do [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  so. Earlier, Hamas said ongoing talks were difficult and accused Israel, which ended [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=19.34s)]
*  a previous ceasefire agreement of intransigence. In Gaza, Israeli attacks are continuing across [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=24.98s)]
*  the territory, reportedly killing at least 23 people, including several children. Israeli [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=30.98s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington on Wednesday where he said he and President [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=37.06s)]
*  Trump were in lockstep to secure a hostage deal, but not at any price. Four days of proximity [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=43.14s)]
*  talks in Doha haven't resulted in any breakthrough, but Mr Trump again suggested on Wednesday [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=50.32s)]
*  that a deal was close. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=56.52s)]
*  I think we have a chance this week or next week, not definitely. There's nothing definite [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  about war and Gaza and all of the other places that we all deal with so much, but there's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=65.08s)]
*  a very good chance that we'll have a settlement and agreement of some kind this week and maybe [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  next week if not. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=78.08s)]
*  Let's speak now to our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Usher, who's in Jerusalem for us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=79.84s)]
*  Sebastian, which side is more likely to concede on this major sticking point of the permanent [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=85.28s)]
*  ceasefire and Israeli military withdrawal? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=90.96s)]
*  That's a very good question. I don't think we know. Essentially, that has been a very, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  very big sticking point and the senior Israeli official essentially brought the attention [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  back to that. What we've been hearing about in the past few days from the indirect talks [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  is on other issues, the issue of how aid will be distributed in Gaza. Hamas doesn't want [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=112.24s)]
*  this new mechanism, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, to continue. It wants the UN and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  other aid agencies to resume the aid, as has been the case in the past. It also wants Israeli [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  troops to pull back to positions that they held before the resumption of the offensive [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=132.4s)]
*  by Israel after the last ceasefire collapsed. So this main obstacle, which has been in the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=137.16s)]
*  way again and again, which is essentially Hamas wants a guarantee as cast iron as possible [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=145.32s)]
*  that any truce will lead to the end of the war, that there will be no turning back, and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=151.28s)]
*  the Israeli government's position, the position of the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=158.72s)]
*  that isn't the case, that Israel, if necessary, needs to continue its operations in Gaza if they [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=163.16s)]
*  still believe that there's a threat posed by Hamas. What we heard from this senior Israeli [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=169.72s)]
*  official, unnamed overnight, was a reiteration of that, essentially, which we haven't been hearing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  in the past few days, this call for Hamas to disarm. Now, we know from Israel that it essentially [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  wants, and we heard this from Mr Netanyahu again in the past couple of days, but it wants Hamas [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=189.4s)]
*  essentially to be completely eliminated in terms of any military or political control of Gaza. That [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  would mean essentially that its leadership would probably be sent into exile and it would disarm. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, Hamas has come close to saying that before, but it's never gone as far, I think, as Israel [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  wants. Now, it's whether Hamas is ready to accept guarantees put out by President Trump that this [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=216.52s)]
*  ceasefire will lead to a permanent end to the war, whether it accepts Israel's contention, that it [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=225.36s)]
*  will very seriously engage with that idea during the 60 days of a ceasefire, and therefore Hamas [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=231.56s)]
*  believes that it should accede to the ceasefire, even if it might only end up being a temporary [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=236.96s)]
*  ceasefire, but it could lead to an end to the war, or whether Hamas digs its heels in again and says, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=242.36s)]
*  but unless it gets that guarantee pretty much at the start of any ceasefire process, then it won't [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=247.32000000000002s)]
*  move forward on it. Sebastian, thank you for the moment. Stay with us because I just want to update [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=253.08s)]
*  our audience on what's happened in the Red Sea. The fate of around 15 crew members who were on [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=258.12s)]
*  board a cargo ship attacked off Yemen by Houthi militia is still unclear. The Liberian-flagged [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=264.6s)]
*  Greek-operated vessel called Eternity Sea sank on Wednesday, and a maritime security company rescued [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=272.0s)]
*  six crew members, four others were killed, and Houthis say some crew members are in their hands [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=278.56s)]
*  and getting medical assistance. So let's return to Sebastian Usher now. Sebastian, what more do we know about this? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=285.04s)]
*  Well, we know there were 25 crew on board the ship. We know that it was attacked first on Monday, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  then on Tuesday, and now hearing from the rescuers that it's gone down, and that 15, as you say, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=300.4s)]
*  of the crew are missing. We know that some of those crew, at least, but we haven't been given [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=306.64s)]
*  figures by the Houthis, have been taken by them essentially as hostages. We don't know if there [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=310.08s)]
*  are still some who are in the sea. What the rescues have said is that the six crew members that they [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=315.52s)]
*  were able to save had been in the sea for 24 hours, and that they were going to continue the search [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  in the Red Sea until the hours of daylight. This is the second such attack with the Houthis have [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  mounted against a ship in the Red Sea in the past few days. They did so on Sunday against another ship. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=332.32s)]
*  All of the crew members were rescued from that ship, but this is certainly a new development [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  from the Houthis. There haven't been such attacks on shipping really since the end of last year. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  We had today again, and we've just heard from the Houthis, that they fired a missile targeting, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  they say, the international airport here in Israel. It was intercepted by the Israeli defense, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=354.64s)]
*  as happens so often. But clearly, the Houthis are intensifying their attacks on Israeli targets. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=360.56s)]
*  At the moment, they still seem to be standing, as far as we know, with the agreement they made [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=368.8s)]
*  with the U.S. not to attack U.S. targets, but was made a couple of months ago. But if this kind of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=373.76s)]
*  activity continues, one would assume that the U.S. might again become involved in attacks that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=378.4s)]
*  recently have only been carried out by Israel on Houthi targets in Yemen. That happened just [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=383.92s)]
*  a couple of days ago. The port of Hadada was attacked by Israel. Every time we have an incident [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=388.88s)]
*  like this, Israel, the Israeli government says, but it will hit back harder than it's been hit [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=394.0s)]
*  by the Houthis. So I think we can expect probably another attack by Israel on Houthi targets in Yemen [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=399.92s)]
*  in the coming days. Sebastian, thank you for updating us on those developments and on Gaza [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=406.88s)]
*  ceasefire talks. That's our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Usher, live in Jerusalem for us. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5vwiSdez4&t=413.12s)]
