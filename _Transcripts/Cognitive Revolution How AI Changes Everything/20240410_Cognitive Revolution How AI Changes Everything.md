# Inside China's AI Ecosystem: A View From Beijing
**Cognitive Revolution How AI Changes Everything:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQSrMvwwi6c)
*  they're having to spread their bets fairly widely because there isn't a real standout front runner
*  in China for LLMs in the way that you might see just two or three really standout players in the
*  US. You don't see as much research happening in China on AI alignment. You don't see top labs here
*  committing to responsible scaling policies in the same way that Anthropic and OpenAI have.
*  There's a lot less thinking here about corporate governance mechanisms that might need to be in
*  place to mitigate the worst risk from AI. But maybe this is because you don't have in China
*  such a long history of labs that are explicitly focused on building AGI.
*  Hello and welcome to the cognitive revolution where we interview visionary researchers,
*  entrepreneurs and builders working on the frontier of artificial intelligence.
*  Each week we'll explore their revolutionary ideas and together we'll build a picture of
*  how AI technology will transform work, life and society in the coming years.
*  I'm Nathan Labenz joined by my co-host Eric Torenberg.
*  Hello and welcome back to the cognitive revolution.
*  Today I'm excited to share another episode in our experimental series providing wide angle coverage
*  of critical AI topics. This time we're providing a bird's eye view of the Chinese AI ecosystem.
*  My guest is a tech worker and AI watcher based in Beijing who goes by the pen name L squared.
*  She prefers to remain anonymous not because her takes are super spicy. On the contrary,
*  I think you'll find that they're very well grounded and not at all sensationalist.
*  But just out of an abundance of caution given her location and employment situation.
*  In this wide ranging conversation we cover the major AI players in China,
*  the quality of Chinese models and products and how they compare to US offerings,
*  the Chinese public's engagement with AI products, the state of AI regulation in China and the
*  Chinese government's general stance toward AI technology, the impact of the US chip man both
*  today and in the years ahead, the state of US China AI research collaborations, and much more
*  along the way as well. One of my key takeaways is that the US and Chinese AI ecosystems are in many
*  ways more similar than they are different. In both countries, the major tech giants are leading the
*  charge by writing the biggest checks to AI startups, providing critical infrastructure,
*  and increasingly competing with those same startups in the race to bring AI products to consumers
*  and businesses. Research in both countries is also being pushed forward by a mix of big tech,
*  top universities, and startups. In terms of differences, the most important one is simply
*  that there are no standout labs in China that are pushing the frontiers of possibility in the way
*  that open AI, DeepMind, and Anthropic are doing here in the United States. Beyond that, L Squared
*  shares fascinating details on the current state of China's AI regulations, which on paper are
*  quite onerous, requiring companies to jump through significant hoops to bring products to market,
*  but which so far seem to be enforced only very loosely. We also discussed the apparent lack of
*  jailbreaking culture that comes to the fore whenever a major new model or product is released
*  here in the West. I am very grateful to L Squared for taking the time to share her knowledge and
*  perspective on all of this, and I also want to thank Jordan Schneider of Chinatalk for making
*  this connection possible. For more of L Squared's writing on AI in China, you can refer to the Chinatalk
*  newsletter. We did have some minor recording issues due to VPN bandwidth limitations while
*  recording this episode, and so we are using an AI-enhanced version of the web recording.
*  I think it sounds very good overall, that's a testament to the power of modern AI systems,
*  but if you hear any weirdness along the way, that's why. As always, if you find value in this work,
*  please take a moment to share it with friends. Regular listeners will know that while my
*  politics are generally very libertarian, and I certainly would not want to live under the
*  Chinese government's restrictive speech codes, my bias is to look for ways to de-escalate US-China
*  tension. And I hope that content like this, which provides an up-to-date, on-the-ground perspective
*  on the state of Chinese AI technology, can serve as a counterweight to the worst fears that our
*  collective imaginations might conjure up. Finally, if you've got a unique perspective on another
*  important area in AI, even if that's just a contrasting perspective on the Chinese AI ecosystem,
*  I would love to work with you to make an episode about it. So please reach out via our website,
*  cognitiverevolution.ai, or by DMing me on your favorite social network.
*  Now, I hope you enjoy this insider's view on China's AI ecosystem with L Squared.
*  Thanks so much, Nathan. It's great to be here.
*  Yeah, I'm really excited for this conversation, a conversation from 12 time zones apart and across
*  global spheres of influence with a focus on what is going on with AI in China. This is something
*  that I've been trying to wrap my head around a little bit and just find it very difficult to get
*  a qualitative understanding of despite trying to read the blogs and whatever else is available to
*  me. So really excited to get your take. I basically just want to come at it from all angles. And that
*  includes your experience as a user of some of these products, watching society there more broadly,
*  your take on what the government is trying to do and what they're actually doing,
*  and a little bit of how you think the international competition is shaping up as you see it from
*  Beijing. How's that sound?
*  Sounds fantastic.
*  All right, let's do it. So I guess obviously a big disclaimer is I really don't know what I'm
*  talking about a lot more than I do, but this will still be obviously a limited perspective.
*  One of my favorite, I don't know if it's a joke or proverb about China is that man goes to China for
*  two weeks, thinks he knows a lot about China, stays for a year, realizes he knows nothing about
*  China. I'll put myself very firmly in the nothing category. But you want to just give us a little
*  bit of a context on your experience in China, like the kinds of work you've done there, how long
*  you've been there, that sort of thing? Yeah, sure. So as you may tell from my accent, I
*  did not grow up in China, but in London. I've now been working in Beijing for the past five years or
*  so in a mixture of Chinese tech companies and Western ones. And I am now focused more on the
*  infrastructure side, cloud computing, but I'm still following Chinese AI, Chinese language skills
*  that have allowed me to follow what is going on here. But I really like that you shared that
*  quote and I do find myself that there's still so much more I need to know. And yeah, really
*  recognize that I'm only sharing one limited perspective here today. Cool. If anyone's
*  listening and wants to offer a contrasting perspective, we could certainly welcome that
*  voice on the show as well. So definitely, if that is you, don't be afraid to reach out.
*  For now, let's start off with just an overview of the Chinese AI ecosystem, if you would. I think,
*  obviously in the US, people are familiar with your Open AIs, your Google DeepMinds, your Anthropics
*  as the sort of leaders and everybody else is paying attention, but those guys have really
*  driven the agenda. I'm very curious about how you would describe the situation
*  correspondingly in China. Like who are the live players, if that phrase makes sense?
*  Who are the big companies? Just give us kind of that very basic background overview.
*  Yeah, sure. So first off, the caveat, the AI is obviously a very broad set of technologies. And
*  I think for most of our discussion, we'll be focusing more on the large language model
*  providers. So within that space, I would break things down into two main groups. You've got the
*  big tech companies and the LLM startup. So on the big tech side, you've got companies like Alibaba,
*  which is a big e-commerce player, and Tencent, which developed the WeChat super app. Both of
*  these companies have their own large language models, but have also been investing in LLM
*  startup. And Alibaba in particular has been very active here. It's invested in at least five
*  different LLM startups. And it's important to note that they are also the cloud computing provider
*  in China with the biggest market share. And so we see with these investments that they are
*  likely getting the startups they're investing in to use their cloud resources. And they're having to
*  spread their bets fairly widely because there isn't a real standout front runner in China for
*  LLM in the way that you might see just two or three really players in the US, say.
*  As well as Alibaba and Tencent, you've got Baidu, who are the search giant in China.
*  They have their own Ernie chatbot, which is doing pretty well. We've seen that
*  at the top of the super clue benchmark, which is a prominent benchmark for Chinese language AI models.
*  And ByteDance, who people may know as the developer of TikTok and doing a Chinese equivalent. They
*  also have a bot product that seems to be doing pretty well. According to one source I saw recently,
*  that was at the top of the monthly active user leaderboard for Gen.AI apps in China earlier this
*  year. And then moving on to the LLM startups, you've got maybe two categories that you could
*  further break things down into. So one is startups that have emerged from Tsinghua University, which
*  is really China's top university for computer science. And there's a startup called Moonshot AI
*  and another one called Drupal AI that are both started by Tsinghua professors and have managed
*  to attract quite a lot of funding and attention. And they're fairly small in terms of employee size,
*  maybe a couple of hundred people, really able to produce pretty decent models. And then you also
*  have some startups that are started by more established entrepreneurs. So people may have
*  heard of the team that was started by Kaifu Li, who is a pretty prominent tech leader in China,
*  has experience at Google China and Microsoft Research Asia. And their set of models, the
*  e-models have been doing pretty well on open source leaderboards. And you also have a startup
*  called Baiquan, which was set up by the founder of a search company in China. And again, they've been
*  investing in both open source and closed source models.
*  So if I had to summarize or attempt to compare and contrast that to the US situation,
*  overall, it sounds more similar than different. I think you named four big tech companies that
*  presumably have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and can pretty freely write these investment
*  checks. And they are also the owner operators of the physical capital that all this stuff has to get
*  trained on and eventually run at inference time on. And it sounds like they are all wise to the
*  opportunity and very much engaged with it. And then at the startup layer, as you said,
*  maybe the big difference is that there isn't such a clear inner group of leaders, but there are,
*  sounds like a pretty healthy number of startups, including from top universities and just known
*  people. So is there anything else, anything I'm missing there? Or would you say overall,
*  aside from that kind of nobody's like the clear front runner caveat, would you say it is
*  essentially a similar business dynamic?
*  Yeah, I'd say there are similarities. I should note that I haven't given a comprehensive list
*  there. There's other big players you could mention like Huawei, who are especially important on the
*  infrastructure side, also have a big cloud business. And there are other startups as well. And
*  this has led to some people in the Chinese ecosystem commenting that there are too many
*  players in the foundation model space. And this is a waste, especially given that China is facing
*  quite severe constraints on the hardware side. I think it is very possible that you'll see
*  narrowing down of players in the coming months and years, more concentration happening over time.
*  Yeah, certainly. A lot of companies have gotten started here in the US as well. And I don't think
*  all of them will ultimately make it. So I think that definitely also sounds pretty familiar.
*  We'll circle back to the hardware question in a little bit. I want to definitely ask some questions
*  about how much the chip ban or just chip restrictions in general are already having an effect and how
*  that might change over time. But before that, how would you say the public is engaged with AI in
*  China? Here, I'm very much in a bubble, obviously. So it's all I talk about and all I think about and
*  everyone that I know is trying to maximize the performance of language models. Obviously, there
*  are still lots of people in the US that have not even used chat GPT even once or a lot of people
*  that used it once and didn't get hooked immediately. But it is definitely something that has
*  cracked the, even if not everybody's using it, it is something that has really cracked the public
*  consciousness. It's something that made the State of the Union this year and is all over the news.
*  And there's a White House executive order. How would you describe the
*  public awareness in China? Has there been the chat GPT moment, if you will, in China?
*  Yeah. Like you, I am in a bit of a bubble myself, but I do think there is broader public
*  consciousness about the rise of chat GPT and similar tools in China, discussions of AI on the
*  mainstream news. There's been discussion both of chat GPT and more recently Sora and the need for
*  Chinese equivalents to be developed. And I think people do feel that this is really important
*  technology, both at the government level, but also the wider public paying attention.
*  For people like, is it on TV? Is it the sort of thing that is, it's just on everybody's minds?
*  Would you say there is a culture of people using it at work throughout the economy? Is there a
*  leader? Is there a brand name like a chat GPT that people would most readily know or most readily go
*  to if they were going to seek out a language model solution? Yeah. In terms of whether it's on TV,
*  yes, definitely see segments on the news about this. Recently, China had its biggest political
*  meetings of the year. And around that time, you had political leaders going to visit places like
*  Baidu and the Beijing Academy of AI. And I see reports of those visits on the news.
*  And we've also seen AI generated cartoon series that was broadcast on Chinese TV. So the companies,
*  including state-owned enterprises, are looking to make use of AIGC services. And the other part of
*  your question was whether people are using these tools at work and if there's a go-to provider.
*  I wouldn't say that there is a clear go-to provider for businesses here. I think that,
*  as we discussed with the last question, it's still fairly open landscape here. And I think
*  there are a number of different companies that are selling to businesses, doing proofs of concepts,
*  and it's still a bit early to tell who those leading providers might be. You want a sense of
*  how widely AI assistant tools, how widely used they are. I mentioned that Spike Dancers chatbot
*  had been at the top of the monthly active user leaderboard earlier this year. I think that had
*  about 17 million MAU by comparison. There's estimates of chat GPT having about 27 million
*  in the US. So yeah, maybe there's not quite as much take up yet in China of these AI assistants,
*  but it's comparable. Yeah, that's interesting. Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment
*  after a word from our sponsors. AI might be the most important new computer technology ever.
*  It's storming every industry and literally billions of dollars are being invested. So buckle
*  up. The problem is that AI needs a lot of speed and processing power. So how do you compete without
*  costs spiraling out of control? It's time to upgrade to the next generation of the cloud,
*  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, or OCI. OCI is a single platform for your infrastructure, database,
*  application development, and AI needs. OCI has four to eight times the bandwidth of other clouds,
*  offers one consistent price instead of variable regional pricing. And of course, nobody does data
*  better than Oracle. So now you can train your AI models at twice the speed and less than half the
*  cost of other clouds. If you want to do more and spend less like Uber, eight by eight and
*  Databricks Mosaic, take a free test drive of OCI at oracle.com slash cognitive. That's oracle.com
*  slash cognitive. Oracle.com slash cognitive. Omniki uses generative AI to enable you to launch
*  hundreds of thousands of ad iterations that actually work customized across all platforms
*  with a click of a button. I believe in Omniki so much that I invested in it and I recommend you use
*  it too. Use Cogrev to get a 10% discount. Obviously the population size of China compared to the US is
*  something like 4X. And I wonder what you would consider to be the addressable market multiple.
*  I don't have a great command of Chinese demographics, but I would, if you segmented it to like,
*  how many people are, is it like a tier one city? Would that be the sort of way to think about it?
*  Or tier one and tier two? There's, I know that, again, I'm showing my ignorance of China here,
*  but I know that there are these sort of systems where not everybody can move to Shanghai, right?
*  So there's different classes of sort of economic privilege within the country. If you were to say,
*  what is the sort of universe of people who are like living broadly a sort of first world life
*  style or first world work style that would be in a position to use the language model? Is that like
*  half of China? Good question. Yeah, I think maybe around 40% of the population
*  would be kind of China's middle class, 40-50% might say. So 600 million.
*  Gotcha. Okay. So I guess the takeaway there is it's pretty early in the adoption curve,
*  still in both countries. 27 million in the US is still under 20% of the working,
*  the workforce in the United States. Obviously, not everybody's in a job that would benefit from
*  a language model. So maybe that's like getting up toward 40% perhaps of people that like could
*  conceivably use it, which I guess is not, it's not nothing, especially given how little time it's
*  been in the market. It sounds like maybe there's a two, maybe a three X kind of multiple in terms of
*  per capita, how many people are using something like this in the US versus China, but not like a
*  totally night and day sort of difference. How about the tools themselves and just the quality
*  in preparing for this, you were kind enough to take me on a little journey into the world of
*  Baidu's Ernie. You can maybe give us the Chinese name for that, but I know it as Ernie 4.0.
*  And this was a couple months ago already. So we were looking at leaderboards and trying to get a
*  sense for how good is this thing? And is it close to GPT-4? They, I believe, Baidu themselves put
*  out a benchmark called Super Clue, which is meant to be a more Chinese language focused benchmark,
*  but still they compare themselves to GPT-4 on that benchmark and find that GPT-4 is still tops in the,
*  even in the Chinese first benchmark that they are measuring themselves by. But at the time,
*  Ernie 4.0 was the best of the Chinese products on that benchmark. And I guess I would, we didn't do
*  a ton of testing so you can expand on this, but in the little bit of testing that we did,
*  I probably was pretty impressed and came away feeling like this is a pretty comparable to
*  chat GPT sort of product. We ran a test prompt on a coding exercise and the quality of the Python
*  that came back from chat GPT was definitely not head and shoulders above what we got from Ernie 4.0.
*  Again, it's a little hard for me to evaluate because I don't speak Chinese and the code is
*  code, but the comments are in Chinese and all of these little nuances to it. But I guess my first
*  order summary based on that experience was they seem more similar than different.
*  What more can you tell us about the experience of being a retail user of the Chinese products?
*  Yeah, I think that's a pretty good assessment. I would just clarify quickly that the Super Clue
*  leaderboard is not something that is developed and managed by Baidu itself. It's a third party that
*  is doing that leaderboard and updating the results every couple of months. But you're right that
*  Ernie Baidu's product is at the top of that leaderboard in terms of the Chinese models.
*  And yeah, my own experience playing around with some of these models is that they are pretty good,
*  pretty useful. I think especially for Chinese language tasks, the gap with GPT 4.0 is not huge.
*  I'd say there's some differences in usability among the Chinese apps that I've been trying.
*  Some of them are overly sensitive in terms of not responding to questions that I think seem
*  quite harmless, not political at all, but maybe I've accidentally triggered some keyword filter
*  that they have in place and then I just don't get the answer that I'm needing. That is one limitation
*  that you get when using these tools in a censored environment. Also, some of the tools don't have
*  context windows that are that long. I think there is a bit of a usability gap in that sense as well.
*  How about availability? Is there ever, and this is one way to get perhaps at the
*  trip question, is there contention for resources? If you log in, do you ever have it say,
*  oh, hey, it's overloaded right now, you can't use it or you come back later?
*  ChatGPT has the occasional outage, but broadly speaking, it's available and it doesn't seem that
*  they are, as much as they may say they're constrained on chips for training GPT 5,
*  it seems like there's plenty of ChatGPT to go around as my first order approximation.
*  Does it feel the same way in China? If you subscribe, do you just have consistent access
*  or is there anything that seems like it would be an echo of the chip restrictions?
*  Yeah, I haven't faced availability issues when I've been trying to use these tools.
*  Do you know anything about tokens? That was also a curveball question that I didn't prepare you for,
*  but in the language models, I'm most familiar with a typical vocabulary size would be like
*  50,000 tokens and they're all English words and word parts and so on and so forth. Some very
*  strange ones as you get into the very deep long tail, but I think Chinese characters are basically
*  all multi-token in an English first vocabulary context. Do you know if any of the Chinese
*  providers are doing their own tokenization, like creating their own vocabulary and perhaps like
*  predicting Chinese characters in a more token efficient way as a result?
*  I'm afraid it's not something I'm familiar with.
*  I'll have to check on that one myself. That may be something I can answer.
*  So I'll put a bookmark on that one.
*  I also just checked the leaderboard, LNsys.org, which is my, as regular listeners will know,
*  my go-to for comparing new language models. I do find that to be broadly very trustworthy.
*  Cloud3 has jumped right to the top right up alongside the latest GPT-4 turbos.
*  Right now, the number one Chinese model on that leaderboard is Quen 1.572b,
*  which I believe comes out of Alibaba. Is that something that you would go to an Alibaba chatbot
*  to access? The license said there that it was like a special license, so it seemed like it was not
*  open source or maybe it is open source, but under a custom license, which I know these companies
*  sometimes do, did that model make waves when it dropped? How would you access that if you wanted
*  to go use that model? Yeah, so it is marketed as open source, but I haven't looked at the details
*  of the license agreement, so it's very possible that there's some constraints around it that mean
*  it's not really that open source. In terms of how the average user in China would access that,
*  Alibaba has its own chatbot product called Tongyi Qianwen, and this is probably similar to
*  Quen, but it's, I guess, more advanced closed source version. So you wouldn't really, as a
*  typical user, go and use that Quen version that we're seeing on that leaderboard. I guess that's
*  more for the developer community who could access it through platforms like Hugging Face,
*  but yeah, for the Chinese users on the consumer side, they would be accessing this slightly
*  different model, which I guess has more moderation mechanisms in place to make sure it's compliant
*  with Chinese AI regulations. What does the price look like on these subscriptions? I think when we
*  looked at the Ernie product, it was like equivalent of $8 a month. It seems like in the US,
*  it's like everything is $20 a month at the retail level. That's true for ChatGPT Pro, it's true for
*  Claude Pro, Replet Ghostwriter is there now, U.com is there now. I think Perplexity is at the same
*  price point. It seems like everything is right at that $20 a month. Has there been a similar
*  convergence on a single or very common price point in the Chinese market? If so, what is it?
*  I guess it would be the $8 if that's what it is, but has there been that convergence?
*  Yeah, I'm not sure. I haven't done a comprehensive check of the price point of these different
*  models. My impression is that a lot of them are still offering services to consumers for free,
*  probably still at that stage of wanting to grow their user base. Baidu is the main one that I know
*  of that is around that $7, $8 mark and has been commercializing for several months now. I think
*  it might be a little while before other services are charging consumers at that level.
*  Some people in the investor community here are saying that really the enterprise-facing
*  JNI apps are where the money is going to be made and it's going to be pretty hard to
*  commercialize these consumer-facing apps. Interesting. Yeah, I think certainly there's
*  going to be a lot of enterprise revenue in the US as well. I do think a lot of people ultimately
*  are going to get these tools from their employers. In the US, maybe people are a
*  little more willing to subscribe to some newfangled thing, but in the end, I do think most people
*  probably get it from their job just like they get Google Productivity Suite or Microsoft
*  Productivity Suite from their job. This seems like probably something that ultimately is part
*  of a package of tools that you get. That seems maybe like we're headed for similar places,
*  even if it's a little bit of different route to get there. The Q1.572B, I should emphasize too,
*  is according to the LM Sys leaderboard, really neck and neck with the original
*  GPT-4 generation. So right now you've got GPT-4 Turbo and Claw 3 as the clear top, and then you
*  drop down to that next tier and it's GPT-4 and Q1 is right there. I think it's in the top 10. It's
*  just slightly before the earlier generations of GPT-4. So that really is quite good. It's also
*  remarkable that's open source. If it is open source, it might be the global leader in open source.
*  It's also remarkable that it is, I would assume, predominantly being tested in English on the LM
*  Sys arena because that is an open place where people can just come and run whatever prompts
*  they want. They on the back end will put two different models head to head. You see the output
*  from each and it's your decision to choose which one you like better and that's how they determine
*  their rankings. I can't imagine there are too many people in China that are bothering to come to the
*  LM Sys leaderboard, although it's a big world and full of surprises. But I'm assuming that this
*  rating reflects largely English usage, which is suggestive of the possibility that in Chinese
*  it might even be a bit better. It would seem plausible that new one, again, this is the Q1.572B,
*  that it might be a better experience for Chinese users than the earlier GPT-4s. So it does seem
*  the frontier in each country is not that different from one another.
*  Anything else to add there? But yeah, it's an interesting bottom line that people talk about
*  the US being years ahead. That's a common notion and we're going to keep our lead with the chip
*  ban or whatever. And I'm like, from what I saw of Ernie 4.0 and from what I'm seeing on the LM Sys
*  leaderboard, there is not a years ahead difference. Now one caveat too is they might be
*  training on OpenAI outputs, which is definitely a fast path to refining your behavior. That's been a
*  very common practice all over the world. And I don't know, I know there's been like a little
*  bit of noises to that might be happening among some Chinese providers. I think one even maybe
*  acknowledged it to a certain degree. Have you heard any kind of noise or what would be your sense of
*  to what degree Chinese companies might be drafting on OpenAI's work, so to speak?
*  Yeah, you may be referring to a story about how ByteDance's OpenAI account was blocked because
*  it was found that they were using OpenAI outputs for training their own models, which is against
*  the terms of the usage agreement. I'm not sure how widespread this practice is more broadly among
*  Chinese developers, but there is a lot of use of the Lama architecture. And recently there's been
*  a presentation that the Beijing Academy of AI delivered to the Chinese premiere.
*  And this presentation that's been circulated has set out three main challenges for Chinese AI. And
*  one of those is reliance on foreign open source architecture. And so I think people
*  here in China see that as a vulnerability. If we're to see US government attempts to
*  impose export controls on open source technology. They're going to have a hard time taking Lama
*  back or preventing Chinese researchers or companies or whatever from accessing it if this
*  stuff continues to be open source. So I'm not sure I quite get the fear there. I guess the fear
*  would be maybe it gets cut off, right? But aside from that, it seems hard to... That's one of the
*  big... I don't go in for this argument personally, but among the folks that want to see open source
*  models curtailed, one of the arguments is that China is going to be... They'll use them. And so
*  if we want to create this separation in terms of capabilities, then open sourcing negates that.
*  Am I missing something there in terms of why Chinese companies would feel like that's a risk?
*  Yeah, I suppose, right, the cat's been let out the bag and you can't really stop Chinese companies
*  from using Lama now. But I think the fear is more about if we look to the future and we see
*  other important innovations coming out of the open source community in Western countries, if you have
*  controls on that community and their ability to provide open source models to people in China,
*  then that can be something that limits China's ability to stay following the cutting edge.
*  Yeah, if we actually shut down open source, I could see that contributing to a widening gap.
*  At the moment, it seems like that's not close to happening. And until it does, it seems like the...
*  And maybe beyond that, I'm not saying... I don't have an opinion on whether Chinese companies would
*  in fact fall behind if the open source were to be cut off. I honestly don't think so, but it's
*  interesting that you have somebody in that... Somebody who knows more than I do certainly seems
*  to be concerned about it. So it's an interesting data point. Hey, we'll continue our interview in

*  So you mentioned presenting this stuff to political leaders. I have been fascinated by,
*  first of all, just the fact that these models are getting open sourced. If I were to guess
*  which country would be first to clamp down on the open sourcing of language models, it would seem
*  that China would be the first to be concerned about that just because
*  once they're out in the open, we've covered this in other episodes, but they are not going to follow
*  censorship rules once they're out in the open source world. Even if they have been trained to
*  refuse to talk about certain things, any amount of fine tuning is typically enough to remove that.
*  We've got an episode with Adam Gleave from Far AI that talks about inadvertent jailbreaking,
*  where fine tuning a language model even without the intent to jailbreak it, but just to do whatever
*  you're going to do often removes these refusal behaviors and essentially resets the censorship
*  layer on the model. Are you surprised that there are so many open source models coming out of
*  Chinese companies with that in mind? Maybe that's just something that the government hasn't
*  quite figured out yet? Maybe I shouldn't be surprised. I'm just very confused as to
*  if you'd asked me to guess, I would have guessed that there would not be a lot of open source
*  models coming out of Chinese companies, but in fact, it seems like there's a lot. Maybe my
*  assumptions are flawed or maybe the government hasn't caught up. How do you account for that?
*  I think this reflects a difficult balance that the Chinese government is trying to strike,
*  like many governments worldwide, between really harnessing the benefits from AI and
*  leveraging it to improve economic productivity while also managing risks that it presents.
*  I think that it does see open source as important for helping to advance AI development,
*  help China to catch up with the US in terms of its AI landscape. It's not cracking down on open
*  source, but meanwhile, it is bringing forward AI regulations that it hopes can mitigate the
*  worst risks from AI, which I think in its view are really these risks of destabilizing the country
*  politically. It's got pretty tight controls that service providers need to comply with in terms of
*  making sure that outputs from these models are going to be in line with the CCP's narratives and
*  not saying things that are politically unacceptable. This kind of risk is very much on its radar and
*  something that it's trying to control by making sure that any models that have large user bases,
*  that are going straight to the Chinese public, are having to follow these quite onerous regulations.
*  But it's just the trade-off that the government is having to grapple with.
*  Okay, you mentioned there the onerous regulations. This is something that, again, I feel very confused
*  about. I've heard a series of different reports where I feel like last summer there was a draft
*  regulation that basically said you're going to have to prove that your training data is all
*  up to standards, which of course people were like, we're talking about trillions of tokens here.
*  It's going to be really hard to go through and verify that is actually true. How are we going
*  to do that? Obviously, one way, interestingly, would be to use language models to do the filtering,
*  but you don't have the language models. You don't have to compute to process the tokens. It does
*  become a pretty significant burden. Then later there was an update, as I understand it, and it
*  seemed for a minute that had been relaxed. But then I read one of your posts on the China Talk
*  blog and it seems like your take is that, no, in fact, it really wasn't all that relaxed. So,
*  it helped me again, just get unconfused. What are the regulations that folks have to go from? Do
*  they actually have to prove the ideological purity of their training data at this point,
*  or what are the biggest hoops that folks have to jump through?
*  Yeah, it's a good question because there has been some changing around in terms of what these
*  regulations are actually saying. So, the main upshot is that LLM providers or GEN.AI service
*  providers would need to do a registration process, which will involve a series of safety-related
*  tests on training data and on model outputs. And only once they have shown to regulators that they
*  meet certain thresholds of acceptability, can they get the approval that they need to deploy their
*  models. In terms of the training data, it's not the case that they would need to go through and
*  sample every single piece of data. There would be requirements around sampling a certain subset of
*  their training data and not using batches that are failing these safety tests. But yeah, it's still
*  quite onerous, I'd say. What is noting is that you do have a distinction between what these rules say
*  on paper and what is actually being enforced. One example that relates to training data is that
*  recently we've seen a security standard come out for generative AI, which is really putting a lot
*  of detail on how companies should actually be complying with these GEN.AI regs that came out
*  last year. And in this security standard, it says that providers should not be using training data
*  from sites or sources that are blocked according to the laws and policies of China. Anything that
*  is blocked by the firewall in theory should not be used for training data. Currently, hugging faces
*  blocked in China, so is Wikipedia. If this were really enforced, then that's quite common sources
*  of training data that these Chinese companies are just not meant to use. I think it's quite unlikely
*  that this is going to be something that the government checks up on. I think it's more likely
*  that developers will be continuing to use these sources, but just not telling the government that.
*  And I think the government will probably turn a blind eye because it doesn't want Chinese GEN.AI
*  services to be falling too far behind. Another thing I would note is that so far you've only seen
*  about 40 apps and services that have been approved under these GEN.AI regulations. And I think that
*  there are probably many more GEN.AI apps that are actually in use that are being served to customers
*  and businesses. And this suggests to me that there are a lot of companies out there that are taking a
*  look at these regulations and the kinds of hoops that need to be jumped through to get approval.
*  And they're just deciding that it's too much effort. They don't have the bandwidth to go through
*  this process, which can often involve a lot of back and forth with the government. And you also
*  see some companies saying that their tools are just open for internal testing. You have to apply
*  for access, get on the whitelist before you can use them. And I think that's a kind of risk
*  mitigation measure, where if the government comes to them and says, you haven't registered, what are
*  you doing? They can say, oh, we're only opening this to a limited number of users. And that would
*  maybe help to reassure the authorities. But in practice, they're approving anyone who applies
*  for access. And it's really not that much different in practice from full deployment.
*  I think that in summary, you do have pretty demanding rules for GEN.AI services in China.
*  And this can be a barrier for companies that are looking to quickly grow their user base.
*  But there's also a gap between the law and what is being enforced on the ground. And so
*  there is still some space for companies that are starting up in this area.
*  Yeah, that's, again, just very confusing. And the idea that the certainly familiar reality that the
*  law says one thing, but you can get away with something else in many cases. I would say that's
*  true here in the United States, even just as I roll through a stop sign in my neighborhood from
*  time to time. But here it is pretty striking. I went to this one, Yee Chatbot,
*  that was I think it's now, I think it's still the second rated one on the LMSIS leaderboard.
*  This is Yee34B. And this is from the company that was started by the guy you mentioned earlier,
*  Kai-Fu Lee. Interesting background, just reading into his story a little bit. I understand he's
*  Taiwanese, but the company's headquartered in Beijing, which is interesting right off the bat.
*  The model that they put out, they said was trained on three trillion tokens, notably that's
*  a trillion more than Lama2. They're definitely going beyond Lama2 with that. But when I went to
*  it in the LMSIS arena and just chatted with it, I of course asked it about Tandem and Square.
*  And it just gave me the answer that I would expect. It was like that I would expect from
*  Western Chatbot to give you a taste of it. On June 3, 1989, the government decided to take
*  decisive action to end the protests. The military was deployed into Beijing and on the night of June
*  3 and into the morning of June 4, soldiers and tanks entered Tandem and Square, forcibly clearing
*  the area. The exact number of casualties is unknown, but estimates range from several hundred
*  to several thousand people killed. It goes on, but obviously that's pretty sensitive content in the
*  Chinese context. Would you explain that by basically just saying that, hey, the rules are
*  one thing, they're getting data where they can get it, and they're just training without doing those
*  sorts of filters? And that's the natural result if you just train on the open internet. Is that
*  your theory of that case? My theory would be that for this stage where Chinese developers are putting
*  open source models out on platforms like Hugging Face, they are not doing as much to ensure that
*  they are in line with Chinese standards and rules. So maybe not putting the same keyword filters on
*  that they would put on there if they are serving Chinese customer base. And so recently, you've
*  seen that company put out an API that Chinese companies can use to access the E34B model and
*  other models that they put out. And I would bet that with that API, there are more measures in place
*  to make sure that you wouldn't be able to get that kind of answer on Tandem and Square. So I think
*  there it's just a case of Hugging Face not actually being publicly accessible in China.
*  There's not that need for a company to comply with those same strict content restrictions
*  that they would when they're more clearly serving the Chinese market.
*  Yeah, interesting. Okay. There was a good post on China Talk about this recently as well. And
*  basically, what they did in this post was a rundown of a handful of top models and just asked
*  it a bunch of asked each one number of sensitive questions and try to systematically get a handle
*  on how the different Chinese language models behave. To summarize that, it was notable,
*  first of all, that there is quite a range of behavior. I think the one that was the same one
*  that gave me the Tandem and Square output was the most Western in its orientation,
*  in just the nature of its answers. But there were definitely others that showed a much more
*  what you'd expect from a Chinese product. They also reported that there is a difference,
*  to your point, between what you're on Hugging Face if you're just looking at the bare
*  model and what you would experience in the productized context as it exists on the Chinese
*  sites. The explanation for that seems to be that there is an expectation for app developers that
*  they're going to do some filtering alongside the core generation. And this is something that
*  we've seen leaders in the US do this to a degree, like the original Bing had a feature, people may
*  remember, where it would generate an answer. And then at some point, if it detected that it had
*  gone off the rails, it would retract that answer and you would actually see your answer disappear
*  from Bing and it would be replaced with a sort of, sorry, I can't talk about this right now thing.
*  So that seems to be honestly pretty rare in the US or in the West, let's say. Most apps I go to
*  do not do that. And even the chat GPTs, the Google, Gemini, they pretty much just
*  generate whatever they're going to generate and give it to you. They don't really seem to
*  do much in the way of filtering. It seems like that's actually quite expected in the Chinese
*  context. And they see the difference between what you experience on a Hugging Face versus
*  again, the Chinese retail apps. They also reported that the performance did not seem to
*  obviously correlate with the behavior in the sense that my takeaway from this was RLCC-PF
*  can work, meaning reinforcement learning from Chinese Communist Party feedback.
*  It did not seem that the models that conformed more to the expected standards behaved worse.
*  In the reporting on the China Talk report, it was basically that the performance didn't seem to be
*  affected by those control measures. So I thought that was quite interesting. And of course,
*  these are language models. So there's still plenty of weirdness. It was only a
*  certain sample size and you get models that sometimes answer one way and sometimes answer
*  the other way. So there's definitely plenty of weird stuff still to figure out. It also would
*  vary if they were prompted in English versus Chinese. So definitely a lot of weird stuff
*  to be explored. I do recommend that post on the China Talk blog if you want to get a rundown of
*  the leaders and some of their behavior on a small but structured task. I'm sure you read that. Did
*  you have any other thoughts or takeaways from that post on China Talk? Yeah. One thing to add,
*  you mentioned that E was the model that seemed the most Western in its answers. It's important
*  to note that when that test was done, they didn't have a consumer-facing platform in China. The only
*  version that was tested was that hugging face version. And as I was saying, I think you would
*  see something different once you test the China-facing interface. I think that you were
*  summarizing there how you didn't see a huge performance hit from this kind of censorship.
*  I think that times roughly with the take I gave earlier about how I'm still seeing value from
*  these tools, even if sometimes they do set off a sensitive keyword trigger and you can't quite get
*  the answer that you wanted. But yeah, I think there is ultimately this tension between trying
*  to be useful and not touching the red lines that the government has put in place. And I mentioned
*  earlier that recently we've seen a slide from the Beijing Academy of AI circulate, which summarizes
*  its view of the main challenges for AI in China. One of those I said was the fact that the underlying
*  architecture of many of these models is not Chinese. Another one they mentioned was the
*  lack of controllability of AI models. And so I think this is something that the Chinese
*  developers are still struggling with. And this can be pretty high-stake. I've seen Chinese government
*  take quite severe measures against entrepreneurs and tech companies in recent years, though I think
*  there is always that risk that you have some high-profile story come out of how a Chinese
*  chatbot said something that was rude about a Chinese political leader or in some other way
*  unacceptable. And that could be quite damaging from a PR perspective or even lead to temporary
*  or more permanent shutdowns by the government. I think that kind of risk that developers face is
*  much higher compared to in the US. Yeah. Is there a difference between when you said earlier that
*  there were like 40 providers? Is that a foundation model provider or would that be like an app? So
*  for example, I'm involved with this company Waymark, which I started, blah, blah, blah. People
*  have heard me talk about it. We, of course, are an app on top of the foundation models. We are
*  fine-tuning them, but we're not developing the core technology. We're productizing it. Would we be
*  subject to those same sorts of pre-approval requirements there? Or is there also an app
*  layer that once a language model foundation model provider is approved, then other people can use
*  their stuff via API in random consumer apps? It's not clear to me if there's a two-tier system or
*  if everybody has to jump through all those hoops. So the app developers are also meant to jump
*  through those hoops. I'm not quite sure how much detail they are expected to go into. It's possible
*  that if they are building on a foundation model that has already been approved, that it might
*  simplify the process a little bit. But technically, they are still meant to go through
*  safety assessment and registration. But as I say, it's likely that because there are so many apps
*  and only 40 registrations so far, there's probably a lot of companies that are not actually choosing
*  to go through that process even though they should. And so how do they distribute their products? I
*  guess again, I'm showing my ignorance of the Chinese system, but you could just put up a
*  website and people can come visit your product and not every website has to get checked.
*  And then on a mobile app, here, if you're going to publish a mobile app, you got to go through
*  Apple review or the Android store. And in each case, there's some, in theory, some sort of a check
*  there. So I imagine there must be a comparable thing if you're going to actually have a native
*  smartphone app. So would these folks that are the sort of dark matter of AI apps, are they likely
*  just to be found on random websites that just nobody's really looking at?
*  Yeah, I think that they would still be reaching customers through Chinese app stores, through
*  their own websites. And although these app stores should probably be checking for this approval,
*  maybe if those kinds of checks are not really being conducted. But yeah, it's possible that
*  that might be something that is cracked down on later on. The government decides to do a cleanup
*  of the apps, but maybe one factor is that this process for approving apps is still pretty new.
*  We've seen reports of taking several weeks, months even, for the app developers and regulators to
*  exchange information to make sure that the regulators are happy. And so there's probably
*  a big backlog of applications. And yeah, maybe the government recognizes that right now it's
*  not super realistic, these apps to be registering first. And so they're not
*  being that heavy handed with the enforcement. Is there a culture, one fun ritual we have here
*  in the United States and I guess in the West more broadly is, although it feels like a very sort of
*  Bay Area phenomenon in some ways, is the ritual jailbreaking of new systems when they come out.
*  And we had this on the original chat GPT launch day, people were finding all sorts of loopholes,
*  reminded of pretending is all you need. When it was like, oh, write me a bedtime story about
*  hot wiring your car or whatever. And more recently, we've had the Gemini making black
*  George Washington's and stuff like this. And everybody gets a good laugh out of it, right?
*  I don't think it actually matters nearly as much as the commentary it broadly does aside from as an
*  indication of the fact that the companies don't have a working way to control their systems.
*  I don't, I think that's not to be glossed over, but I actually don't think it ends up
*  mattering all that much for their business prospects. But is there anything like that
*  in the Chinese context? Are people like going and trying to get likes by showing what they
*  manage to get Ernie 4.0 to do or anything like that? Yeah, I haven't seen this. It does seem to be
*  quite different from the Western ecosystem in that sense. One possible reason is just that there's
*  more caution here from Chinese citizens about what can and can't be said online. And you wouldn't
*  want to go and share screenshots of your attempt to make a chatbot say something that's politically
*  unacceptable. And yeah, maybe there's also some awareness that these Chinese models aren't quite
*  that level of a GPT-4 or a Claude III and it's obvious that they're going to make mistakes. And
*  maybe people just don't see as much surprise factor in getting these models to do something
*  that they shouldn't. That's interesting. How permeable is the firewall in general? If I
*  am in China and I want to use chat GPT, pretty much all the Western services are blocked in China,
*  but is it easy to get around that or is that now actually pretty difficult?
*  Lots of people do have a VPN that will allow them to access foreign websites and services.
*  I think maybe the main challenge with accessing
*  is like chat GPT might be the need for a foreign SIM card, but I think there are
*  ways around that. I think you can buy the use of a foreign number on e-commerce sites in China,
*  like Taobao. So yeah, there are friends that I know who are using chat GPT.
*  And yeah, I think that for enterprises in China, there may be ways to access foreign LLM services.
*  If you are a customer of Microsoft Azure, then I believe that they give access to their OpenAI
*  suite of product to users anywhere in the world, including China.
*  Interesting. That phone number bit, is that just to verify your account?
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's interesting. I tried to sign up. It was mostly a total fail, but I tried
*  to sign up for a few Chinese products from here in the US. I was able to access the websites.
*  I was able to understand what was going on with the help of
*  Chrome's native translation features. That didn't always clarify what was going on,
*  but it was enough to allow me to try to proceed through a signup process. But then I got totally
*  blocked on the need for a Chinese phone number to receive an SMS to be able to confirm. And so I
*  just couldn't go any further. Would I be able to do something similar in the reverse? Could I buy a
*  Chinese SIM card or have some sort of Chinese phone service receive a text message for me so
*  I could go try some of these things in more depth? Yeah, good question. I would imagine that it is
*  possible somehow, but I need to investigate that myself. Not sure. Yeah. Okay. Well,
*  put that on my to-do list. Okay. So I guess if I had to summarize everything so far,
*  I would say it's more similar than it is different. The big tech companies are the
*  infrastructure owners. They are the check writers. They are the brands that do a lot of the retail
*  and enterprise distribution of these products. They also do R&D. They partner with startups that
*  are also trying to get to the cutting edge of capability. And people are definitely well aware
*  of what's going on and more and more people are using them. But it also at the same time has not
*  gotten to every last user or reaching anything approaching saturation. Capabilities are broadly
*  similar in terms of what's available to an end user, even if perhaps the Chinese ecosystem is
*  somewhat dependent on open-sourced R&D from the West to get there as fast as they have.
*  Point remains that they pretty much have, it seems. And a Chinese user is not super far behind
*  a GPT-4 in terms of the quality of support that they can get from a language model.
*  There is this approval process that is onerous if followed to the letter,
*  but it sounds like it's not usually or often not followed to the letter. And if anything,
*  maybe the biggest difference was the lack of the jailbreaking ritual and the shitposting online.
*  Aside from that, it seems you can call it maybe a bit of a warped mirror, but it seems like the
*  two ecosystems are closer to mirror images of each other than they are to very different realities.
*  Would you agree with that summary and would you complicate it at all?
*  Yeah, I think that's a really good summary. What might complicate things is the impact of the
*  export controls going forward. So far, I'd say that we haven't seen it at a huge amount in terms
*  of the fact that we do have pretty capable models still in China. And that's down, I'd say, to a
*  couple of saving races for Chinese AI, which is one that many Chinese companies did stockpile
*  a whole bunch of chips before the export controls took effect. So you've got
*  cloud computing providers here in China that are still able to provide access to
*  good Nvidia chips. And second, Chinese companies are currently able to use cloud computing services
*  overseas so they can train models using top chips that would be unable to be imported now into China.
*  Going forward, those stockpiles are going to run out at some point. And meanwhile, the cutting edge
*  of development is still moving ahead outside of China. And so you would expect the full effect of
*  the export controls to become more visible after two, three years. And people who say now, oh,
*  the chip bands clearly haven't worked, your Chinese AI is still good, they need to be a
*  bit more patient. And then on the cloud computing side, you also do see the US government noticing
*  that kind of loophole and thinking about how to cut off access for Chinese companies to the use of
*  cloud services in the US. And so there was a draft rule put out by the US government that's
*  currently out for comment that would require cloud providers in the US to keep a record of when
*  foreign customers are using their services for large training runs. And there's a provision
*  in those rules that could allow use of these US cloud providers to be restricted for people from
*  certain countries, which would probably mean China. Yeah, I think there is that real risk
*  for Chinese developers that access to compute is going to get even trickier. And so that would be
*  one thing to keep an eye on that could cause that gap between Chinese and Western AI ecosystems to
*  grow further in the future. Yeah, that's interesting. We're just recording on
*  Monday, March 18, my time, I guess it's Tuesday morning, March 19 for you. The Blackwell
*  architecture was just announced by Nvidia today with quotes from, I think, the CEO of every major
*  big tech and AI company. I haven't observed the details of that yet, but it does seem to be another
*  meaningful advance in terms of the just raw volume of compute that it packs and also the
*  energy and overall cost effectiveness is supposed to be an order of magnitude improvement as well.
*  So I have been among those that maybe haven't been patient enough in terms of my interpretation
*  of the impact of the chip ban, which is not to say that I'm wanting this to happen. I'm not sold
*  on the idea that anyone is really going to win by slowing down the Chinese ecosystem, but I have been
*  probably in terms of just declaring, not declaring, but analyzing whether it has
*  worked or not. I've probably been not patient enough. Certainly you see, oh, here's a next
*  generation architecture and maybe none of that or very little can be imported into China than that
*  would seem to have a potentially quite large impact in the coming years. What is China going to do
*  about that? Obviously, there are very impressive companies in China. We mentioned Huawei earlier.
*  What does the attitude seem to be there? Is it like, I've seen a time lapse of a hospital going
*  up in six days in China in a pinch during the beginning of the pandemic. Do you think that same
*  can-do attitude prevails or is there a sense that this is really not a technology deficit that
*  can be overcome domestically? Yeah, I think there's probably mixed views on this in China.
*  Definitely, you see the rhetoric around China needing to indigenize its semi-ecosystem and
*  supply chains and the government is willing to throw a lot of resources at that effort. I think
*  Huawei is really the main hope for Chinese chips. It worked with SMIC Fab in China to produce a chip
*  that really surprised a lot of observers last year at a smartphone chip. They are looking to
*  expand GPU production this year. There are a lot of hopes resting on them, but also challenges in
*  terms of increasing yields. It's really not an easy task to catch up to the leading edge in
*  this super complicated industry. In summary, people are working on it, trying very hard,
*  but you can't just will success to happen in this area. It's a very tricky task.
*  Yeah, interesting. One bright spot, I wonder if you have a read on this, a relative bright spot
*  in US-China relationship has been Microsoft. As you mentioned, you can be a Microsoft customer
*  in China, which I don't think you can really be a customer of Google in the same way. Maybe you
*  could get Google Cloud. I don't know if you could get Google Cloud or AWS in the same way you could
*  get Azure. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like Microsoft certainly has an unusually good
*  working relationship with China and that even in the research where there are a number of great
*  papers that have been US-China collaborations mediated through Microsoft. Often it's like
*  Microsoft research and sing walk. Do you have any sense for like how Microsoft has managed to
*  keep such warm relationship amidst general increasing tensions?
*  Yeah, good question. You mentioned other companies there. AWS does have the presence in China. It has
*  a couple of data center regions. So Microsoft's not the only company with a presence,
*  but it's quite unique in terms of having such a significant research presence because a lot of
*  the other American tech companies that do have a foothold in the China market would still be doing
*  their R&D outside of China. So what makes Microsoft different? I think for a long time, there's just
*  been this recognition from Microsoft leadership that there's a lot of great research talent in
*  China that they want to tap into. I think going back a number of years now, they've been
*  investing in developing that talent community and many top leaders in Chinese AI have been trained
*  up at Microsoft Research Asia. There's some interesting pieces that Jeff Ding and his China
*  AI newsletter have translated on the history of Microsoft Research Asia that I could refer
*  listeners to. But I would say that it is getting increasingly hard to be a company that's trying to
*  maintain good relations with both the Chinese and the US governments. I think you've already
*  seen Microsoft get questioned from US politicians about its research presence in China. There were
*  some rumors last year that it might be thinking about moving some of its research scientists to
*  Canada from Beijing. So there's still a bit of a question mark about how long Microsoft can
*  maintain this position of tapping into research talent in China. I wish them luck in maintaining
*  their positive relations and I definitely have learned a couple notable tidbits here, including
*  that AWS has a presence there. I did not know that. So that's definitely an update to my worldview
*  that there are multiple big tech companies doing non-trivial business in China. On the
*  collaboration at the sort of academic scientist level, this is also a confusing thing for me.
*  I don't know if you have a theory of this. I read archive papers daily and a lot of the names are
*  Chinese. The author's names are Chinese and often all the author's names are Chinese and often it's
*  a Chinese institution that they're working out of. So I'm surprised that given all this sort of
*  general ratcheting of tensions, there hasn't been any sort of pullback from China in terms of,
*  hey, because we've certainly seen this from the leading frontier model developers in the US,
*  not publishing their methods anymore. The Chinese research community though seems to
*  not just continue to publish, but continue to publish in American venues in English
*  a lot of the time. And I guess I wonder like, why is that? Or is that just scientists rising above,
*  political discord to continue to work together? Or is there something else going on there that
*  keeps the flow of research on out of China and to the rest of the world?
*  Yeah, I would say that China is keen, Chinese government is keen for its researchers, academics
*  to be reaching a global audience. It looks good for Chinese power. If it's rising up the ranks
*  in terms of contributions that scientists are making in the world. So you see that reflected
*  in the incentive system that researchers in China are working within. They are incentivized to produce
*  as many publications as possible. And that means publishing in top English language journals,
*  presenting at top international conferences. And there are some Chinese journals, but most
*  top Chinese researchers would not be bothering with those because you're just cutting yourself
*  off from a larger potential audience, then you're not going to be rewarded as much for it in the
*  academic system. Would I infer from that that there are no Chinese versions of the papers that
*  I'm reading that are coming out of Chinese institutions? Yeah. They're like literally
*  only publishing in English. Wow, that's fascinating. Does this fall under like,
*  face the broad concept of saving face? Is that what this is? Or is that not the right way to
*  think about this? I'm not sure. I think there's a risk of trying to see too much through this
*  face lens. I think it's understandable at both an individual level and a government level that
*  the researchers themselves want to have a larger impact to be recognized by more people publishing
*  the best venues possible. And also at the government level, China wants to be recognized
*  as an international science power, then this is where they've got to be publishing. That's just
*  how international science is, and it's dominated by English at the moment. So I think it's a case
*  of Chinese researchers working within the current power structures. How long may it continue? I hope
*  the scientific collaboration avoids getting disrupted in the way so many other ties between
*  two countries have. It is funny. I heard Jordan Schneider's talk report from NeurEPS on the China
*  Talk podcast, and he said that there are just a remarkable number of people speaking Mandarin
*  at NeurEPS. I believe this last one was in New Orleans. And it's visa issues, all that kind of
*  stuff aside, you just walk through the halls there and a good chunk of the conversations are happening
*  in Mandarin. So it is very interesting to think about that juxtaposition of there's enough
*  critical mass that people can speak their native Chinese language. And at the same time, they're
*  all even out of Chinese universities still publishing in English. It's a weird world.
*  So I guess last couple of questions that I really appreciate your time and you've been super
*  generous with it. The big picture obviously is this rivalry between the two countries.
*  One article that I have not been able to get out of my, this is like my Roman Empire arguably
*  with these days, an op-ed in the Washington Post from May 2018. This is before GPT-2, which is
*  early 2019. The article written by a person named Feng Zhang, you can tell me if I'm saying that
*  wrong, professor at Tsinghua, described by the Washington Post as one of China's most prominent
*  legal scholars. The article is titled, AI Will Spell the End of Capitalism. That is almost six
*  years old, prior to language models, but definitely a pretty provocative headline,
*  even by today's standards, maybe more so today, just given how much more powerful AI systems have
*  become. The notion there is basically the market has been the only way to figure things out, but
*  like AI maybe will give us a different way to figure things out and China's going to lead on
*  this. There's a prospect for a return to a more planned economy, a more planned and controlled
*  society. Is that the line that, is there a government line domestically in China and is
*  that what it is? We're going to use AI to get even more communist, more centralized planning,
*  more centralized control, or is there a different narrative that is heard from the government?
*  I wouldn't say that article really reflects the government position. I do think that the government
*  sees a lot of opportunity in AI, sees that it can help with industrial optimization and productivity
*  gains, but I haven't seen it spread the message that it's going to lead to some communist utopia.
*  There's also risks that the government recognizes and has talked about in terms of exacerbating
*  social inequality and disrupting employment structures. I wouldn't say that it's as optimistic
*  as that article is and a lot of the opportunities and risks that it talks about from AI are similar
*  to the ones that you see other governments talking about. Interesting. Yeah, I've heard you say that
*  of course through this conversation and it has rung in my ear as I guess just another
*  uncanny similarity. It's not given the fundamentally new and weird nature and powerful
*  nature of this technology. It makes sense on some level that people should have a similar
*  attitude toward it, but it is striking and surprising that basically the line seems to be
*  the same. Get the upsides, minimize the risks, and that's it. It sounds like not a lot more
*  detail there either. This is something I've been really lamenting recently about the
*  Western discourse is just that we don't really have a positive vision for the future.
*  I don't necessarily think it's the government's place to offer that here, but even industry
*  leaders are not really offering much in the way of a concrete vision for a positive future. It's
*  going to be amazing as long as we don't blow ourselves up in the process. It sounds like
*  that's basically the same thing that is prevailing in China. It could be awesome and hopefully we'll
*  get there. Is it really that kind of lacking in detail? I would say that similarly there isn't
*  really concrete clear long-term vision for AI and how it will be integrated into the economy.
*  This year you had the recent publication of the government work report where it set out its
*  priorities for the year and AI was mentioned fairly prominently there and they were talking about
*  this AI Plus initiative which seems to be about integrating AI with more different industries and
*  sectors and really trying to bring forward more real-life application to different sectors.
*  That's not really the same as deep thinking about how we're going to be using AI and responding to
*  AI when these systems get way more powerful in the future. I think a lot more thinking to be done
*  on that topic. It sounds like there's a global shortage of positive vision for the future.
*  One thing we do hear often about climate, I guess maybe Asian cultures more generally, is that there
*  is a higher default level of enthusiasm for or optimism about technology here in certainly in
*  the US. I would say probably Europe too. You have much more skepticism, much more like it's going to
*  take all our jobs and then it's going to suck or whatever. Not to mention the Terminator memes, but
*  would you say it does seem to be true that there is more just day-to-day man on the street sort
*  of optimism about a technology future in China? Yeah, I think the more positive attitude you're
*  referring to does seem to come through in opinion polls that I've seen. In the West, you see NGOs
*  playing an important role in raising concerns about certain abuses of technology. You just
*  don't have that kind of active NGO landscape here because of many restrictions that nonprofits face.
*  You don't have these organizations that can really mobilize and raise concerns about tech in
*  quite the same way. Although sometimes you do see important critical pieces from journalists. Yeah,
*  my take would be probably a bit more optimism, but also shaped by the fact that you don't have
*  the same kind of open space for discourse and for diverse voices that you have in the West.
*  In the context of self-driving cars, is there a... Because that's another one here where,
*  and it drives me nuts, there's just a lot of pessimism and negativity. It's either it'll
*  never work or I don't want it even if it does. I have no idea what the situation might be in China,
*  but if I had to bet on which country is going to get self-driving cars first, I would probably
*  bet on China. The reason is actually less to do about the attitude of positive or negativity,
*  but more just if something like that is feasible, I would expect that the Chinese government would
*  be like, hey, this is going to make life safer and better and people can work in the commute or
*  whatever. Let's do it and actually make a point to make it happen. Whereas here, certainly the
*  authorities are, if anything, standing in the way and very gradually allowing stuff to happen.
*  They haven't been totally blocking it, which has been a pleasant surprise, but it certainly is not
*  something that the government is trying to make happen. On the self-driving car front,
*  do you see that as... Is there any indication that the government wants to bring that reality
*  to the public? Yeah, there is a positive attitude from the government towards self-driving cars.
*  There are companies, including Baidu, that have been testing cars in suburbs of major cities,
*  in parts of Beijing. There are now taxi trips that you can take without a safety driver, but
*  they are limited to certain routes, certain sets of destinations. I think that what you say about
*  government potentially being more willing here to provide support could be true. I think the fact
*  that Chinese consumers are often quite open to trying new technologies can also be a point in
*  favor of the Chinese self-driving car industry. I would add though that the city centers in China
*  can be pretty chaotic. We've got loads of cyclists and delivery drivers going the wrong way. No one
*  really following the road rules. I think that could be a big obstacle, at least for very busy,
*  messy city centers. But certainly in more straightforward environments, I could see
*  adoption being pretty impressive and fast in China once the technology is good enough.
*  Is that something where you could see the government actually transforming the landscape
*  to take advantage of it? We have this picture of China with the high-speed trains and whatever,
*  and it's like... I heard somebody say one time, you'll never see a straighter railroad than the
*  one from the Beijing airport to downtown. I don't know if that's true or not, but the idea was simply
*  that somebody draws a line on the map and that's where it's going to go. There's not a lot of
*  doing and blocking and this and that. Obviously, there are pros and cons to such decisive moves to
*  build. Does it seem conceivable that you could see these chaotic city streets tamed in some way for
*  the purpose of ushering in a new technology regime like a self-driving car? Or is that just
*  too crazy to contemplate from where you're sitting today?
*  Yeah, good question. Definitely not outside the realm of possibility. You do see already
*  Chinese government being willing to invest in new cities and new infrastructure to support
*  self-driving cars. There's a place called Xiongan that's not too far away from Beijing in a
*  neighbouring province. It's built as this new town and has lanes specially for driverless cars.
*  There's an expressway linking Beijing to this place in Hebei and that expressway is being designed
*  with self-driving cars in mind. I think that is a positive signal. It's obviously harder to completely
*  rework existing, really old cities, but the Chinese government can do pretty impressive things when it
*  puts its mind to it, as you alluded to with the mention of the train system.
*  Cool. That's another great little tidbit, the idea that there's a highway under construction
*  with self-driving cars in mind. That's exactly the kind of thing I was thinking might happen there,
*  and I don't see that happening here in the near term. But hey, maybe we'll be motivated by not
*  wanting to allow a self-driving car gap. If so, that'd be the kind of technology race I would
*  encourage. Going back to, I think probably the last big question I have for you is just around
*  the culture and thinking of AI safety in China. I think, again, one of the very annoying things to
*  me that is often said in the West is that we can't trust China to cooperate with us in any way,
*  shape or form on AI safety. Therefore, we just have to develop the technology as fast as possible,
*  because otherwise China will. I don't really buy that, but I also don't know a lot about what
*  people in China do think about questions of AI safety. I know we've seen some joint statements
*  recently, which is seemingly encouraging that there is some room for cooperation.
*  There's even a governmental agreement, at least in principle, to not use AI systems to launch
*  nuclear weapons, which is doing the minimum. But hey, it's great. We should celebrate that,
*  I would say. Beyond that, I just don't know. What would you say is the rough shape of thinking
*  in China when it comes to big picture questions of AI safety?
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Yeah. First, are you not quite sure which
*  agreement you're referring to on the nuclear side of things?
*  Let me look it up real quick. November 11, 2023, Biden G set to pledge
*  ban on AI in autonomous weapons like drones, nuclear warhead control. This was out of that
*  meeting in San Francisco. And...
*  I think there was speculation before Biden and Xi met in November that they might announce this
*  agreement not to use AI and nuclear systems. But when the actual readout came through from
*  the White House, it just had a brief line on AI, which said that Biden and Xi agreed that there
*  would be future dialogues on AI risk. Yeah. As I'm reading all these headlines,
*  I think you might be right. Unfortunately, all of the sort of early and mid-November articles
*  say set to and to sign. And then an article on December 4, a couple of weeks later,
*  from the lawfare.org, China won't yet commit to keep autonomy out of its nuclear command and
*  control. It will take a lot more talking to get there. Yes, that's been perhaps deferred to future
*  discussions, which is a bummer because I thought we had agreed to not have AI systems in our nuclear
*  command and control. So yeah, I won't sleep quite as well tonight. But I guess a big call out on
*  that because I had bought into the prospective and not yet actually confirmed headlines about
*  that agreement with the backdrop of that agreement was not in fact actually reached.
*  And I'm somewhat reeling from that realization. Tell me the truth, but I'm hoping for some good
*  news on the big picture questions of AI safety in China. Yeah, sorry to disappoint you on that one.
*  I would say that there have been some positive signs in the past year or so. We've seen more
*  dialogue between Chinese and Western actors around AI safety. In June of last year, there was a whole
*  day of talks on AI safety and alignment conference held by the Beijing Academy of AI. Sam Altman
*  delivered an online talk for that and many other prominent Western AI figures spoke as well.
*  You also had the AI safety summit in the UK that was attended by Chinese government and other
*  Chinese individuals. And it was great to see agreements coming out of that on catastrophic
*  risks from AI. On the other side, I'd say that there is still a gap between
*  it's concrete actions and you don't see as much research happening in China on AI alignment.
*  You don't see top labs here committing to responsible scaling policies in the same way that
*  Anthropic and OpenAI have. There's a lot less thinking here about corporate governance
*  mechanisms that might need to be in place to mitigate the worst risk from AI. But maybe this
*  is because you don't have in China such a long history of labs that are explicitly focused on
*  building AGI, pushing the cutting edge of the technology in quite the same way. And maybe it's
*  understandable that Chinese developers are just focusing on trying to improve their tech and get
*  up to the level where they can really be following the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. And they're not
*  really putting so much energy into thinking about safety. But I'm hopeful that with continued
*  dialogue with Western actors and academic circles and at the government level, you could see
*  movement on this front and more actual action and investment as opposed to just talking.
*  My last question, is there anything that you think folks in the West could do to
*  encourage that continuation of dialogue and hopefully some big picture cooperation as opposed to
*  the what everyone fears, I think, which is the AI arms race between the two countries.
*  That's sort of at the level of what could governments do, but also what should I advocate
*  for starters, if anything. Thanks for that question. I think that for people who have
*  influence within AI circles, within policy circles, just trying to keep channels of communication open
*  such that there can still be room for dialogue on safety and risk reduction. I think the general
*  members of the public, maybe people who don't have the ear of government in quite the same way,
*  I think there's still an encouragement that I would make to try and engage mindfully in discussions
*  about China and engage critically with the content that you see. I think it's important to just
*  recognize that it is very hard to get a good handle on what is happening in China. You don't
*  have a big community of foreign journalists here. They're stretched very thinly and a lot of the
*  English language discussion about China and Chinese AI can lack nuance. So, encourage people to take
*  stories that they see with a pinch of soul, to try and read people who are talking about these issues
*  in a thoughtful way. Recommend the work of people like Jeff Ding and Max Xi Hen on the AI regulation
*  side in particular and trying not to spread overly exaggerated views of Chinese AI. I can get
*  frustrated when I see what really seems to be fear-mongering. This view that China is a real
*  threat to AI leadership on the US side and we've got to do everything we can to stop it. I hope
*  that there can be a more nuanced and thoughtful discussion about the pros and cons of engaging
*  with China and a more considered approach to these questions. I'd like to think that you and I have
*  done our small part this evening and morning to advance that agenda. I really appreciate your
*  time and I've learned a lot from this conversation. Is there anything else you want to
*  touch on before we break? I don't think so. Maybe we can put some links to some of the
*  experts that I mentioned, some of the resources that I think could be useful if people want to
*  do a bit more digging. But yeah, I'll just finish by thanking you a lot for giving me the chance to
*  share my thoughts today and it's been a pleasure. The pleasure is all mine. L Squared, you can find
*  her writing on the Chinatalk blog from time to time. Thank you for being part of the Cognitive
*  Revolution. Thanks Nathan. It is both energizing and enlightening to hear why people listen and
*  learn what they value about the show. So please don't hesitate to reach out via email at tcr
