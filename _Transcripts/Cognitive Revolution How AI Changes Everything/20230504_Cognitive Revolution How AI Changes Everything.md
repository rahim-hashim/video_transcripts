# Helping Businesses Use AI with Rachel Woods of The AI Exchange
**Cognitive Revolution "How AI Changes Everything":** [May 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U6WrgbYTME)
*  The most absurd conversation that I've had was like literally from TikTok.
*  People reached out and they wanted me to join their two hour long board meeting,
*  public pharma company. Like what they hired me to do is to sit there and just like be a sounding
*  board for as they're thinking through what does an AI strategy mean. If everybody can post on
*  Twitter and everybody has an AI that just like takes their raw thoughts and puts them into like
*  high performing tweets and everybody is using these agents, okay is anybody actually on Twitter
*  anymore? If you're paying attention you can feel at least like you're making progress.
*  The number one thing I recommend to people is start using chat GPT with an automation tool
*  like Zapier or Make. We are using AI for like so many things that are like so serious and honestly
*  sometimes it's just really fun to use AI to make much better memes and like I've never been a
*  person who's good at making memes before and now I feel like I can make ones that make me laugh at
*  least. Hello and welcome to the cognitive revolution where we interview visionary
*  researchers, entrepreneurs, and builders working on the frontier of artificial intelligence.
*  Each week we'll explore their revolutionary ideas and together we'll build a picture of how AI
*  technology will transform work, life, and society in the coming years. I'm Nathan Labenz joined by
*  my co-host Eric Torenberg. Hi everyone and welcome back to the cognitive revolution.
*  Today we continue our AI in Media series with special guest Rachel Woods. Rachel was previously
*  a data scientist at Meta where she worked on AI systems that support the small business advertising
*  platform and she was also the founder of Vinebase an e-commerce and marketing platform focused on
*  small vineyards which she sold to Quirksy in 2022. Today Rachel is the founder of the AI exchange and
*  best known for her Twitter and especially her TikTok profile where she creates roughly one
*  video per day to help people keep up with and understand all the latest AI news. She also
*  dispenses practical advice for both individuals and companies. The AI exchange publishes a regular
*  newsletter which you can subscribe to at news.theaiexchange.com and she provides additional
*  resources community and even optional consulting services for subscribers. Rachel and I talked
*  about the kind of audience she is reaching, just how quickly people are waking up to the opportunity
*  of AI, how many companies that didn't have AI in their 2023 plans are now scrambling to adapt,
*  how she tries to consult with and guide those companies forward, and lots lots more. I hope
*  you enjoy this delightful conversation with Rachel Woods. Rachel Woods, welcome to the cognitive
*  revolution. Thank you, thanks so much for having me. Yeah, I'm excited to talk to you. I think you
*  have staked out a really interesting position for yourself as a sort of very smart and plugged in
*  AI influencer, popularizer, educator. So I'd love to start off by just asking you a little bit about
*  how you conceive of the role that you're playing and who your audience is and how you decided to
*  do this in such an opportune time. Yeah, so a little bit of luck and foresight, I think, is kind of the
*  moral of my story in this space. So I actually started my TikTok account November 1st, which
*  if you think back to the timing of that, before the whole world cared about chat GPT,
*  it's almost comical that that was like, you know, the month before everything imploded or exploded,
*  however you want to think about it. But yeah, I mean, so my story is I was a data scientist before
*  and then I founded a venture-backed startup in the e-commerce space where we were actually using GPT-3
*  a bunch in that product. And after kind of that experience and seeing the impact that large
*  language models were having on what we were building, I was like, okay, the world like maybe
*  doesn't care yet, but the world needs to know that AI can do this crazy thing where it writes for you.
*  And that ended up being like that plus a little bit of a joke of like, I'm going to go be a TikTok
*  influencer was the impetus to go start a TikTok account, which I, yeah, I mean, it's just been a
*  crazy journey since then. So now you're reaching regularly something like 100,000 people a day.
*  And obviously there's spikes on top of that on TikTok. What is the state of the public,
*  you know, the broad public right now who just like comes across your videos? I'm so deep down
*  the rabbit hole myself. And I think probably most of our listeners are that I sometimes find it's
*  like easy to lose touch with what somebody who's cruising TikTok and like sees one of your videos
*  for the first time, you know, might be pretty supposed to think. Yeah. I mean, a lot of people
*  are surprised when I tell them my stats. So myself included, like, I feel like I originally thought
*  that TikTok was a lot of young people doing dances or like funny memes. But 90% of my audience is
*  over the age of 25 and 50% is over the age of 35. And they're predominantly US based. And then I
*  have the really fun privilege of people reach out to me and like book time with me and want to talk.
*  And so I've found out that there are mostly business leaders, professionals, founders and
*  engineers, literally like on TikTok nights and weekends, like listening and learning about AI.
*  And then funny enough, sharing my TikToks in their company's Slack channels, which I just like sit
*  back for a minute and like think about like being at work and just seeing like a stream of TikToks
*  about AI in your Slack. It's pretty funny. But yeah, I mean, like, I know we're in the AI bubble.
*  I mean, I'm very active on Twitter too. But one thing that's been truly like amazing over the last
*  three, four, five months has just been like the pure like mainstream, especially business explosion
*  and interest in AI. I'm sure you've seen that as well with what you're doing, but it's really there,
*  which has been pretty incredible. Yeah, it seems like I feel like we're in this kind of
*  probably pretty short in between moment where, you know, my joke right now is that I've restarted
*  the calendar on the release of GPT-4. So we're now at GPT-4 plus one month to the day, I believe.
*  And it's, you know, this huge step change where all of a sudden you're seeing like pretty
*  sophisticated reasoning, not quite breakthrough insight, but you know, like professional grade
*  reasoning on just a super wide range of things. And yet that's not really deployed almost anywhere
*  at this point. And I have no idea like to what degree people are, again, like outside of the bubble.
*  Like aware. Yeah, just have any concept of whether
*  that's happening or not, because the messages are so confused, right? Like at the same time,
*  you'll see people saying like, it's all hype and, you know, this technology is never going to work.
*  We need a totally different paradigm. And then, you know, at the same time, like
*  other people are reporting that it's, you know, matching human doctors. So yeah, I just, I don't
*  know, it's like hard to get a read on. But it sounds like you are mostly reaching people that are much
*  more plugged in and kind of shepherding them through education as opposed to, you know,
*  you don't see too many randoms on your page. Yeah. I mean, I would say like the audience that I
*  really speak to is the early adopters across almost every industry. So kind of how I decided
*  to go from TikTok being a fun side thing to it being my full-time thing and building a whole
*  company around it was I put a link in my bio January 1st, and within 24 hours, I had six people
*  purchase time with me to talk to me about not like the latest prompts or even kind of like catalog
*  into the mid-journey discord, but it was like, okay, I see that there's a huge shift in AI.
*  What should my business even be doing in this next wave? And I feel like that is actually like
*  a side of the AI conversation we like don't see on Twitter. We don't see in the doomsday conversation
*  is like, there are just so many businesses across like every single industry that are actually
*  sitting down with their board, with their team and thinking, okay, should we be having like
*  rethinking how AI is brought into like our product or our offering? So then from that lens,
*  some of the things that I think the AI bubble people are paying attention to around these
*  emerging capabilities of reasoning, other than a lot of ways, the leaders across these other industries
*  are paying attention to those types of trends because they're trying to figure out what does
*  an AI strategy even mean? Is an AI strategy that I'm going to have like prompts in my offering to my
*  customers or is an AI strategy that I'm going to have to figure out how to deploy agents?
*  Right. And I think that's actually the conversation that's going on. Even if you're a
*  lawyer, a dentist, a CEO of a software company that's based out of, you know, maybe not Silicon
*  Valley, like it really is like the conversation people are having, which is fascinating.
*  I think those conversations sound pretty fascinating. And it sounds like you've had
*  a wide range of them that probably literally does span like local small business owner
*  all the way up to kind of CEO of a significant company. How do you frame things for them when
*  somebody comes to you and is like, okay, here's my deal? And maybe the answer is like it's highly
*  contextual, which would be interesting in and of itself. But I'm sure you have some kind of high
*  level frame that you offer, maybe a couple of different versions to people who are like,
*  I've seen, you know, I've used JSTPD a little bit. I've seen it on the news, but I'm really
*  kind of at a loss for what this means for my business. Yeah. I mean, so, Nathan, the funniest
*  or like the most absurd conversation that I've had was like literally from TikTok. People reached
*  out and they wanted me to join their two hour long board meeting, public company, public pharma
*  company. And my, like what they hired me to do is to sit there and just like be a sounding board
*  for us. They're thinking through like, what does an AI strategy mean? Like that's the level at which
*  people are actually having conversations. Yeah. I mean, there's definitely some commonalities,
*  you know, I have done over a hundred of these calls since the beginning of the year. And so
*  I've started to like distill down things into resources, which is like a lot of what we put
*  the business around. But, you know, one question is like, are you going to use AI to improve your
*  internal operations or are you going to use AI to offer a new service or product or experience
*  to your customers? And like, those are, those are pretty distinct conversations a lot of times.
*  And I often talk to people about how they think about risk, right? There's a lot more risk
*  in offering an AI solution to your customers today, just on like where the technology and the
*  capabilities and human loop and these other like questions and limitations we have are versus
*  starting to figure out is how you can use it in your internal operations. I recommend companies
*  start there because they get more of a feedback loop and a sense of the technology and like,
*  you're going to learn stuff that's going to help you figure out how to go and maybe deliver
*  something like different to your customer. But yeah, like I think the thing that would surprise
*  most people is how serious these conversations are and like how like legit that it's not just like the
*  AI bubble people saying the words like human in the loop, you know, it is, it is a much broader
*  audience. Yeah, fascinating. I agree with your advice for what it's worth to start with something
*  in your own operations. That's certainly how I got comfortable and to the point where I felt
*  qualified speaking publicly about this technology was really just breaking. And I have, you know,
*  probably sounds like a pretty similar riff. I always talk about identifying discrete tasks that
*  AI can do and then embedding that into like a broader process, you know, that takes advantage
*  of the ability to delegate to AI. And a lot of times that can be pretty analogous to tasks that
*  are currently done. Sometimes it can be like new tasks or, you know, it can enable scale in new ways.
*  But just kind of starting with those discrete things of like, is there a sort of input output
*  where it's like hard now? And if I had, you know, infinite interns, whatever it could in theory be
*  easy. If you can identify those places, you get off to a pretty good start and then you feel real
*  value. You definitely learn things. You see some failure modes and hopefully, you know, develop a
*  healthy respect for the technology. But yeah, I agree. That's a very good place for most to start.
*  You know, like when I think about like what to create content on, like, I think there are
*  people in the space who are creating content for the objective of getting views, growing an account,
*  growing an audience, growing distribution. And, you know, early on, I like, I think you have to
*  make a decision of like, whether that's going to be your objective in this space, because you go down
*  a certain path. Or if your objective is going to be more playing a little bit of the long game,
*  and creating like really a relationship more as a creator, I guess, than an influencer where you're
*  creating value for people and helping them actually like navigate what's going on. I think like what
*  I see you talk about online is like very much in these like same objectives, which is, hey,
*  we sitting here look at how AI is going to change the way we operate business. And we also see that
*  if people don't really have kind of the right way to think about it, or not the full information,
*  or they're not really paying attention, or they're not inspired to get like small wins, then like,
*  this space is going to keep moving and people are not going to be, you know, prepared to ride that
*  wave. And I think that that's like, it's just so important. And that's like where I create content
*  from is like, if someone can not feel concerned about the future of their business, because like
*  they watched a few videos, right? Or because they like read my newsletter, then like, that's,
*  that's the win. Like, how do you arm people to, to actually feel confident navigating this next wave?
*  Because I think you and I both sitting here, like see, there's just going to be a huge change.
*  Upstream is where I go deeper with some of the world's most interesting thinkers to map the
*  constellation of ideas that matter. On the first season of Upstream, you'll hear from Mark Andreessen,
*  David Sachs, Balaji, Ezra Klein, Joe Lonsdale, and more. Make sure to subscribe and check out the first
*  episode with A16Z's Mark Andreessen. The link is in the description. Omniki uses generative AI to enable
*  you to launch hundreds of thousands of ad iterations that actually work customized across all platforms
*  with a click of a button. I believe in Omniki so much that I invested in it, and I recommend you
*  use it too. Use Cogrev to get a 10% discount. Do you know anyone who feels, if you could
*  point to anyone who's confident in navigating this, I'd be very interested. I don't feel very
*  confident at all. Do you feel confident? I mean, I feel confident in, in like, it's just a step by
*  step, like paying attention and trying to make smart decisions along the way. Right? Like I'm not,
*  I'm not sitting here saying like, okay, like people have it totally solved. People know how it's
*  going to play out. But I do think there's a level of like, if you're paying attention, you can
*  feel at least like you're making progress. Right. And then, you know, like repurposing content,
*  the thing that used to take you like 30% of your time as a content creator, okay, now takes you
*  2%. Right. And like that's progress. And I think like confidence can come out of like those,
*  you know, small wins. Yeah, it's fascinating. I, I love the space in many ways. And one of the biggest
*  ones is just how much I am constantly learning. I try to target like 50% of my, you know, working
*  time just on kind of understanding what's going on and probably do fall a bit short of that. But
*  you know, have to maintain a pretty good amount or, you know, things get stale so quickly.
*  The number of times that I've kind of gone back and looked at writing from two weeks ago and felt
*  like, well, it needs at a minimum, like a significant update is just crazy. Yeah, I mean,
*  it's interesting that you say you don't feel like confident in that because like, I guess I think,
*  I think looking back and seeing how much the space is changing and then realizing that it's
*  changing, like that's, that's actually just like what's going on right now, right? It's like,
*  we're all having to do that. Yeah, no doubt. And I like it, but I do also at the same time feel like
*  my ability, I think like I can see maybe six months out, you know, with some amount of
*  clarity. And when I, you know, talk to people on the podcast, I'm like, I like apologize for even
*  asking them to envision 2030. Or occasionally I have asked, they're like 2030, what are you nuts?
*  That's beyond anyone's event horizon. So yeah, I mean, I guess there's different meanings of
*  confidence. I would, you know, I'm with you in that I do feel like I have enough command of the
*  current situation to, you know, at least help people start to get up to speed. But I, I'm very
*  reluctant to make, you know, any predictions that kind of get beyond 2023 at this point.
*  I totally agree. Yeah. So what is going back to the kind of board level conversations or, you know,
*  where you're interacting with companies as a strategic advisor, I'm kind of keeping in mind
*  this, you know, large pharma company type example. I have a fair degree of uncertainty around how
*  quickly things are going to happen over, you know, the course of like this, you know, I've called it
*  the great implementation of kind of, we have GVD-4, it's, you can see a pretty clear path
*  of being everywhere. You know, I am confident that there is a wave of transformation coming
*  based on that deployment, but the speed of the wave time, you know, and exact kind of timing
*  dynamics, how it plays out, you know, a lot more uncertainty there. So what have you seen in terms
*  of the ambition of these companies? You could talk about that in a couple of ways, like timelines,
*  but also, you know, like a pharma company, I could see, you know, wisely, I would say, you know,
*  starting with something small and internal and, you know, like expense receipts, you know, you
*  could, you can reform all these little things that are kind of annoying today. But then you could also
*  be like, you could imagine a world where it's instead of talk to your doctor about our drug,
*  it's like talk to our language model on our website as kind of the first thing you do before,
*  you know, we then encourage you to go talk to a doctor. So like, how ambitious are these
*  companies thinking right now? And when do you think we see like the small and then the bigger
*  changes? The first thing that I see is most people, in fact, like I would almost say all with an
*  asterisk, didn't have AI in their 2023 roadmap or budget. And so most of the conversations that I
*  was helping companies have either directly or kind of supporting through content was how to think
*  about like having that conversation and what investments might look like. I recommend to a
*  lot of companies that they do, they kind of take a page out of Silicon Valley's book and think about
*  doing an internal hackathon with their team. Like, I think we're starting to see some of those start
*  to play out over the next like couple months, where companies are at least just giving their team
*  the space to experiment and see where value could come from within anything, especially
*  internal operations. You know, when you ask about like the the really big broad strokes of like,
*  wow, we don't recognize like what it means to be an e commerce company or what it means to be a
*  pharma company or what it means to do X, Y, and Z. Like, I do think those things are much further
*  out and like much fuzzier. But I guess this is my bias. Like I sit in the day to day of like,
*  your team does so much manual work that they know is manual work. They don't love doing. They're
*  sitting there on the slog and like they want to use these tools. How do you enable them to use some
*  of these tools and kind of this like productivity unlock? And I think that's happening like,
*  you know, now and exceedingly so in the next like three to six months.
*  How do you see that shaping up? Because this is something I also have, you know, again,
*  in terms of my limited confidence. If you'd asked me a couple months ago, I was very like,
*  we got to curate the best tools. And in particular, I'm advising a friend's company,
*  which you know about, which is called Athena, which is in the executive assistant space. And
*  as of January, I was like, we need to test a ton of tools, we need to curate the best tools.
*  And then we'll have like this Swiss army knife of like proven things. It's going to be awesome.
*  And, you know, we'll train all the EAs on how to use them. And that'll be like ultimately kind of
*  a part of how we can position the company. And I don't think that's wrong. But I do think the
*  number of tools that I expected to be in that set has dropped precipitously to where I'm now like,
*  it might be like three, you know, or, or even maybe just kind of one core one plus like other
*  things that are naturally built into, you know, spreadsheets and whatnot, where, you know, just
*  the product itself changes. So what's your kind of expectation for that productivity suite over,
*  you know, whatever, three to six months, like as that kind of matures, what do you think people
*  are going to be using most? So I also think about this question in two ways, which is
*  when I tell people, hey, maybe think about giving your team space to do like an internal hackathon
*  type experience. Most of that is for building up what I think of as like AI literacy. Because again,
*  I go back to like, most companies did not have AI in their vocabulary before chat GPT. And so I think
*  we're just still in this space of, you know, people like try chat GPT, but they're not using
*  it on a regular basis because they can't really find like ways that it's useful.
*  Also, they're probably still on the free version a lot of the time, which is a huge difference in
*  value. Yeah. And there's open, like people don't really understand data privacy and the ownership
*  of what happens to the prompts and the outputs that goes into that. So like, I think there's just
*  a lot of adoption that needs to happen just from a like learning perspective. And then from a tool
*  side, I'm actually very much in the same boat as you. Like, I encourage a lot of companies and teams
*  to be a little patient with the tools that they test out. My hot take, as I say, an annual plan
*  is one of the worst things that you can like commit to in this market because it's just changing so
*  fast. And you never know like one month, the AI sales assistant tool could be the thing that you
*  think is going to really like enable your team. And the next month, it could be something totally
*  different. Right. But I think that like some of the best success stories I've seen are when
*  companies and people building have like really close relationships and they're kind of like
*  iterating through that together. So I think we're still so early on the tools themselves
*  in a lot of regards as well. Here's a hot take back. I think it's shaping up to be
*  the chat GPT as kind of the Google, you know, the canonical name brand, you know, iPhone equivalent
*  of using an AI chatbot. And it seems like there will be certainly alternatives, but
*  it seems like OpenAI has a pretty substantial lead. And for those that are really taking advantage
*  of this stuff, it seems like that is going to be the hub. That's kind of my most likely
*  projection for like later this year. It's like plugins come online, they work well, and everybody's
*  like chat GPT plus like it's the thing. That's what we're using. I think that could happen. I
*  still feel like it's a little early. I think there are some dynamics that haven't like played out
*  totally yet. Just from as I've like talked to people. I mean, one thing that a lot of people
*  overestimate, I think is like how many people are using chat GPT on a regular basis. A lot of people
*  have tried it. A lot of people haven't had success with it yet because maybe their prompt wasn't
*  very good, right? Or they didn't figure out the right workflow. So I think we're still really
*  early, but that could happen for sure. How much so for me, I think the core thing is just
*  the leap from 3.5 to four is so big. I wonder if you would agree with this general assessment,
*  but in my experience, like so many things have gone from at 3.5, still this kind of like art of
*  eliciting decent performance, really got to tinker and drill in on the instructions and often a couple
*  of examples. I typically had to think still pretty hard to get good results from anything up to 3.5.
*  I find with four, it's honestly pretty easy most of the time. So this company, Athena, is like a
*  thousand plus people. I have a standing open invitation. Anyone can just send me whatever
*  they want help with. And I usually find that within a half an hour, I can kind of take their
*  inputs and get to like a decent working output. How would you characterize that leap and kind of,
*  you know, to me, that's like the thing. If you went to chat GBT and you use 3.5 and you like
*  didn't get great results, like I would bet four out of five of those people would get good results
*  if they had just used GBT-4. I mean, I'm curious when you have this open standing invitation, like
*  how much of that do you feel like is because you're a good prompt engineer now? Not that
*  much, honestly, anymore. Some definitely I use like a number of kind of pretty standard techniques.
*  Like we do, my go-to obviously is like some clear instructions, but I usually don't find I have to
*  like overly tinker with or refine those. Usually use like a role, you know, you are a copywriting
*  expert or you are, you know, a seasoned recruiting executive or what have you. I usually don't even
*  have to use examples. I do use like a little bit of kind of know-how when it comes to kind of
*  segmenting the prompt with a little markup to make it, you know, extra clear to the model like which,
*  you know, this is this and that is that. And that's been a huge advance from 3.5 to 4. Like
*  that stuff just works now. Like it can understand the document A and document B are like
*  distinct things at a conceptual level and like synthesize in a way where it used to just kind of
*  confuse even with, you know, decent markup a lot of the time. So honestly, I don't know. I think like
*  maybe I underestimate how hard it is to catch up, but I feel like I can communicate this stuff in
*  like not a long time. And usually do. Like usually when I get done with a half hour call, like
*  people are, they have a working thing and they, you know, feel like they can, you know, continue
*  to elaborate it from there if they want to. That's where I feel like we're just still so early
*  because like the techniques that you're describing, I think we're still at a very, very small
*  percentage of like the workforce or companies that even know about those. And not for a lack of
*  like interest, but just it's, you know, we're in, I think there's a bubble in the fact that like
*  we're in AI all the time. We're thinking about it all the time. Right. When I talk to businesses
*  that are definitely paying attention to AI, but like they run an e-commerce business, like their
*  day-to-day is not saying, thinking about like, oh, does GPT-4 like recognize Markdown better now?
*  And I think we're going to get there, but yeah, it just, it still feels extremely, extremely early
*  and kind of the widespread adoption. And while I agree for like my use cases, I feel like 3.5 and
*  four, I even find myself like thinking like, how hard is this task? Okay. I should use four for it
*  versus 3.5. I think those are also still like very new behaviors. Because all this stuff is still
*  only like a couple of months old. So yeah, like that's just, maybe that's just where I sit and
*  like who I talk to on a day-to-day basis. But seeing like, we're still so early in a lot of stuff.
*  And I feel like then that's where like I get excited because while we feel like on a week,
*  two week basis, we have this huge step changes with things like auto GPT. A lot of companies
*  are still just wondering what AI can do. And so it's not like from 3.5 to 4, 4 to auto GPT
*  feels like these step changes. And so it's more just like AI in general feels like this huge step
*  change. And we're all just figuring out what, what are the capabilities? What can it be used for? Does
*  that make sense? Yeah. As you're describing that, it kind of is analogous to the grokking process,
*  that you know, that it underlies AI improvement, right? There we see these kind of step changes
*  at different scales where there's like the 3.5 to 4 is like a very significant one. There's all these
*  like little micro ones in between. And then for the public, you're kind of saying like, it's basically
*  zero to one. Like we didn't have this before and now we have it. And that's kind of the,
*  the step change that people are having to contend with.
*  Yeah. And I mean, like, just another example, like even in early January, when I was talking to
*  companies, they were describing things like agents, right? Like, oh, can I build it like a chat GPT
*  for my company that goes and finds leads on LinkedIn, and then figures out how to personalize
*  those leads. And then we'll send emails and then we'll like follow up to those emails. And I just
*  give it like the goal of like, close this lead. And I was like, okay, like, that's not quite how
*  it works yet. But like, let me show you how to like break stuff down maybe into prompts. You can
*  start playing. Okay, well, now we have agents, right? But like to that person who was thinking
*  about what AI could do for them, the problem it could solve for their business. They've more seen
*  the step change of AI as opposed to the step change of where we're in the weeds of the actual
*  capabilities, you know, and the, the technical feasibility of each of those, which, yeah, I mean,
*  I find fascinating, like sitting between the two worlds. They're sometimes very different.
*  And I find that really fun. Yeah, I agree. I think it's fascinating perspective that you have and
*  kind of Nexus point that you sit at. I didn't realize how much kind of higher level corporate
*  consulting you've been doing. I think that is a fascinating space right now. Do you run into like,
*  I mean, it's interesting, right? You're, as I understand you, an individual, and I know you
*  have the business as well, but like you show up for me, you know, with your face and like your
*  personality on TikTok and, and Twitter as well. But I do love the TikTok feed. In fact, you're one of
*  maybe 10 or so TikTok AI creators of various sorts that we have curated a list for the EAs
*  at Athena, because we're just like, you know, you guys are collectively and even individually,
*  but certainly collectively, like creating much more content and keeping folks much more up to
*  date than we possibly can internally. So, you know, we just say like, follow these accounts.
*  And, you know, next time you're on TikTok, we kind of, you know, siphon off a little bit of
*  your entertainment budget for some AI education. I think that's honestly a strategy I'd recommend
*  to a lot of companies as well. It's just kind of sharing like good sources. Yeah. I mean,
*  like literally hundreds of short videos of digestible AI content on my TikTok, not even
*  to mention like, yeah, there are a lot of really talented creators on there. So it is a huge
*  resource. Do you run into like Bain? Like who are you? Do you get toward, I mean, public companies,
*  board meeting sounds like you'd be to some degree overlapping with like a much different kind of
*  consultant. And I wonder what you've seen or heard about how they are approaching the market.
*  So I guess taking a step back, I was a research data scientist at Meta. So like I worked on
*  like some stuff with embeddings there, like ranking and for a lot of stuff that now I'm like,
*  wow, those were like fun projects for like having kind of a lens and a take on like what's going on.
*  And then between then and now, I built a like e-commerce like venture backed startup. And so
*  I had the whole experience of like, okay, when you're trying to get something off the ground,
*  how much, you know, a labor of love and a ton of operations that frankly like AI can really help
*  with like that is. And so I've really found my sweet spot and who I love talking to and helping
*  are those like, you know, startups, mid sized companies who are the ones who didn't have AI
*  in their vocabulary very strongly last year and now are thinking through like, what do I do next?
*  I think like there's excellent coverage at the very top of the market, you know, the Fortune
*  500s, the Fortune 100s. There's going to be, you know, a lot of big projects, a lot of changes
*  that I do hear and have kind of exposure to. But, you know, I think back and even just like the
*  companies that we've worked with and helped, there is so much opportunity if you're a non-AI,
*  let's say marketplace series A company to look at the bottlenecks in your marketplace and be able
*  to start thinking about some of these problems in a new way. And so, yeah, that's like the space
*  that I've had a lot of fun working with people. You know, what are the common misconceptions that
*  people have and, you know, do you find that people as they're new to this, like are generally
*  optimistic or pessimistic? But I was kind of thinking of more of like a Main Street audience
*  there and, you know, gathering that it's more of a Silicon Valley audience, but it's like a non-AI
*  Silicon Valley type audience that you're mostly supporting. One of the interesting misconceptions
*  is when I say to those like, you know, metrics earlier of like, who's actually watching,
*  at least my TikTok, like I think there are other AI TikTok creators who are more talking to
*  the mass professional audience or even the mass consumer audience. You know, those people are
*  exposed to different things. I sit here and I talk about data privacy because I get asked that
*  question like 20 times a week, right? And people have like real questions that they're trying to
*  navigate. And so that's a lot of the stuff that I spend my time on. So kind of a different type
*  of like influencer, I guess, in the space. Tell me a little bit about how you use AI
*  in your business. Like what are you finding to be impactful? You know, how do you anticipate that
*  continuing to evolve? Yeah. So one of the things I tell people that I think makes them feel a little
*  bit better is like, I've tried a ton of stuff and a lot of stuff doesn't work. Like it's not just
*  you. Which I think some people like kind of think that they're the problem. It's like, no, no, no,
*  we're just really early on the tech. We use AI in a bunch of like micro ways. So like things that
*  you think like, oh, it'd be so nice for this to be automated. But like, this was a little bit too
*  complex to automate in the past, like throw GPT in there. It's a great simple like classifier.
*  It's a great simple kind of like connecting between like messy processes. And so we have a
*  lot of places we're using it there. So one is like when, so the way our business works is we
*  have a free newsletter and then people can subscribe to like premium content. They get a
*  community. That's kind of our more like scaled offering for this kind of like consulting or
*  business advice. And so a really big part of that is making sure that we know what are people
*  struggling with and like what types of businesses, business problems they have. And so we have a form
*  that pulls all that information in. But then like we're basically with a set of scripts that we run
*  that do kind of like better natural language understanding of the common themes to inform
*  what type of like content we're creating or like, let's say we're creating a certain type of
*  content on a topic. What are some of the most common like questions? All that stuff would have
*  taken me like so long in the past to do with old school NLP. Now super, super easy with a simple
*  script. And then like we'll also use it to like kind of personalize some of the outreach and like,
*  hey, you mentioned this business problem in the past. Like here's some content we just made.
*  So it's a lot of just like, yeah, feeling like you spent a hundred hours on something.
*  And it was actually like 15 minutes, right? Yeah, that's huge. I sometimes find myself
*  talking about two modes of using AI, one being the kind of co-pilot paradigm where you are
*  prosecuting a task and you have this sort of sidecar helper that can
*  auto complete for you or maybe answer a question or what have you, right? But you're kind of like
*  owning where are we going right now? And then the other one, which you're speaking to there,
*  where there's even more unlock and I suspect kind of like a tipping point coming where
*  kind of everybody goes to this mode or like else is what I call delegation mode. And that is where
*  you're like, I am now going to make this discreet enough that I can actually have the AI do the
*  task. And then I will come and look at outputs, but I'm not going to sit there with it in real time
*  doing it, right? And it's not going to be kind of assisting me. It's instead actually going to be
*  performing the task. And again, hopefully, hopefully people are still reviewing the outputs.
*  That remains important for now, at least. But how do you think about, does that dichotomy
*  resonate with you or do you have a different way of framing it for people? No, I mean, I think that
*  that's, I think it's a great way to think about it. You mentioned the intern analogy earlier,
*  which I also really like. Someone suggested at one point that there's maybe a little bit more PC
*  to use the alien analogy, which is like, you have a thousand aliens coming to help you do stuff.
*  What would you do? We use AI in both types of ways in our business. Like just another one on
*  the copilot is like repurposing content, right? Is, I mentioned this earlier, a huge part of
*  creating content that like goes further. And if you have any type of like marketing background or
*  done that stuff before, like, you know that you can just like copy paste the content between
*  platforms, but frankly, your mindset is different when you're scrolling through TikTok versus when
*  you're scrolling through LinkedIn feed. And so content is going to perform better if you
*  have a slightly different approach or different framing, different call to action, et cetera.
*  And if you can get to a place with a prompt that really like nails that for you or gets close
*  and it's like, oh my gosh, like I used to take so much time or I used not even repurpose
*  with kind of that intelligence at all. And like now it's so easy. Like there are just a lot of
*  those like smaller things that I think we use. And then a lot of businesses, like I encourage them
*  to find those for them themselves. You do that in kind of copilot mode just via chat, chat,
*  Yes. We also just like write scripts because it's easier. So I just have like a Python notebook that
*  basically just sends that to chat GPT. Yeah. But I'll do it all. I'll just directly to the model.
*  So what's the, what's the rationale for that? Like I, I'm personally interested in this because
*  I honestly have not mastered it myself. I find myself much more inclined toward delegation mode
*  versus copilot mode, interestingly, except in coding where I feel like the, in that context,
*  the auto-complete of like of the original GitHub copilot is amazing. And I definitely benefit from
*  that. But so yeah, tell me a little bit more about like, how are you doing this kind of
*  repurposing? You start with what, and then you have these scripts and then like, are you reviewing,
*  or are you like trusted enough to like translate tweets to LinkedIn posts and go? I really want
*  to understand the details of that. Yeah. So like one of the most common ones is like,
*  I'll take a TikTok transcript. So like something I've already posted on TikTok.
*  And then I have a script, which I've, or like, really it's a prompt that I've honed in over time
*  that will take that and like create a LinkedIn post draft, for example. And I, to your question,
*  no, I don't just set it on autopilot of like, yeah, go forth and say kind of like,
*  whatever's going to come out of chat GPT for me. And I really encourage like people don't do that.
*  But I found it can get pretty close. And especially if you, I mean, this is where the copilot and
*  delegation model breaks a little bit, but it's like, if you look at your prompt of like, how would I
*  coach someone else to repurpose this content and the way that I think is going to perform best on
*  this channel, then you can kind of start to get to some of these prompts that work pretty well.
*  But yeah, I mean, that being said, like, I would say we're still at maybe
*  anywhere between two to 5% of the like capability that we could be getting out of the technology
*  that's just like literally readily available today, even though we're like full time trying
*  things experimenting. As I said, we tried lots of it doesn't work, which I think is also great.
*  Yeah, I mean, to me, I just like, I like we're just so early and the adoption and like figuring
*  out how this technology is like really going to help us and yeah, and how businesses work.
*  Two to 5%. That's not a lot. There's a long way to go.
*  I mean, we don't have any agents going out and, you know, automatically pulling your LinkedIn and
*  emailing Nathan saying, you know, Hey, your stuff on Twitter is pretty cool. And let me tell you,
*  you know, like, like, we don't have that stuff implemented, nor do I think that's like the place
*  to start for a lot of people. But yeah, I mean, I, I think we're on the very, very early side,
*  like as a society of like, how much AI is going to change how we operate.
*  Do you use as you're trying to like, get it to write like you in different formats,
*  how much of that is pure like descriptive prompt versus few shot based on like, you know,
*  prior conversions that you've done. So we've tried both. What we have working
*  right now is a combination. Like I'll pull in similar LinkedIn posts for the certain type of
*  content. So kind of like a, I mean, it's not fully automated yet, but like, these are the things we
*  think through, which is like, Hey, like, if you could use embeddings to pull in a similar type
*  of content, what would that look like? Right. And then how could you use that to do few shot learning
*  to get the post to feel more like what you want? All of it comes down to like, do you like the end
*  output or not? And did it save you time? And like, if it didn't then like try something new, right.
*  There seems like there's this, you know, maturing of all these tools that's going to take us from
*  the sort of two to 5% to, you know, some significantly higher percentage, even if we don't,
*  you know, get toward a hundred percent of potential. I wonder if you have a vision for like,
*  what the computing experience looks like as that matures. Like, you know, my venture was kind of,
*  we all sit using chat, GPT plus with plugins, but how would you begin to, it seems like it's not that
*  far away. People are going to build, they're building this stuff now. You know, we don't like
*  all the, all the concepts seem to be there. The embeddings, the ability to like index your Gmail
*  history, whatever, like conceptually, it's easy to say that in practice, you know, I've, I would not
*  fork over my Gmail history to baby AGI just yet. So a lot of it seems like it's down to kind of
*  engineering, but also like coalescing around certain paradigms or UIs that are just so nascent.
*  Do you have a sense for like, what it's going to be like to sit at a computer and do stuff in,
*  you know, whatever, six, nine, 12 months? I mean, I feel like it could be pretty different than what
*  we do today. I mean, a lot of me like hopes that it's different. Like I have this other hot take,
*  which is like, I think as a society, we all like work way too much and do way too much of the same
*  stuff every day. I mean, it's not like it necessarily a hot take, but I'm like, I think it's like
*  really not a bad thing if we are all working maybe like an actual 40 hours a week instead of what we
*  like pretend is 40 hours. But in terms of like what that looks like, I mean, I don't know, like
*  I think I stand it like we're still so early and, and trying to predict what things are going to be
*  and gives maybe like not the right mindset, the, or not to like challenge like your way of thinking
*  too much, but it's more like, how do you just like pay attention to like what is changing and what is
*  happening so that you can see like how certain trends are progressing. For example, one I'm
*  paying attention to a lot right now is like all the experiments of GPT-4 being able to code an
*  entire application from someone's like voice command. Like that is huge, right? And could have
*  profound impact on like us having highly personalized software or a business who's been
*  sticky notes next to their like laptop trying to say, okay, like my software doesn't do X, Y,
*  and Z, but like if we do this, this, this, this, this like hacky thing, it can do this. Okay. Well,
*  it's the cost of creating like more personalized software or software in general is like dropping
*  a lot. Okay. Maybe that stuff starts to like, you know, not be problems anymore. Yeah. Maybe like
*  long way of saying like, I wouldn't plan to flag in the ground and say like, we're all going to have
*  Chad GPT plugin marketplace like on our phone and it's going to be the only mega app, right?
*  But I do think things are going to change a lot. And it seems like it's very clear that the agent
*  paradigm will get you to the point where these sort of user interface tasks that are kind of
*  tedious and time-consuming can largely be delegated. Do you want to like come back and watch like sped
*  up, you know, videos of what it did and like find yourself like on the checkout page, like ready to,
*  you know, hit confirm or whatever, almost like a rewind, except, you know, the AI is doing the
*  thing and you're like rewinding the AI activity instead of your own. Yeah. I mean, and then there's
*  like the question of like, if everybody can post on Twitter and everybody has an AI that just like
*  takes their raw thoughts and puts them into like high performing tweets and everybody is using these
*  agents. Okay. Is anybody actually on Twitter anymore? Right. Or like, what's the value of being on
*  like being on these platforms? If you have then a summarizing agent that pulls the most interesting
*  tweets of the day, like, I think you can get a little bit too, and they're, they're fun thought
*  experiments. Like you can get walkthrough step by step by step and saying, well, then this will happen.
*  Then this will happen. Then this might happen. But yeah, that's then where it becomes really like,
*  I think messy and hard to predict. Like this is going to be how this all plays out.
*  Yeah, totally. I mean, radical uncertainty is my kind of starting point for any, uh,
*  that would be a good name of the, of a podcast right now. Yeah. The other one that we had
*  considered was AI summer, which, um, I think would have been a good one as well. Yeah. The Bing
*  launch. I don't know if you, uh, have a good story to tell there, but that must've been quite a
*  bizarre experience in multiple ways. Uh, I feel really positive about companies that are
*  like launching, uh, you know, what they're building in this market. I think frankly,
*  if you zoom out to some degree of a time horizon, um, the learnings you get from launching early,
*  I think do like, I fall on the side of like, it does outweigh, uh, the potential risk of just like
*  waiting way too long to like, start putting this stuff out into the market. But on the launch
*  itself, I mean, it was really, so I do have a kind of a funniest story on this, which is that like,
*  I was not an influencer before or a creator before, like that's like not my background.
*  And so it was very new to a lot of this stuff. Um, but I literally got a cold emailed from
*  Microsoft, uh, just saying like, we want to fly you out for this thing, but we can't tell you what
*  it is. And, uh, at the time, like you can't tell anybody that you even got this email.
*  Um, and I was like, and that was kind of one of my first experiences of getting something like
*  that. I mean, things have happened since, uh, that have been, I realize that's more like the
*  M.O. when you're an influencer, but like the time I was like, well, this is either going to be
*  like the, the story, you know, it ended pretty badly, right? Like it's, uh, flown out.
*  You don't know where you're going. Uh, it says microsoft.com and the email address, but like,
*  I don't know how that could be spoofed. Um, but I was like, yeah, like,
*  I bet I'll just go for it. Right. It was kind of like my personality. Um, and so then I said like,
*  yeah, sure. I'll come. And, uh, yeah, it ended up being really fun because it was, um, you know,
*  I had to meet other, it was like a lot of the like AI reporters were there. Um, so I think some
*  friends, I generally agree. And I think there has been a pretty strong demonstration of the wisdom
*  of making some contact with the broader public, right? Like looking back on the timeline of GPT
*  four, and I didn't know this at the time, but I was in this like weird position where I was
*  participating in the red team program and, you know, had access to the model and was like,
*  exploring that, you know, full time obsessively, like writing all these reports for them, et cetera,
*  et cetera. They did not give us though, any other information. So I was like totally in the dark as
*  to like what their plans were. And the version we were working with was the raw form that, you know,
*  did not have any of the safety mitigations and was like pretty crazy. So I was genuinely nervous
*  coming out of that period. Like what exactly are they going to do next? And, you know, are we
*  entering into like a period of total insanity? And then what they actually did shortly thereafter
*  was launch chat GPT with 3.5 instead of four, and, you know, kind of allowed all those jail breaks
*  to happen. And, you know, I, nobody's ever like confirmed this to me, but it seems quite clear
*  that that was a strategic plan to like get the jail breaks out, you know, largely on 3.5 and then,
*  you know, be able to roll that whole data set into extended training. So I do broadly agree that like
*  it does not, you know, as Sam Altman kind of says, like it does not make sense to go develop a godlike
*  a, maybe not at all, but if you're going to probably still doesn't make sense to like develop it all in
*  secret and then just, you know, drop it on the world all in one, you know, zero to one moment.
*  So I do agree with your perspective that like it does, it is important to launch stuff, not only
*  for business, but even just for like society. At the same time, that felt rushed. And like,
*  to me, like kind of extremely so. I've got, I'm putting a piece together actually where I'm like
*  documenting this, like going back in time and like, you know, kind of Twitter archeology-ing,
*  like who knew what, when, you know, and how did this happen? But it seems like they definitely
*  were rushing it and like kind of at an executive level, I feel like they should do better. You
*  know, you should not release your bot in a stage where it's like actively hostile to users.
*  And, you know, some of those transcripts were like just a simple disagreement, you know,
*  about the date, right? We were not, this was not like a jailbreak type phenomenon. I feel like
*  that's, you know, when people try to break the model, I put that in a very different classroom
*  when the model breaks on someone who was just acting earnestly and trying to interact with it.
*  So it felt like super rushed to me. Did you, did you feel like they had things like buttoned up
*  at the time or did you see a sort of like, because the big worry obviously is the race condition,
*  right? For the people that worry about AI safety long-term, I'm definitely one of them,
*  as enthusiastic as I am. You know, the thing that people worry about most is like, if we get into a
*  race condition, everybody's just cutting corners or whatever, like that's really bad. To me,
*  it feels like that's kind of what happened there. But I wonder what your perspective is,
*  if that like resonates or feels off, you know, given that you flew out and sat
*  in person with them when they did it. Yeah, I just go back to like, I am definitely a proponent of
*  like, you need, you need feedback to learn stuff. I also, I feel like working with my group, I feel
*  like we're so early and a lot of this like technology, what it even means to like red team
*  these products, I would wager we know way more now than we knew three, four months ago on some
*  of these teams. Yeah, I completely agree. Like you should not have a bot that is aggressive to users
*  or OpenAI has a moderation endpoint. Like that should be a given, especially if you're launching
*  something high profile. And like, I know there were some launches recently that didn't use that
*  endpoint. Like that stuff is really important. That being said, I think that there's a little
*  bit of like, you learn from your failures too. And I think that sometimes some of these, like I mean,
*  you zoom out, they're not that big of issues. And we learned a heck of a lot. And like, you know,
*  people are going to be way more cautious in a lot of these, avoiding a lot of these problems in the
*  future. Yeah, largely, I agree. I would like to see them publicly own it a little bit more and like,
*  kind of publicly learn a lesson that may be, you know, wishful thinking on my part. But
*  it is striking to me that we're entering this era where it's like, these technologies are not super
*  easy to control. You know, one of my biggest, just two by one of my investors used to say,
*  two by four to the head obvious, and definitely a two by four to the head obvious point that I've,
*  you know, deeply understood through the red teaming and everything else is just
*  the good behavior of this class of large language model definitely does not come,
*  you know, by default, it is not like easy to create. They have like a hell of a time,
*  you know, with false positives and false negatives on refusal. And, you know, it's just very far from
*  being a solved problem. And so yeah, it's not, you know, somebody was going to do something like,
*  Sydney at some point and make that mistake. It doesn't sit great with me that it was like the
*  biggest, you know, one of the very biggest companies in the world, who I would think should have
*  probably known a little bit better. And it definitely still doesn't sit that well with me
*  that like, they haven't kind of come back around and been like, yeah, we kind of fucked up, you
*  know, we rushed this thing out. And like, what's the standard going forward? You know, should I
*  expect this type of behavior from word in the near future? Or like, is Excel going to be like,
*  you know, intruding into my marriage? I mean, I just think that there's somebody should probably
*  like, at least articulate a standard that they, you know, plan to uphold for themselves.
*  I just want to say too, like, you know, I went to that event, I've worked with Google on some stuff,
*  I've worked with Adobe, like I'm working like across the space, which I think is another,
*  like, fun perspective I get to have, right, which is just being able to see a lot of this stuff,
*  you know, opening eye, what's going on. Like, I love this, because I'm like, the challenge
*  that I would throw back to you is like, okay, yeah, but like, imagine if these types of things
*  were half like, were happening with much more powerful models, does having bad or like not
*  great experiences today, like help us to create like, decrease the risk of that happening with
*  other models in the future? I think it does. I think we're actually, I'm very pleased with how
*  things have gone relative to how, you know, I feared that they might end, you know, it seems
*  like there is kind of a, I mean, just today, right? Last night at MIT, Sam Maltman kind of said,
*  and now there's been this like wave of Twitter messaging from OpenAI employees, that's like,
*  we're not training GPT-5. I think that's a very key part of the kind of plan that you're, you know,
*  describing that we do need some time to actually work these things out. So yeah, I agree. I view it
*  very differently, I think in a world where GPT-5 is currently training versus what they're saying
*  now, which is that it's not, I think that makes a huge difference to how you kind of understand the
*  like, the early release decision-making. I'm grateful that there is like some, you know,
*  restraint at the top of this trend, because, you know, it is so powerful that, you know, I do kind of,
*  it's not hard for me to imagine that it could really get entirely out of control.
*  Think about the mass adoption of this technology in different companies, right? If a mid-sized company
*  has some bad prompt injection exploits happen, that doesn't educate the market,
*  potentially as well as a bigger company having things like, I don't buy that Snapchat's My AI
*  is the only chat GPT bot that has talked about stuff that told the bot not to talk about,
*  right? But it is the one that's like highest profile. And so I think that does a good job
*  of also like educating the market of like, hey, anybody who's building anything that looks like
*  this now knows of that story and is protecting against it. Are you hearing things from people
*  about like the alpaca, you know, llama moment? And what do you advise people when they ask you like,
*  hey, this llama things out there, and I heard it's just as good as chat GPT. Like,
*  what's your response to that kind of thinking? I mean, I think one thing is, I always remind people
*  I'm not a lawyer, and you need to talk to a lawyer about like commercial use, or just general like
*  use of these different models in your business, not just like limited to llama and alpaca, like
*  I tell them that for everything. But I mean, I think if you like, look at the writing on the
*  wall, we're going to have powerful open source models as well in this large language model space.
*  And so, yeah, like there's, I think there's just an element of people getting comfortable with the
*  technology. And yeah, I guess like, I'm more afraid of mistakes made later than us learning
*  now. It's just my like general take. Yeah. But I would not advise somebody to go implement
*  something that's not commercially licensed into their core product. You know, let's imagine that
*  they were like, okay, cool, it's released. But it's still just the sort of pre-trained, totally
*  unrefined, you know, and therefore more unwieldy, more, you know, whatever alien like thing. I don't
*  have a mature framework for thinking about this yet, but it does seem like the one of the things
*  we talked about, you know, much earlier in the conversation around internal like task automation
*  versus a sort of element of your service is probably a really critical distinction there.
*  Because if you did have a llama and, you know, then it was commercially licensed and all that,
*  and you then like applied your, you know, 10,000 example instruction fine tuning,
*  and then you are like in control of how it's being used in the context of some task,
*  I would expect you'd probably get, you know, could get pretty good results and might be happy that
*  you did it. Whereas if you try to like take a shortcut to cheap chat GPT, and then like put
*  a chat bot on your website, that's based on llama, I would expect that you would be quickly embarrassed.
*  Definitely. I mean, yeah, like the risk profile of launching something poorly thought out externally
*  is like infinitely higher than like experimenting internally. I mean, a lot of teams who go back to
*  like, I talked to a lot of teams who did not have AI in their 2023 roadmap. When they asked me like,
*  where do I start? I really try to encourage them to think about the internal use cases, because like
*  the risk is just so much lower. If you don't have that experience already, like you're going to get
*  your feet wet. And you're going to learn really quickly that, like how these models work and what
*  their limitations are. Right. I think a good example would be like if somebody had launched a
*  chat bot on their website that goes in like, can summarize web pages, and it was 3.5,
*  they might think that it actually does that, but then, and they might offer that service to their
*  customers. But if they instead had started with like, okay, well, let's use internally first,
*  we're using GPT 3.5 to summarize web pages, they would eventually figure out or learn or just
*  like have the experience to say, oh, this actually isn't doing that. Right. And that's just a very,
*  I don't think most people are confused on that point, but like, this is like one example of like
*  when you're using something internally, you do have more of a tight feedback loop of like,
*  how's this actually working? Yeah, it's critical education. It all starts with education,
*  which is I think why you're in such an interesting spot right now, because you've been
*  doing a great job at educating so many people. Couple quick closing questions for you, just
*  cool tools that you would recommend to the audience that are not like the obvious chat GPT.
*  The number one thing I recommend to people is start using chat GPT with an automation tool,
*  like Zapier or make. It's fun. And B, I think that tends to be the big unlock for a lot of people
*  and actually starting to use stuff. I'm going to give a random shout out, which is super meme dot
*  AI, because we are using AI for like so many things that are like so serious. So like business
*  productivity oriented. And honestly, sometimes it's just really fun to use AI to make much
*  better memes. And like I've never been a person who's good at making memes before. And now I feel
*  like I can make ones that make me laugh at least. So I would definitely go check that out. Yeah,
*  that's cool. We made the art for this show with playground AI. And I mean, this would have been
*  completely impossible for me to do that previously. So I do love those kinds of things that just
*  unlock a totally new, just like, you know, capability for me as an individual.
*  Okay. Second one, you kind of alluded to this earlier as well, but hypothetical scenario,
*  a million people have a neurolink implant. Whenever that, however long that takes, we're at a million
*  implants. If you get one, you can control your device straight from your thoughts. So you could
*  transmit thoughts to text or thoughts to like UI control and be hands-free using a computer.
*  Would that be enough to have you interested in potentially getting one?
*  Oh, I would like put me on the short list for the early experiments. No, my husband is a doctor. So
*  he would read all, I trust him to read all of the stuff that I would need to think through to make
*  that decision. But then assuming it's a go, put me on the list.
*  You're in good company with that answer. That's a pretty polarizing question we found more so
*  than even the tools where people are more often just like, I don't know. I pretty much just use
*  chat tpt. If I can, what's your answer? I'm just curious. Oh, I would definitely be open to it. I
*  mean, I think this is, it's a question that's, I think it's revealing about how people think.
*  And I like asking it for that reason. I also think of course, it's like a way too specific
*  hypothetical. And the actual answer might be like, by the time that is mature, I already can kind
*  of do that with my apple glasses or whatever, just by twitching my eyes. And that's comfortable
*  enough that nobody needs to drill in the skull. So I'm not that confident that I'll end up wanting
*  to do that when it becomes available, but I would be definitely open to it in a narrow hypothetical
*  where it's like the world is like it is today, but you can have that. I have three kids and
*  have my hands full pretty often. So it's definitely, there's a lot of moments where I'm like,
*  you know, taking them out to walk through the narrow road or whatever. And I'm like, I wish
*  I could just jot this thought down before it totally escapes me. So honestly, for that alone,
*  I would be, and I might, you know, could also be a wearable perhaps in the future could be a
*  little less radical, but even with the, the implant, I would be open to it. I'm like, I
*  already had an advantage. I already wear glasses. So like, I could just throw it in the glasses.
*  If you listen to Robert Scoble, that's coming, the first version that's coming this year. I
*  don't know. There's, there's a couple of these like stealthy device, you know, AI things that
*  I really don't know much about, but could make a huge splash in the potentially like not too
*  distant future. Okay. Last one, just zooming out big picture as wide as you kind of can,
*  what are your biggest hopes for and fears for society as this AI wave kind of washes over
*  everything? My biggest hope is that we get to a place where we're frankly working less. And I put
*  an asterisk on that a little bit, because I think what's more exciting to me is that we get to a
*  world where work looks more like the type of work a lot of people do kind of on weekends or on
*  vacations. That's a casual, you're thinking about things when you feel inspired to think about
*  things, and you're able to solve like the bigger problems at hand, instead of kind of at least for
*  me, like the work week is just so busy and full of so many things all the time. And yeah, I think,
*  I think it sounds like pretty great to feel like you're on vacation all the time, but still able
*  to like, can I contribute and drive what you care about forward? Biggest fear, I think about this a
*  lot, which is a major like motivating factor for how I spend my time, is I think that we want to
*  have a future with diverse businesses, diverse perspectives. And if the way that things play out,
*  only 1% of people are actually adopting this technology, I think that's a worse future than
*  us having broader adoption and continuing to have like competition. And so, like what I'm more
*  afraid of is, yeah, centralized adoption, as opposed to democratized access. Cool. Well,
*  you are doing your part to try to avoid that future. And I really appreciate you taking the time to
*  join us today. Rachel Woods, thank you for being part of the cognitive revolution. Thanks for having
