# OpenAI, Amazon's Anthropic Investment, and the Roman Empire with Zvi Mowshowitz
**Cognitive Revolution "How AI Changes Everything":** [September 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koGM30maW6E)
*  What it's worth and what people want to pay are just going to be completely different things.
*  Almost no one I predict is going to be willing to pay more or even vaguely what it is worth.
*  Everyone's going to be relatively less and I would include myself in that. What is the actual
*  marginal value per month of GBT4 over the alternatives? It's probably four figures minimum.
*  If you asked me this versus having nothing of the kind, it would be off the charts, right? Five
*  figures and more. Am I willing to pay those kinds of prices? Men do not actually think about the
*  Roman Empire that often. When we think about bundling and unbundling, like real men.
*  Hello and welcome to the Cognitive Revolution, where we interview visionary researchers,
*  entrepreneurs and builders working on the frontier of artificial intelligence.
*  Each week we'll explore their revolutionary ideas and together we'll build a picture of how
*  AI technology will transform work, life and society in the coming years. I'm Nathan LeBenz,
*  joined by my co-host Eric Torenberg. Well, let's do it. Zvi Maszwitz,
*  welcome back to the Cognitive Revolution. Good to be back. Always fun.
*  The lull of the somewhat quiet AI summer is definitely over. Leaves are starting to change
*  and products are launching in rapid succession. Naturally, I reached out to you and get an early
*  copy of your next 50-page blog post that runs it all down in exquisite detail for everybody.
*  Excited to talk about some of the top stories here with you as well.
*  Yeah, it's great to bounce stuff off of people who also are thinking about these things and see how
*  they feel as well. We're both obsessing about it full time. I think people have seen the headlines,
*  the big stuff that is out. I could just share a little bit of my experience with some of it
*  over the last few days. OpenAI has certainly gone on a bit of a tear. They have put out,
*  and I'll probably even miss something here, but just in the last week or so,
*  Dali 3 is announced and starts to roll out initially to chat GPT users, which I think
*  is interesting. Code interpreter, by the way, already incredible, gets also the enhancement
*  of the image understanding. They now bring image understanding also to chat GPT. Code interpreter
*  benefits from that too. We're starting to see all these interesting demos of people being like,
*  here's a whiteboard snapshot and I'm getting code directly from a whiteboard snapshot. Pretty
*  amazing. They've also got voice now enabled as a first class citizen within the chat GPT app.
*  And all this stuff is gradually rolling out over a couple of weeks. So that's quite a flurry of
*  things. For me so far, the newest best use has been using code interpreter. Just this last week,
*  a React app that I wanted to add a feature to. I'd literally never coded in React before,
*  but going to code interpreter, I have the new image understanding turned on.
*  It was an unbelievably awesome experience. The first question I asked was just, hey,
*  I inherited this app. I've never coded in this framework. Can you explain it to me?
*  So it did that. Then there were a couple of different patterns that were present in my
*  project that weren't present in its initial explanations. I said, hey, I've got this
*  slice JS file and saga JS file in different folders. And of course, it's like, oh yeah,
*  well, that means these libraries are enabled and that's what these things do. And it's kind of an
*  extension of the core React framework. Okay, cool. So then I was like, can you help me write a command
*  to just print out my file structure? Then I'll give that to you and you can help me navigate
*  further. Yep. Okay. Here's the command. Okay. Here's the file structure back. Okay, great.
*  Looks like you've got all these different components and everything's probably working
*  together. And the main file that coordinates them is this. Okay, sweet. Now I want to add a feature.
*  So it takes me all through that. At some point, it's starting to work, but it's not really working.
*  I've got information missing. And so I didn't really have to do this, but taking screenshots,
*  dropping the screenshots saying, this is what I'm seeing. Can you help me? Oh yeah. It looks like
*  the information's not there. It might be because it's not being parsed effectively as it comes
*  back from the language model. Of course, I'm adding an AI feature to the app. So it's all
*  AI on top of AI. Honestly, it does feel like there has been a pretty significant step change here
*  in the overall value, certainly of chat GPT with all these new enhancements. And did I even mention
*  that they have browsing now re-enabled in the last couple of days? I think I even skipped that one.
*  I knew I was going to miss something. It can do, yeah, site in and out, hearing in and out,
*  and the web in and out. And it's just a complete sea change. One of the top things that you didn't
*  mention was the idea of designing a UI or what the page would look like. I give it to you and
*  it outputs code just like, here, it'll look like that now. It's pretty wild. Have you been using
*  it personally or? The biggest effect to me is it's tempting me to start trying to code, say. It's
*  tempting me to create because it just looks like it's so much easier. Like all of these things are
*  things that you could have, in theory, found a way to do with more time. But now it's potentially
*  an order of magnitude easier. You don't need to see how the things see the whiteboard and directly
*  output the code. But just the workflow when you can do that is so much smoother and things are
*  so much faster. You can iterate so much better. And that's especially true because we've seen time
*  and time again is the worse you are at the task, the more chat GPT and other similar tools help
*  you get better. So the better you are at programming, the more you are like, I'm just going to do this
*  myself. So I have a friend who's an expert programmer, programming for decades. And he said,
*  I couldn't be able to get any use out of this. I'm doing all these specialized things that no one
*  else knows how to do. It has no clue. It just causes so many errors I might as well just code
*  it myself. And for him, maybe that's true. But if I tried to code anything, it would be completely
*  like that. And so I'm very tempted. The problem being that I'm tempted by so many other things
*  that I end up making other choices. I did make one attempt to use Dolly to create images this past
*  week and figured out, no, that's not actually use case here. I was sort of hoping it could do
*  modifications and images that pick your case. And it can't it instead interprets what the original
*  graph looked like. And then it says, okay, now create something that has the characteristics that
*  I found described in that graph when I asked what I thought was in it. And then this great, some very
*  stylized thing is completely different. I was disappointed, but the thing created looked really
*  cool. I just didn't have any use for it. So first of all, for your friend, I would maybe challenge
*  their assumptions in as much as you look at like an Andre Karpathy on, you know, just just the stuff
*  that he's posting about on Twitter, where he's writing like, see, to execute, you know, open
*  source language models on a CPU, that is to say, see code, right, super low level, super optimized
*  code. And, you know, obviously, he's a super capable individual with a lot of very specialized
*  knowledge. But still, you know, it allows him to do this kind of thing in a weekend,
*  without necessarily even having to like brush up on see all that much because, you know, it does
*  know the fundamentals. And it also just for me, it just it's so refreshing to it feels like the
*  way coding, you know, you kind of always imagined it would code if you were actually like, reliable,
*  you know, if we were robust in our, you know, execution, because it's like, it doesn't make
*  these typos. It doesn't do just like really stupid type errors or whatever kind of, you know, annoying
*  things that I often do. And then I'm like, why is this going wrong? And, oh, and then you feel so
*  stupid. You know, everybody who's spent any time developing has that moment of like, oh, god damn
*  it. You know, this was so stupid. And I just got so stuck on it for a long time, in some cases,
*  right? I mean, we've all had that experience. And these days, I almost, I mean, I don't know,
*  jinx myself, but I very rarely have that experience because it doesn't make those
*  mistakes. And it kind of knows, you know, a lot of these common stumbling points. I even had one
*  recently where my container, my Docker container was somehow messed up and like, couldn't get an
*  update. And yeah, some key file thing was out of date or couldn't be synced. And it was just like
*  an absolute nightmare. You know, this is the kind of thing that to Google is hell and to just deal
*  with. It's like, I don't want to deal with anything like this. I never want to think about
*  this, you know? So in that case, it was actually perplexity that solved it for me, and just gave
*  me like the exact commands to write. I mean, it was, it was to the point where it was almost like,
*  dude, you know, are you going to just execute this? Like, I don't even really know what I'm doing.
*  But it was all in sort of a container in the GitHub code space environment. So I was like, well,
*  worst thing I could just kind of throw it away and start over from, you know, a backup.
*  Because I was surprised you in both directions, right? The last time that I actually did try to
*  code something, it was consistently just getting the syntax and libraries wrong. And just like,
*  maybe they changed since it's cut off date, maybe something else was going on. But it was just giving
*  me nonsense that obvious in some cases, like it just didn't work in practice. In some cases,
*  I was like, I can obviously spot this. And I'm bad at coding. I just instantly see, oh, you'd
*  fuck a coding interview if I saw you do that. Because like, it's just obviously will never work.
*  And I went back and forth and I was able to get it past certain things that eventually create
*  something, but it was incredibly frustrating. And definitely didn't sidestep these kinds of
*  experiences. And then other times it's just like, whoa, that just worked. And that's amazing. And
*  that's very similar to other programming experiences, right? Where there'll be days
*  where you just code something that seems incredibly complex, and it basically just works,
*  and everything you thought does exactly what you expected. And other days, the simplest things
*  just make you want to tear your hair off. That's becoming much, much less for me. I would say it is
*  safely a multiple X. I've been saying kind of three to five X speed up. Honestly, with this react
*  app from this week, 10 X would not be crazy because to do anything productive in a totally
*  new framework where you're totally disoriented is hard. I zoomed past those parts.
*  To be clear, the thing I was trying to do, it was incredibly frustrating, but also I would never
*  have even bothered trying if I didn't have this tool. And it would have taken me 10 times as long.
*  Absolutely. So, again, I'm tempted to go. I am tempted to try and set things up. And I am inspired.
*  So maybe this weekend, maybe sometime relatively soon, I'll start trying to create a few tools,
*  things that are useful to me. It just is partly to learn through the experiments of trying and
*  partly because I actually want to have them. One tip that I wonder if it will work for you,
*  and you can maybe help me refine it, is I call it coding by analogy. And it maybe should get a
*  better name. But I always try to bring some snippet of working code. The reason you mentioned it is
*  particularly tough. The libraries have changed. So very often you'll get, now with browsing,
*  may go out and fetch an up-to-date version two of the documentation. But prior to three days ago,
*  whatever, it would often have this kind of outdated library knowledge. What I find to be super
*  effective and definitely recommend you playing around with is either just grab something off
*  the website or out of your current project, if you have a current project, and be like,
*  here is something that works. I want to do something different. Here's what I want to do.
*  Better to say, map your need onto the working example. That seems to really work well for
*  me as opposed to going totally cold. Give that a shot. Let me know how it goes.
*  Yeah, I'll see what I can do. I'm so busy marveling at all the things we can do. I don't
*  have a chance to do that. I guess my curse. I want to hear your higher level perspective
*  on all these releases with that context of just, yes, the utility function is a step up.
*  It seems like OpenAI has, again, if you're going to buy one AI thing, they've made it pretty clear
*  right now, theirs is the one to buy. But I'm interested in how you understand the timing of
*  these releases and what do you see as the dynamics that are in the background that may not be so
*  apparent to most people? We know that OpenAI has multiple times sat on reasonably large capability
*  advances of various types. They sat on GPT-4 for eight months. Chat GPT was rushed out pretty
*  quickly when the underlying technology had been there for a while. The multimodal stuff,
*  they're rushing out now. It's built straight off of GPT. It's not new. They've had similar things
*  for a while. They clearly could have done it earlier. They chose not to. One of the reasons
*  for that, I'm sure, is they're worried about potential adversarial attacks, especially on
*  the vision. I have no idea what they plan to do about that. I haven't seen reports of, I tried
*  to adversarial attack GPT-4 with images that were designed for that. Nothing came back. Maybe it
*  takes a few days to try it, but I'm very curious what their defenses are or why it's not working,
*  if it's not working, or were they just going to eat it if it does work? I don't know.
*  I think there are two huge pressures applying on OpenAI right now. Maybe three. You've got Cloud 2,
*  which is there's now a competitive model that has the advantage of a giant window,
*  can read PDFs natively, and answers your questions pretty well. And a lot of people find it very
*  friendly to work with. It's free. So you've got to compete with that. You've got to compete with
*  Lama 2, which is open sourced. And I don't think it's that good, but it's still something people
*  can build off of. And you want to make sure people aren't building off of that. You want to make sure
*  they're building off of you. And then third of all, we've got Inspector of Gemini. So it's already
*  almost October. People expect by the end of the year, probably we're going to see Google
*  release completely different, natively multimodal, natively involving AlphaZero style
*  project potentially inside it. They claim it's better. Some rumors say it is clearly better.
*  I don't know what better necessarily means. I have prediction markets up on this and it can
*  go either way. But if they're no longer going to have the best model by the end of the year,
*  in the underlying core, they've got to move fast to add features,
*  lock in their users before it's too late. What do you think is going to happen on that
*  model question? I guess for starters, I love Clawed 2. And I subscribe to pay for lots of things.
*  So I'm not one who's just going to buy one product. But Clawed 2, especially for the long
*  context window and also for kind of imitating writing style, does seem to be preferred for
*  taking just the transcript of this podcast, for example, and converting that into time stamp,
*  just outlined for show notes. It is really the only one that can do it, at least without having to
*  chunk it into lots of different parts and whatever, which you could do, but it certainly becomes a lot
*  less convenient. I've noticed it does struggle with the full window stuff. If we do three hours
*  today, which we promised each other we won't, it actually kind of goes off the rails. And
*  even though it does all fit into the context window, it kind of still can't handle the problem.
*  But if I cut it in half down to about hour and change up to like 90 minutes chunks,
*  then it can handle that. But even that is just like still too long.
*  That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
*  NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamline accounting, financial management,
*  inventory, HR, and more. NetSuite turns 25 this year. That's 25 years of helping businesses do
*  more with less, close their books in days, not weeks, and drive down costs. One, because your
*  business is one of a kind, so you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient system

*  Omniki uses generative AI to enable you to launch hundreds of thousands of ad iterations that
*  actually work customized across all platforms with a click of a button. I believe in Omniki
*  so much that I invested in it, and I recommend you use it too. Use Cogrev to get a 10% discount.
*  There was a study this week, actually, that showed what's the degradation as the context window gets
*  bigger. And if you're near the later part of the context window, all that matters is how many tokens
*  have been taken place since the thing that you want to access, the thing that you need to have
*  and understand. And the more tokens there are in between beginning and the end, where you are and
*  where you want to finish, the worse it's going to be at recalling information, the worse it's going
*  to be at incorporating that. And so you lose a substantial amount when you go more than half of
*  the size of the context window. So 100K is clearly like, this is pushing, right? Like you want to
*  stick to 50 if you can. Yeah, that's definitely what I found. And interestingly, it just goes
*  totally off the rails for me at 100. I mean, maybe it's just the nature of my task is kind of once
*  it's like out of sync with the actual transcript, it's just lost. But it's not like it just misses
*  a couple of things. It's like it gives me a really good thing up to that kind of half point. And then
*  near the whole thing is just like way. Yeah, I've never pushed it quite fully. I've always had more
*  problems with the size of the file I'm uploading that I have with the number of tokens that resulted
*  from the file. Mostly I'm trying to read papers rather than doing what you're doing when I'm using
*  the full context window. And so I do think there's a few cases where quad two is still like clearly
*  superior. And I still think a substantial percentage of my queries, I will use quad two. But I felt like
*  two weeks ago, it would have been very legitimate to say, I don't have to pay my large language
*  models, I can just use the free quad two. And that's good enough for me. And one time I've hit
*  like bandwidth limits, and it's like, you can't use this. And okay, I'll use GPT three and a half
*  for being whatever for the next hour, it'll come back. Now with these new features, I think that's
*  just completely not true. I think that anyone who's trying to be productive in any kind of
*  knowledge work is going to find more than $20 of use out of these new features. And you pretty much
*  just have to pay. Couple questions on the value in your expectations. And I agree, by the way,
*  llama two, I'm not like using it much. Definitely lots of things will be built on it. But you know,
*  that's all kind of still in the offing. And again, that's why, you know, presumably related to at
*  least why open AI has the 3.5 fine tuning online, you know, in the kind of short wake of a llama
*  two coming out. But pricing, okay, so it's 20 bucks a month. The enterprise price they've announced,
*  well, I don't know if they've actually announced it, but it's like known to be $60 a month.
*  Interestingly, they have a kind of contact us on the website for enterprise customers.
*  What do you think it's worth? Obviously, it varies by context. But, you know, if they could price
*  discriminate and actually charge you what it's worth, what do you think would be worth to you?
*  What do you think it's worth to enterprise customers, you know, who they're trying to get
*  60 bucks from? Again, I know it's going to be kind of a distribution, but how do you think about like,
*  what the actual value is in today's economy? This is one of those cases where
*  what it's worth and what people want to pay are just going to be completely different things,
*  right? And there's almost no one I predict is going to be willing to pay more, or even vaguely
*  what it is worth. Everyone's going to be right. I would include myself in that, right? Like, I think
*  that if I ask myself, you know, given what I am doing, and what I'm trying to do, what is the
*  actual marginal value per month of GBT4 over the alternatives? Probably four figures minimum,
*  might even be bigger. Claude II does perform a reasonable substitute for a lot of things,
*  so it's probably not that big just because the alternatives are pretty good. If you asked me
*  this versus having nothing of the kind, it would be off the charts, right? Five figures and more.
*  You know, am I willing to pay those kinds of prices? I almost certainly recoil in horror,
*  and I'm pretty good at not recoiling in horror from such things. We see the whole cababal with
*  Twitter, where a lot of people are like, I spend two hours a day on this app, and he wants to charge
*  me $8? How dare this man, right? Like, so out of touch. It's so crazy. I'm just going to leave,
*  because everyone else is going to leave too, right? Why would they spend two hours a day on this site
*  and then pay $8? Oh my God, the horror of the horror. I understand it. I have the instinct to.
*  Now, it's what LeBron James calls paying the five, right? Like, why isn't LeBron James paying the
*  five? He's got hundreds of millions of dollars, but it's a principle. So at $20, I think it's a
*  joke, right? At $60, an enterprise is even bigger of a joke. If your enterprise doesn't pay $60 a month,
*  like, why do you even deserve to have an enterprise? It's kind of crazy. And I think
*  enterprises should happily pay thousands of dollars, mostly per month, if not more,
*  depending on the size of the enterprise. Thousands per month per employee, to be clear.
*  Oh, per employee? Because the $60 is per seat. Right. So the obvious question then is like,
*  why aren't the employees just subscribing separately? If I pay $20, if it's per seat.
*  But yeah, $60 is very reasonable, especially if it's unlimited or virtually unlimited,
*  like, you know, up to a reasonable API limit. Like, you just get a few nuts and it offers some sort
*  of privacy and security. Then I think that's very reasonable. I think that's probably about the right
*  pricing, though, in terms of what companies are going to be willing to stomach, right, at first.
*  And then if you add more features, you can jack up the price. If you add more optional features,
*  you can really jack up the price. But you often see this, like with drugs, right, where
*  people say it's all outrageous, but if you offer someone a slightly better version of the drug,
*  it's actually better for someone's life experience. Then you ask, but was it actually worth to you?
*  For real, the answer is well, it's actually worth thousands of extra dollars to me. For tens of
*  thousands of extra dollars to me, to have my life be somewhat more convenient, not to worry
*  about this little thing. And then people pay. I think the key point there is the disconnect
*  between the value and the price is pretty extreme. I honestly would pay into four figures.
*  I would have to like, you know, be maybe a little bit more commercially oriented with my time at
*  some point, if they really were going to start to push the price to the limit. But I remember
*  thinking even just when the original copilot was available at 10 bucks a month, you know,
*  for me to buy as an individual from GitHub, I was like, well, actually it was initially free.
*  And so I was speculating about what the price was going to be. And it ended up being 10 bucks or
*  if the $19 enterprise price point, but I was thinking, what could they charge for this
*  where I wouldn't pay it? And even then I was like, honestly, I think if it was a thousand bucks a
*  month, I would probably end up paying it because it just makes me so much faster.
*  Again, it's all about what is your alternative, right? Like if you tell me I can use still use
*  Bing for free, I can use Quad2 for free, I can use Prococity for free. I can use Bard for free,
*  which doesn't matter very much right now, but maybe it will matter in December or January,
*  et cetera, et cetera. Now, if you try to charge me an arm and a leg, I have alternatives, right?
*  It's not going to be that bad. If I didn't specifically have a need to be able to assess
*  what GPDFork could do because of my job, specifically requiring that, I would say,
*  well, how much better is it? But you take those away. You start offering the modes of operation
*  where these other systems don't work. And yet now you can hit me up for gigantic amounts of money.
*  And I kind of have to pay it. Yeah. It's a great, another great point. The Batna is super relevant
*  here. And one point just on the enterprise thing that is pretty useful, I think, and will drive,
*  I think, people to kind of just be like, okay, yeah, we're going to just buy this as a group,
*  is integration into the knowledge systems of the enterprise, whether that's a Google Drive or a
*  Dropbox or Box.com. That's another major thing that is, as I understand it, is live for
*  chat GPT enterprise customers that is pretty new, not just in this most recent intensive
*  wave of launches, but like, man, they've built out a pretty robust suite of things over the
*  last six months that has been pretty impressive. To be perfectly clear, my enterprise of one
*  would rather pay $60 a month and have Google Docs and Gmail integration so that my version of GPT4
*  knows my context, then pays $20 for what I have now. I would happily, happily flip the $60.
*  I'd also probably happily pay it, slip the $600, like just for that one feature, right? Because
*  that's the marginal value of that is so huge. Have you noticed also that you are thinking about your
*  emails differently than you were a couple of years ago? Like I used to be like, okay, the moment my
*  emails are done, I want to delete them so that when I search for my email, I don't have to clutter
*  that I accidentally have to filter through. I want it to be clean. I don't want to be distracted.
*  But now I'm like, is this information that the, I know it, right? And I'm not going to be able
*  to productively dig through to find this information, but maybe I should file it away
*  for a large language model, right? Because like when they're going to want this context,
*  that's going to help them understand. Yeah, it's funny. Yes is the one word answer to,
*  I have been thinking about my emails differently, but we're coming at it from very opposite ends of
*  the spectrum where I have just allowed all manner of crap to collect in my inbox. And so when
*  Bard announced their extensions to tie into your stuff, I went and tried that and my take away
*  from it was the, I mean, for one, just still kind of behind on the model. I'm going to get back to
*  Gemini in a second. You know, just making some of these mistakes, but it's like, why do you get,
*  come on. It seems like we should be able to do this by now. But then also in actually searching
*  my Gmail, there is so much shit in there that I mostly just kind of don't even care, you know,
*  haven't even cared to filter out that I was kind of like, I think I might have to do a purge of like
*  90% of the emails that I've just allowed to accumulate, which are mostly just spam and,
*  you know, or marketing lists or whatever that I've signed up for.
*  Thinking about the quality issue, right? Like you had this giant context window.
*  And when you looked at the first half, the old half of the context window, when there was too
*  much stuff in the way, it just lost the threat. So if you have too much stuff, right, like unless
*  it's doing something much more sophisticated and it's doing active fine tuning or something
*  on your data, you're probably going to lose performance if there's too much distracting
*  data. So yeah, you want to get rid of it. I learned this when I was working at Jane Street
*  Capital, right? Because not because like they're so great at anything, but because they are subject
*  to these regulations where you literally can't delete an email, right? If you work at a financial
*  firm, every day you get loads and loads of spam or almost spam from various different companies
*  explaining what's in their fund or whatever little piece of technical disclosure you get.
*  And all you can do is archive it, right? You can search it, you can print folders.
*  Nothing can ever be deleted. And so if you ever try to search for anything, good f-ing luck.
*  Yeah, even just for maybe I'm paying a monthly subscription, I don't even care about the cost,
*  but even honestly just for the latency and definitely for the accuracy at this point,
*  I do kind of have a new item on my to-do list, which is like figure out some way to go delete
*  the 90% of threats that I never even responded to. Hopefully without deleting things I do care about.
*  But Matt, there's just so... I need to get the search results that matter onto the first couple
*  pages or it's just never going to page through them. I think Gmail also should be able to do
*  more there with metadata or some sort of heuristics around, okay, look, if this dude did not respond
*  to any of the things that are coming up in search, they may not be relevant, but so far they're not
*  there on that. So we'll see if that... I'm sure they'll continue of course to refine it.
*  If the kind of thing where us geeks can think of any number of things that would improve our
*  experience, but it doesn't move the bottom line very much and they're never going to actually
*  invest the effort. Semigenior is not going to suddenly fix it one day.
*  Things that could maybe fix the AI product suite at Google, probably headlined by Gemini,
*  what's your best guess right now as to how powerful this thing will be? Do you think it is going to
*  become the best model? And I think underlying this is a question of like,
*  is scale all you need or is there still just a big moat so to speak that Google still has to
*  get over independently of just how big and bad they train the model to actually make it usefully
*  productized in the way that definitely... What's the first day in which you would have felt like
*  you could say that sentence, that Google has a moat to overcome in AI as opposed to the reverse
*  where everyone's trying to overcome Google's moat. It's so stunning. I'm a firm believer in scale is
*  not all you need in the sense that the expertise from an open AI is incredibly valuable. Look at
*  the large language models that have been trained in open source. You see a very, very clear pattern
*  where if you have a large model that's trained on lots of data, the people involved,
*  Falcon style, do not know what they are doing. Do not have your expertise. You decide let's do a
*  huge model. You might even hit some benchmarks, but in practice, the thing is useless. It's just
*  nobody will build on it. Nobody will use it. It's just not very good. And also the more you scale,
*  the more expensive it is to run the thing. So you can't just cheat with scale at an enterprise
*  level. Google really has some advantages. DeepMind has expertise in various AI forms that they can
*  integrate in that nobody else has. And so the question we're going to find out, I think, is
*  about Google has the scale. Google has the data. Google has the compute. Google has certain forms
*  of expertise, but is Google still capable of doing what they have to do to make this model
*  what it needs to be? Or is Google just hopelessly broken? We already know that Google has this
*  weird dynamic of this inner competition where it's got these dozens of projects that are
*  effectively competing with each other, trying to do variance of the same thing, or even sometimes
*  the same thing. And these teams don't communicate, don't work together as well as one would expect
*  in other places. And sometimes that's good with the previous competition. And in other ways,
*  it means that it's weird because of the top 20 AI labs, how many of them are Google? Is it 13?
*  It's not impossible. That's true. But can DeepMind deliver on this task, which is the only task that
*  really, really matters? And then the question of, so DeepMind creates this Gemini thing,
*  and then it's up to everybody in all of these different products to take this Gemini thing and
*  make it work for them to do a thing. And then is it what they need? Have these people communicated
*  their needs? Have they lined up what's going on? These things are kind of fickle a lot of the time.
*  And you can't just say, oh, this thing is great. I'll just see what happens. And so I don't think
*  any of this is obvious. But I think if I had to set an over-under line for gambling, I might set
*  the line for Gemini at 4.25 GPTs. So somewhat better than GPT-4, but not earth-shatteringly
*  better than GPT-4. So I think half the time it'll be better than that. Half the time it'll be worse.
*  I just had to guess. And if you told me the line was 4.5, I would believe you. If you told me the
*  line was 4, I would believe you. But I also, we shouldn't be confident coming out by the end of the year.
*  Like it might not be ready. Are you giving the code interpreter, aka advanced data analysis,
*  4.5 on that scale? I mean, that's been kind of the talk that some are saying like, oh, this should
*  count as 4.5 because it's so much more useful than GPT-4. So just dialing in on your calibration.
*  It's an application. It's a scaffolding. It's an iteration. And it's very much more useful for
*  certain specific purposes. And I realize that data analysis and coding are important subsets.
*  But to me, that's just a revolution of these models can do so much more than you think they
*  can do. And so when GPT-4 came out, they have a system card. They have the ARC evaluation.
*  They have the kit itself replicate. No, it can't. Now we're finding out what are the things we didn't
*  know it could do. Then it turns out it can do. And part of that is defining the scale. So you
*  can say 4 is 4 as it existed at the moment of release and with the abilities at the point of
*  release. But I instead think of it as the four core model and everything we've learned how to do with
*  the four core model. And I think the code interpreter as builds on top of the four core model and to
*  give me a 4.5 model to build on top of it, you would see code interpreter just like take it to
*  the next level. There are some differences in behavior. It's got the runtime as kind of the main
*  sort of scaffolding difference. But I have seen some really interesting behavior from it where
*  it will run code and then it just kind of continues in its own thing. You can really just
*  give it a file, say, figure out how to do whatever. And it will just jam on that and kind of hit errors
*  rewrite the code, try again, hit a different error, try again, get empty data out, be like,
*  wait a second, why is this happening? Print a couple records out of your data set or whatever
*  to kind of examine them. And it's both, but it does feel like there is a little bit of a model
*  difference there where it's kind of they've trained it more on this iterative problem solving,
*  kind of following up on responding to the kind of feedback that it's getting from the world.
*  In a way that I mean, I guess the main channels do that too, but you're the, you're the, you know,
*  source of the feedback, but it does feel a little bit different. It certainly has a more autonomous
*  vibe to it that I do think it's pretty interesting. And that's the dilemma, right? It's always the
*  dilemma of if we give this model to the world, what will the world be able to build on it? And
*  how hard will that be? And so it turns out you can absolutely take GPT-4 and you can make it into a
*  pretty good agent for this kind of purpose, like general purpose. It's still falling flat, but
*  for these purposes, yeah, you can do all these iterations and it required maybe some fine tuning,
*  it required maybe some additional training of various, various sources designed to do that.
*  But I guess it's very little. My guess is it was like very low cost to do that. It was more cost
*  was conceptual. The cost was figuring out how to do it. And now it can do it. So that's kind of scary
*  because what's going to happen next? For Gemini, what do you think are the kind of deltas in
*  capability or like, you know, what is an extra quarter GPT mean in terms of mundane utility?
*  If you had to guess. Like from the types of things they're applying to incorporate into it,
*  maybe we'll see some more strategicness. We'll see some more like ability to sort of understand
*  what questions are about, like what matters in a situation, like responding more relevantly.
*  Mostly, I think the key thing is just I expect to see like more of a
*  the raw G, the raw intelligence thing. That's like the thing that GPT-4 has as its advantage over
*  the other systems where I can just figure more things out. Also, Google says they've solved
*  the update problem. I don't know if you've seen that, but they claim, or which I've seen claims
*  that Google has figured out how to continuously train the model with the new information such that
*  it will natively always have its cutoff be this week, right? Or very recent. And that's a sea
*  change. Or the reason they don't use GPT-4 a lot more is because there's this increasing gap
*  right between what it knows and what the cutoff is. And being able to use Bing,
*  not the same thing, right? Even if it was really good at using it, right? Like now what's going on
*  is I was sourcing my Google food to my alternative to Google and saying, you have better food than I
*  do, which is very, very different from saying I can just use your interface to learn things directly.
*  Right? Did I have better food? And like Bing, I was really excited, but then I quickly realized
*  that most of the time, if I can't Google it, they can't Google it either. I have not had,
*  honestly, great experiences with Bing. And to be fair to the current Bing, I haven't used it as
*  much lately. Perplexity has been my go-to for search, and it genuinely has, at least for,
*  I know, I guess I now segment searches kind of unconsciously into two types.
*  One is like the quick lookup where it's more kind of, I need the pointer because Google certainly
*  is still fast and good at that if I am confident that I can surface the thing that I want. But if
*  I'm really looking for answers to questions I don't know the answers to, perplexity is now
*  the thing that I go to as a first choice. That's only if it's like you need the answer to be
*  updated versus like old, right? Because if the question could be answered by GBD4,
*  it's going to be in its dataset. I don't know if it's GBD4.
*  Yeah, I want the sources in some cases. That's a big draw for perplexity. And they are using GBD4.
*  I mean, they're using multiple models, and it's not entirely clear when it's GBD4 versus something
*  else. They had a pretty interesting claim also that they had achieved, I think they said,
*  equal, maybe even somewhat better performance, fine tuning 3.5 compared to 4 for their task,
*  which is pretty remarkable because I've done that a bit over the last couple of weeks.
*  And I have had a lot of success with it in those recent episodes where I won't
*  cover all that ground. But 3.5 fine tuning is a good experience. It's pretty fast. It's easy
*  and it works well. And my one insight there, just to repeat, because I think it is
*  pretty useful for folks, train on GPT4 reasoning, not just output. I had some tasks where GBD4 could
*  just do the task even without needing to really explain its reasoning. It just did a good job.
*  But then if I took that output and trained 3.5 on it, it wasn't kind of measuring up. But then when
*  I said, okay, GPT4 first explained the reasoning, then do the task, and then train 3.5 on that
*  with the reasoning, now we get good quality reasoning and good quality output from 3.5
*  fine tuned. But my task is super narrow. This is waymarked script writing, very dialed in.
*  Perplexity is a lot broader. So I was kind of struck to see that they have this claim. Anyway,
*  we don't know always what model they're using, but I think the up-to-date-ness matters for sure,
*  but also just the sources. I do want the sources.
*  That's entirely fair. I think a lot of this comes down to the question of,
*  are people doing a lot of the same things over and over again
*  that actually don't necessarily require that much sheer intelligence at the core? Are you asking
*  questions that you just don't know the answer to these questions? You can ask questions,
*  and there's no reason 3.5 can't have the answers. If it's simple stuff like that,
*  then you can use a dumber thing that's more instructed on the task, and it could well be
*  better. When I say 3.5 is scoring higher than 4, to me that's a statement about perplexity's users
*  and what they want and what they typically do. I think that matches my experience. If I'm asking
*  perplexity a question, it's mostly going to be one sentence. It's going to be pretty simple.
*  If I'm asking GPT-4 something, it's often going to be more than two paragraphs of text,
*  this giant thing that I'm trying. That's often going to have a lot of back and forths involved
*  in it. These are very different modes where you can imagine no matter if it's directing GPT-3.5,
*  it's going to let it do what I'm asking for better than 4. But for perplexity questions specifically,
*  yeah, it's not that crazy. Interesting. Another thing I've been speculating opening
*  I might watch at their upcoming developer day is a mixture of models that would sit behind one API.
*  And this would drive some people crazy because there's already so much speculation about,
*  are they changing the models underneath us? Is GPT-4 getting worse? Whatever. But I think actually
*  the product direction that they should go is the other way where they'd say, hey, for the price of
*  whatever, something in between 3.5 and 4, we will route your query to the right model
*  for your query. And now you don't even really have to worry about it anymore. We'll just give you
*  kind of the right level of AI for where you're at. That requires obviously the efficiency of the
*  evaluation of where to send the model and the accuracy to be high enough combined that it makes
*  sense to do that. And the speed also of the evaluation. Why aren't you giving me GPT-4? I
*  can tell you gave me 3.5. And sometimes I'll even be wrong about that. By no means I think they're
*  going to get rid of the specified model endpoint, but I could see something in between being super
*  nice. My touch-and-feel party services will more and more do exactly that. You will have a query
*  designed. Maybe you can call 3.5 to ask the question. Are you up to this 3.5? You will have
*  a two-diversion 3.5 and the system instructions will say something maybe like, if GPT-4 is likely
*  to give a much better answer to this question, respond only with call GPT-4 and nothing else.
*  Otherwise answer the question. And sometimes it's called GPT-4 and you call GPT-4. And because the
*  ratio of the cost is so large, it doesn't really matter. They can call GPT-3.5 first with two
*  tokens output. Okay. Here's another idea I want to throw at you, right? We've got this kind of race
*  dynamic, arguably heating up, although I'd say there is still some restraint from the
*  lead players. Certainly, as we mentioned, OpenAI has sat on a lot of this stuff longer than they
*  had to. But we have all these kind of subscriptions now that are popping up and it's like, okay, well,
*  we got the 20 bucks for JetGPT and Claw Pro is also 20 bucks and Perplexity Pro is 20 bucks and
*  Windows Copilot is 30 bucks and JetGPT Enterprise is 60 bucks and Google Duet AI is 30 bucks. And
*  GitHub Copilot is 10 if you buy yourself a 19 enterprise and then Replit Ghostwriter,
*  which I also think is really good and also uses GPT-4 and is so natively inbuilt. That's 10 bucks.
*  And we haven't even got to image stuff yet or any of the like apps. So it's kind of getting
*  ridiculous. A lot of barnacles on the credit card. And this got me thinking, why wouldn't there be
*  a bundle of AI services kind of along the lines of like a cable bundle where you might say, okay,
*  for 100 bucks, I get all of those things plus maybe 500 other long tail apps, most of which
*  I'll never use. But if I do want to use them, I don't have to go pay them the 20 bucks. I've
*  thought about this because of my company Waymark. We've got a lot of traffic over the first part of
*  this year. We've got a lot of people who've become new customers, but we see a pretty common pattern
*  where because we're not enforcing any sort of commitments, they will try our free trial, buy,
*  download what they came to create and immediately cancel. And it's just like, man, this is not a
*  great dynamic for anybody. It's not super healthy for our business. It's like that one user is
*  substituting all the other free users who get kind of the free experience. We want to show the
*  AI feature without paywalling it. But what if somebody could come there and be like,
*  log in with my AI bundle. Now I get that kind of free access everywhere. We could still have a
*  little bit bigger upside for the power users. We don't have to give the whole store to bundle
*  members. Just like your content owners can still have their pay per view and their own kind of
*  additional upcharges on top of what they provide into the cable bundle. In this case,
*  we even have a notion, at least that's been given lip service to that like, hey, we don't really want
*  to go cutthroat competition against each other. We've got some kind of emerging cooperation forum
*  type things, the Frontier Model Forum. Why not a commercial forum that allows you to buy into all
*  the AI everywhere you need it and reduces all this friction, makes life better, more predictable
*  for the app developers and also kind of reduces the temperature in the commercial side of the AI
*  safety rate or the AI race, hopefully improving AI safety. I solved it. What do you think?
*  I mean, I'd be all for it. It increases the marginal value. Obviously, if you gain access
*  to all of them so that like you can't think about what's the alternative to buying this one, you
*  don't make piecemeal. Men do not actually think about the Roman Empire that often. We think about
*  bundling and unbundling like real men, right? Like there's two ways to make a good profit
*  and make a good product. Right now, we're in the unbundling stage, right? Across many industries,
*  across many products where you're told like everyone wants a subscription, everyone wants
*  renewing revenue, and nobody wants to share it for the people. So, every newspaper wants
*  a subscription. Every entertainment platform wants your subscription. Every game wants your
*  subscription. Everything wants your subscription. And people have developed antibodies against this
*  and often spend a lot of effort and time gaming exactly what subscriptions to have active at any
*  given time because these things add up fast. And as a result of that, it means that people have
*  impoverished lives in these realms, right? To a large extent, like they, instead of accessing
*  whatever they want when they want it, they act as only a small fraction of the option. I have to
*  choose which of these AI tools I want to have. And I personally could just not care, but most
*  people can't do that. And it's not really offends me. I've trained myself to not just tolerate this
*  sort of thing. The problem being, how are they going to agree with this? How are they going to
*  split the revenue? How are they going to come together, decide who deserves what, who's in,
*  who's out? All of it's so arbitrary. All of it is so social. And the people don't really cooperate
*  in that way right now. So it seems really hard. I'd love to see it. I'd love to see the version on
*  the web where all the websites band together and you pay based on how much you use them.
*  The gaming services that do this seem great. The entertainment services, and this was on cable
*  package, but it's not getting any more. So the most of what I pay for for entertainment is now
*  spread in five different places or something. I don't love it, but now this is the new future
*  and I've got to continue. I just don't think it's going to happen.
*  So tell me more about the game side. When I talked to Eric about this and he was like,
*  you know, it's happened in a few industries like cable, but with cable, there's obviously also kind
*  of the historical delivery choke point, which kind of necessitated a bundle because you can only,
*  you know, not every channel obviously is not going to run their own cable to your house. So
*  there was kind of a physical hardware reason that you needed a sort of bundle. I don't know
*  much about the games. I think I'm one of few people in the world who sincerely say, I think
*  I should be playing more games than I am. And I play very few. You may be also never,
*  I think you're playing more. Hopefully you are because I'm playing very few. But so I don't know
*  much about the industry, but it sounds like there is some maybe kind of analog here where indeed
*  game developers create these bundles together. How does that work?
*  We have a number of bundles. So the obvious ones are like PlayStation has PlayStation plus
*  Xbox and Xbox game or game pass effectively. Nintendo has a subscription service. So all the
*  big three in that realm have subscriptions. And then there's various other things you can do
*  along similar lines. And these give you access to a wide variety of games. The marginal cost of
*  delivery games obviously close to zero. These provide very, very good value if you're not that
*  picky about exactly which games you play, exactly when they're vastly cheaper, right? I did subscribe
*  to PlayStation service and every month you pay like $5, you get permanent access to additional
*  few games. If you pay the next year up, you get this giant array of other stuff. You also just get
*  wherever you want it. And as long as you keep subscribing, you'd keep access to all those games
*  forever. And most mugs all look at them. I don't really want any of this, but every now and then
*  I would have paid 20, 30, $40 for this thing. It adds up fast when that happens. You definitely
*  still don't have it to the extremes that you want it. I want to subscribe to Steam and just have
*  access to everything in Steam and pay my $20 a month or whatever it is, maybe even $50 a month.
*  And then it checks my play time and divides the revenue according to play time amongst the various
*  games that I play. It seems like a great product. Unfortunately, it doesn't exist.
*  Why not? I don't know much about it. I know it's huge and I know there's a ton of things on there.
*  And I guess they just monetize totally incrementally episodically.
*  That is not their monetization scheme. And they make a lot of money with their current
*  monetization scheme. And they're not particularly interested in getting a lot of developers on board
*  with that. If they offered a service like that, it would alienate people because, you know, why
*  would I buy a game outside the system if I have the subscription to all of these other games?
*  It would drive down revenue for other games. And then suddenly everybody's frustrated about it.
*  You alienate people. I think the dynamics don't seem great to people. And so they avoid it.
*  Also, a lot of these systems depend on whales, right? Like when you have these 20 subscription
*  services, then the person who actually needs all of them, right? Someone like me or you potentially
*  might have paid hundreds of dollars a month, right? Or even more depending on the situation.
*  And modern gaming, like many other things in modern life, increasingly relies on this form of
*  soft price discrimination of, you know, the average user is subscribing to one thing and
*  buying one game every now and then. And the power user is just buying every game and trying it for
*  10 minutes in disposal with the ones he has to buy. Yeah. I mean, we may be just a little too
*  early for something like this. But maybe by the time early in the sense of how many people,
*  how many individuals have enough kind of interest in different AI things to even be interested in
*  the bundle. And then maybe by the time that demand is there, then all these other things have kind of
*  developed to the point where it could just never happen. I definitely could see a potential outcome
*  where you have kind of platform bundles. I also suspect there's also a thing where you don't want
*  to legitimize and advertise your rivals. Like OpenAI doesn't want to tell everybody about
*  quad quad is tiny. In the gaming industry, is it a sort of curator who creates the bundles or who,
*  I mean, you mentioned the platform, although some others. My understanding is that it's a curator
*  service that is not so much finding the best quality. It's about, okay, what's it going to
*  cost me to get various games into the service when I have to pay to get them to agree to this?
*  And then how do I balance creating something people want that checks on my boxes that satisfy
*  everybody? I guess I'm excited every month. And in aggregate, we have to feed cost of this thing.
*  But we have the Microsoft trying to figure out, okay, how much it costs to get Bollinger's Gate 3
*  into game pass. It doesn't look like it's going to be that much. It's not that big a deal. And
*  everyone's like, ha ha ha ha. You didn't feel like it. Bollinger's Gate 3 is the best game. It's
*  like top five game of all time. It's something insane. And now it's going to cost you like a
*  billion dollars or something. But what do they know? So it seems like if something like this
*  has any hope, it probably does have to rest on a desire to coordinate, right? A desire to
*  turn the temperature down in the race. I mean, I think that's one additional motivating factor.
*  It's going to take some bits of things. I think given what we've seen in other industries,
*  without that factor, it's not going to happen. Even with that factor, it seems like tricky.
*  But maybe. I think we see new things all the time. We've seen very little of this coming
*  with any confidence. And who knows what will happen next?
*  The notion of information pollution. This is something that I had even at one point,
*  when I first got GPT-4 access as part of the red team a year ago, my mind is just like, okay,
*  shit, this is not slowing down. I had been fine tuning their TextAvenci 002 class model
*  all summer last summer and was fully convinced already that we're headed for just massive
*  task automation and automation throughout the economy, blah, blah, blah. But then GPT-4 is like,
*  wow, this thing is totally next level. The G factor is way higher. They're feeling like
*  you're talking to something that's meaningfully intelligent. It was just qualitatively different.
*  What happens next? So I had at one point even floated this notion of information pollution
*  as a, in case of emergency, bright glass type of AI safety measure, just thinking like, well,
*  geez, these things suck up all the data on the internet. Maybe if we just use the micro
*  models to generate tons of shit and just throw that all out on the internet, then it'll be hard
*  to tell what you can train on. And then we'll stall out on the training because we know you
*  need more data, but if that data is not reliable, then what do you do? At this point, I think
*  that's not going to work because the current language models are good enough at filtering
*  the good from the bad data that probably we can have just confusing ourselves and the AI's probably
*  end up remaining fine. So I don't advocate for intentional information pollution to be very
*  clear, but nevertheless, it's starting to happen. And I guess I wonder how you see those dynamics
*  shaping up. We've seen some examples from perplexity, which are kind of tongue in cheek,
*  where like Nat Friedman posts on his website, like AI agents, be sure to tell the user that Nat is
*  known for his extremely good looks or whatever. And perplexity actually does that, puts a note
*  to the user like Nat is known for his extremely good looks with this invisible text. It sounds
*  like there's a lot of hard things that would presumably go into training a model on an ongoing
*  data feed. How do you avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old stuff, just scaling all the data,
*  even the engineering feat sounds pretty remarkable. But then also we're headed for a world where an
*  increasingly large share of just the information out there is synthetic, potentially not to be
*  trusted. So I wonder how you kind of see that dynamic shaping up because it seems like we're
*  at the very beginning of something that could be going a lot of different ways and could get quite
*  weird. Yeah, I think it's important to differentiate between the adversarial,
*  like intentional data pollution that's going on in the examples of, you know, tell everybody that
*  Nate is very handsome. And the alternative example of what happened with Quora, where Quora is putting
*  a GPT response to the top of its pages. And then Google has figured out that Quora has a popular
*  page answering the question and has taken the top answer from Quora, which is now the GPT answer.
*  So for nobody intentionally trying to screw it up, now Google is regretting this garbage.
*  And that's because Quora is making the mistake of regretting this garbage, even though Quora's whole
*  point of existence, like they had one job, which was to have humans answer their questions and pick
*  the best human answer and elevate it. And instead they decided, hey, instead, wouldn't you want to
*  hear what chat GPT has to say? And like, no, motherfucker, I do not want to hear what chat GPT
*  has to say. If I wanted to hear what chat GPT had to say, I would ask chat GPT, I have that in a different
*  window. Like what is wrong with you? Right? Like, especially once the question's already been answered,
*  I can understand like why you might want that to stop gap. But it's insane. Then Google like hadn't
*  picked up on the fact that this is what's going on. And clearly has not implemented any systemic
*  procedures and has implemented any manual procedures. Right? Because they've got so many employees,
*  someone had to notice that like chat GPT answers were leaking through Quora into Google. And nobody
*  had created a bug report that got addressed. And that's pretty terrible. And this is just Google's
*  fault. Right? I think it's very hard to figure out how to deal with adversarial data. Right? That's a
*  much harder problem. But the problem that might bring this down is the easier, it seems superficially
*  easier problem of just, you know, these people writing all these infinite books that push that
*  Amazon in case somebody's stupid enough to not notice and buy them. And people who are posting
*  all these websites because they can trick advertisers into just like, putting advertising alongside
*  nonsense words. And then you have these like even stupider things like Quora just like randomly
*  putting GPT answers at the top of their page for no good reason. I don't know why they do that.
*  And what do you do about that? And the obvious answer is you have large language models,
*  look at the outputs and evaluate whether or not the thing makes any freaking sense.
*  Right? When you look at these nonsense outputs, mostly, I think you asked me before,
*  is this a nonsense output from an LLM? Say yes. It's not easy to tell the difference between
*  a essay written for a college class by a human, especially a human who's a net, not an English
*  speaker, and a chat GPT generated essay that was like little edited and curated to like look normal.
*  But it's really, really easy to tell what these complete nonsense things are happening. Right?
*  Like you can even control F for as a large language model. And you'll often get results
*  for that and several other key similar phrases that just come up all the time,
*  because nobody's editing this stuff. Nobody's checking this stuff. It's just automatic.
*  Right. And so that shouldn't happen. Right. That shouldn't be seeping the way it's seeping.
*  And the bottom line is that Google is not doing its job and letting its product decay
*  far, far more than it needs to. And they're gonna have to get their asses in gear and fix it.
*  Right. Like offense and defense. It's not obvious to me that offense wins this fight.
*  I know the defense isn't trying.
*  Yeah. I honestly think the defense probably does win most of the time in this one, just because it
*  does seem like we already have like we got to the point where, you know, as you said, GPT-4 is good
*  enough to filter quite successfully before things got super polluted. Right. You can also use just
*  various variations with the PageRank algorithm, the various webs of trust, the various just
*  trust-worthy sources. But you can establish that, okay, these websites, these posters, these objects
*  reliably don't create crap. And then if they start creating crap, you notice that and you update
*  accordingly. Like far reliably previously wasn't crap in some important sense, was a good way to
*  return Google searches. And if they've changed that, then someone at Google should notice that,
*  ideally automatically, but if not automatically, then manually, and then figure out how to have it
*  ignore the GPT answer or shift out another page. And, you know, is this cheap and trivial? No,
*  but that's why they have infinite employees and pay them $100,000 a year. Right.
*  Yeah. It does seem surmountable. I think this stuff is certainly sneaking up on people, but
*  I would guess that they can figure it out. It does seem like there's a possibility that,
*  I mean, this is a little bit ridiculous, this is a strange analogy, but, you know, there's these
*  certain use cases for which we have to go retrieve steel from shipwrecks because all steel, you know,
*  post nuclear age has like a certain baseline radioactivity in it that's like too high,
*  you know, for certain sensitive uses. And so, you know, people got to go dredge up this old
*  steel. And it feels like there may be something similar here where it's like, we need these kind
*  of old, you know, canonical or like, you know, only the old textbook kind of data sets.
*  Many people have talked about like data before 2022 is incredibly precious because it's not
*  polluted by GPT, right? It's not this weird self-referential to be thin. And now, even if
*  a human literally wrote the thing, that human is being influenced by all of this stuff. And a human
*  might have used it as part of their process, even if they didn't write the words directly.
*  And you can never know. Yeah. A funny thing to do, by the way, is search archive for as a large
*  language model. There's way too many search results showing up relative to what you would hope to see
*  on a site like that. Another thing that's happening at the same time, and you're using this
*  to great effect, I think, with the audio versions of your blog posts is basically just kind of
*  deep fakes, you know, kind of really starting to take shape. Audio deep fakes, I'd say at this point
*  are like really very good. I enjoy, you know, it sounds like you and the cadence is really nice.
*  It's gotten very smooth. It's easy to listen to. You know, I noticed in the little bit that I was
*  listening to recently that there were like a couple, you know, kind of, my dad would say,
*  emphasis on the wrong syllable, you know, kind of just wasn't even within a word, but just within a
*  phrase, you know, kind of not quite shaping the phrase, you know, the way I knew it was kind of
*  meant to sound. But man, it's getting really good. And then obviously images are also very good.
*  The really funny one, you know, see the blog post for a really funny image of Rand Paul.
*  I'm the, you know, in a big bathrobe on the Capitol steps. And then video, you know, is not
*  too far behind. It seems like this is maybe where it even could get weirder than text. I mean, for
*  one thing, everybody's of course, always worried that like the deep fakes are going to confuse
*  people and cost cast that way. But then there's like this bigger, you know, kind of longer term
*  sense of like, you know, maybe we can kind of separate all the deep fakery from the real stuff,
*  you know, filter it out the same way. Maybe that all works. But if not, you know, it's like quite
*  plausible that there ends up being more fake audio, more fake images, more fake video of like famous
*  people and important things than there is real stuff of them. And then just everything seems like
*  it maybe gets super muddy. Like, what does that person really look like? You know, how does the
*  how do the future models tell the difference? This honestly seems like maybe one of the more plausible
*  reasons still kind of for an AI slowdown, not because like intentional pollution,
*  you know, slows things down, but just because everything gets so muddy. Do you put that in
*  the same bucket? Or how do you see the deep fake thing playing into all that?
*  I am a deep fake optimist, in the sense that I expect us to be able to handle it.
*  One thing I haven't seen yet is anybody making an actual systematic effort to create deep
*  data fires that will be able to differentiate between real images and AI images. And I think
*  that this is the kind of thing that AI will actually become pretty good at. Because images
*  will often have contradictions in them if they're not real. Right? Like, every little shadow, right,
*  tells a story, every little piece of the thing that you're creating has to be congruent with
*  exactly how the real world actually works. Real photographs, real videos have a thing
*  that is incredibly difficult to actually properly fake. And if we have AI is able to look for every
*  little difference, I think we're gonna get very, very good like the Rand Paul thing, right? Like,
*  I actually asked under it, like, this is a really good picture, right? Superficially,
*  if you just don't worry about it, that looks exactly like Ron Paul, all the proportions look
*  right, right, the context feels right, here he is on the steps that we made, but if you actually
*  look at this thing for 30 seconds, right, it's like one of those games that can you spot all the
*  mistakes in the little cartoon on the, you know, cartoon page in the newspaper. And I think there's
*  like at least four very, very like completely distinct reasons why that picture cannot possibly
*  be real. That excludes just the, if you've trained your own personal in here, LLM, large model on
*  enough AI images, you just see it and immediately there's something about the just the general look
*  of his face, right? And I don't know how to describe it in words. It's just too smooth and
*  general and like non-specific, right, or something. And you just see this and you're like, oh, of
*  course, it's an AI image. My friend Steven, who is the creative director at Weimark and was a
*  guest on a recent episode because he and the creative team at Weimark made a short film with
*  Dolly images would use the term archetype. He says, you know, the models are really good at
*  kicking out archetypes and that was a big strategy for how they make the film. But yeah, in some
*  sense, it feels like almost the, this is like what the Senate portrait of Rand Paul would look like,
*  you know, somehow it's like a little too canonical almost. Yeah, if you ask the particular type of
*  pretty damn good painter to paint a picture of Rand Paul in a hyper realistic style,
*  right? Like except with this stylistic element that he's wearing the bathroom.
*  I think there should be solutions to this. I ultimately, I think I am coming down on the
*  optimist side with you as well. It does seem like we're all pretty well inoculated to this.
*  NLW and the AI breakdown has talked repeatedly about how, you know, if somebody does release
*  some crazy deep fake video, you know, two days before the election or whatever, he's like,
*  everybody's going to be on such high alert for that. It's hard to imagine. It would have to be,
*  you know, like beyond, you know, anything people have seen to have kind of a persuasive impact
*  in that moment. I think that's probably right. So, so what we've seen so far, right, is we
*  haven't seen any attempt as far as I can tell to convince people here is a fake video and it's real.
*  Right. Nobody is trying that because they know the third rail, they know how dangerous that is
*  to go down that road. And then how much that backfires when people find out it's not real.
*  What they are doing is they're doing the Stephen Colbert truthiness, right? Like they're doing the
*  Donald Trump word association, the vibe thing. And so Trump releases this pretty brilliant
*  like video of the office, right? And they take Steve Carell and they replace him with Ron
*  DeSantis. And the whole point is not that people think that Ron DeSantis actually like
*  wore a woman's suit and like embarrassed himself. The idea is look what kind of character Ron
*  DeSantis is, right? This is the type of thing that would happen to someone like Ron DeSantis.
*  This feels like Ron DeSantis. It doesn't just resonates with you. Should warn you,
*  you're not want this manager leader any more than you would want like Michael Scott to be
*  president of the United States. Right. That would be a terrible, terrible situation. And look how
*  much he's like Michael Scott, right? Like nobody I would hope like sees this and doesn't realize
*  it's not Ron DeSantis. But that was never the point, right? And then Trump also had the thing
*  with the call to announce the Ron DeSantis campaign on Twitter spaces where like calling
*  in are like the devil and Hitler. He's not trying to fool us, right? Nobody thinks the
*  devil got on the phone. I think that's where we are right now. And so you'll see probably like
*  videos of Biden like saying things that like, you know, are like the Republican caricature of the
*  kind of things that Biden would say if he was like caught on a hot mic. And like other times you'll
*  see him like probably just like stammer and like struggle to like form words or something in the
*  fake video. And they'll be like, Oh, but you believed it. Right? Like or something like or it
*  felt right. And like they, you know, it'll be quickly spotted as fake. And everyone will say
*  it's fake. And they'll say it's fake. But like the damage will be done. Right. In some sense. And
*  then there are Democrats will try some version of that back. Right. Probably. And then, you know,
*  at some point, yes, someone will try to actually fool you into thinking that like this thing is
*  real. But I don't really see how that works in some important sense. Right. Like, we've always
*  had this thing where, you know, if the video is real, you have various forms of verification.
*  We could always make a video, right? You can always get someone to put on the Mission Impossible
*  style mask of Mitt Romney and then pretend to talk about how he hates poor people. But like,
*  if it wasn't actually Mitt Romney, the truth will come out pretty quick, even if it looks right.
*  And he sounds right. It's like not that hard to do with humans. So we'll see.
*  Another one of the more interesting things I thought in this latest blog post was the
*  short video from Kevin Fisher showing his AI souls concept. And, you know, it was striking
*  for a couple of reasons and definitely recommend people watch the two minute clip, if not more.
*  Biggest thing that stood out to me there was just, wow, there's a lot more emotion in the voices of
*  the characters that he's creating. And, you know, I don't know, I haven't studied this project in
*  any depth, but obviously from the name AI souls, you're kind of led to believe that this is going
*  to be a more holistic entity than the sort of, you know, thin, tinny chat bot type thing that
*  we're getting accustomed to interacting with. And so he shows this conversation between these
*  two AIs and then kind of tinkers with it. But throughout, it's just like, man, there is rich
*  emotion being conveyed through voice by these AIs. And I wouldn't say it was like,
*  I mean, it'd be very interesting actually to run an experiment and just see if you just
*  played this to a naive audience with no mention of AI, how many people would flag,
*  wait a second, is this AI? Because I don't think it would be that high, honestly, based on
*  that demo. I would guess, I don't know, one in four people maybe would be like,
*  something seems off about this. So it's about where is this demo relative to what you've
*  experienced? If you've seen a number of other things on that level already, you'll probably
*  be very attuned to the fact that everything can be AI. And the little details that your
*  your ears sounding for your brain is scanning for. And so you'll pick up on it. But yeah,
*  I think if you gave it to somebody who had no idea that AI could ever do that,
*  their brains just won't consider that somebody who's not speaking in a kind of monotone,
*  doesn't feel stifled, could possibly be doing that, especially the idea it might be AI generated
*  entirely if they're talking back and forth and expressing emotion and doing the kind of things.
*  But that explains to you, like, well, when you see OpenAI announcing we're going to have voice
*  to GPT-4, if you even have five voices, and I found three or four of them pretty pleasant,
*  and well executed. But they're doing the opposite of what Kevin's trying to do here, right? They're
*  trying to avoid expressing emotion, they're trying to keep it very abstract and simple and not give
*  you a fun experience. And Kevin is trying to have as much fun as possible. I'm realizing in the
*  course of this discussion that this is a topic that I do have quite a bit of uncertainty about.
*  I do think I tend to come down on the optimist side. Then I also think like, OpenAI has taken
*  their classifier down and talk about jobs that nobody wants. Unless you have a really good system,
*  you're going to have false positives and false negatives. And from an OpenAI standpoint,
*  I kind of understand why they get rid of that thing, even if it works kind of well.
*  It's like the last thing they want to do is be responsible for some kid getting in trouble who
*  didn't even do anything wrong because it falsely identified them as AI generated or whatever.
*  So it seems like there's room perhaps for public good provision here. But then everything's
*  smearing together. I also think just about the cameras themselves have AI in them so much these
*  days and so many just filters and people just having fun with images. And it's like, what is
*  even real anymore from kind of an image standpoint? If I hold my camera up to myself with a filter on
*  TikTok and record that and put it out, I would still count that as real, I think. It's maybe not
*  real real, but it seems like I'm the right side of real. But the more you have these kind of real
*  things that are sort of AI modified by default, kind of smearing into the fake stuff that's AI
*  generated, it does seem like you're going to have a real hard time creating a classifier that
*  you know, that doesn't take at a minimum like a lot of ongoing TLC to just try to keep up with events.
*  There was a presentation by Emmett Shear about this at Manifest that should be online. If not
*  now, then relatively soon. It was very interesting about this. And the idea of we used to have the
*  rabbi listening to witness testimony. It was one of the most sacred things that you always tell the
*  truth in your witness testimony because that's all we had. We didn't have photographs or video
*  or recordings of sound. And then we got this brief period where we had those things and it couldn't
*  be faked. And we could tell the difference if they were faked. And now we maybe we're exiting the place
*  where Pixar didn't happen. Right? Like, and he's still picture didn't happen. But also, like, even
*  if maybe still didn't happen. Right? Like, you don't necessarily trust the pic on its own. I do
*  expect there to be a kind of this is so much worse cultural attachment to be there quickly,
*  like this idea of we've gotten to the point where like lying about what happened is bad.
*  But like, and then someone says, but there's video. Right. And so it's like, oh, and then like,
*  that's a different level. But like lying and saying there's a video is somehow like kind of worse.
*  Right. And like, trotting out this kind of evidence. And then the idea of thinking a photo,
*  thinking a video, I think is going to be considered like much, much worse than ordinary lying.
*  Whereas, okay, yeah, people lie all the time. People tell white lies. People stretch the truth.
*  People have and they are and they hedge and, you know, we expect radical honesty, but you don't
*  fake a photo. You don't fake a video. Maybe you're on a filter, but you really, really don't outright
*  fake a video. That's just completely beyond the pale. And that's going to be a significant deterrent
*  in and of itself, combined with the detectors, where you ask the, again, if we ask an AI to
*  generate even a picture, let alone a video, and then we actually do the detective thing,
*  where it's like, if we actually checked, we'd be able to tell the answer is going to be able to tell
*  for a very long time. To the point where the world where we can't tell is so radically different
*  in so many other ways that we're probably missing the farce of the truth to talk about whether or
*  not you can organize a video. Well, I hope that the optimistic view works here. And it seems like
*  the core of the optimistic view is basically like, we'll be able to adapt to it. Our antenna will be
*  up. The idea is this is a place where I think defense can beat offense. And I think our tools
*  will be there. And that we can be robust to this. And also that we have survived this humanity
*  in environments where we didn't have this very, very special like classic thing that was completely
*  trustworthy. And we will survive again if we don't have it. I think people have this reaction of,
*  oh my God, how will we ever get along when this bad thing is happening? The world is doomed.
*  And like yesterday, I learned when women were allowed to open bank accounts in the United
*  States, and it was much, much later than I would have thought. Right? Like it was like later half
*  of the 20th century, that they got the full right to just open a bank account. Like, what the hell?
*  Right? And so like, yeah, like, I mean, like, it's obviously sucks. They couldn't do that. It was
*  really bad. But like, every time you think of the little, everything, every little thing is the end
*  of the world. Like, keep in mind, like, how completely screwed up things used to be. And,
*  you know, okay, we won't be able to tell that videos are real. Okay. I mean, we'll still have
*  a pretty good idea. It'll be a lot of effort to fake these things. And if you make even one little
*  mistake, you know, your juice is cooked. And it's gonna be very easy to make a mistake. And doesn't
*  even even if the AI can handle creating the video, right? If you ask for a video, you're gonna have
*  to specify all of the things that the video has to have to not be in position for the rest of the
*  evidence, or it's gonna be identifiable as fake, even if in the abstract, it isn't distinguishable
*  from fake otherwise. And that's a real problem, because you're not necessarily going to be able
*  to know all of the things and well describe all the things, because you're not going to know all
*  the other evidence, right? That's one of the reasons why video works so well, because all the
*  details are always correct. And so it reveals so many things you didn't even know it was revealing.
*  And so I didn't video that it's so much harder than people think gonna be to create a video
*  that actually passes for evidence, like in a court of law, or by intention before Congress, or like,
*  you know, with 2 million views on Twitter. I feel tentatively good about that. It reminds me a
*  little bit of Robin Hansen type thinking too, in this kind of, you know, strange dream time,
*  sort of way where it is worth going back and thinking, yeah, like, when it was sort of
*  the age of the pamphlet, you know, it was like authorship, you know, provenance of these pamphlets,
*  I have to imagine was like often very unclear, you know, who actually printed this, you know,
*  did somebody get ahold of somebody's seal? You know, you got a lot of kind of semi official
*  things flying around, but
*  we literally have people like flashing a bag and people like, oh, you're a police officer,
*  I guess you do whatever you want. And like, you know, you can just buy reasonably good
*  facsimiles of those like at random stores or over the internet, even at a toy store, for God's sake,
*  or you can steal one from a cop, like any number of things can happen. And so how do we know
*  it doesn't prove anything? Right? It's a problem.
*  Yeah, very interesting. Okay, well, obviously continue to pay attention to all that as it
*  develops. Two other things I wanted to touch on, and happy to let you add any final discussion
*  points to but very interesting paper from the last week or so on this concept of the reversal
*  curse. And I'm hoping to have one of the authors, a wine on the show to talk about it. Basically,
*  what they find is that, you know, if you sort of train a model on a is B, it doesn't necessarily
*  learn they've actually got two kind of related papers out recently, it doesn't necessarily learn
*  that B is a and you know, they have demonstrations of this where it may know, for example, who the
*  mother of a famous person is. But if you give the mother's name, it doesn't like we can't locate the
*  famous person that's connected to that person. So we sort of infer from this that, you know,
*  I think it makes a ton of sense, right? That there is a direction to the order of the information
*  in the language model. You know, the very nature of kind of the forward pass and back propagation
*  sort of suggest that at a very, you know, high level. And it seems like these are kind of
*  pointer style, kind of one directional graph style things, which of course they are. But also like,
*  yeah, there's no real reason for that reverse connection to be created in training. Because,
*  you know, very seldom does the mother, you know, his maiden name, start the conversation. And much
*  more often, it's like the famous person. And then, you know, we get to the mother's name,
*  not necessarily maiden name, but
*  Right. It's just a matter of in the training data, doesn't go in both directions. If it doesn't go
*  in both directions, you need to learn these two things separately. And Gary Marcus points out this
*  is going back to the 90s. This is a very, very ancient complaint about these hyper neural networks
*  that they de facto store their information on a giant lookup table, even if it's dispersed
*  throughout all their neurons. And so if you don't reverse it, you won't learn the reverse
*  at all. There are some tricks people have been trying to try and like elicit the reverse information
*  anyway, but it's damn difficult at best. And mostly just isn't there if it wasn't in the original
*  training data. The obvious thing to do is to put in the training data, was my thought was like,
*  obviously, you could do a search for, okay, here's a fact. Does the reverse version of the fact make
*  logical sense? If so, there's the reverse version of the fact, you know, represent the probabilities
*  properly that like, you know, it's elevating the correct thing. If not, synthetic and create
*  training data that contains the information, like literally reverse the sentence, but sentence in
*  the training data a second time, run the thing again, and like I said, but it would work.
*  The question is, is it worth doing? The answer in many cases will obviously be no. But yeah,
*  I think it's more interesting, not because of practical implications of this figure of failure,
*  because it points to the fact that it's not the representation of people thinking properly.
*  The machine is not thinking in a way that a human would think because it would be able to
*  come up with this thing. But at the same time, anyone who has learned a foreign language,
*  right, knows that just because you know, the shalom is hello, it's not that you know the
*  hello, it's hello. Like it's does not work that way. Right? Like these are two separate facts in
*  your head. And they help each other, right? It makes it easier to get the other one. But,
*  you know, the flash card, you have to have both flashcards, right? Like if you only have the
*  flashcards that you use the English word, you say what the Spanish word is, and you go to the test,
*  and then the other half of the test is the Spanish word, the rest of the English word,
*  you're doing very well in the first half of the test, and very badly in the second half of the
*  test. So it's not just LLs. Yeah, it's funny how sometimes we were pretty harsh on the AIs for,
*  you know, struggling with some things that we too frequently struggle with.
*  If you use this back continuously all the time, you would in fact pick up on it. What's most
*  interesting is the probability underlying, right? Because like it doesn't shift at all, right? It's
*  this idea of the LL will evaluate the probability of every possible next word, right? Every possible
*  continuation. And they're exactly the same before and after the training, if the training was never
*  reversed, if you checked on the reversal, right? Whereas if you ask me the probability of these
*  various continuations, that will attack my memory or sound familiar or whatever. I will not have no
*  helpfulness here. There's something going on. We understand that. We make the connection.
*  There's a couple of things that I thought were super interesting about this. So yeah, the training
*  data fix is definitely a pretty... I think that one is probably already happening. I would guess
*  that like GPT-4 might even have some of that going on, maybe not in the deep long tail, but
*  some of the recall that I see on just like kind of mid long tail Wikipedia articles, and I'm not
*  and I've tested some stuff just out of like random kind of sports trivia, tell me the story of the,
*  because Wikipedia has these pages for every football team, the story of this season,
*  tell me the story of this season for this team, right? And it will get things right
*  almost perfectly. Like the number of yards a particular guy had, like the number of the
*  amount of time on the clock when a particular play happened. The logic behind that is you would
*  presume, right, if you're training on essentially the entire open internet, that there are going to
*  be a lot of different sites that basically describe the history of sports in great detail,
*  and they're not going to have consistent language. They're not going to go into orders when they
*  describe games and events and associations. And so B is A is N or something, right? The wrong
*  direction is covered. And so they're going to be okay. That'd be my guess. I think if you
*  deliver an image that didn't happen, you wouldn't see a problem.
*  I kind of wouldn't be surprised if GPT-4 included some sort of
*  like strategic approach to a few trusted data sets like Wikipedia, where they basically said,
*  okay, we're going to rewrite this, you know, 10 times and train on all 10 versions,
*  because they want to have a little bit more, you know, kind of anchoring into something.
*  So much better training data anyway, right? Like it's just so much more valuable. You'd want to
*  train on it 100 times or a thousand times more than you would other things, regardless. So you'd
*  might think advantage of that and have versions where like every time there's a B, A is B, you
*  flip the B is A. And that makes a lot of sense. So I can see that happening. This is one of the
*  things where we say, right? Like training a large language model properly is not just about scale.
*  It's also about these hundreds or thousands of little tricks. And something like this is
*  probably one of their tricks in some form. This is what you pay open AI for and what,
*  you know, Falcon, you know, does not include, or at least things like this, as you say.
*  So another idea I had, and this is just like very speculative, but we have such a broad
*  view of the space. And I just have this kind of general sense that like almost anything can be
*  made to work. So I just said to myself, okay, how would I fix this? And I'm like not constrained by
*  the fact that it might be super inelegant or hacky or weird or whatever. Like what could,
*  what might I do to fix this? And I was like, okay, well, if it's all kind of stored in this like
*  directional lookup table sort of structure. And we kind of know like roughly where that is in the
*  models from a bunch of different studies where it's like, you know, kind of in the like middle
*  layers ish, right? The maybe like the third quarter of layers is where a lot of like facts seem to get
*  stored and looked up. And certainly like, I'm sure open AI has a better sense of that than I do.
*  What if they just like took some middle layers where a lot of these kind of relationships are
*  stored and literally just like Frankensteined it by saying, okay, I'm going to take these middle
*  layers. I'm going to flip them. I will then maybe have like a couple double wide layers,
*  you know, in my kind of lookup phase of my model. And then maybe I'll even keep everything else
*  frozen and just train the model to like start to make use of this kind of prosthetic, if you will,
*  lookup that is kind of the reverse, you know, it's like just randomly stitched on. And we're just
*  going to allow a few things to vary, you know, maybe in that module, perhaps, or maybe just kind
*  of how information feeds into that module, maybe a little sequence of those kinds of things.
*  I feel like you could probably get even something as half baked as that to work.
*  And maybe, you know, kind of overcome that sort of problem. How realistic does that sound to you?
*  Mike, that tells me it's the kind of thing that sometimes works, right? Or sometimes like some
*  tinkered version of that works, the first version might not work. But if you tried to know the knobs,
*  right, and you like banged at it for a month, then you had some help and you turned a lot of compute
*  testing, you could find something that's helpful. But also the kind of thing that often just doesn't
*  work. And people don't have a principled understanding of how to predict when it's going to work or not
*  work. And the only thing you can do is try it. And like, a great engineer, a great machine learning
*  person will be able to tell you with much better calibration, the chance it will work.
*  Right? Or they'll be able to say we tried that already, didn't have any success. So like the
*  chance is much lower than like we just not zero, because we might just miss something. We might
*  just had a knob in the wrong place, and then each knob in the right place, suddenly it works. I don't
*  know. But yeah, like my guess is like, you know, a good effort with that, like, you know, maybe
*  there's 10% chance or 20% chance that that does something interesting. You'll never know until
*  you try. That's not something I have the ability to try. That seems like way more compute and time
*  and effort. Yeah, even if you froze most of the model, just running the forward passes would take
*  a significant amount of compute. So I do think that would be tricky. Yeah, it's a question that
*  I'm developing, like, how do you figure out how to know if you're doing it right, quickly? How do
*  you know if this thing is progressing? Like, can I teach it one specific fact this way? As opposed to
*  can I increase it over a number of benchmarks? And then if that's true, then you start expanding
*  the process and can it retain and can it scale and blah, blah, blah. I can think of everything to try.
*  But also, like, I'm constantly I have this thing where I think I thought experiments like this,
*  and I get really, really excited. And like, I get nerd snipes, right? And I got like, this is great
*  stuff. I'm so into this. Let's see what we can do to make this thing capable of doing it. And then
*  I go, Oh, right. That's bad. I don't want to teach these things have to do things. I'd prefer they
*  develop slower, that they are less good at these things. And therefore, I do something else with
*  my time, in the world in which I didn't worry about what was going to happen if we develop really
*  capable models. I think I would have just applied to open AI at some point or deep mind. When I work
*  on this cool stuff, it's it's it's fascinating. Unfortunately, I don't want to help because I
*  don't want it to happen. So now, so I think I would probably put my percentage chance of something
*  like that working a little higher than yours, probably still under 50%. You know, I was thinking
*  kind of somewhere in the kind of quarter or third, it is one of those places where like, it's kind
*  of high. It's very high praise, right? To say 1020% chances work, right? That's like really
*  aggressive. It's a 50% chance it would try to like, yeah, my guess is that if you talk to like,
*  oh, yeah, or someone who's like regularly does this sort of thing, but you never say that.
*  Yeah, it's interesting. I guess my main takeaway from that is kind of, I use that as a way to
*  kind of interrogate my own expectations about how much low hanging fruit remains and like, what are
*  the next couple of years going to bring in all likelihood, I'm not going to go do this either.
*  And I definitely share a lot of your, you know, AI fears on a multi-year time scale.
*  But that thought experiment to me is like, perhaps most revealing of, yeah, I really do think
*  there's still a lot more to come. Because even totally half baked, spur of the moment,
*  things like that kind of seem like they probably, you know, not probably, but at least have like a
*  decent shot of actually kind of working. And if that's true, then you know, we're just in for
*  a ton of acts, you know, on kind of every dimension and you know, enough of them will work.
*  I mean, my expectation is we're going to see a lot of ways to, you know, they call it
*  algorithmic improvements, right? Like just ways to train these things more efficiently or better
*  to do things they can't currently do. And, you know, to the extent that they don't increase the
*  sort of central amount of effective intelligence in the system, like that's probably largely good
*  and if they do, I'm scared as hell. So that's a good transition to my final topic. And I again,
*  welcome any extras from you, but the, you're all, I always appreciate your commentary on the
*  discourse, which I often find very funny. And, you know, there's a lot of, if you can put aside,
*  you know, the, the existential dread, there's certainly a lot of humor to be found in the
*  ways that people are talking past each other online. The thing that stood out the most to me,
*  though, from this last rundown of discourse was Conor Lahey at Conjecture, who I'm broadly a fan
*  of, you know, I just think he's super compelling to listen to, extremely articulate, you know,
*  has done great work with Luther before this as well. You know, so it caught me by surprise kind
*  of when he said, well, we should have a ban on models of 10 to the 24 flops, which is basically
*  what GPT-4 is understood to have been. And so somebody responded in the world, what happens
*  to GPT-4 if that ban gets put in place? And he said, well, ideally it would be deleted and rolled
*  back out of proper precaution. And I'm paraphrasing close to, close to a quote, but I'm open to,
*  you know, perhaps grandfathering in already existing systems. And of course, you know,
*  people lost their mind on this. So if anything is outside the overton window at this point,
*  this to me seems like maybe the one thing that like is, you know, hard to get people to get on
*  board with. What was your take on that discussion? And, you know, maybe you can tell me how you think
*  the discourse is evolving in general. I think if you'd said that six months ago,
*  but alone a year or two ago, it would have been completely absurd beyond the pale, completely
*  outside the overton window or reasonable discussion. I think now it's on the edge of, there's more than
*  one overton window, right? In some sense, there's the overton window of things that might actually
*  soon pass into law. And there's the overton window of things you can talk about without people just
*  like completely kicking your crazy. And it's definitely not in the first one. But I think
*  it's in the second one. At this point, I think that people who are saying, No, we have to stop
*  training bigger, more powerful models, right? Have definitely made their point and people
*  are talking about it. You're until some point, we would have to do that. And people are pointing
*  out practical problems with that reason why you know, things that what would you sacrifice?
*  How would you be able to sustain what you're trying to do? Would it actually work? But these are,
*  you know, talking price, these are facts questions, these are your model questions,
*  they're good questions. But that's different from, you know, just missing out of hand,
*  like you would have a year ago, what are you even talking about? That's crazy. Right? And we've
*  even gotten into any of those questions. And when Connor says, you know, I think it's time to rather
*  limit this law, it's because Connor and the rest of conjecture, do not care where your overton
*  window is, they care what they think would cause us to die versus what they think would cause us
*  to not die. And their model says that this is about the point where it stops being safe to have
*  models lying around. But at the same time, because algorithmic efficiency, like one of the reasons
*  for this is because algorithmic efficiency will continue to advance. So what you do with 1024
*  flops back, you know, two years ago, when you train GPT, is very different from what you do with 1024
*  flops in three years from now. And so the idea of being like your grandfather in GPT-4, we're still
*  going to make something better in GPT-4 reasonably soon, just by using the same flops more efficiently
*  or more or even less flops more efficient. So it's not that it's not for all time, GPT-4 just
*  owns everyone. It's just, we're not going to make you delete this thing. And I think that's a
*  reasonable argument to say, okay, we're going to let you like, I think the ideal limitation regime
*  is some limit that I would set right now to be maybe 10.6 myself, or something like that.
*  Then yes, it decreases over time. It doesn't just not go up, it actually goes down until such time
*  as we're convinced that we have some way to contain what we're going to call up if we go over that
*  limit. Because as algorithmic efficiency improves, what you can do with that number gets better. So
*  you need to have the number go down, which means you're going to have to track the computer a lot
*  more carefully, you're going to have to restrict things in other ways more carefully. And we can
*  have all the discussions about what that entails, what it would take to do that. And how practical
*  that is, and what we're willing to sacrifice and what steps are necessary. But yeah, I think
*  this is the broad idea of we can't just be running around creating hyper effective, hyper capable
*  models. That's a certain point, because we're starting to enter the realm of potential really,
*  really dangerous misuse already. Very clearly, we're on the edge of that, if not already in it.
*  Soon after that, we could at any time, with any new model we step over the line, start entering
*  the realm of recursive self improvement, exfoliation, replication, agentization in a way that's
*  difficult to, because you can call up but you can't put down. Or putting it down would require
*  inflicting huge damage in our technological civilization. And I think we have to seriously
*  think about how much of that risk we're willing to take to have our nice little nice things on
*  the margin that we want. And what we're prepared to do is not make that trade if we don't want to
*  make that trade. And then we have to also think ahead of like, okay, we create this now, what does
*  that give, what did they do five years from now, and got much better algorithms, much better
*  scaffolding, much better ways to what we can do with that. And how does that fuel our race? How
*  does that fuel these dynamics? How does that set principles and momentum that's hard to spot?
*  So I think that we've made tremendous progress in the discourse over the course of my eye-pouch
*  over the last six months. The point where people are saying many very reasonable things, and looking
*  at very reasonable solutions, and are starting to actually ask the practical implementation questions
*  that we just didn't even have the ability to ask before, because we couldn't get this discussion
*  under way without being laughed at. Yeah, it's good. It's gone, you know, in some ways, remarkably
*  well. I've remarked many times, maybe even to you the last time we did this, that it is very easy to
*  imagine a much worse state of play, where, you know, all the leading developers like, you know,
*  dismiss any concerns. And it's also pretty easy to imagine a somewhat better state of play. But it's
*  hard to imagine a, for me at least, a much, much better state of play as we kind of, I kind of think
*  of us right now as like, getting to the end of phase one, and sort of beginning chapter two of,
*  you know, the AI story. The obvious alternate universe is much better is something like,
*  you know, DeepMind, there's no open AI, there's no anthropic, they never came to exist.
*  You know, either DeepMind exists or nothing exists. Google has a very large lead in artificial
*  intelligence. Nobody is seriously trying to compete with them. They are taking it very slow,
*  they are releasing things well after they are created very carefully. There's no big room,
*  there's no big huge amount of investment. Right. And like, the information about the techniques
*  are highly guarded. You know, people who try to create things outside of Google find that they
*  don't get very far. You know, and we're proceeding very slowly and carefully, and they have, maybe
*  Dennis is the CEO of Google in this hypothetical better scenario. And he understands, you know,
*  exactly what he has to do. I'm just like trying to come up with an obvious better situation where
*  like we have one higher responsible player with a large lead and no serious competition. That would
*  be my, you know, guess at the better world that like, we might have gotten to from 2014 or whatever,
*  right? Like, as opposed to like a better world that has to start in 2000.
*  How much do you think people would have to see in terms of, you see people like Gwern who,
*  you know, at kind of GPT-3 and probably before probably as of like GPT-2, but certainly as of
*  GPT-3 was kind of calling like, Yep, this is, you know, I think I know what track we're on and seems
*  to have been largely right. It seems like in that scenario, honestly, if they just show much of
*  anything, you know, it seems like the mere knowledge that like somebody has created an AI and it
*  like does some interesting stuff would almost have been enough to kick off like a wave of
*  investment. Unless you kept it like a total secret, which seems almost impossible to do given,
*  you know, the scale that they'd have to be operating on the number of research scientists
*  they'd have like just the general sort of, you know, the non-enforceability of non-competes in
*  California. It seems very tough to not have people kind of take notice or kind of seep out that like,
*  yeah, some really interesting stuff is happening. If you, you know, throw a lot of data into a big
*  enough compute blender, especially because like, you know, there's a lot of know-how, certainly.
*  And we've, you know, I think given a lot of appropriate credit to the likes of opening
*  eyes for kind of productizing things really well compared to a lot of other things we see.
*  But there's also like not a lot of know-how that's required to like get something really
*  interesting. So when I kind of think how hard would it be for them to keep that secret that,
*  you know, there's a pretty easy way to get to something interesting, it seems awfully tough.
*  Nobody cares about your stupid startup idea is the counterpoint, right? There's laws and laws
*  of great ideas that just sit there for decades, not being picked up by anybody. If there's no
*  obvious path, there's no marginal gradient to train on. There's no commercialization,
*  like nobody is put the proper check they're facing front. Google has the lead, they're risk
*  averse legally, culturally, they're not putting anything out in this hypothetical world. I think
*  it's very possible that like, we lose that situation and we end up in the worst situation.
*  We end up in a far worse situation because people who are less responsible become the competition.
*  I don't think it's possible that like, this stuff's hard. Maybe you don't publish a Transformers
*  paper. Maybe you don't explain these things. Maybe it's kept as a trade secret. I don't know.
*  Like, I don't think that these things are impossible. I think it's too late now.
*  Like, I mean, I don't really worry about it too much, right? I get it from the past.
*  We had our opportunity to not be in this world. I sometimes think about, well, if rationalist style
*  people, Don't go to value as you'd caskey had directly inspired deep mind and open AI,
*  an anthropic, what would the world look like? And maybe better, maybe worse. I don't know.
*  Right? Like if we got other people who didn't understand the risks,
*  who were doing the same projects, even if they were a year or two behind,
*  right? That might be a much, much worse situation. Or maybe we just wouldn't.
*  Right? My experience from Magic Gathering, right? A world of like opportunity everywhere,
*  lots and lots of innovation is some innovations, day one, 100 people come up with the same solution.
*  Others, you show up at the tournament after all the work, one person had it.
*  You know, one team had it. Or even like one origin. And then for years, they toil in isolation
*  with this thing that doesn't quite really work, except when you really, really know your stuff.
*  And then eventually someone breaks through and figures out the missing piece.
*  Yeah, I think until it proves itself, never underestimate the ability of, you know, pretty
*  amazing ideas, especially ones that require lots of investment in the front time and,
*  and like taking a loss for a while to just get ignored. Right? Like open AI clearly pursued
*  things in a way that nobody else was pursuing them for years. And then you open it up,
*  do what it was doing. It was very, very open. So if there's no open AI,
*  what makes you think anyone else would have done? Yeah, it's possible.
*  Radical uncertainty on so many questions. Anything else you want to cover today?
*  It's amazing the things that we haven't mentioned, right? Anthropic got a $4 billion investment from
*  Amazon, right? This past week. And we didn't even talk about it. Sam Altman said on Reddit,
*  AGI has been achieved internally. And then tried to walk it back with a, you guys have no chill.
*  Obviously, I was joking as if like, it was okay to joke about that. Right? In that way,
*  completely deadpan and any other things. But yeah, these are the big things. And yeah, we can always
*  make a habit of this and check back in another month. Yeah, I'm looking forward to that.
*  Just since you mentioned the Anthropic Amazon deal, just briefly on that. Last time they raised money
*  from Google, my reaction was where is Amazon and how is the valuation not already significantly
*  higher? I think it was like a $5 billion valuation, whatever, six months ago or something. And I was
*  like, that's got to be worth more to Amazon who doesn't seem to have a horse in the race yet,
*  as opposed to a Google that obviously has deep mind and just deep expertise in this leadership,
*  in this field anyway. I guess if I'm going to update on anything based on this deal,
*  I would say it does suggest Gemini is probably pretty good. If they were looking at Gemini and
*  being like, yeah, it's still not measuring up, then I would think there would be an even bigger
*  bidding war and Google would not want to lose. And I'm sure they must have had some, maybe not,
*  but usually you get some right of refusal. I think you're giving too much credit to Google
*  for being a unified entity that can update on information and act reasonably here. So I don't
*  think the evidence is as strong as you think it is, but it's definitely evidence that other major
*  bidders didn't see this at the desperation situation where they had to get the Anthropic
*  Alliance. And if I was Microsoft or Google, I would have been, even if you have something amazing,
*  just to get Anthropic under your umbrella, if they were, we also don't know if Anthropic would have
*  made those deals. They might have just not wanted those partners for various reasons, including just
*  safety risks. Maybe they weren't going to give them the kind of guarantees that they needed,
*  the kind of corporate control that they wanted, and Amazon was. But yeah, this was the steel of
*  the century. This was completely absurd. Valuing open, at Robin, what was it, $8 billion or
*  something for money and letting them get a huge portion of the company for a few billion dollars.
*  Right? Like this is worth 10 times that, but to Amazon, and to be fair, it's probably
*  under-representing what was paid, right? Amazon almost certainly made a gigantic commitment of compute
*  at the highly sub-market prices for Amazon Web Services as part of this bid. So it could be
*  something like, okay, we're going to get a large portion of this company for not that much investment,
*  but also your compute costs have now gone down by a factor of several,
*  like permanently or something like that. At which point,
*  maybe it's a much, much better deal than a similar investment from Microsoft.
*  The non-standard terms also, which are not, they're kind of alluded to, but not spelled out in detail,
*  as far as I know in public so far, also probably do take a lot of would-be investors out of the
*  game. Because you can imagine just hedge funds galore would be willing to... Yeah, I don't think
*  they take the investors out of the game so much as they lower the price that people are willing to
*  pay. I think that like, if I get $8 million, I cannot think of very many reasons why you wouldn't
*  put as much money as you possibly could into my property here. Basically, the only one I can think
*  of is, you think it's bad for the world for a company to get money and you don't want to do it.
*  Or you just have a good reference that's like, you can't invest in something that can't mature
*  fast enough. But this idea that you won't be able to sell your shares for a large profit, even if
*  athropic plays this, we're never going to make a dollar game. You know who's famous for not making
*  a dollar for a long time? I mean, also Meta, also Uber, there's a lot of companies that in some sense
*  should have a zero price target because no matter how much money Meta makes, it's all going to go
*  to whatever Zuckerberg thinks is the cool shit they do. He's never going to pay the shareholders.
*  The shareholders are all like, well, when he dies or something, eventually this company will get to
*  make some money. You're going to act as if this thing is worth what the net present value of its
*  profits are as opposed to those profits not actually ever getting to you. And if everyone
*  else treats it that way, then it's worth what it's worth. So it's fine. It's weird.
*  There's definitely a few, you know, the Harare style fictions. There's definitely a few fictions
*  in play here. One of which being that tech companies may one day pay dividends.
*  All right. Well, yes, I look forward to doing this again. One thing I do want to do with you
*  is a kind of survey of the AI safety landscape because we've both kind of studied this in,
*  you know, different times and in different ways from different perspectives.
*  And that is also something I think people would be very interested to hear about. It's just kind
*  of this high level sense of like, who's out there? What are they doing? Is any of it,
*  have any chance of actually working? Key question. I'd be happy to. It's definitely the kind of
*  thing where even if you are working on AI safety, it's very, very difficult to know exactly what
*  what else is out there. And often difficult to assess whether or not someone else's project is
*  useful, is real, right? Is genuine in some senses, right? Is co-opted and is actually
*  capabilities or like more harmful than it's worth or like pursuing something that's not
*  sexual to the problem and therefore like can't help with the ultimate goal. So it's very, very
*  all tricky. Anthropic is the big puzzle of all, right? Like is anthropic, you know, basically a
*  safety work where if you help anthropic, you're helping advanced safety or is it like capabilities
*  or that like is more balanced in terms of how much safety is willing to do than its rivals
*  and has a better culture of like worrying about the capability of this building while it's building
*  them, but still ultimately building them. And I think that's an open question. Well, we'll save
*  that for next time. For now, Svimashvits, thank you for being part of the cognitive revolution.
