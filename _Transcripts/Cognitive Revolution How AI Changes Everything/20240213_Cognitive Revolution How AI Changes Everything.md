# AI Abundance: a16z Partners Justine Moore and Anish Acharya Forecast a New Era for Consumers
**Cognitive Revolution "How AI Changes Everything":** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfcW4gwKtpo)
*  our philosophy is like for creativity, everybody is born creative, and everyone has this sort of
*  latent desire to be creative. But as we get older, what happens is one, our sort of taste improves.
*  So like the kind of work that we would want to create gets more sophisticated. For most of us,
*  that muscle atrophies. So our creative skill tends to diverge from our creative taste. So what does
*  that mean? It's like hard to compose the kind of music you want to hear. It's hard to paint the
*  kind of pictures you want to see. So one of the cool things about the new technologies,
*  it feels like if you have good taste, you can make good art. So that sort of lowers the floor
*  for participation and being creative. And then some of the more I guess, niche subreddits are
*  really good for specific sorts of topics. I think local llama and AI video and then comfy UI are
*  probably my favorite three right now because they tend to be curated group of folks who are
*  really like pushing the forefront of language models or video or kind of image generation.
*  Our hot take is that maybe the human part of human connections overstated.
*  And actually people just need connection. And look, I think there's an opportunity for these
*  companion experiences to, you know, be tailored to people in a way that really helps them flourish.
*  Hello, and welcome to the cognitive revolution, where we interview visionary researchers,
*  entrepreneurs and builders working on the frontier of artificial intelligence.
*  Each week we'll explore their revolutionary ideas and together we'll build a picture of how AI
*  technology will transform work, life and society in the coming years. I'm Nathan Labenz joined by
*  my co-host Eric Torenberg. Hello and welcome back to the cognitive revolution. Today's episode is a
*  fun one as we'll be exploring the frontier of AI powered consumer products. My guests are Anisha
*  Charya and Justine Moore, partners at A16Z consumer, the division of venture capital mega fund and
*  Drayson Horowitz that invests in consumer product companies. They have recently published an
*  investment thesis called the abundance agenda, which outlines how they see the market for AI
*  native consumer applications developing and what they're looking for in new investment opportunities.
*  If that sounds a bit academic or vague, I assure you that this is not armchair theorizing. To
*  develop their investment thesis, the A16Z consumer team has spent countless hours trying a huge
*  number of different AI applications hands-on. Justine in particular shares many of her
*  experiments and findings on Twitter and is a true must follow for anyone who wants to keep up with
*  this fast moving space. Between her feed and the abundance agenda presentation itself, and I must
*  say it was created with AI native presentation app gamma itself the subject of a cognitive revolution
*  episode back in August of last year, I was inspired to try at least 10 new AI native applications
*  just while preparing for this episode. For what it's worth of those music generator,
*  Suno AI impressed me most relative to what I had experienced previously. I was able to generate
*  remarkably high quality music in minutes, including the revolutionary reggae track complete with lyrics
*  about AI that we used as intro music for today's episode. It's really a great tangible example of
*  how empowering and how fun AI products can be. And I definitely look forward to making more music with
*  it in the future. In this conversation, we cover A16Z consumers investment approach, including
*  their foundational belief that AI represents one of if not the biggest platform shifts of our
*  lifetimes, their view that consumer trends can't really be predicted in advance and must instead
*  be spotted in the wild, and their preference for products that are quote weird but working,
*  even if the use cases seem unserious or potentially even black mirror at first.
*  We also discuss how they are thinking about the retention challenges that many AI application
*  developers are facing, the prospects for an AI product bundle and or a personal AI procurement
*  department, the reasons so many applications are still missing APIs, and the potential for
*  entrepreneurs to disrupt regulated industries with unapologetic direct to consumer approaches.
*  It was a ton of fun to compare notes with some fellow AI scouts and at a high level,
*  as regular listeners will certainly know, I share a niche and Justine's enthusiasm for the prospect
*  of AI provided abundance. From the creative superpowers we enjoy today with apps like
*  Suno to the productivity tools that are just starting to become really useful to the fitness
*  and mental health coaches that we might not otherwise be able to afford, and even to the
*  medical and legal advice, which can supplement human experts in critical moments. It's all super
*  exciting to me. At the same time, I do have what I like to think of as a healthy fear for just how
*  weird things might get. And I really do worry that the whole field is moving so quickly that
*  competitive pressure, especially when combined with founder optimism or naivete, could cause
*  real harm to consumers at scale and potentially even damage the AI application industry itself,
*  if such harm is sufficiently outrageous as to provoke counterproductive regulation before we
*  have even established best practices to guide the industry. Balancing the benefits and risks of AI
*  will of course be a society wide challenge in which everyone has a stake and many millions
*  have a voice. But even thinking small and reflecting on my own experience as the father of
*  three young boys and parenting is arguably the quintessential thing that doesn't scale,
*  I unfortunately don't have any easy answers. Of course, I will want my kids to take advantage
*  of the best AI tutors, and absolutely I will want them to pursue their own weird interests,
*  many of which will likely involve AI in some form. And yet I currently feel quite reluctant
*  to expose them to applications whose developers are under intense pressure to grow and retain users.
*  I certainly don't have all the answers, and we only had an hour together for this episode,
*  but my hope is that in addition to helping advance our shared understanding of AI,
*  at least some of the conversations that I have here on the cognitive revolution
*  can serve as a gentle but credible reminder that with great power comes great responsibility.
*  As always, if you're finding value in the show, we'd appreciate it if you'd take a moment to share
*  it with your friends. I believe this episode will be of broad general interest for anyone
*  who's investing in, building with, or just exploring their own creative and productive
*  potential with the help of AI. With that, I hope you enjoyed this conversation with Anisha Charya
*  and Justine Moore of A16Z Consumer. Anisha Charya and Justine Moore from A16Z Consumer,
*  welcome to the cognitive revolution. Sweet Nathan, a long time listener,
*  first time caller, so thank you for having us. That's kind of very excited to have you.
*  We're here obviously to talk about, you know, a new framework that we're proposing and excited
*  about and investing in really called the abundance agenda. And this is all the work that we've been
*  doing and seeing and thinking about in the world of AI. And of course, the key word here is abundance.
*  So let me kind of talk you through why we're so excited and fixated on this concept of abundance.
*  And there's really kind of two reasons. Like every time there's one of these big platform shifts,
*  everything from the internet to mobile to, you know, smaller shifts like fintech and crypto,
*  there's been this huge sort of explosion of new companies being built and all these benefits for
*  consumers. And if you look at consumers, every time one of these shifts happens, their lives just
*  get better. Their lives get better because they can, you know, afford more stuff, both products
*  and services and things that are luxuries become a lot more accessible that were sort of out of
*  reach become accessible and maybe even commodities. So the AI thing that's happening, it feels like
*  consumers are going to benefit in this enormous way. It also feels like so many of the most
*  interesting companies that we invested in were built around the last platform shift. This feels
*  like kind of the moment for consumer investing. So hopefully you can tell from our vibes that we're
*  very fired up. And then in terms of like the way we're actually looking at the opportunity side,
*  there's really three markets and three things that we see that are resonating with consumers.
*  So the first is everything in the world of creativity and productivity. So our philosophy
*  is like for creativity, everybody is born creative, and everyone has this sort of latent desire to be
*  creative. But as we get older, what happens is one, our sort of taste improves. So like the kind of
*  work that we would want to create gets more sophisticated. And two, look, for most of us,
*  that muscle atrophies. So our creative skill tends to diverge from our creative taste. So what does
*  that mean? It's like hard to compose the kind of music you want to hear. It's hard to paint the
*  kind of pictures you want to see. Sometimes it's even tough to compose an email in a way that
*  really captures exactly what you're trying to get at. So one of the cool things about the new
*  technology is it feels like if you have good taste, you can make good art. And that just hasn't been
*  true. So that sort of lowers the floor for participation in being creative. And we're
*  seeing a ton of that. Like, what is the market size for that? I don't know. But mid-journey,
*  ideogram, all of these companies are seeing enormous consumer pull, both in usage and revenue.
*  So there's obviously something to that idea of helping everyone be their best, most creative
*  self. I think the second concept is around productivity and how we do our work. And that's
*  almost the inverse of the creativity observation, which is the thing that prevents us from doing
*  great work is one, the kind of administrative overhead that we all pay, that tax we pay in doing
*  our work. And two, it's great that we have tools that help us do work. But sometimes you just want
*  to delegate the work to someone or a team. And I think with the AI, you can imagine a lot of the
*  administrative overhead goes to zero or approaches zero. And a lot of the AI can do the work instead
*  of helping you do the work, which should sort of raise the ceiling. So creativity, productivity,
*  sort of lowering the floor and raising the ceiling for creative work and professional work.
*  So that's been like one of our biggest areas of focus. We're super excited and just to walk
*  you through it. Look, I think the second thing that's really working as companionship. So
*  relationships, you know, we all know that there's like this fundamental need for human connection.
*  I think our hot take is that maybe the human part of human connections overstated. And actually,
*  people just need connection. And if you look at the public data, you see that people are using
*  these companionship apps twice as often as they're using social apps, as twice as often as they're
*  using TikTok or Instagram. So something about these experiences is resonating with consumers
*  in a really deep way. And look, I think there's an opportunity for these companion experiences to,
*  you know, be tailored to people in a way that really helps them flourish, right? Helps them sort
*  of feel good about themselves, help them feel accepted, help them feel like, you know,
*  they're not the only one that is their own unique kind of weird. So there's something really powerful
*  that's happening and really life affirming and, you know, consumers are behaving accordingly.
*  And I think the last thing is, you know, wellness and personal growth. I mean,
*  it's kind of well established, right? If you have personalized teaching, you perform two standard
*  deviations better than the average student. If you have personalized wealth management or sort of
*  financial advice, you just tend to manage your money a lot better. And of course, if you have a
*  team of people that's looking after your physical health, mental health, you know, it just improves
*  your wellbeing. The problem with all those things is that they're really expensive. So it's like a
*  great vision for people who have resources and, you know, AI should collapse the cost of those things.
*  And it should mean that things get dramatically cheaper. So yeah, those are kind of the three
*  markets that we're looking at. I think the only thing before I handed it to Justine that I'd say
*  is like, the way we're prosecuting these markets is a little different from perhaps how others have
*  done or how we've looked at it in the past. Number one, I think we're really looking at the intersection
*  of weird and working. So like, we think that weird products or products that feel like they
*  might not be serious tend to be the ones that end up being the winners. And this is one of the reasons
*  that incumbents don't just win everything in consumer. This is also one of the reasons,
*  by the way, why first time founders tend to outperform second time founders and consumer.
*  I think their tolerance for being embarrassed and building weird things is actually much higher.
*  So that's kind of the area that we've looked for weird and working and being not nonjudgmental
*  about that. You know, related to that, I think we've got a real belief that, you know, we can't
*  predict consumer, we can only observe consumer. It's just really hard to know what is actually
*  going to be built. And that's why we're sort of in the business of observation instead of like,
*  you know, having our own vision for what consumers should or will want.
*  I think the last bit is just like the importance of culture as an overlay here.
*  You know, like we've always as a firm been all about the intersection of culture and technology
*  and, you know, AI is such a sort of it's enabling such a set of creative fields.
*  It's hard to talk about the technology without talking about culture as well.
*  So I love the notion of an abundance agenda for starters. And that is what has me so excited
*  about the AI moment. When I first got access to GPT-4, it was within the 60 day testing window
*  that I started going to it with my medical questions. I felt that even within that,
*  you know, short time and even as rough as the product was, and, you know, obviously there
*  was going to be a million extensions and, you know, access to databases and stuff, which it
*  didn't have at the time. I felt like for many things, it already was a superior experience
*  to the all in experience of going to the doctor. And I was like, man, the AI doctor for everyone in
*  the world is just going to be such an unbelievably empowering, democratizing, you know, just world
*  changing phenomenon. So I do love the notion of the abundance agenda. And I also do share the sense
*  that it's like very hard to predict where this is going. And I always say my crystal ball gets
*  foggy, you know, more than a few months out. So Justine, do you want to kind of take part two
*  and give us a little bit more into the things you're looking for and the things that are
*  exciting you in the market early as it is? For sure. Yeah. Maybe I'll start with like the
*  kind of how we look at everything prosumer, which is essentially enabling everyday consumers to do
*  things that before were considered professional grade work or that required very specific skills,
*  knowledge of complex software, things like that. But I think like the first killer use case probably
*  of consumer AI beyond chat, like just chatting with chat PPT was content generation. So it's
*  kind of magical experience of, hey, I can type in a prompt and I can get an image, I can get a song,
*  I can get a video. And that has a ton of use cases across both just like everyday consumers,
*  making fun things to share with friends to creators, making things to help them grow an audience
*  to people doing this for a business, whether they're like a small business, making an ad or
*  promotional materials, or they're maybe even a creative professional at a large company that
*  is making their brainstorming and iteration much faster. I think we started with content generation
*  around kind of the base model, like how do you make the magic happen? And so we needed all of
*  these foundation models to be built around all of these different content categories.
*  And now we're kind of hitting the point where there's enough publicly accessible models,
*  whether it's open source or closed models that you can access via API, that we're starting to
*  see people build the workflow and the features around these models and make it truly easy for
*  everyday people to use. So you don't have to be a prompt engineer. You don't have to go into a
*  bunch of tools to edit and piece together content after you've created that. Hey, we'll continue our
*  interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors. The Brave Search API brings affordable
*  developer access to the Brave Search index, an independent index of the web with over 20 billion
*  web pages. So what makes the Brave Search index stand out? One, it's entirely independent and
*  built from scratch. That means no big tech biases or extortionate prices. Two, it's built on real
*  page visits from actual humans collected anonymously, of course, which filters out tons of junk data.
*  And three, the index is refreshed with tens of millions of pages daily. So it always has
*  accurate up-to-date information. The Brave Search API can be used to assemble a data set to train
*  your AI models and help with retrieval augmentation at the time of inference, all while remaining
*  affordable with developer-first pricing. Integrating the Brave Search API into your
*  workflow translates to more ethical data sourcing and more human representative data sets.
*  Try the Brave Search API for free for up to 2,000 queries per month at brave.com slash API.
*  It actually allows you to iterate and refine on said content like you have a person working
*  alongside you, like a brainstorming partner who's also an editor who can make changes on the fly.
*  So content generation and editing, we've been spending a lot of time on the workflow,
*  have also been spending a lot of time thinking about how do you translate all of the incredible
*  things that the open source community is doing into consumer accessible products.
*  I think the amazing thing about AI right now is that, especially in image, but we're actually
*  now starting to see it a lot in language as well, and probably eventually video too. There's a really
*  vibrant group of people all over the world who are taking these base models and fine tuning them and
*  creating all of these loras and checkpoints and then combining them in interesting ways to make
*  very cool content. You probably see even with things like Comp VUI, people are making whole
*  videos out of image models, people are generating 3D textures, people are doing very incredible
*  things. But historically that's been limited to folks who are technical, who have like a 40 ID at
*  home or more professional grade hardware. So we're very much hoping that in this next wave of consumer
*  AI, we start to see a lot of companies that are bringing these truly cutting edge open source
*  products to everyday consumer arms and more accessible like browser based products, apps,
*  things like that. We're also, I think, starting to see kind of on the editing front, like how do you
*  combine the generation editing experience? How do you go from, hey, I made an image and all I can do
*  is download that image or regenerate the same props to like, I want the same thing, but a little
*  bit different. Like we've seen with the mid journey variations or even with things like we've seen with
*  Pika's ability to modify canvas, you make the video and then you can say, I just want to change
*  the small part of it or I want to expand this or I want to change the dimensions. So it's not kind
*  of like a one off generation artifact. So that's kind of like productivity for and workflow touring
*  for consumers or creative individuals. We also spend a bunch of time thinking about like,
*  maybe the less creative, slightly more professional use cases around productivity,
*  things just helping you get your everyday job done. Like basically the idea of,
*  can we use AI to give every individual an assistant or a chief of staff or a data analyst,
*  kind of whatever makes most sense to their role to give them a lot more leverage on their time.
*  And there's so many tasks that we can now automate before AI was largely kind of like data or rules
*  based tasks. And now there's so much more you can do with kind of natural language prompts to say,
*  go out and research this for me, go out and go through all of these numbers,
*  come up with the pros and cons lists, generate a ton of emails, whatever the task is,
*  how can those things be automated? And thus far, I think we mostly seen that in like exactly what
*  I mentioned around tech space in our faces. I think moving forward, the question is like,
*  how do you have products that are more integrated into someone's daily life? So you're not stopping
*  to enter a prompt to the AI and wait for it to come back, but it's maybe listening to you,
*  whether that's through software or through hardware on a regular basis, and then interjecting both to
*  answer specific questions or do specific things, but also just to make like smart recommendations
*  as you go through your daily life. So as you can probably tell, there's a ton of stuff that
*  we're excited about, happy to go through any of those in more detail. I have a million different
*  questions and I'll try to ask them as crisply as I can to get through as many as possible.
*  For folks that want to go absorb your full document, I've had the chance to do that with
*  an advanced copy built using the Gamma app, a former guest, which is a great generative AI
*  tool for slides that really has some nice UI patterns that I recommend. It's actually a
*  pretty frequent recommendation of mine to go check out the Gamma UI. I would put it up there
*  right alongside my own waymark in terms of a very nice fusion of the generative AI, the chat back
*  and forth, but then also the controls that you need to actually make something that you can put
*  out there into the world that's kind of a finished product. So let's start with maybe some of your
*  methodology. So much stuff happening, right? I describe myself as an AI scout, and that means
*  try to keep up with everything. You're kind of trying to keep up with everything. People should
*  follow you on Twitter, Justine in particular, for just kind of a fire hose of product experiment
*  and funny findings and all that kind of stuff. But how do you spend your time? Where do you go
*  to figure out what's cool? Is it just trying products? Is it discords? Is it other stuff?
*  Justine is going to have a great answer to this too. But look, it feels like a lot of the
*  communities on Twitter and Reddit as well, different aspects of the community. It feels
*  like you can't be a part of the community if you're not using the products, which is why we're using
*  Gamma and all these, our compliance team hates that, but we are using all the products. It feels
*  like it's hard to be authentic to the space and have real intuition if you're not using the
*  product. So Twitter and Reddit are the main two places. And Justine's really led the way on this
*  for our team, but we're just doing a lot of work to make sure that we've tried these products
*  ourselves. So whether that means comfy or automatic and just getting them set up on our own laptops
*  and trying to control that and just really try everything so that we understand what's going
*  on at a sort of product instinct level instead of just an investor metrics level.
*  Yeah, totally agree Anish. I would say Twitter, Reddit, also Discord obviously is huge. I think
*  for specific communities with people who are really deep and in certain areas and trying a
*  different thing, a ton of different things and troubleshooting. I think the very cool thing about
*  a lot of these AI products is that it's not just super technical users. Like we kind of have a joke
*  on the team of various Discord channels or Reddits or all these anonymous Twitter accounts. Like
*  it could be the CEO of a giant company. It could be a 16 year old in the Philippines who discovered
*  a really cool app and has spent enough time on it to like become an expert. And I think that's one
*  of the things that is so exciting about these new platform shifts is like it truly enables so many
*  more people to become experts and to share their thoughts and to be bringing something new to the
*  community. So yeah, we probably spend too much time online, but we spend a kind of a massive
*  amount of time. Like obviously the Twitter algorithm is great at surfacing things that
*  kind of get attention and get a lot of engagement. But I think Reddit and Discord in particular,
*  like various communities like Local Llama or AI Video, like where there's really folks who are
*  not like posting something to get attention or to get engagement or likes or like drive eyeballs to
*  a product, but who have just spent a ton of time tinkering around with something and are trying to
*  make something cool or have like a real question. And I think engaging with those communities and
*  seeing how people are using these products and what they like and what they don't like, it's like
*  incredibly valuable. There's kind of no substitute for that.
*  I think my biggest takeaway there is I need to spend more time on Reddit. Are there any particular
*  subreddits that you would say are the absolute place to be?
*  Oh my gosh. Yeah. So I did, I'll send this to you. I did a big recap at the end of the year
*  on the biggest AI subreddits and kind of where all the activity is happening. I think it depends on
*  what you're looking for. I think some of them are like, you know, the Chat GPT or the Stable
*  Diffusion subreddits are really good for, hey, I just want to see like what's popping off in AI
*  and like what people are interested in. And then some of the more, I guess niche subreddits are
*  really good for specific sorts of topics. I think Local Llama and AI Video and then Cup The UI are
*  probably my favorite three right now because that it's, they tend to be curated group of folks who
*  are really like pushing the forefront of language models or video or kind of image generation.
*  There's like a running joke in the community that AGI is going to be discovered or released or
*  launched or whatever your term for it is, depending on how you interpret AGI by somebody like running
*  a 4090 in their basement who then posts about it on Local Llama and it doesn't seem too far from
*  the truth. We've had Sam Altman possibly shitpostingly teasing certain developments on Reddit as well. So
*  yeah, all bets are off, I would say in terms of just how this all develops. For the business
*  side of the consumer startup, this is something that we've kind of wrestled with it at WeMark and
*  if you've seen our product, but basically it's another kind of text to output type experience.
*  You get to say what sort of video you want, what you want to communicate, etc. We typically serve
*  small businesses and we make commercials, video ads, but especially focused on TV commercials.
*  And we have found that we do great when we partner on a B2B basis with the TV platforms. So,
*  you know, whether it's broadcast or cable or, you know, OTT, whatever. On the contrary, though,
*  when we go direct to an SMB, we've had what I would say is a pretty representative, I think,
*  challenge across the kind of consumer prosumer space, which is the economics are not quite
*  figured out, right? Like inference is kind of expensive. So we do give a free trial, but then
*  we like need to convert a certain percentage to get to our unit economics to work. And, you know,
*  it's like, geez, well, it's got to be kind of at least 19 or, you know, maybe 29 a month.
*  And then we have a bunch of people that will convert and then a significant number will
*  immediately go and cancel. And we'll say to them, like, well, you know, what was wrong or whatever.
*  And a lot of times they'll say, well, nothing was really wrong. It's just that it was worth it for
*  me to pay this 19 or 29 or whatever right now to get this problem solved. But I'm not sure how often
*  I'm going to come back. And there's a ton of stuff like this coming out. And so, you know,
*  I'll just kind of come back if I need to. So I imagine that's a huge challenge. What are
*  you seeing right now in terms of retention? Has anybody solved that? Is there a good model for it?
*  I have an idea for you. I'll pitch next. But have you seen anybody with a good way through that
*  problem? It's not very well understood how well this media format can perform. So I was at
*  Credit Karma for five years. You know, Credit Karma is one of the biggest consumer products out there.
*  One hundred and twenty million U.S. members, I believe. And most of their growth story,
*  actually, it was a paid growth story, but was mostly through television and kind of long tail
*  television inventory, you know, as well as video to some extent. And it just, you know,
*  I think it was a poorly understood format by digital SMBs and digital startups in particular,
*  you know, to sell kind of legacy and data, but it performs really well. So one, I think there's
*  just a little bit of a marketing the marketing challenge and like showing people how well the
*  format can perform. Look at two, of course, like the cost of inference is going to go down and the
*  models are going to get more efficient. So like that's that's inevitable. It's happening every day.
*  I think the last bit, though, and our partner, Alex, talks a bunch about this. We sort of look
*  at prosumer products and think about high NPS churn versus low NPS churn, you know, low NPS churn
*  being like, I hated your product and I'm never coming back again. And high NPS churn being like,
*  look, I'm an episodic user of this. And there's probably some way of modeling that that's somewhere
*  between, you know, recurring sort of SaaS revenue and purely transactional one time revenue. So I
*  think we just have to have a slightly different framework because a lot of these content
*  generation products are going to be episodic and that's OK. You can build great businesses around
*  them. It's just hard to look at that churn and create the same as you would low NPS churn.
*  Does that make sense? That's really interesting. To be honest, we have historically struggled with
*  that argument and maybe we just haven't come up with quite the right way to frame it. But this
*  is maybe the first time I've heard, you know, from the investor side of the table, somebody saying,
*  we'd be open to a financial model that isn't really anchored to strictly recurring revenue
*  model. In the past, people have told me outright, we'll give you zero credit for anything that is
*  one time purchase. You got to come talk to us, man. Well, OK, let's set something up. I like the sound
*  of that much better. I guess, you know, this an alternative path perhaps would be this concept
*  that I've been kicking around for a while of the AI bundle, which is kind of, you know,
*  because we're in the TV business, it's sort of inspired by the cable bundle. And I've just been
*  thinking, it seems to me like we're all headed for a world in which we pay like 100 bucks a month or
*  something. You know, we slash our employer employers pay 100 bucks a month for like AI tools
*  writ large. And for that, I kind of want an experience a little bit more like I get with
*  cable where, you know, I have a thousand channels and I may watch some, you know, most never and,
*  you know, some rarely, but I have access and that kind of reduces the friction. And then,
*  you know, they split up the money, obviously, depending on their deals. Would you be excited
*  about an AI bundle? Do you think that that has any legs? It seems like every app developer I ask
*  is into it. And the consumer side seems to make sense. But like, who actually would put that
*  together? And, you know, why will it fail? I don't know. Hey, we'll continue our interview
*  in a moment after a word from our sponsors. If you're a startup founder or executive running
*  a growing business, you know that as you scale your systems break down and the cracks start to
*  show. If this resonates with you, there are three numbers you need to know. 36,000, 25 and one.
*  36,000. That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle. NetSuite
*  is the number one cloud financial system, streamline accounting, financial management,
*  inventory, HR and more. 25. NetSuite turns 25 this year. That's 25 years of helping businesses
*  do more with less, close their books in days, not weeks and drive down costs. One, because your
*  business is one of a kind, so you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient system

*  Omniki uses generative AI to enable you to launch hundreds of thousands of ad iterations that
*  actually work customized across all platforms with a click of a button. I believe in Omniki so much
*  that I invested in it and I recommend you use it too. Use Cogrev to get a 10% discount. I think it's
*  it'll probably happen eventually some sort of AI bundle where you have broadly maybe the most
*  popular products in every category that you can kind of tap into or use different credits for
*  or things like that. I think thus far we haven't seen that sort of thing take off partially because
*  there's still so much fragmentation going on in products and in various markets. Like people use
*  different products for different things and people there's so many of the products now are
*  starting to fragment into like, hey, this is an image generator, but this one is really good at
*  anime. This one is really good at photorealistic images. This one is really good at text. And so
*  it's kind of hard to have a bundle that maybe combines what everybody wants. It is for engineers
*  when there's like so much kind of diversity in product options today, if that makes sense.
*  I agree with that. I also think that bundle, I mean, it's a great idea. It might be a sort of
*  a bridge solution. So like, I think the long-term trajectory of this is that if you're a business
*  owner, you just don't want to think about marketing. You just want customers to show up and you want
*  to, you know, your business to have paid some profitable acquisition costs. So you think like,
*  what is an AI CMO or what is an sort of entirely AI powered back office? I think it's one in which
*  an AI system can choose what products to buy, how to be a subscriber and when to churn and how to use
*  them. And you just sort of work on whatever your craft is and customers sort of show up and, you
*  know, get charged and pay and all that. So just to make sure I'm understanding that quickly,
*  the alternative to an AI bundled that I as a human would subscribe to and sort of let ride like my
*  cable bundle is an AI agent that is in fact managing my individual subscriptions more actively
*  such. And I'm going to buy the way I need that for content too, right? Because like now everything's
*  fragmenting off the cable bundle. So I was need like my content subscription AI agent to just
*  manage, you know, what have I actually watched cancel what I haven't, but that's basically the
*  idea you're sketching out. Totally. And I think it's actually bigger than just subscriptions. I
*  think it's your entire back office. Like a great example is a company called it's format, right?
*  Just in that sort of site generation company where they will actually, you know, they'll generate
*  and variants of a website and they'll do all of the multivariate testing so that like the best one
*  just gets chosen for every consumer. And you as someone who, you know, is a DTC seller online,
*  like you don't want to think about creating variations of your website and doing performance
*  marketing that way. You just want as many customers to go through the funnel as possible.
*  So that's kind of like speaking in the direction of like an AI CMO or an AI powered back office.
*  The threat to the AI bundle is the AI procurement department.
*  That's right. That's right. Okay. Another question I had on this, and this is, I guess it may be a
*  two-parter. So at Weymark, we, we fine tune models specifically focused on the script writing. And
*  then we use, you know, any model that we can get our hands on open source commercial, whatever.
*  Our goal is to make the best end product that we can. And I have not yet found a good image to video
*  app. So I guess first question is like, do you have any recommendations for me? I tried a number
*  even just off the slides last night. I have a picture, Mike, I kind of use the same image
*  for all this stuff. I have a picture of my kid making a snow angel in the snow and I prompt it
*  like, here's the image kid making a snow angel in the snow. And it's always like his face is melting.
*  We're in still kind of the like Will Smith eating spaghetti thing. So I'm wondering first,
*  have you seen anything that is great in that respect? And then second, if there is something
*  great, I kind of expect it's not going to have an API right now. Cause most of these things,
*  you know, not all there are exceptions, but very frequently I see the app does not yet have an API.
*  And that kind of surprises me for some of these like image generation or these sort of what feel
*  to me like point solutions. It feels to me like a lot of them are still even like an image to video,
*  right? Like that's still an input to something most of the time. I don't just take that clip
*  and like go publish it, right? I'm going to use it in some other context. So is there a good solution
*  that can get my kid to make a snow angel and why are there not more APIs for these sorts of products
*  so far? Yeah, it's a great question. I think what we've seen thus far in video is a mix of things.
*  So like you mentioned, a lot of clothes models, people training these foundation models, folks
*  like runway or Pika or Gentmo, who I do think all do a good job at kind of different styles of image
*  to video. Like runway for example, is maybe if you have a photo realistic image of your kid,
*  especially with all the new things around motion brush to try to prevent the face from moving or
*  warping too much. But you might be moving the arms if they're making a snow angel or something like
*  that. Pika might be great if you want to do kind of like a stylized like a cartoon or an anime,
*  they all kind of specialize in different things. So we've seen that kind of closed model ecosystem
*  in video. And then we've also seen, especially I would say in the past couple of months,
*  a ton of work happening in open source video. The first half of last year, I think the kind of only
*  broad open source video model was the model scope and then the iteration of that, which was zero
*  scope, which are great, but get kind of warpy, very short output stuff like that. I have seen
*  a lot of folks iterating on that with things like hotshot that are making it easier to do
*  consistent image to video. In terms of the API question, I think video is tough because
*  it's relatively expensive to generate and it takes a long time. And so, and the quality is
*  not quite there yet for folks to be able to use commercially. So you have this weird combination
*  of like costs a lot of money to generate and the outputs aren't great enough to be
*  so exceptional yet that you can put it in something that you use to generate revenue or things like
*  that. So that's why it feels like video is maybe a little bit more at that kind of creator pro
*  scene work stage than the actual kind of like enterprise API stage. We've actually written
*  a massive amount about AI video. We spent a ton of time in this space. We're really excited about it.
*  I think this will be the year that there's a lot more development happening and kind of the
*  underlying model architectures as well that enable us to be able to generate more temporally
*  coherent, consistent, non-warping and morphing clips. So I expect if we talked about this in
*  three months, six months, definitely by the end of the year, we'll hopefully be having a very
*  different conversation. Gotcha. So to summarize that, the lack of the APIs is a reflection of
*  the fact that the products are just not there to the point where other application developers are
*  jumping to integrate quite yet. I think that, and also I think we see at the early stages of
*  these sorts of developments and categories, the companies at the forefront are often purely focused
*  on developing best in class models first before saying like, hey, how do I enable other people to
*  put this in their application? So I also think it really hasn't been a focus of many of the teams
*  yet. Like they're focused on getting to the very best model. And then once they have that, and once
*  they can see that in some of the consumer prosumer numbers, I expect we'll start seeing APIs come out.
*  I guess a couple of things that jumped out at me that were maybe not as much represented in the
*  taxonomy of the different kinds of things that you were looking for. One was like just things that
*  are a little less weird. I was recently introduced to shortwave, which is a kind of originally a
*  Gmail competitor before there was generative AI to take it to the next level. And now they've built a,
*  for me, the best implementation of rag that I have seen possibly anywhere. I've been super
*  impressed with it. And that's a subject of an upcoming episode, but Gmail is a big product,
*  it's a, email is a lot of time. And we generally, like, I'm very impressed with shortwave, but like,
*  there's not yet a killer email assistant. And that is like not a weird thing. So I guess I'm
*  wondering why, why weird versus just like, hey, kill it on this like super obvious, you know,
*  everybody's sending emails all day use case. Is that, is there a reason that that's not as much
*  of the focus? I mean, I think this was sort of made two things to consider. I think one is if it's a
*  feature you can get promoted for building at Google, then it's going to get built at Google.
*  And it feels like, you know, email, AI email composition is like a sort of straightforward
*  sustaining innovation for an incumbent after the shortwave is great, we're of course, investors in
*  superhuman. So like, I like the category, but you don't want to feel like that that sort of thing
*  is something that incumbents are going to build. And we're just less focused on incumbents.
*  I think the second is like, some of the things that we speak to here may actually be end up
*  looking like the product you're describing. So voice has been something we've talked a lot about,
*  I'm really passionate about it. You know, voices just never work as an interface of technology,
*  like it's just never worked period. And now it works. And there's a sort of question of like,
*  well, what is a voice first productivity experience? What's a voice first inbox?
*  That feels like a stretch for someone at Gmail to build, whereas someone at, you know, superhuman
*  and shortwave or a company that's just starting today might build it. And it might actually feel
*  a lot more like you're, you know, reviewing your inbox with your EA versus, you know,
*  sort of linearly going through these blocks of texts and context switching. So yeah,
*  I do think some of those things might get solved, albeit in a way that feels a little weird.
*  I'm, by the way, generally quite pro weird. I do enjoy all these, you know, strange AI experiences.
*  How do you think about the breakdown? You know, we've heard like,
*  Elad Gil was on the show some months ago and said he sort of expects 80, 20, you know, 80% to go to
*  the existing platforms as sustaining value and 20% to go to startups. But then he's quick to add,
*  but that's huge because this is probably the biggest platform shift of our lifetimes.
*  Is that basically how you see it also? Or would you put a different spin on that macro lens?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think we'd almost take the opposite view. What's like 80, 20 to startups.
*  I mean, look, I think that incumbents will become more efficient and more profitable.
*  And that's great for them because that means their products will get cheaper and more people will
*  have access to them. That's kind of the abundance concept as defined by sort of existing companies
*  and existing products. But, you know, the whole history of these platform shifts is that the new
*  markets are way bigger than anyone predicts. And they always favor the kind of platform native
*  startup, the AI native startup in this case. So, you know, if we're we have this conversation again
*  in two years and it's 80, 20 and in this direction that you lot is predicting,
*  I'll be surprised. I'll be disappointed. So how do you think about that from the
*  standpoint of like Salesforce? That's always my kind of canonical go to. I always think
*  Salesforce will add an AI layer before you will build an AI first CRM that can really
*  displace them. Is there something wrong with that analysis? My challenge to you is like,
*  do you even need a lot of like, you know, we don't focus on B2B, but just to weigh in for a
*  second, you know, what is BI, for example, the entire category BI is an interface between a CEO
*  question and the database. Right? Like, I would argue that you actually don't even need any of
*  those products anymore. And in fact, you can just have a CEO asking a question and having an AI or
*  LLM generate a query that goes to a database and a bunch of dashboards are returned. And that same
*  system can decide what dashboard should be in a CEO's inbox every morning. So I don't know. I
*  mean, I think that there, yes, I think that in terms of adding AI to the existing products,
*  yes, incumbents and Salesforce is set up well to do that. I just sort of question how many of these
*  categories will be either unnecessary or dramatically different thanks to the tech.
*  Yeah, this is kind of a, if software was eating the world for a long time, now AI is going to eat
*  software and it's sort of, or strongly suggests that you believe that the models will continue
*  to get a lot more powerful. Cause even like GPT-4, we just did a show with somebody from,
*  with Juan from data.world and they've got a benchmark now as like kind of complicated
*  queries and you know, can AI generate the query effectively? And the answer is like, even with
*  GPT-4, not really yet. And so for me, like maybe the hundred trillion dollar question is do the
*  models just continue to advance to the point where, yeah, they don't even need all this
*  scaffolding and structure and you just go straight natural language to database and boom. And it's
*  like all that crap gets kind of washed away or do we sort of find that, you know, that next,
*  you know, couple rungs on the ladder would be harder to climb. And so a lot of the scaffolding
*  kind of continues to be important, you know, whether it's Gmail or Salesforce or anything else,
*  but it sounds like the implicit belief underlying this projection is that we're nowhere close to the
*  models topping out. Is that fair? I think so. I think the models are getting, you know, better,
*  faster. Justine, what do you think actually? Cause I also think you've got to distinguish between
*  the language models and the media models. I mean, they're all moving in different directions.
*  I think we're more big believers that the models will continue to get better. I think we're also
*  big believers that the workflow you build around the models is very important. And
*  that there's more and more people building that workflow now, sort of like I mentioned in content
*  generation, but it applies to every category. The first wave of AI was like, you can have this
*  magical product where you put in a prompt and you get texts back, or you get an image back, or you
*  get a video back. But I think a lot of kind of what you're mentioning, like the challenges around
*  it is like, okay, what if it's not exactly what you want? Or what if the answer is wrong? That's
*  not to say like, oh, this is never going to work or the models have to get much better or like,
*  this means that the incumbents are going to win. I think we're big believers that there will be
*  startups that tackle those challenges. Okay. What is the accuracy layer? What is the layer
*  that double checks? Like all of the stuff we're seeing around right now, like people run into
*  these problems and innovate on solutions, which I think we believe will just continue to happen.
*  Nathan, I think sort of related, one of the most interesting things that feels under discussed is
*  how artistically opinionated you can sort of tip models in, especially visual media models using
*  fine tuning, both the Dream with approach as well as Laura's and all of these things just allow you
*  to create these really opinionated models using fine tuning techniques instead of training new
*  foundation models. So it also feels like some of these techniques will allow you to have a lot more
*  leverage in sort of the specialization that the models have. Yeah, I definitely don't rule that
*  out either. You know, the leap that I felt in the first days of GPT-4, even relative to having spent
*  tons of time fine tuning just one generation prior of models for very specific tasks throughout that
*  summer of 2022, like I was already bought into the idea that AI is going to restructure the economy.
*  And then I got the GPT-4 access. So I think the prospect of another leap is probably the biggest
*  thing that is still coming at us and going to shake the snow globe again. I think that's probably
*  more likely than not. And so I think if I have to bet, I'm probably betting on the same side of the
*  question that you guys are. Although it's hard to know exactly what shape that'll take and how soon
*  it'll come. And it's easy to sort of say, well, let's just keep refining what we have and layering
*  on the assistant to this great platform that we've built over decades in the meantime.
*  And hard to tell those people that they're definitely wrong. So yeah, it's interesting.
*  That does suggest that there is perhaps a lot of disruption coming for all corners of the economy.
*  I mean, I also think some of the primitives for me, they feel underexplored so far.
*  GPT-4V is so fucking cool. I mean, it's amazing. Computers can see. They can see. And I've been
*  very excited about it pre-release and now post-release. It's also super cool, but it just
*  feels like it's underexplored from a workflow and a product concept perspective. And so I actually
*  think there'll just be a lot to be built even if there isn't another leap in models in the near
*  term, which I'm sure there will be. There's a lot to be built with the stuff we already have.
*  Yeah, totally. I think if we don't get any better models, we have a decade in front of us of
*  figuring out how to plug GPT-4 in everywhere. And if we do, then we might have just a few years of
*  like ripping a lot of things out and plugging new models into where the stuff that ripped out was.
*  One thing I've been kind of expecting is, and this goes directly to the abundance agenda,
*  is somebody to come out and kind of be like, okay, we're doing the Uber strategy for AI doctors.
*  And that is to say, we don't really care what you tell us we can or can't do. We're just going to
*  do it. We're going to go straight to the public. We're going to be so damn good that everybody's
*  going to love us and they're going to hate you for trying to stop us. And that's our play.
*  That hasn't really happened yet. I haven't seen anybody come out with that positioning. And you
*  could kind of extend that, you know, doctors, lawyers, and a number of other things. What do
*  you think is up with that? Why is there no like just unapologetic, you know,
*  Atlantic-like push on the AI doctor front? That's a good question. I mean, I don't want to weigh in
*  too much because it's not the area that we focus on day to day. But look, I do think there's a lot
*  of companies doing work in this area. So, you know, we're investors and Hippocratic. They're
*  building a foundation model that sort of enables things like doctors and nurses as a service. So
*  like one, I do think that there's a specialized data set and knowledge set you need to find to
*  train the foundation model to be able to just be really good. I think even if you're your Uber and
*  you don't give a shit, like you still do give a shit about at least getting the right product
*  outcomes. You know, Uber may not have paid much attention to regulators, but it's not like their
*  cars exploded on the way to your destination. So I do think that there's a little bit of that. And
*  then look to all of these companies are at best 14 months old, you know, mid journey, at least their
*  latest sort of iterations are 14 months old, chat, GBT is 14 months old. So it's just like
*  really hard to overstate how early it is. And, you know, if we have this conversation in 12
*  months and there isn't something that looks like that, and that's really getting to scale,
*  and hopefully it's Hippocratic, then I'll be surprised. I see the doctor group.ai link in
*  the chat as well. And I've heard a little bit about that. And I heard that that is kind of
*  the positioning of that product. And there's a somewhat notorious entrepreneur behind it.
*  I don't know if you want to tell more of that story at this point, but I'm looking forward to
*  that hitting the broader consciousness and seeing how that shapes up.
*  Yeah, for sure. Yeah. No specific comments on that one, I would say. There's probably a reason that
*  Uber was in rideshare and not in like, I don't know, financial services or healthcare. Like
*  there's a couple of these categories that are extremely highly regulated where you can get
*  extreme very heavily fined as an individual or arrested or get your medical license taken away
*  or something like that, or you're directly impacting someone's kind of like core livelihood
*  and career. And so I think in those categories, there's massive room for improvement and AI will
*  definitely come to them. It will just take a little bit longer probably to change some of the systems,
*  the structure, the regulation to enable these folks who have spent many, many years in school
*  to become a doctor or something like that to feel comfortable doing this type of thing, whether
*  they're kind of overseeing chatbots, whether the chatbots completely replace them. We should have
*  GPT-4 take the MCAT. I think that would be very interesting, but I think the category is similar
*  to video or in a year we'll be having for conversation. I'm honestly confused by the
*  relative lack of this kind of frontal attack. I mean, and I'm not necessarily sure it would be a
*  great thing. I think what I always say is I want both for now, at least, right? I would, if I have
*  a serious medical issue, I will absolutely want to talk to a human doctor and I will also absolutely
*  want to talk to AI. And I would feel that I'm missing out if I'm not getting the best, if I
*  did only one or the other. So I'm not recommending people move past the human doctor just yet,
*  but I am surprised that there hasn't been somebody, if only for just kind of the distribution and
*  strisand effect potential, who would come out and say, this is what we're doing. And there could be
*  a jurisdictional arbitrage angle to it as well, of course, that seemingly would make it kind of a
*  cool opportunity for someone. Well, what kind of related concept I think that we're seeing more
*  activity in is things around, therapy might be too strong, but just journals that talk back to you,
*  sort of things that help you with your mental health. I mean, I think one of the clear trends
*  the last 50 years is that, one, the stigma around things like therapy has really collapsed. And
*  two, it's sort of gone from something that was available or needed by a small number of people
*  to something that a lot of people want to have access to. And there's a shortage of therapists,
*  costs are enormously high. So I'm actually fairly optimistic that a product like that will really
*  break out. And look, if you spend time with the products, I've been using one called Rosebud,
*  which is really cool. And I know Justine has used a couple of them, or partner Olivia,
*  they're really satisfying, actually, you can learn a lot about yourself and get a lot of
*  feelings of wellbeing, which now feels weird to say, because you're chatting to a computer
*  and a chat box and yet the feelings are there. So something like that feels like it's going to
*  happen in the near term for sure. Yeah, you talk about weird, but working. So actually,
*  my latest afternoon, I've got Eugenia from Replica coming back for a second appearance
*  on the cognitive revolution. And they've recently put out a paper I'm sure you've seen that showed,
*  and this is actually basically pre-generative AI, that interaction with the app reduced suicidal
*  ideation for like 3% of the users that they studied. And this was in late 2021. So, you know,
*  this is we're talking pre-chat GPT here, right? Pretty remarkable. One thing that I worry about
*  in this sort of extreme speed with which everything is happening is, I think I look at
*  somebody like Eugenia, I think, Matt, she is the perfect person to do this, right? She came at this
*  from having felt a lot of loneliness in her own life and like a real deep concern for people that
*  are struggling with these issues. And she built something pre-AI, you know, one of the most
*  memorable things anybody said on this show to me was, we couldn't build a bot that could talk,
*  but we could make one that could listen. And, you know, just her empathy for that user profile
*  was, you know, cut above anybody else. And so she's, you know, been early to this space,
*  and she clearly really cares about her users. But now I'm like, geez, the app store is getting
*  crowded. And the sort of, you know, blitz scaling philosophy, obviously, like makes a lot of sense
*  for, you know, maximizing your return on investment, but does create some weird incentives
*  where if I'm trying to compete in the virtual friend space, like, I need to make that economic
*  flywheel work, right? I need to pay per click and I need to, you know, monetize and I need to kind of
*  hook people probably. So I wonder if you guys have a sort of companion framework to all this that
*  sort of governs me. I mean, we're headed for a regulation if we don't, you know, figure it out,
*  I feel as an industry ourselves and maybe anyway, but I'm kind of wondering, you know,
*  do you have some guidance for founders? Or do you have guidance for yourselves for like what
*  investments you wouldn't, you wouldn't want to make to try to make sure that people are
*  doing this work in a pro-social way. It's easy for me to imagine that we could end up in a sort of
*  parasitic or predatory dynamic. And that, you know, if people are paying per click for users,
*  that might even be the dominant strategy. So how do we avoid that trap? Which by the way,
*  I think will be the thing that brings regulation if it doesn't come, you know, for other reasons.
*  I think we've spent a ton of time in the companionship space. As you've mentioned,
*  started with a few products, ended up getting tons and tons of products, both on web,
*  things in the app stores, things getting banned from the app stores and going back to web or
*  telegram or discord. I think at the end of the day, it's consumers decide what products they want
*  to use and what they spend time on and where they spend money. And for us, we haven't really seen
*  these kind of like click-baity, scammy, not quality products, driving a lot of user acquisition,
*  engagement and retention over time. I think it's really easy to be judgmental about like,
*  I don't think people should be talking to a bot about these topics, or I don't think people
*  should be using a bot for this. And what we're looking for is more like kind of taking off the
*  lens of what we would or wouldn't do with the bot. What is adding value to someone else's life? Like,
*  we all have very different experiences and things that we struggle with. And so I think what we're
*  looking for is more like, is there a segment of users that are really engaged on this product?
*  Are they retaining on it? Are they spreading the word to their friends because it's adding value
*  in some way to their lives? And thus far, those have not been like, it gets pretty easy when you
*  download an app to see like, hey, this is like a poor quality model or the spot isn't really
*  listening to me. And it's just trying to get me to like upgrade to pro or click on ads or things
*  like that. Like kind of the consumer market sorts those things out over time and that the quality
*  products tend to rise to the top. I agree with all of that strongly. And I think the other thing is
*  like, if let's say we were PMs looking at this industry and we kind of said like, what's a proxy
*  metric? I actually think that the percentage of people who can leave a product feeling good
*  has been going up as a lot of the social and relationship products have evolved.
*  Like I might say Instagram is kind of a global popularity contest, right? And definitionally,
*  most people are not winning. And maybe it's still satisfying or on some level because people go back,
*  but I just, I feel like a lot of people probably, you know, walk away feeling not as good. I think
*  for TikTok, there's a bigger opportunity to participate. Like anyone that wants to do the
*  trend can participate and be creative. So more people can sort of walk away feeling cool. And
*  I bet you, if you looked at people using the existing companion apps, like even a far higher
*  number of them will walk away saying they're feeling really good and fulfilled by the experience. So
*  I think the kind of overall trend is really positive and we may see regulation, but I don't
*  think it's going to be because like users want to be in abusive relationships with companions.
*  How do you think that changes as we move toward more agentic products? I've recently been
*  doing what I call red teaming in public on a bunch of AI calling agent products and just seeing like,
*  what will they do? What will they not do? Spoiler, they'll basically all do anything. So if I say,
*  call and make a ransom demand and claim you've got this person's kid, they'll just do it. If I
*  clone a Donald Trump voice and say, go call these people and say, you've rethought your position on
*  immigration, you now support open borders. It'll call in the Trump voice and do it. It seems like
*  we are headed for a world where we are going to need some like governance on this or standards
*  or self-governance of some sort. I think there's a good argument, or at least a decent argument for,
*  okay, people are spending their own time, their own money, their own attention. We can trust them
*  to do that as adults. But as we create these more agentic things that sort of go out into society
*  or into group settings and interact with people who maybe don't even know that they're talking
*  to an AI, it seems like things are about to get even weirder. Maybe we're just not there yet to
*  worry about that, but how do you guys see that world starting to shape up? Number one, I think
*  that the intentions of the builders in the AI space are extremely positive. Everyone here is
*  trying to do good work that benefits everyone. So I think that's just an obvious but important
*  thing to state explicitly. Every time there is a technology change, of course, there's going to be
*  bad actors and ways to exploit the technology. But we're already seeing a lot of companies,
*  including our portfolio, trying to take deliberate steps to make it easy to understand, for example,
*  what is AI content and what is not. Look, I think the third point and what gets underestimated is
*  just this note about media literacy. For a generation that has not grown up with AI,
*  some of these things may feel hard to grok and indistinguishable, just like our parents can't
*  tell what's a spam email. You can tell what's a spam email. In the same way, I think the next
*  generation is going to have more literacy and intuition around what is AI. So I think that
*  the benefits dramatically outweigh the costs. Yeah, I believe that too, for what it's worth.
*  My biggest fear as an application developer myself is that we'll end up with GDPR for AI
*  before we've even got the benefits of AI. And that I think a little bit of self-governance
*  will be very helpful for us to avoid that, or at least postpone it to where we've built up the
*  portfolio of the actual good things that can hopefully carry the day. Do you want to put a
*  request for startups out there? Is there anything that you desperately want people to bring you?
*  Anything that's weird and working. Certainly anything that we've touched on in the deck. But
*  I think we try to be very intellectually humble about not presupposing what's going to work or
*  not. And we're just very excited to meet more founders and see what they're working on. So
*  yeah, come one, come all. I think exactly what Anish said. Nothing is too weird for us. Anything
*  that is a new, exciting, insightful take. Anything that people are like that feels like a Black Mirror
*  episode is probably something that we're interested in. All right. I love it. Weird and working Black
*  Mirror episodes. Come one, come all. This has been a lot of fun. I really appreciate the conversation
*  and I definitely look forward to doing it again. We could probably do it every few months with the
*  rate that things are going. So don't be strangers for now. I will say Anish Acharya and Justine
*  Moore, thank you for being part of the Cognitive Revolution. Thank you, Nathan. Good vibes today,
*  man. Can't wait to hear it. It is both energizing and enlightening to hear why people listen and
*  learn what they value about the show. So please don't hesitate to reach out via email at tcr
