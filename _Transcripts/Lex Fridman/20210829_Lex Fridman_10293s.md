# Wojciech Zaremba: OpenAI Codex, GPT-3, Robotics, and the Future of AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #215
**Lex Fridman:** [August 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5OD8MjYnOM)
*  The following is a conversation with Wojciech Zaremba,
*  co-founder of OpenAI,
*  which is one of the top organizations in the world
*  doing artificial intelligence research and development.
*  Wojciech is the head of language and cogeneration teams,
*  building and doing research on GitHub Copilot,
*  OpenAI Codex, and GPT-3 and who knows,
*  four, five, six, and, and, and plus one.
*  And he also previously led OpenAI's robotic efforts.
*  These are incredibly exciting projects to me
*  that deeply challenge and expand our understanding
*  of the structure and nature of intelligence.
*  The 21st century, I think, may very well be remembered
*  for a handful of revolutionary AI systems
*  and their implementations.
*  GPT, Codex, and applications of language models
*  and transformers in general to the language
*  and visual domains may very well be
*  at the core of these AI systems.
*  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors.
*  They're listed in the description.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast,
*  and here is my conversation with Wojciech Zaremba.
*  You mentioned that Sam Altman asked
*  about the Fermi paradox, and the people at OpenAI
*  had really sophisticated, interesting answers.
*  So that's when you knew this is the right team
*  to be working with.
*  So let me ask you about the Fermi paradox about aliens.
*  Why have we not found overwhelming evidence
*  for aliens visiting Earth?
*  I don't have a conviction in the answer,
*  but rather kind of probabilistic perspective
*  on what might be a, let's say, possible answer.
*  It's also interesting that the question itself
*  even can touch on your typical question
*  of what's the meaning of life?
*  Because if you assume that we don't see aliens
*  because they destroy themselves,
*  that kind of upweighs the focus on making sure
*  that we won't destroy ourselves.
*  But at the moment, the place where I am actually
*  with my belief, and these things also change over the time,
*  is I think that we might be alone in the universe,
*  which actually makes life more,
*  or let's say consciousness life, more kind of valuable.
*  And that means that we should more appreciate it.
*  Have we always been alone?
*  So what's your intuition about our galaxy, our universe?
*  Is it just sprinkled with graveyards
*  of intelligent civilizations, or are we truly,
*  is life, intelligent life, truly unique?
*  At the moment, I believe that it is unique,
*  but I would say I could also,
*  there was some footage released
*  with UFO objects, which makes me actually doubt
*  my own belief.
*  Yeah, I can tell you one crazy answer that I have heard.
*  So apparently when you look actually
*  at the limits of computation, you can compute more
*  if the temperature of the universe would drop down.
*  So one of the things that aliens might want to do
*  if they are truly optimizing to maximize amount of compute,
*  which maybe can lead to more, let's say simulations or so,
*  it's instead of wasting current entropy of the universe,
*  because we by living, we are actually
*  somewhat wasting entropy,
*  then you can wait for the universe to cool down
*  such that you have more computation.
*  That's kind of a funny answer.
*  I'm not sure if I believe in it,
*  but that would be one of the reasons
*  why you don't see aliens.
*  It's also possible to some people say that
*  maybe there is not that much point
*  in actually going to other galaxies if you can go inwards.
*  So there is no limits of what could be an experience
*  if we could connect machines to our brains,
*  while there are still some limits
*  if we want to explore the universe.
*  Yeah, there could be a lot of ways to go inwards too.
*  Once you figure out some aspect of physics
*  we haven't figured out yet,
*  maybe you can travel to different dimensions.
*  I mean, travel in three dimensional space
*  may not be the most fun kind of travel.
*  There may be just a huge amount of different ways to travel.
*  It doesn't require a spaceship going slowly
*  in 3D space to space time.
*  It also feels like one of the problems
*  is that speed of light is low and the universe is vast.
*  And it seems that actually most likely
*  if we want to travel very far,
*  then we would instead of actually sending spaceships
*  with humans that weight a lot,
*  we would send something similar to what Yuri Miller is working on.
*  These are like a huge sail which is at first powered,
*  there is a shot of laser from an earth
*  and it can propel it to a quarter of speed of light.
*  And the sail itself contains a few grams of equipment
*  and that might be the way to actually transport matter through the universe.
*  But then when you think what would it mean for humans,
*  it means that we would need to actually put their 3D printer
*  and 3D print a human on another planet.
*  I don't know, play them YouTube or let's say,
*  or like a 3D print like huge human right away
*  or maybe a womb or so.
*  With our current techniques of archaeology,
*  if a civilization was born and died,
*  long enough ago on earth, we wouldn't be able to tell.
*  And so that makes me really sad.
*  And so I think about earth in that same way.
*  How can we leave some remnants if we do destroy ourselves?
*  How can we leave remnants for aliens in the future to discover?
*  Like, here's some nice stuff we've done.
*  Like Wikipedia and YouTube,
*  do we have it like in a satellite orbiting earth with a hard drive?
*  Like, how do we say, how do we back up human civilization?
*  The good parts or all of it is good parts
*  so that it can be preserved longer than our bodies can.
*  That's a that's kind of a it's a difficult question.
*  It also requires the difficult acceptance of the fact that we may die.
*  And if we die, we may die suddenly as a civilization.
*  So let's see. I think it kind of depends on the cataclysm.
*  We have observed in other parts of the universe that birds of gamma rays
*  desire high energy rays of light that actually can apparently kill an entire galaxy.
*  So there might be actually nothing even to nothing to protect us from it.
*  I'm also when I'm looking actually at the past civilizations.
*  So it's like Aztecs or so.
*  They disappear from the surface of the earth.
*  And one can ask, why is it the case?
*  And. The way I'm thinking about it is,
*  you know, that definitely they had some problem that they couldn't solve.
*  And maybe there was a flood and all of a sudden they couldn't drink.
*  There was no potable water and they all died.
*  And I think that so far.
*  The best solution to such problems is, I guess, technology.
*  So, I mean, if they would know that you can just boil water and then drink it after.
*  Then that would save their civilization.
*  And even now, when we look actually at the current pandemic,
*  it seems that once again, actually, science comes to rescue.
*  And somehow science increases size of the action space.
*  And I think that's a good thing.
*  Yeah, but nature has a vastly larger action space.
*  But still, it might be a good thing for us to keep on increasing action space.
*  Well, OK, looking at past civilizations, yes.
*  But looking at the destruction of human civilization,
*  perhaps expanding the action space will add
*  actions that are easily acted upon,
*  easily executed and as a result, destroy us.
*  So let's see.
*  I was pondering why actually even we have negative impact on the globe,
*  because, you know, if you ask every single individual,
*  they would like to have clean air.
*  They would like healthy planet.
*  But somehow it actually is not the case that as a collective,
*  we are not going in this direction.
*  I think that there exists a very powerful system to describe what we value.
*  That's capitalism.
*  It assigns actually monetary values to various activities.
*  At the moment, the problem in the current system is that there are some things
*  which we value. There is no cost assigned to it.
*  So even though we value clean air or maybe we also
*  value lack of destruction on the Internet or so, at the moment,
*  these quantities, you know, companies, corporations can pollute them for free.
*  So in some sense,
*  I wished or like, and that's, I guess, purpose of politics to
*  to align the incentive systems.
*  And we are kind of maybe even moving in this direction.
*  The first issue is even to be able to measure the things that we value.
*  Then we can actually assign the monetary value to them.
*  Yeah. And that's so it's getting the data and also probably through technology,
*  enabling people to vote and to move money around
*  in a way that is aligned with their values.
*  And that's very much a technology question.
*  So like having one president and Congress
*  and voting that happens every four years or something like that,
*  that's a very outdated idea.
*  That could be some technological improvements to that kind of idea.
*  So I'm thinking from time to time about these topics, but it also feels to me
*  that it's it's a little bit like a it's hard for me to actually make
*  correct predictions. What is the appropriate thing to do?
*  I extremely trust Sam Altman, our CEO,
*  on these topics here.
*  I'm more on the side of being, I guess, naive hippie that
*  yeah, that's your life philosophy.
*  Well, I think self-doubt and.
*  I think hippie implies optimism.
*  Those those two things are pretty, pretty good way to operate.
*  I mean, still, it is hard for me to actually
*  understand how the politics works or like how this like
*  exactly how the things would play out.
*  And some is really excellent with it.
*  What do you think is rarest in the universe?
*  You said we might be alone.
*  What's hardest to build is another engineering way to ask that life,
*  intelligence or consciousness.
*  So like you said that we might be alone,
*  which is the thing that's hardest to get to.
*  Is it just the origin of life?
*  Is it the origin of intelligence?
*  Is it the origin of consciousness?
*  So let me at first explain you my kind of mental model,
*  what I think is needed for life to appear.
*  So I imagine that at some point there was this primordial
*  soup of amino acids and maybe some proteins in the ocean.
*  And, you know, some proteins were turning into some other proteins through reaction.
*  And you can almost think about this
*  cycle of what turns into what.
*  As there is a graph essentially describing which substance turns into some other substance.
*  And essentially life means that all the sudden in the graph has been created,
*  that cycle such that the same thing keeps on happening over and over again.
*  That's what is needed for life to happen.
*  And in some sense, you can think almost that you have this gigantic graph
*  and it needs like a sufficient number of edges for the cycle to appear.
*  Then from perspective of intelligence and consciousness,
*  my current intuition is that they might be quite intertwined.
*  First of all, it might not be that it's like a binary thing,
*  that you have intelligence or consciousness.
*  It seems to be a more continuous component.
*  Let's see, if we look, for instance, on the even networks recognizing images,
*  people are able to show that the activations of these networks
*  correlate very strongly with activations in visual cortex
*  of some monkeys.
*  The same seems to be true about language models.
*  Also, if you, for instance,
*  look, if you train agent in a 3D world,
*  at first, it barely recognizes what is going on.
*  Over the time, it kind of recognizes foreground from background.
*  Over the time, it kind of knows where there is a foot and it just follows it.
*  Over the time, it actually starts having a 3D perception.
*  So it is possible, for instance, to look inside of the head of an agent
*  and ask, what would it see if it looks to the right?
*  And the crazy thing is, initially, when the agents are barely trained,
*  these predictions are pretty bad.
*  Over the time, they become better and better.
*  You can still see that if you ask what happens when the head is turned by 360 degrees,
*  for some time, they think that the different thing appears.
*  And then at some stage, they understand actually that the same thing
*  is supposed to appear.
*  So they get an understanding of 3D structure.
*  It's also very likely that they have inside some level of
*  symbolic reasoning, particularly symbols for other agents.
*  So when you look at DOTA agents, they collaborate together
*  and they have some anticipation of if they would win battle.
*  They have some expectations with respect to other agents.
*  I might be too much anthropomorphizing how the things look for me.
*  But then the fact that they have a symbol for other agents makes me believe that
*  at some stage, as they are optimizing for skills, they would have also symbol to describe themselves.
*  This is a very useful symbol to have.
*  And this particularity, I would call it self-consciousness or self-awareness.
*  And still, it might be different from the consciousness.
*  So I guess the way how I'm understanding the word consciousness,
*  let's say the experience of drinking a coffee or, let's say, experience of being a bud,
*  that's the meaning of the word consciousness.
*  It doesn't mean to be awake.
*  Yeah, it feels it might be also somewhat related to memory and recurrent connections.
*  So it's kind of like if you look at anesthetic drugs, they might be
*  like they essentially they disturb brain waves such that maybe memories not form.
*  And so there's a lessening of consciousness when you do that.
*  Correct. And so that's the one way to intuit what is consciousness.
*  There's also kind of another element here.
*  It could be that it's, you know, this kind of self-awareness module that you described.
*  Plus, the actual subjective experience is a storytelling module
*  that tells us a story about what we're experiencing.
*  The crazy thing.
*  So let's say, I mean, in meditation, they teach people not to speak story inside of the head.
*  And there is also some fraction of population who doesn't have actually narrator.
*  I know people who don't have a narrator and, you know, they have to use external people
*  in order to kind of solve tasks that require internal narrator.
*  So it seems that it's possible to have the experience without the talk.
*  What are we talking about when we talk about the internal narrator?
*  Is that the voice when you like?
*  Yeah, I thought that that's what you are referring to.
*  Well, I was referring more on it, like.
*  Not an actual voice.
*  I meant like there is some kind of like subjective experience
*  feels like it's.
*  It's fundamentally about storytelling to ourselves.
*  It feels like.
*  Like the feeling is a story that is much,
*  much simpler abstraction than the raw sensory information.
*  So there feels like it's a very high level of abstraction that
*  is useful for me to feel like entity in this world.
*  Most useful aspect of it is that.
*  Because I'm conscious.
*  I think there's an intricate connection to me not wanting to die.
*  So like it's a useful hack to really prioritize not dying.
*  Like those seem to be somewhat connected.
*  So I'm telling the story of like it's rich.
*  He feels like something to be me and the fact that me exists in this world.
*  I want to preserve me.
*  And so that makes it a useful agent hack.
*  So I will just refer maybe to that first part,
*  as you said, about that kind of story of describing who you are.
*  I was thinking about it even.
*  So, you know, obviously, I I like thinking about consciousness.
*  I like thinking about the eye as well.
*  And I'm trying to see analogies of these things in a what would it correspond to?
*  So.
*  You know, openly, I train
*  a model called GPT, which can generate
*  pretty amusing text on arbitrary topic.
*  And and one way to control GPT
*  is by putting into prefix at the beginning of the text
*  some information, what would be the story about.
*  You can have even chat with,
*  you know, with GPT by saying that the chat is with Lex or Elon Musk or so.
*  And GPT would just pretend to be you or Elon Musk or so.
*  And it almost feels that this
*  story that we give ourselves to describe our life,
*  it's almost like things that you put into context of GPT.
*  Yeah, the primary is the ends.
*  But the context we provide to GPT is is multimodal.
*  It's more so GPT itself is multimodal.
*  GPT itself hasn't learned actually from experience of single human,
*  but from the experience of humanity is a chameleon.
*  You can turn it into anything.
*  And in some sense, by providing context,
*  it, you know, behaves as the thing that you wanted it to be.
*  And it's interesting that, you know, people have stories of who they are.
*  And as you said, these stories, they help them to operate in the world.
*  But it's also interesting,
*  because various people find it out through meditation or so that
*  there might be some patterns that you have learned
*  when you were a kid that actually are not serving you anymore.
*  And you also might be thinking that that's who you are.
*  And that's actually just a story.
*  Mm hmm. Yeah, so it's a useful hack, but sometimes it gets us into trouble.
*  It's a local optima. It's a local optima.
*  You wrote that Stephen Hawking, he tweeted,
*  Stephen Hawking asked what breathes fire into equations,
*  which meant what makes given mathematical equations
*  realize the physics of a universe?
*  Similarly, I wonder what breathes fire into computation.
*  What makes given computation conscious?
*  OK, so how do we engineer consciousness?
*  How do you breathe fire and magic into the machine?
*  So it seems clear to me that not every computation is conscious.
*  I mean, you can, let's say, just keep on multiplying one matrix over and over again.
*  And maybe gigantic matrix, you can put a lot of computation.
*  I don't think it would be conscious.
*  So in some sense, the question is, what are the computations
*  which could be conscious?
*  I mean, so one assumption is that it has to do purely with computation,
*  that you can abstract away matter.
*  Other possibilities there, it's very important, was the realization of computation,
*  that it has to do with some force fields or so, and they bring consciousness.
*  At the moment, my intuition is that it can be fully abstracted away.
*  So in case of computation, you can ask yourself,
*  what are the mathematical objects or so that could bring such properties?
*  So, for instance, if we think about the models,
*  AI models, what they truly try to do, or like models like GPT,
*  is, you know, they try to predict next word or so.
*  And this turns out to be equivalent to compressing text.
*  And because in some sense, compression means that you learn the model of reality
*  and you have just to remember where are your mistakes.
*  The better you are in predicting the...
*  And in some sense, when we look at our experience, also when you look,
*  for instance, at the car driving, you know in which direction it will go.
*  You are good in prediction.
*  And it might be the case that the consciousness is intertwined with compression.
*  It might be also the case that self-consciousness
*  has to do with compress or trying to compress itself.
*  So, I was just wondering what are the objects in, you know,
*  mathematics or computer science, which are mysterious,
*  that could have to do with consciousness.
*  And then I thought, you know, you see in mathematics,
*  there is something called Gadel theorem, which means,
*  if you have sufficiently complicated mathematical system,
*  it is possible to point the mathematical system back on itself.
*  In computer science, there is something called halting problem.
*  It's somewhat similar construction.
*  So, I thought that, you know, if we believe that
*  under assumption that consciousness has to do with compression,
*  then you could imagine that as you keep on compressing things,
*  then at some point it actually makes sense for the compressor to compress itself.
*  Metacompression.
*  Yeah.
*  Consciousness is metacompression.
*  That's an idea.
*  And in some sense, you know, the crazy.
*  Thank you.
*  So, but do you think if we think of a Turing machine, a universal Turing machine,
*  can that achieve consciousness?
*  So is there something beyond our traditional definition of computation that's required?
*  So it's a specific computation.
*  And I said this computation has to do with compression.
*  And the compression itself, maybe other way of putting it is like
*  you're internally creating the model of reality in order.
*  Like you try insight to simplify reality in order to predict what's going to happen.
*  And that also feels somewhat similar to how I think actually about my own conscious experience.
*  So clearly, I don't have access to reality.
*  The only access to reality is through, you know, cable going to my brain.
*  And my brain is creating a simulation of reality and I have access to the simulation of reality.
*  Are you by any chance aware of the Hutter Prize, Marcus Hutter?
*  He he made this prize for compression of Wikipedia pages.
*  And there's a few qualities to it.
*  One, I think, has to be perfect compression, which makes I think that little quirk
*  makes it much less applicable to the general task of intelligence,
*  because it feels like intelligence is always going to be messy.
*  Like perfect compression is feels like is not the right goal,
*  but it's nevertheless a very interesting goal.
*  So for him, intelligence equals compression.
*  And so the smaller you make the file, given a large Wikipedia page,
*  the more intelligent the system has to be.
*  And that makes sense.
*  So you can make perfect compression if you store errors.
*  And I think that actually what he meant is you have algorithm plus errors.
*  By the way, who Hutter is, he was a PhD advisor of Schenleck,
*  who is a DeepMind co-founder.
*  Yeah, yeah. So there's an interesting and now he's a DeepMind.
*  There's an interesting network of people.
*  He's one of the people that I think seriously took on the task of
*  what would an AGI system look like?
*  I think for a longest time, the question of AGI was not taken seriously
*  or rather rigorously.
*  And he did just that.
*  Like mathematically speaking, what would the model look like?
*  If you remove the constraints of it having to be
*  having to have a reasonable amount of memory,
*  reasonable amount of running time, complexity, computation time,
*  what would it look like?
*  And essentially it's a half math, half philosophical discussion of
*  how would it like a reinforcement learning type of framework look like for an AGI?
*  Yeah, so he developed the framework even to describe what's optimal with respect
*  to reinforcement learning.
*  Like there is a theoretical framework, which is, as you said, under assumption,
*  there is infinite amount of memory and compute.
*  There was actually one person before his name is Solomonov.
*  Hutter extended Solomonov work to reinforcement learning.
*  But there exists a theoretical algorithm, which is optimal algorithm to build
*  intelligence. And I can actually explain you the algorithm.
*  Yes, let's go.
*  Let's go. So the task itself, you can.
*  Can I just pause how absurd it is for a brain in a skull trying to explain
*  the algorithm for intelligence?
*  Just go ahead. It is pretty crazy.
*  It is pretty crazy that, you know, the brain itself is actually so small and it can
*  ponder how to design algorithms that optimally solve the problem of intelligence.
*  OK, so what's the algorithm?
*  So let's see.
*  So first of all, the task itself is described as you have infinite sequence of
*  zeros and ones. OK, you read n bits and you are about to predict n plus one bit.
*  So that's the task.
*  And you could imagine that every task could be casted as such a task.
*  So if, for instance, you have images and labels, you can just turn every image into
*  a sequence of zeros and ones, then label, you concatenate labels and you and that
*  that's actually the end.
*  You could you could start by having training data first and then afterwards you
*  have test data.
*  So theoretically, any problem could be casted as a problem of predicting zeros
*  and ones on this infinite tape.
*  So, so let's say you read already n bits and you want to predict n plus one bit.
*  And I will ask you to write every possible program that generates these n bits.
*  OK, so and you can have you choose programming language.
*  It can be Python or C++.
*  And the difference between programming languages might be there is a difference by
*  constant asymptotically.
*  Your predictions will be equivalent.
*  So you read n bits, you enumerate all the programs that produce these n bits in
*  their output. And then in order to predict n plus one bit, you actually wait the
*  programs according to their length.
*  And there is some specific formula how you wait them.
*  And then the n plus one bit prediction is the prediction from each of these
*  program according to that weight.
*  Like statistically, statistically, you pick the smaller the program, the more
*  likely you you're to pick the its output.
*  So that's that algorithm is grounded in the hope or the intuition that the simple
*  answer is the right one.
*  It is a formalization of it.
*  Yeah.
*  And it also means like if you would ask the question after how many years would,
*  you know, sun explode, you can say it's more likely the answer is due to some
*  power because they're shorter program.
*  Yeah.
*  And then other why I don't have a good intuition about how different the space
*  of short programs are from the space of large programs.
*  Like, what is the universe where short programs like run things?
*  So as I said, the things have to agree with n bits.
*  So even if you have you, you need to start, okay, if if you have very short
*  program and they're like a feel some has if it's not perfect with prediction of n
*  bits, you have to start errors.
*  What are the errors?
*  And that gives you the full program that agrees on n bits.
*  Oh, so you don't agree perfectly with the n bits and you store.
*  That's like a longer, longer program, slightly longer program, because it
*  contains these extra bits of errors.
*  That's fascinating.
*  What's what's your intuition about the programs that are able to do cool stuff
*  like intelligence and consciousness?
*  Are they perfectly like, is it is there if then statements in them?
*  So like, is there a lot of exceptions that they're storing?
*  So you could imagine if there would be tremendous amount of statements, then
*  they wouldn't be that short in case of neural networks.
*  You could imagine that what happens is they when you start with an
*  initialized neural network, it stores internally many possibilities how the
*  problem can be solved.
*  And HDD is kind of magnifying some some some paths which are slightly similar to
*  the correct answer.
*  So it's kind of magnifying correct programs.
*  And in some sense, HDD is the search algorithm in the program space and the
*  represented by, you know, kind of the wiring inside of the neural network.
*  And there's like an insane number of ways how the features can be computed.
*  Let me ask you the high level basic question.
*  That's not so basic.
*  What is deep learning?
*  Is there a way you'd like to think of it that is different than like a generic
*  textbook definition?
*  The thing that I hinted just a second ago is maybe that closest to how I'm
*  thinking these days about deep learning.
*  So the statement is neural networks can represent some programs.
*  Seems that various modules that we are actually adding up to, like, you know, we
*  want networks to be deep because we want multiple steps of the computation.
*  And deep learning provides the way to represent space of programs, which is
*  searchable.
*  And it's searchable with stochastic gradient descent.
*  So we have an algorithm to search over a humongous number of programs and gradient
*  descent kind of bubbles up the things that tend to give correct answers.
*  So a neural network with fixed weights, that's optimized.
*  Do you think of that as a single program?
*  So there is a work by Christopher Ollach where he works on interpretability of
*  neural networks.
*  And he was able to identify inside of the neural network, for instance, a
*  detector of a wheel for a car or the detector of a mask for a car.
*  And then he was able to separate them out and assemble them together using a simple
*  program for the detector, for a car detector.
*  That's like if you think of traditionally defined programs, that's like a function
*  within a program that this particular neural network was able to find.
*  And you can tear that out just like you can copy and paste from Stack Overflow.
*  So any program is a composition of smaller programs.
*  Yeah, I mean, the nice thing about the neural networks is that it allows the
*  things to be more fuzzy than in case of programs.
*  In case of programs, you have this like a branching this way or that way.
*  And the neural networks, they have an easier way to be somewhere in between or
*  to share things.
*  What do you use the most beautiful or surprising idea in deep learning and the
*  utilization of these neural networks?
*  Which, by the way, for people who are not familiar, neural networks is a bunch of,
*  what would you say?
*  It's inspired by the human brain.
*  There's neurons.
*  There's connection between those neurons.
*  There's inputs and there's outputs and there's millions or billions of those
*  neurons. And the learning happens by adjusting the weights on the edges that
*  connect these neurons.
*  Thank you for giving definitions that I supposed to do it.
*  But I guess you have enough empathy to listeners to actually know that that
*  might be useful.
*  No, that's like some asking Plato of like, what is the meaning of life?
*  He's not going to answer.
*  You're being philosophical and deep and quite profound talking about the space of
*  programs, which is just very interesting.
*  But also people just not familiar with the hell we're talking about when we talk
*  about deep learning.
*  Anyway, sorry.
*  What is the most beautiful or surprising idea to you in in in all the time you've
*  worked at deep learning and you worked on a lot of fascinating projects,
*  applications of neural networks?
*  It doesn't have to be big and profound.
*  It can be a cool trick.
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking about the trick, but like it's still amusing to me
*  that it works at all.
*  Yeah.
*  That let's say that the extremely simple algorithm stochastic gradient descent,
*  which is something that I would be able to derive on the piece of paper to high
*  school student when put at the scale of thousands of machines actually can create
*  the behaviors which we called kind of human like behaviors.
*  So in general, any application is stochastic gradient descent to neural networks
*  is is amazing to you.
*  So that or is there a particular application in natural language,
*  reinforcement learning?
*  And also, what do you attribute that success to?
*  Is it just scale?
*  What profound insight can we take from the fact that the thing works for
*  gigantic sets of variables?
*  I mean, the interesting thing is these algorithms, they were invented decades
*  ago and people actually gave up on the idea.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, back then they thought that we need profoundly different
*  algorithms and they spent a lot of cycles on very different algorithms.
*  And I believe that, you know, we have seen that various innovations that say
*  like transformer or dropout or so they can, you know, pass the help.
*  But it's also remarkable to me that this algorithm from 60s or so, or I mean, you
*  can even say that the gradient descent was invented by Leibniz in, I guess, 18th
*  century or so, that actually is the core of learning.
*  In the past, people are it's almost like out of the maybe an ego.
*  People are saying that it cannot be the case that such a simple algorithm is there,
*  you know, could solve complicated problems.
*  So they were in search for the other algorithms.
*  And as I'm saying, like, I believe that actually we are in the game where there
*  are actually, frankly, three levers.
*  There is compute, there are algorithms and there is data.
*  And if we want to build intelligent systems, we have to pull all three
*  levers and they are actually multiplicative.
*  And it's also interesting.
*  So yes, is it only compute?
*  People internally, they did the studies to determine how much gains they were
*  coming from different levers.
*  And so far we have seen that more gains came from compute than algorithms.
*  But also we are in the world that in case of compute, there is a kind of, you
*  know, exponential increase in funding.
*  And at some point it's impossible to invest more.
*  It's impossible to, you know, invest 10 trillion dollars.
*  We are speaking about the, let's say, all taxes in U.S.
*  But you're talking about money that could be innovation in the compute.
*  That's that's true as well.
*  So, I mean, there are like a few pieces.
*  So one piece is human brain is an incredible supercomputer.
*  And they're like a.
*  It has a hundred trillion parameters.
*  Or like if you try to count various quantities in the brain, they're like a
*  neuron synapses, that small number of neurons, there is a lot of synapses.
*  It's unclear even how to map synapses to the parameters of neural networks, but
*  it's clear that there are many more.
*  Yeah.
*  So it might be the case that our networks are still somewhat small.
*  It also might be the case that they are more efficient than brain or less
*  efficient by some by some huge factor.
*  I also believe that there will be like, you know, at the moment we are at the
*  stage that these neural networks, they require 1000X or like a huge factor of
*  more data than humans do, and it will be a matter of there will be algorithms that
*  vastly decrease sample complexity.
*  I believe so, but the place where we are heading today is there are domains which
*  contains million X more data, and even though computers might be 1000 times
*  slower than humans in learning, that's not the problem.
*  Like for instance, I believe that it should be possible to create super
*  human therapies by, and they're like even simple steps of doing it.
*  And you know, the core reason is there is just machine will be able to read way
*  more transcripts of therapies and then it should be able to speak simultaneously
*  with many more people and it should be possible to optimize it all in parallel.
*  And well, there's now you're touching on something I deeply care about and think
*  is way harder than we imagine.
*  Um, what's the goal of a therapist?
*  What's the goal of therapies?
*  Hmm.
*  So, okay.
*  So one goal.
*  Now this is terrifying to me, but there's a lot of people that contemplate suicide,
*  self-affirmed depression, uh, and they could significantly be helped with therapy.
*  And the idea that an AI algorithm might be in charge of that.
*  It's like a life and death task.
*  It's a, the stakes are high.
*  So one goal for a therapist, whether human or AI is to prevent suicide ideation,
*  to prevent suicide.
*  How do you achieve that?
*  So let's see.
*  So to be clear, I don't think that the current models are good enough for such
*  a task because it requires insane amount of understanding and patting.
*  And the models are far from this place, but it's, but do you think that
*  understanding empathy, that signal is in the data?
*  Um, I think there is some signal in the data.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, there are plenty of transcripts of conversations and it is possible to,
*  it is possible from it to understand personalities.
*  It is possible from it to understand, uh, if conversation is, uh, friendly,
*  uh, amicable, uh, uh, antagonistic.
*  It is, I believe that the, you know, given the fact that the models that we
*  train now, they can, uh, they can have, they are chameleons that they can have
*  any personality, they might turn out to be better in understanding, uh, personality
*  of other people than anyone else.
*  And they should be empathetic.
*  Yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  Uh, but I wonder if there's some level of, uh, multiple modalities required
*  to be able to, um, be empathetic as a human experience, whether language is
*  not enough to understand death, to understand fear, to understand, uh,
*  childhood trauma, to understand, uh, wit and humor required when you're dancing
*  with a person who might be depressed or suffering both humor and hope and love
*  and all those kinds of things.
*  So there's another underlying question, which is self-supervised versus supervised.
*  So can you get that from the data by just reading a huge number of transcripts?
*  I actually, so I think that reading huge number of transcripts is a step one.
*  It's like the same way as you cannot learn to dance if just from YouTube.
*  By watching it, you have to actually try it out yourself.
*  And so I think that here that's a similar situation.
*  I also wouldn't deploy the system in the high stakes situations right away, but
*  kind of see gradually where it goes.
*  And, uh, obviously initially, uh, it would have to go hand in hand with humans.
*  But, uh, at the moment we are in the situation that actually there is many
*  more people who actually would like to have a therapy or speak with, with someone.
*  Then there are therapies out there.
*  I can, you know, I was so, so fundamentally I was thinking, what are the things that,
*  uh, can vastly increase people?
*  Well-being therapy is one of them.
*  Being meditation is other one.
*  I guess maybe human connection is a third one.
*  And I guess pharmacologically it's also possible, maybe direct brain
*  stimulation or something like that.
*  But these are pretty much options out there.
*  Then let's say the way I'm thinking about the AGI endeavor is by default, that's an
*  endeavor to increase amount of wealth.
*  And I believe that we can vastly increase amount of wealth for everyone.
*  And simultaneously.
*  So, I mean, there are like two endeavors that make sense to me.
*  One is like essentially increase amount of wealth.
*  And second one is, uh, increase overall human wellbeing.
*  And those are coupled together.
*  And they can, I would say these are different topics.
*  One can help another.
*  And, uh, you know, therapist is a funny word because I see friendship and love as
*  therapy. I mean, so therapist broadly defined as just friendship as a friend.
*  So like therapist is, has a very kind of clinical sense to it, but what is human
*  connection?
*  You're like, uh, not to get all Camus and Dusty, yes.
*  Ski on you, but you know, life is suffering and we draw, we seek connection
*  with other humans as we, uh, desperately try to make sense of this world in a
*  deep, overwhelming loneliness that we feel inside.
*  So I think connection has to do with understanding.
*  And I think that almost like a lack of understanding causes suffering.
*  If you speak with someone and do you, do you feel ignored that actually causes
*  pain?
*  If you are feeling deeply understood that actually they, they might not even
*  tell you what to do in life, but like a pure understanding or just being heard.
*  Understanding is a kind of, that's a lot, you know, just being heard, feel like
*  you're being heard, like somehow that's a alleviation temporarily of the
*  loneliness that if somebody knows you're here with their body language, with the
*  way they are, with the way they look at you, with the way they talk, do you feel
*  less alone for a brief moment?
*  Yeah, very much agree.
*  So I thought in the past about, um, somewhat similar question to yours, which
*  is what is love, uh, rather what is connection.
*  And, um, and obviously I think about these things from AI perspective.
*  What would it mean?
*  Um, so I said that, um, you know, intelligence has to do with some compression,
*  which is more or less like, you can say almost understanding of what is going
*  around.
*  It seems to me that, uh, other aspect is there seem to be reward functions and
*  you can have a, uh, you know, reward for, uh, food for maybe human connection for,
*  uh, let's say warmth, uh, sex and so on.
*  And, um, and it turns out that, uh, various people might be optimizing slightly
*  different, uh, reward functions.
*  They essentially might care about different things.
*  And, um, uh, in case of, uh, love at least the love between two people, you
*  can say that, uh, um, you know, boundary between people dissolves to such extent
*  that, uh, they end up optimizing each other reward functions.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  Um, celebrate the success of each other.
*  Yeah.
*  In some sense, I would say love means, uh, helping others to optimize their
*  reward functions, not your reward functions, not the things that you think
*  are important, but the things that the person cares about, you try to help them
*  to optimize it.
*  So love is, uh, if you think of two reward functions, you just, it's a
*  condition, you combine them together.
*  Yeah, pretty much.
*  Maybe like with a weight and it depends like the dynamic of the relationship.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you could imagine that if you are fully optimizing someone's reward
*  function without yours, then, then maybe are creating codependency or something
*  like that, I'm not sure what's the appropriate way, but the interesting
*  thing is I even, I even think that the individual person, uh, uh, we ourselves,
*  we are actually less of a unified insight.
*  So for instance, if you look at, at the donut on the one level, you might think,
*  Oh, this is like, it looks tasty.
*  I would like to eat it.
*  On other level, you might tell yourself, I shouldn't be doing it because, uh, I
*  want to gain muscles.
*  So, and you know, you might do it regardless, kind of against yourself.
*  So it seems that even within ourselves, they're almost like a kind of intertwined
*  personas and, um, I believe that the self love means that, uh, the love
*  between all these personas, which also means being able to love, love, uh,
*  yourself when we are angry or stress or so combining all those reward functions
*  of the different selves you have.
*  Yeah.
*  And accepting that they are there.
*  Like, uh, you know, often people, they have a negative self-talk or they say,
*  I don't like when I'm angry and like, I tried to imagine, try to imagine if there
*  would be like a small baby, like a five years old angry, angry, and then they are
*  like, you shouldn't be angry, like a stop being angry, but like, instead,
*  actually you want the legs to come over, give him a hug and this, like I say,
*  it's fine.
*  Okay.
*  Is you can be angry as long as you want.
*  And then he would stop.
*  Or, or maybe not, or maybe not, but you cannot expect it even.
*  Yeah.
*  But still that doesn't explain the why of love.
*  Like why is love part of the human condition?
*  Why is it useful to combine the reward functions?
*  It seems like that doesn't, I mean, I don't think reinforcement learning
*  frameworks can give us answers to why even, even the harder framework has
*  an objective function that's static.
*  So we came to existence as a consequence of evolutionary process.
*  And in some sense, the purpose of evolution is survival.
*  And then the, this complicated optimization objective baked into us,
*  let's say compression, which might help us, uh, operate in the real world.
*  And it baked into us, various reward functions.
*  Yeah.
*  And then to be clear at the moment, we are operating in the regime, which
*  is somewhat out of distribution where the even evolution optimized us.
*  It's almost like love is a consequence of a cooperation that
*  we've discovered is useful.
*  Correct.
*  In some way it's even the case.
*  If you, I just love the idea that love is like the out of distribution.
*  Or it's not out of distribution.
*  It's like, as you said, it evolved for cooperation.
*  Yes.
*  And I believe that the cop, like a, in some sense, cooperation ends up
*  helping each of us individually.
*  So it makes sense evolutionary.
*  And there is a, in some sense, and you know, love means there is
*  this dissolution of boundaries that you have a shared reward function.
*  And we evolved to actually identify ourselves with larger groups.
*  So we, we can identify ourselves, you know, with a family, we can identify
*  ourselves with a country to such extent that people are willing to
*  give away their life for country.
*  And so there is, we are wired actually even for love.
*  And at the moment, I guess the, maybe it would be somewhat more beneficial
*  if you will, if we would identify ourselves with all the humanity as a whole.
*  So, so you can clearly see when people travel around the world, when they
*  run into person from the same country, they say, Oh, which city you are.
*  And all this, like all of a sudden they find all these similarities.
*  They, they, they find some, they befriended those folks earlier than others.
*  So there is like a sense, some sense of the belonging.
*  And I would say, I think it would be overall good thing to the world for
*  people to move towards, I think it's even called open individualism, move
*  toward the mindset of a larger and larger groups.
*  So the challenge there, that's a beautiful vision.
*  I share it to expand that circle of empathy, that circle of love towards
*  the entirety of humanity, but then you start to ask, well, where do you draw
*  the line because why not expand it to other conscious beings?
*  And then finally, for our discussion, something I think about is why
*  not expand it to AI systems?
*  Like we, we start respecting each other when the, the person, the entity on
*  the other side has the capacity to suffer.
*  Cause then we develop a capacity to sort of empathize.
*  And so I could see AI systems that are interacting with humans more and
*  more having conscious like displays.
*  So like they display consciousness through language and through other means.
*  And so then the question is like, well, is that consciousness?
*  Because they're acting conscious.
*  And so, you know, the reason we don't like torturing animals is because they
*  look like they're suffering when they're tortured and if AI looks like it's
*  suffering when it's tortured, how's that not requiring of the same kind of
*  empathy from us and respect and rights that animals do and other humans do.
*  I think it requires empathy as well.
*  I mean, I would like guess us or humanity or so make a progress in
*  understanding what consciousness is because I don't want just to be
*  speaking about the philosophy, but rather actually make a scientific.
*  Uh, to have a, like, you know, there was a time that people thought that there
*  is a force of life and the things that have this force, they are alive.
*  Mm hmm.
*  And, um, I think that there is actually a path to understand
*  exactly what consciousness is.
*  And, um, and in some sense, it might require essentially putting probes
*  inside of a human brain, what neural link, uh, does.
*  So the goal there, I mean, there's several things with consciousness
*  that make it a real discipline, which is one is rigorous measurement of
*  consciousness and then the other is the engineering of consciousness, which
*  may or may not be related.
*  I mean, you could also run into trouble.
*  Like for example, in the United States, for the department, DOT,
*  department of transportation and a lot of different places,
*  put a value on human life.
*  I think DOT is, uh, values $9 million per person.
*  Sort of in that same way, you can get into trouble if you put a number on
*  how conscious a being is, because then you can start making policy.
*  If a cow is a 0.1 or like, um, 10% as conscious as a human, then you can
*  start making calculations and it might get you into trouble, but then again,
*  that might be a very good way to do it.
*  I would like, uh, to move to that place that actually we have scientific
*  understanding what consciousness is.
*  Yeah.
*  And then we'll be able to actually assign value.
*  And I believe that there is even the path for the experimentation in, uh, in it.
*  So, uh, you know, we said that, you know, you could put the
*  probes inside of the brain.
*  There is actually few other things that you could do with devices like Neuralink.
*  So you could imagine that the way even to measure if AI system is conscious is by
*  literally just plugging into the brain.
*  And I mean, that assumes that it's kind of easy, but the plugging into the
*  brain and asking person if they feel that their consciousness expanded,
*  um, this direction, of course, has some issues.
*  You can say, you know, if someone takes a psychedelic drug, they might feel that
*  their consciousness expanded, even though that drug itself is not conscious.
*  Right.
*  So like, you can't fully trust the self-report of a person saying their,
*  their consciousness is expanded or not.
*  Let me ask you a little bit about psychedelics.
*  As a, there've been a lot of excellent research on, uh, different psychedelics,
*  psilocybin, MDMA, even DMT drugs in general, marijuana too.
*  Uh, what do you think psychedelics do to the human mind?
*  It seems they take the human mind to some interesting places.
*  Is that just a little, uh, hack, a visual hack, or is there some
*  profound expansion of the mind?
*  So let's see.
*  I don't believe in magic.
*  I believe in, uh, I believe in, uh, in science, in, in causality.
*  Um, still let's say, and then as I said, like, I think that the brain, that
*  the, our subjective experience of reality is, uh, we live in the simulation
*  run by our brain and the simulation that our brain runs, they can be
*  very pleasant or very hellish.
*  Drugs, they are changing some hyperparameters of the simulation.
*  It is possible thanks to change of these hyperparameters to actually look back
*  on your experience and even see that the given things that we took for granted,
*  they are changeable.
*  So they allow to have a, an amazing perspective.
*  There is also, for instance, the fact that after DMT people can see the
*  full movie inside of their head gives me further belief that the brain can
*  generate that full movie, that the brain is actually learning the model of reality
*  to such extent that it tries to predict what's going to happen next.
*  Yeah.
*  Very high resolution.
*  So it can replay realities.
*  Extremely high resolution.
*  Yeah.
*  It's also kind of interesting to me that somehow there seems to be some
*  similarity between these drugs and meditation itself.
*  And I actually started even these days to think about meditation as a psychedelic.
*  Do you practice meditation?
*  I practice meditation.
*  I mean, I once few times on the retreats and it feels after like after second or
*  third day of meditation, there is a, there is almost like a sense of, you know,
*  tripping.
*  What, what does a meditation retreat entail?
*  So you wake up early in the morning and you meditate for extended period of time.
*  And alone.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's optimized, even though there are other people, it's optimized for isolation.
*  So you don't speak with anyone.
*  You don't actually look into other people's eyes and you know, you sit on the chair.
*  So the Vipassana meditation tells you to focus on the breath.
*  So you try to put all the, all attention into breathing and breathing in and breathing out.
*  And the crazy thing is that as you focus attention like that, after some time,
*  there's some starts coming back like some memories that you're completely forgotten.
*  It almost feels like that you have a mailbox and then you know, you are just like a
*  archiving email one by one.
*  And at some point, at some point there is this like a amazing feeling of getting to
*  mailbox zero, zero emails.
*  And it's very pleasant.
*  It's kind of, it's crazy to me that once you resolve these inner stories or like inner
*  traumas, then once there is nothing left, the default state of human mind is extremely
*  peaceful and happy.
*  Extreme like some sense it feels that it feels at least to me in the way how when I
*  was a child that I can look at any object and it's very beautiful.
*  I have a lot of curiosity about the simple things and that's the very usual.
*  And meditation takes me.
*  Are you, what are you experiencing?
*  Are you just taking in simple sensory information and are just enjoying the rawness
*  of that sensory information?
*  So there's no, there's no memories or all that kind of stuff.
*  You're just enjoying being.
*  Yeah, pretty much.
*  I mean, still there is a, that it's, it's thoughts are slowing down.
*  Sometimes they pop up, but it's also somehow the extended meditation takes you to the
*  space that they are way more friendly, way more positive.
*  There is also this, this thing that we've extrac, it almost feels that the, it almost
*  feels that we are constantly getting a little bit of a reward function and we are just
*  spreading this reward function on various activities.
*  But if you stay still for extended period of time, it kind of accumulates, accumulates,
*  accumulates.
*  And there is a, there is a sense, there is a sense that some point it passes some threshold
*  and it feels as drop is falling into kind of ocean of love and bliss.
*  And that's like a, this is like a very pleasant and that's what I'm saying.
*  Like a, that corresponds to the subjective experience.
*  Some people, I guess in spiritual community, they describe it that that's the reality.
*  And I would say, I believe that there are like all sorts of subjective experience that
*  one can have.
*  And I believe that for instance, meditation might take you to the subjective experiences,
*  which are very pleasant, collaborative.
*  And I would like a word to move the word, a more collaborative place.
*  Yeah.
*  I would say that's very pleasant and I enjoy doing stuff like that.
*  I, I wonder how that maps to your mathematics and your, your, your, your, your, your, your
*  mathematical model of love with the reward function, combining a bunch of things.
*  It seems like our life then is we're just, we have this reward function and we're
*  accumulating a bunch of stuff in it with weights.
*  It's like, um, like multi objective and what meditation is, is you just remove them,
*  until the weight on one or just a few is very high.
*  And that's where the pleasure comes from.
*  Yeah.
*  So something similar, how I'm thinking about it.
*  So I told you that there is this like a, that there is a story of who you are.
*  And I think almost about it as a, you know, texts prepended to GPT.
*  Yeah.
*  And the other, some people refer to it as ego.
*  Okay.
*  It's like a story who, who, who you are.
*  Okay.
*  So ego is the prompt for GPT three, GPT.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  And that's description of you.
*  And then with meditation, you can get to the point that actually you experience
*  things without the prompt and the experience things like as they are, you
*  are not biased over the description, how they supposed to be.
*  Uh, that's very pleasant.
*  And then we've respected the reward function.
*  Uh, it's possible to get to the point that there is the solution of self.
*  And therefore you can say that the, or you are having a yard or like a, your
*  brain attempts to simulate the reward function of everyone else or like
*  everything that's that there is this like a love, which feels like a
*  oneness with everything.
*  And that's also, you know, very beautiful, very pleasant at some point.
*  You might have a lot of altruistic thoughts during that moment.
*  And then the self always comes back.
*  How would you recommend if somebody is interested in meditation, like a big
*  thing to take on as a project, would you recommend a meditation retreat?
*  How many days, what kind of thing would you recommend?
*  I think that actually retreat is the way to go.
*  Um, it almost feels that, um, so I said like a meditation is a psychedelic, but,
*  uh, when you take it in the small dose, you might barely feel it.
*  Once you get the high dose, actually you're going to feel it.
*  Um, so even cold turkey, if you haven't really seriously meditated for a
*  prolonged period of time, just go to a retreat.
*  Yeah.
*  How many days, how many days?
*  Just start the weekend one weekend.
*  So like two, three days.
*  And it's like, it's interesting that first or second day it's hard.
*  And at some point it becomes easy.
*  There's a lot of seconds in a day.
*  How hard is the meditation retreat?
*  Just sitting there in a chair.
*  So the thing is actually, it literally just depends on your, uh, on the, your
*  own framing, like if you are in the mindset that you are waiting for it to be over, or
*  you are waiting for Nirvana to happen, it will be very unpleasant.
*  And in some sense, even the difficulty, it's not even in the lack of being
*  able to speak with others, like you're sitting there, your legs will hurt from
*  sitting in terms of like the practical things.
*  Do you experience kind of discomfort, like physical discomfort of just sitting,
*  like your, your butt being numb, your legs being sore, all that kind of stuff.
*  Yes.
*  You experience it.
*  And then the, the, they teach you to observe it rather than it's like a, the
*  crazy thing is you at first might have a feeling toward trying to escape it.
*  And that becomes very apparent that that's extremely unpleasant.
*  And then you just, just observe it.
*  And at some point it, it just becomes, uh, it just is.
*  It's like, uh, I remember that we've, Ilya told me some time ago that, uh, you
*  know, he takes a cold shower and his mindset of taking a cold shower was to.
*  Embrace suffering.
*  Yeah.
*  Excellent.
*  I do the same.
*  Does they are style?
*  Yeah.
*  It's my style.
*  Like this.
*  So my style is actually, I also sometimes take cold showers.
*  It is purely observing how the water goes through my body, like a purely being
*  present, not trying to escape from there.
*  Yeah.
*  And I would say then it actually becomes pleasant.
*  It's not like, well, that's interesting.
*  Um, I, I, I'm also that, I mean, that's, that's the way to deal with anything
*  really difficult, especially in the physical space is to observe it, to say
*  it's pleasant.
*  Hmm.
*  It's a, I would use a different word.
*  You're, um, you're accepting of the full beauty of reality.
*  I would say, cause say pleasant, but yeah, in some sense it is pleasant.
*  That's the only way to deal with a cold shower is to, to become an observer and
*  defined joy in it.
*  Um, same with like really difficult physical, um, exercise or like running for
*  a really long time endurance events.
*  Anytime you're exhaled, any kind of pain, I think the only way to survive it is
*  not to resist it is to observe it.
*  You mentioned Ilja, Ilja Siskar.
*  It was very, he's our chief scientist, but also he's very close friend of mine.
*  He co-founded open AI with you.
*  I've spoken with him a few times.
*  He's brilliant.
*  I really enjoyed talking to him.
*  Uh, his mind, just like yours works in fascinating ways.
*  Now, both of you are not able to define deep learning simply.
*  What's it like having him as somebody you have technical discussions with on
*  in space and machine learning, deep learning AI, but also life.
*  What's it like when these two, um, agents get into a self-play situation in a
*  room, what's it like collaborating with him?
*  So I believe that we have, uh, extreme, uh, respect to each other.
*  So, um, in, I love Ilja's insight, both like, uh, I guess about consciousness,
*  uh, life AI, but, uh, in terms of the, it's interesting to me because you're a
*  brilliant, uh, thinker in the space of machine learning, like intuition, like
*  digging deep in what works, what doesn't, why it works, why it doesn't.
*  And so is Ilja.
*  I'm wondering if there's interesting deep discussions you've had with him in
*  the past or disagreements that were very productive.
*  So I can say, I also understood over the time where are my strengths.
*  So obviously we have plenty of AI discussions and, um, and, you know, I
*  myself have plenty of ideas, but like, I consider Ilja, uh, one of the most
*  prolific AI scientists in the entire world.
*  And, uh, I think that, um, I realized that maybe my super skill, um, is, uh,
*  being able to bring people to collaborate together, that I have some level of
*  empathy that is unique in AI world.
*  And that might come, you know, from either meditation, psychedelics, or let's
*  say I read just hundreds of books on this topic.
*  So, and I also went through a journey of, you know, I develop all sorts of algorithms.
*  So I think that maybe I can, that's my super human skill.
*  Uh, Ilja is, uh, one of the best AI scientists, but then I'm pretty good in
*  assembling teams and I'm also not holding to people like I'm growing people and then
*  people become managers at OpenAI, like many of them, like a research managers.
*  So you, you find, you find places where you're excellent and he finds like his,
*  his, his deep scientific insights is where he is and you find ways you can,
*  the puzzle pieces fit together.
*  Correct.
*  Like, uh, you know, ultimately, for instance, let's say Ilja, he doesn't manage
*  people, uh, that's not what he likes or so.
*  Um, I like, I like hanging out with people.
*  Uh, by default, I'm an extrovert and I care about people.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  Okay.
*  Cool.
*  So that, that fits perfectly together.
*  I, but I mean, uh, I also just like your intuition about various
*  problems in machine learning.
*  He, he's definitely one I really enjoy.
*  I remember talking to him about something I was struggling with, which is coming up
*  with a good model for pedestrians, for human beings across the street in the
*  context of autonomous vehicles.
*  And he immediately started to like formulate a framework within which you
*  can evolve a model for pedestrians, like through self play, all that kind of
*  mechanisms, the depth of thought on a particular problem, especially problems
*  he doesn't know anything about is fascinating to watch.
*  It makes you realize like, um, yeah, the, the, the limits of the, that the
*  human intellect might be limitless.
*  I was just impressive to see a descendant of ape come up with clever ideas.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, so even in the space of deep learning, when you look at various
*  people, there are people who invented some breakthroughs once, but there are
*  very few people who did it multiple times.
*  And you can think if someone invented it once, that might be just a
*  Sherlock and if someone invented it multiple times, you know, if a
*  probability of inventing it once is one over a million, then probability of
*  inventing it twice or three times would be one over a million square or, or to
*  the power of three, which would be just impossible.
*  So it literally means that it's, it's given that it's not the luck.
*  Yeah.
*  And Ilya is one of these few people who, uh, uh, who have a lot of
*  these inventions in his arsenal.
*  It also feels that, um, you know, for instance, if you think about folks
*  like Gauss or Euler, uh, you know, at first they read a lot of books and then
*  they did thinking and then they figure out math and that's how it feels with
*  Ilya, you know, at first he read stuff and then like he spent his thinking cycles.
*  And that's a really good way to put it.
*  When I talked to him, I, I see thinking.
*  He's actually thinking, like he makes me realize that there's like deep
*  thinking that the human mind can do.
*  Like most of us are not thinking deeply.
*  Uh, like you really have to put in a lot of effort to think deeply.
*  Like I have to really put myself in a place where I think deeply about a
*  problem and takes a lot of effort.
*  It's like, uh, it's like an airplane taking off or something.
*  You have to achieve deep focus.
*  He, he's just, uh, he's what is it?
*  His brain is like a vertical takeoff in terms of airplane analogy.
*  So it's interesting, but it, I mean, Cal Newport talks about this
*  as ideas of deep work.
*  It's, you know, most of us don't work much at all in terms of like, like
*  deeply think about particular problems, whether it's a math, engineering,
*  all that kind of stuff, you want to go to that place often and that's real
*  hard work and some of us are better than others at that.
*  So I think that the big piece has to do with actually even engineering
*  your environment such that it's conducive to that.
*  So, um, see both Ilya and I, uh, on the frequent basis, we kind of disconnect
*  ourselves from the world in order to be able to do extensive amount of thinking.
*  Yes.
*  So Ilya usually he just, uh, leaves iPad at hand.
*  He loves his iPad.
*  And, uh, for me, I'm even sometimes, you know, just going for a few days to
*  different location to Airbnb, I'm turning off my phone and there is no access to me.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, that's extremely important for me to be able to actually just formulate
*  new thoughts, to do deep work rather than to be reactive and the older I am, the
*  more of this like a random tasks are at hand.
*  Before I go onto that thread, let me return to our friend GPT.
*  And let me ask you another ridiculously big question.
*  Can you give an overview of what GPT three is, or like you say in your
*  Twitter bio GPT and plus one, how it works and why it works?
*  So, um, GPT tree is a human goes neural network.
*  Um, let's assume that we know what is neural network.
*  And it is trained on the entire internet and just to predict next words.
*  So let's say it sees part of the article and the only task that it has at hand, it
*  is to say what would be the next word and what would be the next word.
*  And it becomes a really exceptional at the task of figuring out what's the next word.
*  So you might ask why would this be an example of a neural network?
*  And you might ask why would this be an important task?
*  Why would it be important to predict what's the next word?
*  And it turns out that a lot of problems can be formulated as a text completion problem.
*  So GPT is purely learning to complete the text.
*  And you could imagine, for instance, if you are asking a question, who is
*  the president of United States, then GPT can give you an answer to it.
*  It turns out that many more things can be formulated this way.
*  You can format text in the way that you have sent us in English.
*  You make it even look like some content of a website elsewhere, which would be
*  teaching people how to translate things between languages.
*  So it would be EN colon, uh, text in English, FR colon.
*  And then you, uh, uh, and then you ask people, and then you ask model to continue.
*  And it turns out that the, such a model is predicting translation from English to
*  French. The crazy thing is that this model can be used for way more sophisticated tasks.
*  So you can format text such that it looks like a conversation between two people.
*  And that might be a conversation between you and Elon Musk.
*  And because the model read all the texts about Elon Musk, it will be able to
*  predict Elon Musk words as it would be Elon Musk.
*  It will speak about colonization of Mars, about sustainable future and so on.
*  And it's also possible to, to even give arbitrary personality to the model.
*  You can say, here is a conversation with a friendly AI bot and the model will
*  complete the text as a friendly AI bot.
*  So, I mean, how do I express how amazing this is?
*  So just to clarify a conversation, generating a conversation between me and
*  Elon Musk, it wouldn't just generate good examples of what Elon would say.
*  It would get the syntax all correct.
*  So like interview style, it would say like Elon colon and Lex colon.
*  Like it, it's not just like, uh, inklings of, um, semantic correctness.
*  It's like the whole thing grammatical, syntactic, semantic.
*  It's just really, really impressive.
*  Uh, generalization.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I also want to, you know, provide some caveats.
*  So it can generate few paragraphs of coherent text, but as you go to a longer
*  pieces, it, uh, it actually goes off the rails.
*  Okay.
*  If you would, uh, try to write a book, it won't work out this way.
*  What way does it go off the rails?
*  By the way, is there interesting ways in which it goes off the rails?
*  Like what falls apart first?
*  So the model is trained on that all the existing data, uh, that is out there,
*  which means that it is not trained on its own mistakes.
*  So for instance, if it would make a mistake, then, uh, I kept, so
*  to give you, give you an example.
*  So let's say I have a conversation with a model pretending that is Elon Musk.
*  And then I start putting some, uh, I'm start actually making up
*  things which are not factual.
*  Um, I would say Twitter, but I got you.
*  Sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, okay.
*  Uh, I don't know.
*  I would say that Elon is my wife and the model will just keep on carrying it on.
*  And as if it's true.
*  Yes.
*  And in some sense, if you would have a normal conversation with
*  Elon, he would be what the fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  There would be some feedback between.
*  So the model is trained on things that humans have written, but through the
*  generation process, there's no human in the loop feedback.
*  Correct.
*  That's fascinating.
*  Make sense.
*  So it's magnified.
*  It's like the errors get magnified and magnified.
*  And it's, it's also interesting.
*  I mean, first of all, humans have the same problem.
*  It's just that we, uh, we'll make fewer errors and magnify the errors slower.
*  I think that the, actually what happens with humans is if you have a wrong
*  belief about the world as a kid, then very quickly we'll learn that it's not
*  correct because they are grounded in reality and they are learning
*  from your new experience.
*  Yes.
*  But do you think the model can correct itself too?
*  Won't it through the power of the representation?
*  And so the absence of Elon Musk being your wife, information on the
*  internet won't to correct itself.
*  There won't be examples like that.
*  So the errors will be subtle at first.
*  Saddle at first.
*  And in some sense, you can also say that the data that is not out there is a
*  data which would represent how that human learns as an N and maybe model
*  would be learned trained on such a data.
*  Then it would be better off.
*  How intelligent is GPT three?
*  Do you think like, when you think about the nature of intelligence, it seems
*  exceptionally impressive.
*  But then if you think about the big AGI problem, is this footsteps
*  along the way to AGI?
*  So, um, let's see.
*  Seems that intelligence itself is there are multiple axis of it.
*  And, uh, I would expect that, uh, the systems that we are building, they
*  might end up being superhuman on some axis and subhuman on some other axis.
*  It would be surprising to me on all axis, simultaneously, they
*  would become superhuman.
*  Um, of course people ask this question, is GPT a spaceship that, that would take
*  us to the moon or are we putting a building a ladder to heaven that we are
*  just building bigger and bigger ladder.
*  And we don't know in some sense, uh, which one of these two
*  which one is better.
*  I'm trying to, I like stairway to heaven.
*  It's a good song.
*  So I'm not exactly sure which one is better, but you're saying like the, the
*  spaceship to the moon is actually effective.
*  Correct.
*  So people who criticize GPT, they say, yeah, guys just building a taller, a
*  ladder and it will never reach the moon.
*  And, uh, at the moment, I would say the way I'm thinking is, this is
*  like a scientific question and I'm also in heart, I'm a builder creator.
*  And like, I'm thinking, let's try out, let's see how far it goes.
*  And so far we see constantly that there is a progress.
*  Yeah.
*  So do you think GPT four, GPT five, GPT and plus one will, um, there'll be a
*  phase shift, like a transition to a place where we'll be truly surprised.
*  Then again, like GPT three is already very like truly surprising.
*  The people that criticize GPT three as a stair, as a, what is it?
*  Ladder to heaven.
*  I think too quickly get accustomed to how impressive it is that the prediction
*  of the next word can achieve such depth of semantics, accuracy of
*  syntax, grammar, and semantics.
*  Um, do you, do you think GPT four and five and six will continue to surprise us?
*  I mean, definitely there will be more impressive models.
*  There is a question, of course, if there will be a phase shift and, uh,
*  there are also even the way I'm thinking about the, about these models is that
*  then when we build these models, you know, we see some level of the capabilities,
*  but we don't even fully understand everything that the model can do.
*  And actually one of the best things to do is to allow other people to
*  probe the model, to even see what is possible.
*  Hmm.
*  Hence the using GPT as an API and opening it up to the world.
*  Yeah.
*  So when I'm thinking from perspective of, okay, there like a, obviously
*  various people are that have concerns about AGI, including myself.
*  Um, and then when I'm thinking from perspective, what's the strategy even
*  to deploy these things to the word, then the one strategy that I have seen many
*  times working is the iterative deployment that you deploy, um, slightly better
*  versions and you allow other people to criticize you.
*  So you actually are tried out.
*  You see where are their fundamental issues and it's almost, you don't want
*  to be in that situation that you are holding into powerful system and there's
*  like a huge overhang, then you deployed and it might have a random chaotic impact
*  on the word.
*  So you actually want to be in the situation that they are gradually deploying systems.
*  I asked this question of Ilya.
*  Let me ask you, uh, you this question.
*  I've been reading a lot of questions about this.
*  I've been reading a lot about Stalin and power.
*  If you're in possession of a system that's like AGI, that's exceptionally powerful.
*  Do you think your character and integrity might become corrupted?
*  Like famously power corrupt and absolute power corrupts.
*  Absolutely.
*  So I believe that the, you want at some point to work toward distributing the
*  power.
*  I think that the, you want to be in the situation that actually AGI is not
*  controlled by a small number of people, uh, but, uh, essentially, uh, by a larger
*  collective.
*  So the thing is that requires a George Washington style move in the ascent to
*  power.
*  There's always a moment when somebody gets a lot of power and they have to have
*  the integrity and, uh, the moral compass to give away that power that humans have
*  been good and bad throughout history at this particular step.
*  And I wonder, I wonder we like blind ourselves in, uh, for example, between
*  nations, a race, uh, towards, um, yeah, AI race between nations.
*  We might blind ourselves and justify to ourselves the development of AI without
*  distributing the power because we want to defend ourselves against China, against
*  Russia, that kind of, that kind of logic.
*  And, um, I wonder how we, um, how we design governance mechanisms that, um,
*  prevent us from becoming power hungry and in the process destroying ourselves.
*  So let's see.
*  I have been thinking about this topic quite a bit, but I also want to admit
*  that, uh, once again, I actually want to rely way more on some outman on it.
*  He wrote and, uh, he wrote an excellent block on how even to distribute wealth.
*  Um, and he's propo, he proposed in his block, uh, to tax, uh, equity of the
*  companies rather than profit and to distribute it.
*  And this is, this is an example of, uh, Washington move.
*  I guess I personally have insane trust in some here already spent plenty of money
*  running, uh, universal basic income, uh, project that like, um, gives me, I guess,
*  maybe some level of trust to him, but I also, I guess love him as a friend.
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder because we're sort of summoning a new set of technologies.
*  I wonder if we'll be, um, cognizant like you're describing the process of open AI,
*  but it could also be at other places like in the U S government, right?
*  Uh, both China and the U S are now full steam ahead on autonomous
*  weapons systems development.
*  And that's really worrying to me because in the framework of something being a
*  national security danger or a military danger, you can do a lot of pretty dark
*  things that, uh, blind our moral compass.
*  And I think AI will be one of those things.
*  Um, in some sense, the, the mission and the work you're doing at open AI is
*  like the counterbalance to that.
*  So you want to have more open AI and less autonomous weapons systems.
*  I, I, I like this statements.
*  Like to be clear, like this interesting and I'm thinking about it myself, but,
*  uh, this is a place that I, I, I put my trust actually in some hands because it's
*  extremely hard for me to reason about it.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, one important statement to make is, um, it's good to think about this.
*  Yeah.
*  No question about it.
*  No question.
*  Even like low level quote unquote engineer, like there's such a, I remember
*  I programmed a car, uh, RC car, they went really fast, like 30, 40 miles an hour.
*  And I remember I was like sleep deprived.
*  So I programmed it pretty crapily and it like, uh, the code froze.
*  So it's doing some basic computer vision and it's going around on track, but
*  it's going full speed and, uh, there was a bug in the code that, uh, the car just
*  went, it didn't turn, it went straight full speed and smash into the wall.
*  And I remember thinking the seriousness with which you need to approach the
*  design of artificial intelligence systems and the programming of artificial
*  intelligence systems is high because the consequences are high, like that
*  little car smashing into the wall.
*  For some reason, I immediately thought of like an algorithm that controls
*  nuclear weapons, having the same kind of bug.
*  And so like the lowest level engineer and the CEO of a company all need to have
*  the seriousness in approaching this problem and thinking about the
*  worst case consequences.
*  So I think that is true.
*  I mean, what I also recognize in myself and others even asking this question is
*  that it evokes a lot of fear.
*  And, um, fear itself ends up being actually quite debilitating.
*  The place where I arrived at the moment might sound cheesy or so, but it's almost
*  to build things out of love rather than fear.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, I can focus on how, uh, I can, you know, maximize the value, how the
*  systems that I'm building might be, uh, useful.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Uh, I'm not saying that the fear doesn't exist out there and like, uh, it
*  totally makes sense to minimize it, but I don't want to be working because, uh,
*  I'm scared.
*  I want to be working out of passion, out of curiosity, out of the, you know,
*  uh, looking forward for the positive future.
*  With, uh, the definition of love arising from a rigorous practice of empathy.
*  So not just like your own conception of what is good for the world, but, uh,
*  always listening to others.
*  Correct.
*  Like at the love where I'm considering group or functions of others, others
*  to limit to infinity is like a sum of like one to N where N is a 7 billion
*  or whatever it is not, not projecting my reward functions on others.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Can we just take a step back to something else?
*  Super cool, which is a open air codex.
*  Can you give an overview of what open air codex and GitHub copilot is?
*  How it works and why the hell it works so well.
*  So with GPT tree, we noticed that the system, uh, you know, that system
*  train on all the language out there started having some rudimentary
*  coding capabilities.
*  So we're able to ask it, uh, you know, to implement addition function
*  between two numbers and indeed it can write Python or JavaScript code for that.
*  And then we thought, um, we might as well just go full steam ahead and try to
*  create a system that is actually good at what we are doing every day ourselves,
*  which is programming.
*  We optimize models for proficiency in coding.
*  We actually even created models that both have a comprehension of language and
*  code and codex is API for these models.
*  So it's first pre-trained on language and then I don't know if you can say
*  fine tuned because there's a lot of code, but it's language and code.
*  It's language and code.
*  It's also optimized for various things.
*  I can, let's say low latency and so on.
*  Codex is the API, the similar to GPT tree.
*  We expect that there will be proliferation of the potential products
*  that can use coding capabilities.
*  And I can, I can speak about it in the second.
*  Copilot is the first product and developed by GitHub.
*  So as we're building, uh, models, we wanted to make sure that these
*  models are useful and we work together with GitHub on building the first product.
*  Copilot is actually as you code, it suggests you code completions.
*  And we have seen in the past, there are like a various tools that can suggest
*  how to like a few characters of the code or a line of code.
*  The thing about Copilot is it can generate 10 lines of code.
*  You it's often the way how it works is you often write in the comment,
*  what do you want to happen because people in comments, they
*  describe what happens next.
*  So, um, these days when I code instead of going to Google to search, uh, for
*  the appropriate code to solve my problem, I say, oh, for this array, could you
*  smooth it and then, you know, it imports some appropriate libraries.
*  That's like it uses noon pi convolution or so I, that I was not even aware that
*  exists and he does the appropriate thing.
*  Um, so you, uh, you write a comment, maybe the header of a function
*  and it completes the function.
*  Of course, you don't know what is the space of all the possible
*  small programs that can generate.
*  What are the failure cases?
*  How many edge cases, how many subtle errors there are, how many big errors
*  there are, it's hard to know, but the fact that it works at all on, in a
*  large number of cases is incredible.
*  It's like, uh, it's a kind of search engine into code that's been written on the internet.
*  Correct.
*  So for instance, when you search things online, then usually you get to
*  the, some particular case, like if you go to stack overflow and people
*  describe that one particular situation, uh, and then they seek for a solution.
*  But in case of a copilot, it's aware of your entire context and in context is,
*  Oh, these are the libraries that they are using.
*  That's the set of the variables that is initialized and on the spot, it can
*  actually tell you what to do.
*  So the interesting thing is, and we think that the copilot is one possible
*  product using codecs, but there is a place for many more.
*  So internally we tried out, you know, to create other fun products.
*  So it turns out that a lot of tools out there, let's say Google calendar or
*  Microsoft word or so, they all have a internal API to build plugins around it.
*  So there is a way in the sophisticated way to control calendar or Microsoft word.
*  Today, if you want, if you want more complicated behaviors from these
*  programs, you have to add a new button for every behavior, but it is possible
*  to use codecs and tell for instance, to calendar, uh, could you schedule an
*  appointment with blacks next week after 2pm and either writes corresponding piece
*  of code and that's the thing that actually you want.
*  So interesting.
*  So the way you figure out is there's a lot of programs with which you can
*  interact through code and so there you can generate that code from natural
*  language that's fascinating.
*  And that's somewhat like also closest to what was the promise of Siri or Alexa.
*  So previously all these behaviors, they were had hard coded and it seems that
*  codecs on the fly can pick up the API of, let's say given software and then it can
*  turn language into use of this API.
*  Without hard coding, you can find, it can translate to machine language.
*  Correct.
*  To, uh, so for example, this would be really exciting for me, like for, um,
*  Adobe products like Photoshop, uh, which I think action script, I think there's a
*  scripting language that communicates with them, same with premiere.
*  And do you could imagine that that allows even to do coding by voice on your phone?
*  So for instance, in the past, okay, as of today, I'm not editing word documents on
*  my phone because it's just the keyboard is too small, but if I would be able to
*  tell, uh, to my phone, you know, uh, make the header large, then move the
*  paragraphs around and it does actually what I want.
*  So I can tell you one more cool thing or even how I'm thinking about codecs.
*  So if you look actually at the evolution of, uh, of computers, we started with a
*  very primitive interfaces, which is a punch card and punch card.
*  So surely you make a holes in the, in the plastic card to indicate zeros and ones.
*  And, uh, during that time, there was a small number of specialists who
*  were able to use computers.
*  And by the way, people even suspected that there is no need for many
*  more people to use computers.
*  Um, but then we moved from punch cards to at first assembly, then C and these
*  programming languages, they were slightly higher level, they allowed many more
*  people to code and they also, uh, led to more of a proliferation of technology.
*  And, uh, you know, further on, there was a jump to say from C plus plus to
*  Java and Python, and every time it has happened, more people are able to code
*  and we build more technology and it's even, you know, hard to imagine now if
*  someone will tell you that you should write code in assembly instead of, let's
*  say, Python or Java or JavaScript.
*  And, um, codecs is yet another step toward kind of bringing computers closer
*  to humans such that you communicate with a computer with your own language rather
*  than with a specialized language.
*  And, uh, I think that it will lead to an increase of number of people who can code.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, and the kind of technologies that those people will create is, it's
*  innumerable, it could, you know, it could be a huge number of technologies.
*  We're not predicting at all because that's less and less requirement of, uh,
*  having a technical mind, a programming mind.
*  You're not opening it to the world of, um, other kinds of minds, creative minds,
*  artistic minds, all that kind of stuff.
*  I would like, for instance, biologists who work on DNA to be able to program
*  and not to need to spend a lot of time, uh, learning it.
*  And I, I believe that's a good thing to the world.
*  And I would actually add, I would add.
*  So at the moment I'm a managing codecs team and also language team.
*  And I believe that there is like a plenty of brilliant people out there
*  and they should apply.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Awesome.
*  So what's the language in the codecs?
*  So those are kind of their overlapping teams.
*  So it's like GPT, the raw language, and then the codecs is like applied to programming.
*  Correct.
*  And they are quite intertwined.
*  There are many more teams involved making these models extremely efficient and
*  deployable, for instance, there are people who are working to, you know, make our
*  data centers amazing, or there are people who work on putting these models into
*  production or, or even pushing it at the very limit of the scale.
*  So all aspects from, from the infrastructure to the actual machine.
*  So I'm just saying there are multiple teams while the, and the team working on
*  codecs and language, I guess I'm, I'm directly managing them.
*  I would love, I would love to hire.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're interested in machine learning, this is probably one of the most exciting
*  problems and like systems to be working on is it's actually, it's pretty cool.
*  Like what, what the program synthesis, like generating a programs is very
*  interesting, very interesting problem that has echoes of reasoning and
*  intelligence in it.
*  And I think there's a lot of fundamental questions that you might be able to
*  sneak, sneak up to by generating programs.
*  Yeah.
*  That one more exciting thing about the programs is that, so I said that the,
*  you know, the, in case of language, that one of the travels is even evaluating
*  so when the things are made up, you, you need somehow, either a human to, to say
*  that this doesn't make sense or so in case of program, there is this one extra
*  lever that we can actually execute programs and see what they evaluate to.
*  So that process might be somewhat more automated in, in order to improve the
*  qualities of generations.
*  That's fascinating.
*  So like the, wow, that's really interesting.
*  So, so for the language, the, you know, the simulation to actually execute it
*  as a human mind for programs, there is a, there is a computer on which you can
*  evaluate it.
*  Wow.
*  That's a brilliant little insight that the thing compiles and runs.
*  That's first.
*  And second, you can evaluate on a, like do automated unit testing.
*  And in some sense, it seems to me that we'll be able to make a tremendous
*  progress, you know, we are in the paradigm that there is way more data and there is
*  like a transcription of millions of, of software engineers.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So, I mean, you just mean, cause I was going to ask you about reliability.
*  The thing about programs is you don't know if they're going to like a program
*  that's controlling a nuclear power plant has to be very reliable.
*  So I wouldn't start with controlling nuclear power plant.
*  Can I be one day?
*  But that's not actually, that's not on the current roadmap.
*  That's not the step one.
*  And you know, it's the Russian thing.
*  You just want to go to the most powerful destructive thing right away.
*  Run by JavaScript, but I got you.
*  So this is a lower impact, but nevertheless, what you make me realize it
*  is possible to achieve some levels of reliability by doing testing.
*  And you could, you could imagine that, you know, maybe there are ways for model to
*  write even code for testing itself and so on.
*  And there exists a ways to create a feedback loops that the model
*  could keep on improving by writing programs that generate tests for instance.
*  And that's how we get consciousness because it's meta compression.
*  That's what you're going to write.
*  That's the comment.
*  That's the prompt that generates consciousness.
*  Compressor of compressors.
*  You just write that.
*  Do you think the code that generates consciousness will be simple?
*  So let's see.
*  I mean, ultimately the core idea behind will be simple, but there will be also
*  decent amount of engineering involved.
*  Like in some sense, it seems that, you know, spreading these models on many
*  machines, it's not that trivial.
*  Yeah.
*  And we find all sorts of innovations that make our models more efficient.
*  I believe that first models that I guess are conscious of like a truly intelligent,
*  they will have all sorts of tricks.
*  But then again, there's a, which is sudden argument that maybe the tricks are
*  temporary things.
*  Yeah, they might be temporary things.
*  And in some sense, it's also even important to, you know, to make sure that
*  to know that even the cost of a trick.
*  So sometimes people are eager to put the trick while forgetting that there is a
*  cost of maintenance or like a long-term cost, long-term cost or maintenance or
*  maybe even flexibility of code to actually implement new ideas.
*  So even if you have something that gives you two X, but it requires, you know,
*  1000 lines of code, I'm not sure if it's actually worth it.
*  So in some sense, you know, if it's five lines of code and two X, I would take it.
*  And, and we, we, we see many of this, but also, you know, that requires some level
*  of, I guess, lack of attachment to code that we are willing to remove it.
*  Yeah.
*  So you led the open AI robotics team.
*  Can you give an overview of the cool things you're able to accomplish?
*  What are you most proud of?
*  So when we started robotics, we knew that actually reinforcement learning works
*  and it is possible to solve fairly complicated problems.
*  Like for instance, AlphaGo is an evidence that it is possible to, to
*  build superhuman Go players.
*  Dota2 is an evidence that it's possible to build superhuman agents playing Dota.
*  So I asked myself a question, you know, what about robots out there?
*  Could we train machines to solve arbitrary tasks in the physical world?
*  Our approach was, I guess, let's pick a complicated problem that if we would
*  solve it, that means that we made some significant progress in the domain.
*  And then we went after the problem.
*  So we noticed that actually the robots out there, they are kind of
*  at the moment optimized per task.
*  So you can have a robot that it's like, if you have a robot opening a battle,
*  it's very likely that the end factor is that battle opener.
*  And, and in some sense, that's a hack to be able to solve a task,
*  which makes any task easier.
*  And I asked myself, so what would be a robot that can actually solve many tasks?
*  And we conclude that, that like human hands have such a quality that indeed
*  they are, you know, you have five kinds of tiny arms attached individually.
*  They can manipulate pretty broad spectrum of objects.
*  So we went after a single hand, like a trying to solve Rubik's cube
*  single-handed, we pick this task because we thought that there is no way to
*  hard code it. And it's also, we picked a robot on which it would be hard to
*  hard code it. And we went after the solution such that it could
*  generalize to other problems.
*  And just to clarify, it's one robotic hand solving the Rubik's cube.
*  The hard part is in the solution to the Rubik's cube is the manipulation of the
*  of like having it not fall out of the hand, having it use the five baby arms
*  to what is it like rotate different parts of the Rubik's cube to achieve the
*  solution. Correct.
*  Yeah. So what, what was the hardest part about that?
*  What was the approach taken there?
*  What are you most proud of?
*  Obviously, we have like a strong belief in reinforcement learning.
*  And, you know, one path it is to do reinforcement learning in the real world.
*  Other path is to the simulation.
*  In some sense, the tricky part about the real world is at the moment, our
*  models, they require a lot of data.
*  There is essentially no data.
*  And I think we decided to go through the path of the simulation.
*  And in simulation, you can have infinite amount of data.
*  The tricky part is the fidelity of the simulation.
*  And also, can you in simulation represent everything that you represent otherwise
*  in the real world? And, you know, it turned out that that, you know, because
*  there is lack of fidelity, it is possible to what we what we arrived at is training
*  a model that doesn't solve one simulation, but it actually solves the entire range of
*  simulations, which vary in terms of like, what's the exactly the friction of the
*  cube or weight or so.
*  And the single AI that can solve all of them ends up working well with the reality.
*  How do you generate the different simulations?
*  So, you know, there's plenty of parameters out there.
*  We just pick them randomly.
*  And an in simulation model just goes for thousands of years and keeps on solving
*  Rubik's Cube in each of them.
*  And the thing is that neural network that we used, it has a memory and as it presses,
*  for instance, the side of the of the cube, it can sense, oh, that's actually this side
*  was difficult to press.
*  I should press it stronger.
*  And throughout this process kind of learns even how to how to solve this particular
*  instance of the Rubik's Cube.
*  It's kind of like, you know, sometimes when you go to a gym and after after bench press,
*  you try to lift the glass and you kind of forgot and your head goes like right away
*  because kind of you got used to maybe different weight and it takes a second to adjust.
*  Yeah.
*  And this kind of of a memory, the model gained through the process of interacting with the
*  cube in the simulation.
*  I appreciate you speaking to the audience with the bench press, all the bros in the
*  audience probably working out right now.
*  There's probably somebody listening to this actually doing bench press.
*  So maybe put the bar down and pick up the water bottle and you'll know exactly what
*  what check is talking about.
*  OK, so what what was the hardest part of getting the whole thing to work?
*  So the hardest part is at the moment when it comes to physical work, when it comes to
*  robots, they require maintenance.
*  It's hard to replicate a million times.
*  It's also it's hard to replay things exactly.
*  I remember this situation that one guy at our company, he had like a model that performs
*  way better than other models in solving Rubik's Cube.
*  And, you know, we kind of didn't know what's going on, why is that?
*  And it turned out that, you know, he was running it from his laptop that had better
*  CPU or better, maybe local GPU as well.
*  And because of that, there was less of a latency and the model was the same.
*  And that actually made solving Rubik's Cube more reliable.
*  So in some sense, there might be some subtle bugs like that when it comes to running
*  things in the real world.
*  Even hinting on that, you could imagine that the initial models you would like to have
*  models, which are insanely huge neural networks, and you would like to give them even more
*  time for thinking.
*  And when you have these real time systems, then you might be constrained actually by
*  the amount of latency.
*  And ultimately, I would like to build a system that it is worth for you to wait five
*  minutes because it gives you the answer that you are willing to wait for five minutes.
*  So latency is a very unpleasant constraint under which to operate.
*  Correct. And also, there is actually one more thing which is tricky about robots.
*  There is actually not much data.
*  So the data that I'm speaking about would be data of first person experience from the
*  robot and like gigabytes of data like that.
*  It would have gigabytes of data like that of robot solving various problems.
*  It would be very easy to make progress on robotics.
*  And you can see that in case of text or code, there is a lot of data like a first person
*  perspective data on writing code.
*  Yeah, so you had this you mentioned this really interesting idea that if you were to
*  build like a successful robotics company, so open as mission is much bigger than
*  robotics. This is one of the one of the things you worked on.
*  But if it was a robotics company that you wouldn't so quickly dismiss supervised
*  learning. Correct.
*  That you would build a robot that was perhaps what like an empty shell like dumb and
*  they would operate under teleoperation.
*  So you would invest.
*  That's just one way to do it.
*  Invest in human super like direct human control of the robots as it's learning.
*  And over time, add more and more automation.
*  That's correct. So let's say that's how I would build a robotics company today.
*  If I would be building robotics company, which is, you know, spend 10 million dollars or
*  so recording human trajectories controlling a robot.
*  After you find.
*  A thing that the robot should be doing that there's a market fit for, like you can make
*  a lot of money with that product.
*  Correct, correct. Yeah.
*  So I would record data and then I would essentially train supervised learning model on
*  it. That might be the path today.
*  Long term, I think that actually what is needed is to train powerful models over video.
*  So you have seen maybe a models that can generate images like Dali and people are looking
*  into models generating videos.
*  They're like a body's algorithmic questions even how to do it.
*  And it's unclear if there is enough compute for this purpose.
*  But I suspect that the models that which would have a level of understanding of video,
*  same as GPT has a level of understanding of text, could be used to train robots to solve
*  tasks. They would have a lot of common sense.
*  If one day, I'm pretty sure one day there will be a robotics company.
*  By robotics company, I mean the primary source of income is from robots that is worth over
*  one trillion dollars.
*  What do you think that company will do?
*  I think sell driving cars.
*  It's interesting because my mind went to personal robotics robots in the home.
*  It seems like there's much more market opportunity there.
*  I think it's very difficult to achieve.
*  I mean, this this this might speak to something important, which is I understand self-driving
*  much better than understand robotics in the home.
*  So I understand how difficult it is to actually solve self-driving to a level, not just the
*  actual computer vision and the control problem and just the basic problem of driving, but
*  creating a product that would undeniably be that would cost less money.
*  Like it would save you a lot of money, like orders of magnitude less money that could
*  replace Uber drivers, for example.
*  So car sharing is autonomous.
*  It creates a similar or better experience in terms of how quickly you get from A to B
*  or just whatever the pleasantness of the experience, the efficiency of the experience,
*  the value of the experience.
*  And at the same time, the car itself costs cheaper.
*  I think that's very difficult to achieve.
*  I think there's a lot more low hanging fruit in the home.
*  That could be. I also want to give you a perspective on how challenging it would be at
*  home or like it maybe kind of depends on the exact problem that you would be solving.
*  Like if we're speaking about these robotic arms and hands, these things, they cost tens
*  of thousands of dollars or maybe 100k.
*  And.
*  You know, maybe, obviously, maybe if there would be economy of scale, these things would
*  be cheaper, but actually for any household to buy, the price would have to go down to
*  maybe 1000 bucks.
*  Yeah, I personally think that so self-driving car provides a clear service.
*  I don't think robots in the home, there'll be a trillion dollar company will just be
*  all about service, meaning it will not necessarily be about like a robotic arm that's
*  helps you, I don't know, open a bottle or wash dishes or any of that kind of stuff.
*  It has to be able to take care of that whole the therapist thing you mentioned.
*  I think that's of course, there's a line between what is a robot and what is not like
*  doesn't really need a body, but you know, some AI system was some embodiment, I think.
*  So the tricky part, when you think actually what's the difficult part is when the robot
*  has like when there is a diversity of the environment with which the robot has to
*  interact, that becomes hard.
*  So, you know, on one spectrum, you have industrial robots as they are doing over and
*  over the same thing.
*  It is possible to some extent to prescribe the movements and with very small amount of
*  intelligence, the movement can be repeated millions of times.
*  There are also, you know, various pieces of industrial robots where it becomes harder
*  and harder. Like for instance, in case of Tesla, it might be a matter of putting a
*  rack inside of a car.
*  And, you know, because the rack kind of moves around, it's not that easy.
*  It's not exactly the same every time.
*  That's the case that you need actually humans to do it.
*  While, you know, welding cars together, it's a very repetitive process.
*  Then in case of self-driving itself, the difficulty has to do with the diversity of
*  the environment, but still the car itself.
*  The problem that you are solving is you try to avoid even interacting with things.
*  You are not touching anything around because touching itself is hard.
*  And then if you would have in the home robot that, you know, has to touch things and
*  like if these things, they change the shape.
*  If there is a huge variety of things to be touched, then that's difficult.
*  If you are speaking about the robot, which there is, you know, head that is smiling in
*  some way with cameras, that it doesn't, you know, touch things, that's relatively
*  simple.
*  OK, so to both agree and to push back.
*  So you refer to touch like.
*  Soft robotics, like the actual touch.
*  But I would argue that you could formulate just basic interaction between like
*  non-contact interaction is also a kind of touch, and that might be very difficult to
*  solve. That's the basic this not disagreement, but that's the basic open question to me
*  with self-driving cars and this agreement with Elon, which is how much interaction
*  is required to solve self-driving cars, how much touch is required.
*  You said that in your intuition, touch is not required in my intuition to create a
*  product that's compelling to use.
*  You're going to have to interact with pedestrians, not just avoid pedestrians, but
*  interact with them.
*  When we drive around in major cities, we're constantly threatening everybody's life
*  with our movements and that's how they respect us.
*  There's a game to ready going on with pedestrians and I am afraid you can't just
*  formulate autonomous driving as a collision avoidance problem.
*  So I think it goes beyond a collision avoidance is the first order approximation.
*  But then at least in case of test, they are gathering data from people driving their
*  cars. And I believe that's an example of supervised data that they can train their
*  models on and they are doing it, which can give a model this like another level of
*  behavior that is needed to actually interact with the real world.
*  Yeah, it's interesting how much data is required to achieve that.
*  What do you think of the whole Tesla autopilot approach, the computer vision based
*  approach with multiple cameras and as a data engine, it's a multitask, multi-headed
*  neural network. And it's this fascinating process of similar to what you're talking
*  about with the robotics approach, which is, you know, you deploy a neural network and
*  then there's humans that use it and then it runs into trouble in a bunch of places and
*  that stuff is sent back.
*  So like the deployment discovers a bunch of edge cases and those edge cases are sent
*  back for supervised annotation, thereby improving the neural network.
*  And that's deployed again, goes over and over until the network becomes really good at
*  the task of driving, becomes safer and safer.
*  What do you think of that kind of approach to robotics?
*  I believe that's the way to go.
*  So in some sense, even when I was speaking about, you know, collecting trajectories from
*  humans, that's like a first step.
*  And then you deploy the system and then you have humans revising all the issues.
*  And in some sense, like this approach converges to a system that doesn't make mistakes
*  because for the cases where there are mistakes, you got their data, how to fix them and the
*  system will keep on improving.
*  So there's a very, to me, difficult question of how hard that, you know, how long that
*  converging takes, how hard it is.
*  The other aspect of autonomous vehicles probably applies to certain robotics applications
*  is society, right?
*  They put as as the quality of the system converges.
*  So one, there's a human factors perspective of psychology, of humans being able to supervise
*  those, even with teleoperation, those robots and the other society willing to accept
*  robots. Currently, society is much harsher on self-driving cars than it is on human driven
*  cars in terms of the expectation of safety.
*  So the bar is set much higher than for humans.
*  And so if there's a death in an autonomous vehicle, that's seen as much more.
*  Much more dramatic than a death in a human driven vehicle.
*  Part of the success of deployment of robots is figuring out how to make robots part of
*  society, both on the just the human side, on the media journalist side and also on the
*  policy government side.
*  And that seems to be maybe you can put that into the objective function to optimize.
*  But that is that is definitely.
*  A tricky one.
*  I wonder if that is actually the trickiest part for self-driving cars or any system
*  that's safety critical.
*  It's not the algorithm, it's the society accepting it.
*  Yeah, I would say I believe that the part of the process of deployment is actually
*  showing people that they can't even things can be trusted.
*  Yeah.
*  And trust is also like a glass that is actually really easy to crack it.
*  And damage it.
*  And I think that's actually very common with innovation that there is some resistance
*  toward it.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's just the natural progression.
*  So in some sense, people will have to keep on proving that indeed the systems are worth
*  being used.
*  And I would say I also found out that often the best way to do it is to use the system
*  and also find out that often the best way to convince people is by letting them experience
*  it.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  That's the case with Tesla autopilot, for example.
*  That's the case with basically robots in general.
*  It's kind of funny to hear people talk about robots like there's a lot of fear, even
*  with like legged robots.
*  But when they actually interact with them, there's joy.
*  I love interacting with them.
*  And the same with the car with a robot.
*  If it starts being useful, I think people immediately understand.
*  And if the product is designed well, they fall in love.
*  You're right.
*  It's actually even similar when I'm thinking about copilot, the GitHub copilot.
*  There was a spectrum of responses that people had.
*  And ultimately, the important piece was to let people try it out.
*  And then many people just loved it, especially like programmers.
*  Programmers.
*  But like some of them, you know, they came with a fear.
*  Yeah.
*  But then you try it out and you think, actually, that's cool.
*  OK.
*  And, you know, you can try to resist the same way as, you know, you could resist moving
*  from punch cards to, let's say, C++ or so.
*  And it's a little bit futile.
*  So we talked about generation of program, generation of language, even self-supervised
*  learning in the visual space for robotics and then reinforcement learning.
*  What do you and like this whole beautiful spectrum of AI do you think is a good
*  benchmark, a good test to strive for, to achieve intelligence?
*  That's a strong test of intelligence.
*  You know, it started with Alan Turing and the Turing test.
*  Maybe you think natural language conversation is a good test.
*  So, you know, it would be nice if, for instance, machine would be able to
*  solve Riemann hypothesis in math.
*  That would be, I think that would be very impressive.
*  So theorem proving is that to you proving theorems is a good, oh, like one thing
*  that the machine did, you would say, damn.
*  Exactly.
*  OK.
*  That would be quite impressive.
*  I mean, the tricky part about the benchmarks is, you know, as we are getting
*  closer with them, we have to invent new benchmarks.
*  There is actually no ultimate benchmark out there.
*  Yeah.
*  See, my thought with the Riemann hypothesis would be the moment the machine
*  proves it would say, OK, well, then the problem was easy.
*  That's what happens.
*  And I mean, in some sense, that's actually what happens over the years in AI that
*  like we get used to things very quickly.
*  You know, something I talked to Rodney Brooks, I don't know if you know that is
*  he called AlphaZero homework problem because he was saying like, there's
*  nothing special about it.
*  It's not a big leap.
*  And I didn't.
*  Well, he's coming from one of the aspects that we refer to as he was part of the
*  founding of iRobot, which deployed now tens of millions of robot in the home.
*  So if you see robots.
*  There are actually in the homes of people as the legitimate instantiation of
*  artificial intelligence, then yes, maybe an AI that plays a silly game like go
*  and chess is not a real accomplishment.
*  But to me, it's a fundamental leap.
*  But I think we as humans then say, OK, well, then that that game of chess or go
*  wasn't that difficult compared to the thing that's currently unsolved.
*  So my intuition is that from perspective of the evolution of these AI systems,
*  we'll at first seen the tremendous progress in digital space.
*  And the you know, the main thing about this space is also that you can
*  everything is that there is a lot of recorded data.
*  Plus, you can very rapidly deploy things to billions of people.
*  Well, in case of physical space, the deployment part takes multiple years.
*  You have to manufacture things and, you know, delivering it to actual people.
*  It's very hard.
*  So I'm expecting that the first and the prices in digital space of goods, they
*  would go down to the let's say marginal costs are zero.
*  And also the question is how much of our life will be in digital?
*  Because it seems like we're heading towards more and more of our lives being
*  in the digital space.
*  So like innovation in the physical space might become less and less significant.
*  Like, why do you need to drive anywhere if most of your life is spent in virtual reality?
*  I still would like, you know, to at least at the moment, my impression is that I
*  would like to have a physical contact with other people.
*  And that's very important to me.
*  And we don't have a way to replicate it in the computer.
*  It might be the case that over the time it will change.
*  Like in 10 years from now, why not have like an arbitrary infinite number of
*  people you can interact with?
*  Some of them are real, some are not with arbitrary characteristics that you can
*  define based on your own preferences.
*  I think that's maybe where we are heading and maybe I'm resisting the future.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm telling you, I, if I got to choose, if I could live in Elder Scrolls Skyrim
*  versus the real world, I'm not so sure I would stay with the real world.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the question is, so will VR be sufficient to get us there or do you
*  need to, you know, plug electrodes in the brain?
*  Yeah.
*  And it would be nice if these electrodes wouldn't be invasive.
*  Yeah.
*  Or at least like provably non-destructive.
*  But in the digital space, do you think we'll be able to solve the touring
*  test, the spirit of the touring test, which is, do you think we'll be able to
*  achieve compelling natural language conversation between people like have
*  friends that are AI systems on the internet?
*  I totally think it's doable.
*  Do you think the current approach to GPT will take us there?
*  There is, you know, the part of at first learning all the content out there.
*  And I think that still system should keep on learning as it speaks with you.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that should work.
*  The question is how exactly to do it.
*  And, you know, obviously we have people at OpenAI asking these questions and
*  kind of at first pre-training on all existing content is like a backbone
*  and is a decent backbone.
*  Do you think AI needs a body?
*  Connecting to our robotics question to truly connect with humans or can, can
*  most of the connection be in the digital space?
*  So let's see.
*  We know that there are people who met each other online and they felt in love.
*  Yeah.
*  So it seems that it's conceivable to establish connection, which
*  is purely through internet.
*  And of course it might be more compelling, the more modalities you add.
*  So it would be like you're proposing like a Tinder, but for AI, you like
*  swipe right and left and half the systems are AI and the other is humans.
*  And you don't know which is which.
*  That would be our, that would be our formulation of Turing test.
*  The moment AI is able to achieve more swipe right or left, whatever the
*  moment it's able to be more attractive than other humans, it passes the Turing
*  test and you would pass the Turing test in attractiveness.
*  That's right.
*  Well, no, like attractiveness just to clarify conversation, not just visual.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  It's also attractiveness with wit and humor and whatever, whatever makes
*  conversation is pleasant for humans.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  Um, so, so you're saying, uh, it's possible to achieve in the digital space.
*  In some sense, I would almost ask the question, why wouldn't that be possible?
*  Right.
*  Well, I have this argument with my dad all the time.
*  He thinks that touch and smell are really important.
*  So they can be very important.
*  And I'm saying the initial systems, they won't have it still.
*  I wouldn't, uh, I got there people being born without the senses.
*  And, uh, you know, I believe that they can still fall in
*  love and have meaningful life.
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder if it's possible to go close to all the way by just training
*  on transcripts of conversations.
*  Like, I wonder how far that takes us.
*  So I think that actually still you want images.
*  Like I would like, so I don't have kids, but like I could imagine the having AI
*  tutor, it has to see, you know, kids.
*  Drawing some pictures on the paper and facial expressions, all that kind of stuff.
*  We use, uh, dogs and humans use their eyes and, uh, to communicate with each other.
*  I think this, that's, that's a really powerful mechanism of communication, body
*  language too, that, uh, words are much lower bandwidth and for body language.
*  We still, you know, we kind of have a system that displays an image of its
*  artificial expression on the computer.
*  It doesn't have to move, you know, mechanical pieces or so.
*  So I think that, uh, you know, that there is like kind of a progression.
*  You can imagine that text might be the simplest to tackle, but, uh, this is not
*  the complete, uh, human experience at all.
*  You expand it to, let's say images, both for input and output.
*  And what you describe is actually the final, uh, I guess frontier.
*  What makes us human?
*  The fact that we can touch each other or smell or so, and it's the hardest
*  from perspective of data and deployment.
*  And, uh, I, I, I believe that these things might happen gradually.
*  Are you excited by that?
*  Possibly this particular application of human to AI friendship and interaction.
*  So let's see.
*  Like, would you, uh, do you look forward to a world you, you said you're
*  living with a few folks and you're very close friends with them.
*  Do you look forward to a day where one or two of those friends are AI systems?
*  So if the system would be truly wishing me well, rather than being in the
*  situation that it optimizes for my time to interact with the system,
*  the line between those is it's a gray, it's a gray area.
*  I think that's the distinction between love and possession.
*  And these things, they might be often correlated for humans, but it's, it,
*  like, uh, like, uh, you might find that there are like some friends with whom
*  you haven't spoke for four months.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, you know, you pick up the phone.
*  It's as the time hasn't passed.
*  It's they, they are not holding to you.
*  And I will, I wouldn't like to have AI system that, you know, it's, it's.
*  Trying to convince me to spend time with it.
*  I would like the system to optimize for what I care about and help
*  me in achieving my own goals.
*  But there's some, I mean, I don't know.
*  There's some manipulation, there's some possessiveness, there's some
*  insecurities, there's fragility.
*  All those things are necessary to form a close friendship over time to go through
*  some dark shit together, some bliss and happiness together.
*  I feel like there's a lot of greedy self-centered behavior within that process.
*  My intuition, but I might be wrong.
*  Instead human computer interaction doesn't have to go through, uh,
*  computer being greedy, possessive, and so on.
*  It is possible to train systems.
*  Maybe that they actually, uh, you know, they are, I guess, prompted or fine
*  tuned or so to truly optimize for what you care about.
*  And you could imagine that, you know, that the way how the process would
*  look like is at some point we, as a human, as we look at the transcript of the
*  conversation or like an entire interaction.
*  And we say, actually here there was more loving way to go about it.
*  And we supervise system to our being more loving, or maybe we train the
*  system such that it has a reward function to our being more loving.
*  Yeah.
*  Or maybe the possibility of the system being an asshole and manipulative and
*  possessive every once in a while is a feature, not a bug, because some of the
*  happiness that we experience when two souls meet each other, when two humans
*  meet each other is a kind of break from the assholes in the world.
*  And so you need assholes in AI as well, because like, it'll be like a breath of
*  fresh air to discover an AI that the three previous AIs you had are too
*  friendly or no, no, or, or cruel or whatever.
*  It's like some kind of mix.
*  And then this one is just right.
*  But you need to experience the full spectrum.
*  Like I think you need to be able to engineer assholes.
*  So let's see, because there's some level to us being appreciate to appreciate the
*  human experience.
*  We need the dark and the light.
*  So that kind of reminds me, um, I met while ago at the meditation retreat, uh,
*  one woman and, um, um, you know, beautiful, beautiful woman.
*  And she had, uh, she had the crutch.
*  Okay.
*  She had the trouble, uh, walking on one leg.
*  I asked her what has happened.
*  And, um, she said that five years ago she was in Maui, Hawaii, and she was eating a
*  salad and some snail fell into the salad and apparently there are neurotoxic, uh,
*  snails over there and she got into coma for a year.
*  Okay.
*  And, um, apparently there is, you know, high chance of event just dying, but she
*  was in the coma at some point.
*  Uh, she regained partially consciousness.
*  She was able to hear people in the room.
*  People behave as she wouldn't be there.
*  No, at some point she started being able to speak, but she was mumbling, like a
*  very able to express herself.
*  At some point she got into wheelchair.
*  Then at some point she actually noticed that she can move her, uh, uh, toe.
*  And then she knew that she will be able to walk.
*  And then, you know, that's where she was five years after.
*  And she said that since then she appreciates the fact that she can move her toe.
*  And I was thinking, Hmm, do I need to go through such experience to appreciate
*  that I have, I can move my toe?
*  Wow.
*  That's really good story and really deep example.
*  Yeah.
*  And in some sense, it might be the case that we don't see light if we haven't
*  went through the darkness, but I wouldn't say that we should, we shouldn't assume
*  that that's the case, which it may, we may be able to engineer shortcuts.
*  Yeah.
*  Ilya had this, you know, belief that maybe one has to go for a week or six
*  months to some challenging camp.
*  Yeah.
*  The just experienced, you know, a lot of difficulties and then comes back and
*  actually everything is bright.
*  Everything is beautiful.
*  I'm with Ilya on this.
*  It must be a Russian thing.
*  Where are you from originally?
*  I'm Polish.
*  Polish.
*  Okay.
*  I'm tempted to say that explains a lot, but, uh, yeah, there's something
*  about the Russian, the necessity of suffering.
*  I believe, I believe suffering or rather struggle is necessary.
*  I believe that struggle is necessary.
*  I mean, in some sense, you even look at the story of any superhero, the movie.
*  It's not that it was like everything I can go easy, easy, easy.
*  I like how that's your ground truth is the story of superheroes.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, you mentioned that you used to do research at night and go to bed
*  at like 6 AM or 7 AM.
*  I still do that often.
*  Um, what, uh, sleep schedules have you tried to make for a productive and happy
*  life? Like, is there, um, is there some interesting wild sleeping patterns
*  that you engaged that, uh, you found that works really well for you?
*  I tried at some point decreasing number of hours of sleep, like a
*  gradually, like a half an hour every few days to this, you know, I was
*  hoping to just save time that clearly didn't work for me.
*  Like at some point, uh, there's like a phase shift and I felt tired all the time.
*  Uh, you know, there was a time that I used to work during the nights.
*  The nice thing about the nights is that no one disturbs you.
*  And, um, even I remember when I was meeting for the first time with, uh,
*  Greg Brockman, his CTO and chairman of open AI, our meeting was scheduled to
*  5 PM and I overstepped for the meeting.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Over slept for the meeting.
*  Yeah.
*  5 PM.
*  Yeah.
*  Now you sound like me.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, at the moment, in some sense, uh, my sleeping schedule also has to do
*  with the fact that I'm interacting with people I sleep without an alarm.
*  So, so yeah, the, the team thing you mentioned extrovert thing, because most
*  humans operate during a certain set of hours, you're forced to then operate
*  at the same set of hours, but I'm not quite there yet.
*  I found a lot of joy, just like you said, working through the night because it's
*  quiet because the world doesn't disturb you and there's some aspect counter to
*  everything you're saying.
*  There's some joyful aspect to sleeping through the mess of the day because, uh,
*  people are having meetings and sending emails and there's drama meetings.
*  I can sleep through all the meetings.
*  You know, I have meetings every day and they prevent me from having sufficient
*  amount of time for, uh, focus work.
*  And, uh, then I modified my calendar and I said that I'm out of office Wednesday,
*  Thursday and Friday every day, and I'm having meetings only Monday and Tuesday.
*  And that bus, the positively influenced my mood that I have literally like at
*  three days for fully focused work.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's better solutions to this problem than staying awake all night.
*  Okay.
*  You've been part of development of some of the greatest ideas in artificial
*  intelligence.
*  What would you say is your process for developing good novel ideas?
*  You have to be aware that clearly there are many other brilliant people around.
*  So you have to ask yourself a question.
*  Why the given idea, uh, let's say wasn't tried by someone else.
*  And in some sense, it has to do with, you know, kind of simple.
*  It might sound simple, but like I'm thinking outside of the box.
*  And what do I mean here?
*  So for instance, for a while, people in academia, they assumed that, uh, you
*  have a fixed data set and then you optimize the algorithms in order to get
*  the best performance and, uh, that was so in great assumption that no one thought
*  about training models on anti-internet or like that, that maybe some people
*  thought about it, but it, it felt too many as unfair.
*  And in some sense, that's almost like a, it's not my idea or so, but that's an
*  example of breaking a typical assumption.
*  So you want to be in the paradigm that you're breaking a typical assumption.
*  In the context of the AI community, getting to pick your data set is cheating.
*  Correct.
*  And in some sense, so that was a, that was assumption that many people had out
*  there and then if you free yourself from assumptions, then they are likely to
*  achieve something that others cannot do.
*  And in some sense, if you are trying to do exactly the same things as others,
*  it's very likely that you're going to have the same results.
*  Yeah.
*  I, but there's also that kind of tension, which is, uh, asking yourself the
*  question, why haven't others done this?
*  Because, um, I mean, I get a lot of good ideas, but I think probably most of them
*  suck when they meet reality.
*  So, so actually I think the other big piece, uh, is, uh, getting into habit of
*  generating ideas, training your brain towards generating ideas and not even,
*  uh, suspending judgment of the ideas.
*  So in some sense, I noticed myself that even if I'm in the process of generating
*  ideas, if I tell myself, Oh, that was a bad idea, then that actually interrupts
*  the process and I cannot generate more ideas because I'm actually focused on
*  the negative part, why it won't work.
*  Yes.
*  But I created also environment in the way that it's very easy for me to, to
*  store new ideas.
*  So for instance, next to my bed, I have a voice recorder and it happens to me
*  often, like I wake up in the, during the night and I have some idea in the past.
*  I was writing them down on my phone, but that means, you know, turning off this,
*  turning on the screen and that wakes me up or like a pulling a paper, which
*  requires, uh, you know, turning on the, uh, light these days, I just start
*  recording it.
*  What do you think?
*  Uh, I don't know if you know who Jim Keller is.
*  I know Jim Keller.
*  He he's a big proponent of thinking harder on a problem right before sleep
*  so that he can sleep through it and solve it in his sleep or like come up
*  with radical stuff in his sleep.
*  He was trying to get me to do this.
*  So it happened from my experience perspective.
*  It happened to me many times during the high school days when I was doing
*  mathematics, that I had that solution to my problem as I woke up.
*  At the moment regarding thinking hard about the given problem is I'm trying
*  to actually devote substantial amount of time to think about important problems,
*  not just before the sleep.
*  I can organizing amount of the huge chunks of time such that I'm not
*  constantly working on the urgent problems, but I actually have time to
*  think about the important one.
*  So you do it naturally, but his ideas that you kind of prime your brain to
*  make sure that that's the focus.
*  You know, oftentimes people have other worries in their life that's not
*  fundamentally deep problems like, I don't know, just stupid drama in your life.
*  And even at work, all that kind of stuff, he wants to kind of pick the most
*  important problem that you're thinking about and go to bed on that.
*  I think that's why I mean, the other thing that comes to my mind is also, I
*  feel the most fresh in the morning.
*  So during the morning, I try to work on the most important things rather than
*  I'm just being pulled by urgent things or checking email or so.
*  What do you do with the, cause I've been doing the voice recorder thing too, but
*  I ended up recording so many messages.
*  It's hard to organize.
*  I have the same problem.
*  Now I have heard that Google pixel is really good in transcribing text and I
*  might get a Google pixel just for the sake of transcribing text.
*  Yeah.
*  People listening to this, if you have a good voice recorder suggestion that
*  transcribes, please let me know.
*  It's some of it is, uh, this has to do with, uh, uh, open AI codex too.
*  Like some of it is simply like the friction.
*  I need, uh, apps that remove that friction between voice and the organization
*  of the resulting transcripts and all that kind of stuff.
*  Um, but yes, you're right.
*  Absolutely.
*  Like during, uh, for me, it's walking sleep too, but walking and running,
*  uh, especially running, get a lot of thoughts during running and there's,
*  there's no good mechanism for recording thoughts.
*  So one more thing that I do, I have a separate phone, uh, which I,
*  which has no apps.
*  Maybe it has like audible or let's say no, no one has this phone number.
*  This kind of my meditation phone.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, I try to expand the amount of time that that's the phone that I'm having.
*  It has also Google maps if I need to go somewhere.
*  And I also use this phone to write down ideas.
*  Ah, that's a really good idea.
*  That's a really good idea.
*  Often actually what I end up doing is even sending a message from
*  that phone to the other phone.
*  So that's actually my way of recording messages or I just put them into notes.
*  I love it.
*  What advice would you give to a young person?
*  High school, college, uh, bar, or whatever.
*  About how to be successful.
*  You've done a lot of incredible things in the past decade.
*  So maybe, maybe you have some, there might be something, there might be something.
*  I mean, it might sound like a simplistic or so, but I would say literally just
*  follow your passion, double down on it.
*  And if you don't know what's your passion, just figure out what could be a,
*  what could be a passion.
*  So this step might be an exploration.
*  When I was in elementary school was math and chemistry.
*  And I remember for some time I gave up on math because my school teacher,
*  she told me that I'm dumb.
*  And I, I guess maybe an advice would be just ignore people.
*  If they tell you that you're dumb, you mentioned something offline
*  about chemistry and explosives.
*  Um, what was that about?
*  So let's see.
*  So the story goes like that.
*  I can, uh, I got into chemistry.
*  Maybe I was like a second grade of my elementary school, third grade.
*  Uh, I started going to chemistry classes.
*  Uh, I, I, I really love building stuff and, um, I did all the experiments
*  that they describe in the book.
*  I can, you know, how to create oxygen with vinegar and, and, and baking soda.
*  So, okay.
*  So I did all the experiments and at some point I was, you know, so what's next?
*  What can I do?
*  And, um, explosives, they also, it's like a, you have a clear reward signal,
*  you know, if the thing worked or not.
*  So I remember at first I got, I got interested in producing hydrogen.
*  That was kind of funny experiment from school.
*  You can just burn it.
*  Then I moved to, uh, nitroglycerin.
*  So that's also relatively easy to synthesize.
*  I started producing essentially dynamite and detonating it with a friend.
*  Remember there was a, no, there was at first like a, maybe two attempts that I went
*  with a friend to detonate what we built and it didn't work out.
*  And like a third time he was like, ah, it won't work.
*  Like, uh, let's don't waste time.
*  And, um, now we were, I was carrying this, uh, this, you know, that
*  tube with dynamite, I don't know, pound or so dynamite in my backpack.
*  We're like riding on the bike to the edges of the city.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh,
*  attempt number three.
*  This was be attempt number three,
*  attempt number three.
*  And, um, now we, we did get hold to, uh, put it inside.
*  It actually had the, uh, you know, uh, electrical detonator.
*  We, we draw a cable kind of tree.
*  I even, I never had, I haven't ever seen like a explosion before.
*  So I thought that there will be a lot of sound.
*  And, but, you know, we were like laying down and I'm holding
*  the cable and the battery at some point, you know, we kind of like a three to one.
*  And, um, I just connected it and it felt like at that ground shake.
*  It was like, I'm more like a sound and then the soil started kind of lifting
*  up and started falling on us.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  And then, uh, no difference.
*  It let's, let's make sure the next time we have helmets, but also, you know,
*  and I'm happy that nothing happened to me.
*  It could have been the case that I lost the limber.
*  So, yeah, but that's childhood.
*  Uh, of an engineering mind with a strong reward signal of an explosion.
*  I love it.
*  And my, there's some aspect of a chemist that the chemist, I know, like my dad
*  with plasma chemistry, plasma physics, he was very much into explosives too.
*  It's a worrying quality of, of people that work in chemistry.
*  They, they love, I think it is that exactly is the, the strong
*  signal that the thing worked.
*  There is no doubt.
*  There's no doubt.
*  There's some magic.
*  It's almost like a reminder that physics works, that chemistry works.
*  It's cool.
*  It's almost like a little glimpse at nature that you yourself engineer.
*  I, that's why I really like artificial intelligence, especially
*  robotics is you create a little piece of nature.
*  And in some sense, even for me with explosives, the motivation was creation
*  rather than distraction.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  In terms of advice, I forgot to ask about just machine learning and deep learning
*  for people who are specifically interested in machine learning.
*  How would you recommend they get into the field?
*  So, um, I would say re-implement everything and also there is plenty of courses.
*  So like from scratch.
*  Um, so on different levels of abstraction in some sense, but I would say
*  re-implement something from scratch, re-implement something from a paper,
*  re-implement something, you know, from podcasts that you have heard about.
*  I would say that's a powerful way to understand things.
*  So it's often the case that you read the description and you think you understand,
*  but you truly understand once you build it, then you actually know what really
*  mattered in the description.
*  Is there a particular topics that you find people just fall in love with?
*  So I've seen, I tend to really enjoy reinforcement learning because it's,
*  it's much more, it's much easier to get to a point where you feel like you
*  created something special, like, like fun games, kind of things that are rewarding.
*  It's rewarding.
*  Yeah.
*  As opposed to like, uh, re-implementing from scratch more like supervised
*  learning kind of things it's, it's yeah.
*  So, you know, if, if someone would optimize for things to be rewarding, then
*  it feels that the things that are somewhat generative, they have such a property.
*  So you have, for instance, adversarial networks, or do you have just even
*  generative language models and you can even see internally, we have seen
*  this thing with our releases.
*  So we have, uh, we released recently two models.
*  There is one model called Dali that generates images and there is other
*  model called clip that actually, uh, you provide various possibilities.
*  What could be the answer to what is on the picture?
*  And it can tell you which one is the most likely.
*  And in some sense, in case of the first one, Dali, it is very easy for you to
*  understand that actually there is magic going on, uh, and in the, in case of the
*  second one, even though it is insanely powerful and you know, people from a
*  vision community, they, as they started probing it inside, they actually
*  understood, uh, how far it goes.
*  It's difficult for person at first to see, uh, uh, how well it works.
*  And that's the same, as you said, that in case of supervised learning models,
*  you might not kind of see, or it's not that easy for you to understand the
*  best strength, even though you don't believe in magic to see the magic,
*  the generative that's really brilliant.
*  So anything that's generative, cause then you are at the core of the creation.
*  You get to experience creation without much effort, unless you have to do it
*  from scratch, but it feels that, you know, humans are wired.
*  There is some level of reward for creating stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Of course, different people have a different weight on this reward.
*  Yeah.
*  In the big objective function objective fact of a person, of a person.
*  Uh, you wrote that beautiful is what you intensely pay attention to.
*  Even a cockroach is beautiful.
*  If you look very closely, can you expand on this?
*  What is beauty?
*  So what I'm, I wrote here actually corresponds to my subjective experience
*  that I had through X extended periods of meditation.
*  It's, it's pretty crazy that at some point the meditation gets you to
*  the place that you have really increased, uh, focus, increase attention.
*  And then you look at the very simple objects that were all the time around you
*  can look at the table or on a pen or at the nature and you notice more and more
*  details and it becomes very pleasant to look at it.
*  And it, once again, it kind of reminds me of my childhood, uh, like a just pure
*  joy of being it's also, I have seen even the reverse effect that, uh, by default,
*  regardless of what we possess, we very quickly get used to it and, you know, you
*  can have a very beautiful house and, uh, if you don't put sufficient effort, you're
*  just going to get used to it and it doesn't bring any more joy, regardless of what you have.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I actually, uh, I find that material possessions, uh, get in the way of that
*  experience of pure joy.
*  So I've always, I've been very fortunate to just find joy in simple things.
*  Just, just like you're saying, just like, I don't know, objects in my life, just
*  stupid objects, like this cup thing, you know, just objects sounds.
*  Okay.
*  I'm not being eloquent, but literally objects in the world, they're just full of
*  joy because it's like, I can't believe one, I can't believe that I'm fortunate enough
*  to be alive to experience these objects.
*  And then two, I can't believe humans are clever enough to have built these objects.
*  The hierarchy of pleasure that that provides is infinite.
*  I mean, even if you look at the cup of water, so, you know, you see first like a
*  level of like a reflection of light, but then you think, no man, there's like a
*  trillions upon of trillions of particles bouncing against each other.
*  There is also, uh, the tension on the surface that, you know, if the back, back
*  could like a stand on it and move around and you think it also has this like a
*  magical property that as you decrease temperature, uh, it actually expands in
*  volume, which allows for the, you know, uh, lakes to freeze on the, on the surface
*  and at the bottom to have actually not freeze, which allows for life like a crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  You look in detail at some object and you think actually, you know, this table,
*  that was just the figment of someone's imagination at some point.
*  And then there was like a thousands of people involved to actually
*  manufacture it and put it here.
*  And by default, no one cares.
*  And then you can start thinking about evolution, how it all started from
*  single cell organisms that led to this table.
*  And, and, and these thoughts, they give me life appreciation.
*  Yeah.
*  And even lack of thoughts, just the pure raw signal also gives
*  their life appreciation.
*  See, the thing is, and then that's coupled, uh, for me with the sadness
*  that the whole ride ends and perhaps is deeply coupled in that the fact that
*  this experience, this moment ends, gives it, gives it an intensity that I'm
*  not sure I would otherwise have.
*  So in that same way, I tried to meditate on my own death.
*  Often.
*  Do you think about your mortality?
*  Are you afraid of death?
*  So fear of death is like a, one of the most fundamental fears that each of us
*  has, we might be not even aware of it.
*  It requires to look inside to even recognize that it's, um, out there.
*  And there is still, let's say this property of nature that if things would
*  last forever, then they would be also boring to us.
*  The fact that the things change in some way gives any meaning to them.
*  I also, you know, found out that, uh, it seems to be very healing to people to
*  have these short experiences, uh, like, I guess, psychedelic experiences in which
*  they experience death of self in which they let go of this fear and then maybe
*  can even increase the appreciation of the moment.
*  It seems that many people, they, uh, they, they can easily comprehend fine.
*  Uh, the fact that the money's finite while they don't see that time is finite.
*  I have this, like a discussion with Ilya from time to time.
*  He's like, you know, man, like, uh, the life will pass very fast.
*  At some point I will be 40, 50, 60, 70, and then it's over.
*  This is true, which also makes me believe that, you know, that every single moment
*  it is so unique that should be appreciated.
*  And it's also makes me think that I should be acting on my life because
*  otherwise it will pass.
*  I also like this framework of thinking from Jeff Bezos on regret minimization.
*  Like I would like if I will be at that deathbed to look back on my life and,
*  um, and not regret that I haven't done something.
*  It's usually, you might regret that you haven't tried.
*  I'm fine with failing.
*  I haven't tried.
*  I was in each year, eternal recurrence, tried to live a life that if you had to
*  live it infinitely many times, that would be the, you'd be okay with that kind of
*  life.
*  So try to live it optimally.
*  I can say that it's almost like, um, I'm available to me where I am in my life.
*  I'm extremely grateful for actually people whom I met.
*  I would say, I think that I'm decently smart and so on.
*  Uh, but I think that the, actually to great extent where I am has to do with
*  that people who I met.
*  Would you be okay if after this conversation you died?
*  So if I'm dead, then it kind of, I don't have a choice anymore.
*  So in some sense, there's like a plenty of things that I would like to try out in my
*  life.
*  I feel that, you know, I'm gradually going one by one and I'm just doing them.
*  Uh, I think that the least will be always infinite.
*  Yeah.
*  So might as well go today.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, to be clear, I'm not looking forward to dying.
*  I would say if there is no choice, I would accept it.
*  But like, uh, in some sense, I'm, if there would be a choice, uh, if there would be
*  possibility to leave, I would fight for living.
*  I think I find, um, it's more honest than real to think about, you know, dying
*  today at the end of the day.
*  That seems to me to at least to my brain, more honest slap in the face as opposed to
*  I still have 10 years like today, then I'm much more about appreciating the cup and
*  the table and so on.
*  And less about like silly worldly accomplishments and all those kinds of
*  things.
*  We, we, we have in the company, a person who say at some point found out that they
*  have cancer and that also gives, you know, huge perspective with respect to what
*  matters now.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, often people in situations like that, they conclude that actually
*  what matters is human connection.
*  And love and, uh, that's people conclude also if you have kids, kids, his family,
*  you, uh, I think tweeted, we don't assign the minus infinity reward to our death.
*  Such a reward would prevent us from taking any risk.
*  We wouldn't be able to cross the road in fear of being hit by a car.
*  So in the objective function, you mentioned fear of death might be fundamental
*  to the human condition.
*  So as I said, let's assume that they're like a reward functions in our brain.
*  And, um, and the interesting thing is even realization how different reward
*  functions can play with your behavior.
*  As a matter of fact, I wouldn't say that you should assign infinite negative
*  reward to anything because that messes up the math.
*  The math doesn't work out.
*  It doesn't work out.
*  And it's, as you said, even, you know, uh, government or some interest
*  companies, you said they assign nine bill and nine million dollars to human life.
*  And I'm just saying it with respect to that might be a hard statement to
*  ourselves, but in some sense that there is a finite value of our own life.
*  I'm trying to put it from perspective of being less of being more ego less,
*  uh, and realizing fragility of my own life.
*  And, uh, in some sense, the fear of death might prevent you from acting
*  because anything can cause death.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm sure actually, if you were to put death in the objective function,
*  there's probably so many aspects to death and fear of death and, uh, realization
*  of death and mortality, there's just whole components of finiteness of not just
*  your life, but every experience and so on that you're going to have to
*  formalize mathematically.
*  And also, you know, that might lead to, um, you spending a lot of compute cycles
*  on this, like a, uh, deliberating this terrible future instead of experiencing
*  now, and then in some sense is also kind of unpleasant simulation to run in your
*  head.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think, do you think there's an objective function that describes the
*  entirety of, uh, human life?
*  So, you know, usually the way that you ask that is what is the meaning of life?
*  Is there, um, a universal objective functions that captures the why of life?
*  So, yeah, I mean, I suspect that they will ask this question, but it's also a
*  question that I asked myself many, many times.
*  See, I can tell you a framework that I have these days to think about this
*  question.
*  So I think that fundamentally meaning of life has to do with some of our reward
*  functions that we have in brain and they might have to do with, let's say for
*  instance, curiosity or a human connection, which might mean understanding others.
*  Uh, uh, it's also possible for a person to slightly modify their reward function.
*  Usually they mostly stay fixed, but it's possible to modify reward function and
*  you can pretty much choose.
*  So in some sense, the reward functions, optimizing reward functions, they will
*  give you a life satisfaction.
*  Is there some randomness in the function?
*  I think when you are born, there is some randomness.
*  Like you can see that some people, for instance, they, they care more about
*  building stuff.
*  Some people care more about caring for others.
*  Some people that there are all sorts of, uh, default reward functions.
*  And then in some sense, you can ask yourself, what's this like, uh, what is
*  the satisfying way for you to go after this reward function and you just go
*  after it is reward function.
*  And, you know, some people ask, are these reward functions real?
*  I almost think about it as.
*  Let's say if you would have to discover mathematics in mathematics, you are
*  likely to run into various objects, like a complex numbers or differentiation.
*  Some other objects, and these are very natural objects that arise.
*  And similarly, the reward functions that we are having in our brain, they are
*  somewhat very natural that, uh, you know, there is a reward function for, for
*  understanding, like a comprehension, curiosity, and so on.
*  So in some sense, they are in the same way natural as their natural
*  objects in mathematics.
*  Interesting.
*  So, you know, there's the, uh, the old sort of debate is mathematics
*  invented or discovered.
*  You're saying reward functions are discovered.
*  So nature provides a sum.
*  You can still, let's say, expand it throughout the life.
*  Some of the reward functions, they might be futile.
*  Like a, for instance, there might be a reward function,
*  maximize amount of wealth.
*  Yeah.
*  And this is more like a, a learned reward function.
*  And, but we know also that some reward functions, if you optimize them, you
*  won't be quite satisfied.
*  Well, I don't know which part of your word function resulted in you coming
*  today, but I am deeply appreciative that you did spend your valuable time with me.
*  Wojciech is really fun talking to you.
*  You're, you're brilliant.
*  You're a good human being and it's an honor to meet you and an honor to talk to you.
*  Thanks for talking to me, brother.
*  Thank you, Lex a lot.
*  I appreciated your questions.
*  You're a city.
*  I had a lot of time being here.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Wojciech Sremba.
*  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Arthur C.
*  Clark, who is the author of 2001, A Space Odyssey.
*  It may be that our role on this planet is not to worship God, but to create Him.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
