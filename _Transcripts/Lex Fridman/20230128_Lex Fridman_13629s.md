# David Kipping: Alien Civilizations and Habitable Worlds | Lex Fridman Podcast #355
**Lex Fridman:** [January 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZN5xjoS6TU)
*  I think it's actually not that hard to imagine we are the only civilization in the galaxy right now.
*  Living.
*  Yeah, that's currently extent. But there may be very many extinct civilizations. If each civilization
*  has a typical lifetime comparable to, let's say, AI is the demise of our own, that's only a few
*  hundred years of technological development, or maybe 10,000 years if you get back to the Neolithic
*  Revolution, the dawn of agriculture. You know, hardly anything can cosmic time span. That's
*  nothing. That's the blink of an eye. And so it's not surprising at all that we would happen not to
*  coexist with anyone else. But that doesn't mean nobody else was ever here. And if other civilizations
*  come to that same conclusion and realization, maybe they scour the galaxy around them, they
*  find any evidence for intelligence, then they have two options. They can either give up on
*  communication and just say, well, it's never going to happen. We just may as well just, you know,
*  worry about what's happening here on our own planet. Or they could attempt communication,
*  but communication through time.
*  The following is a conversation with David Kipping, an astronomer and astrophysicist at
*  Columbia University, director of the Cool Worlds Lab. And he's an amazing educator about the most
*  fascinating scientific phenomena in our universe. I highly recommend you check out his videos on the
*  Cool Worlds YouTube channel. David quickly became one of my favorite human beings. I hope to talk
*  to him many more times in the future. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check
*  out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's David Kipping.
*  Your research at Columbia is in part focused on what you call Cool Worlds, or worlds outside
*  our solar system where temperature is sufficiently cool to allow for moons, rings, and life to form
*  and for us humans to observe it. So can you tell me more about this idea, this place of Cool Worlds?
*  Yeah, the history of discovering planets outside our solar system was really dominated by these
*  hot planets. And that's just because of the fact they're easier to find. When the very first methods
*  came online, these were primarily the Doppler spectroscopy method, looking for wobbling stars.
*  And also the transit method. And these two both have a really strong bias towards finding these
*  hot planets. Now, hot planets are interesting. The chemistry in the atmosphere is fascinating.
*  It's very alien. An example of one that's particularly close to my heart is Trace IIb,
*  whose atmosphere is so dark, it's less reflective than coal. And so they have really bizarre
*  photometric properties. Yet at the same time, they resemble nothing like our own home.
*  And so they said there's two types of astrophysicists. The astrophysicists who
*  care about how the universe works. They want to understand the mechanics of the machinery
*  of this universe. Why did the Big Bang happen? Why is the universe expanding? How are galaxies
*  formed? And there's another type of astrophysicist, which perhaps speaks to me a little bit more. It
*  whispers into your ear. And that is why are we here? Are we alone? Are there others out there?
*  And ultimately, along this journey, the hot planets aren't going to get us there.
*  When we're looking for life in the universe, it seems to make perfect sense that there should
*  be planets like our own out there. Maybe even moons like our own planet around gas giants that
*  could be habitable. And so my research has been driven by trying to find these more
*  miraculous globes that might resemble our own planet. So they're the ones that lurk more in
*  the shadows in terms of how difficult it is to detect. They're much harder. They're harder for
*  several reasons. The method we primarily use is the transit method. So this really eclipses
*  as the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks out some starlight. The problem with that
*  is that not all planets pass in front of their star. They have to be aligned correctly from your
*  line of sight. And so the further away the planet is from the star, the cooler it is, the less likely
*  it is that you're going to get that geometric alignment. So whereas a hot Jupiter, about 1%
*  of hot Jupiters will transit in front of their star, only about 0.5%, maybe even a quarter of a
*  percent of Earth-like planets will have the right geometry to transit. And so that makes it much,
*  much harder for us. What's the connection between temperature of the planet and geometric alignment,
*  probability of geometric alignment? There's not a direct connection, but they're connected
*  by an intermediate parameter, which is their separation from the star. So the planet will be
*  cooler if it's further away from the star, which in turn means that the probability of getting that
*  alignment correct is going to be less. On top of that, they also transit their star less frequently.
*  So if you go to the telescope and you want to discover a hot Jupiter, you could probably do it
*  in a week or so because the orbital period is of order of one, two, three days. So you can actually
*  get the full orbit two or three times over. Whereas if you want to set an Earth-like planet,
*  you have to observe that star for three, four years. And that's actually one of the problems
*  with Kepler. Kepler was this very successful mission that NASA launched over a decade ago
*  now, I think. And it discovered thousands of planets. It's still the dominant source of
*  exoplanets that we know about. But unfortunately, it didn't last as long as we would have liked it
*  to. It died after about 4.35 years, I think it was. And so for an Earth-like planet, that's just
*  enough to catch four transits. Four transits was kind of seen as the minimum. But of course,
*  the more transits you see, the easier it is to detect it because you build up signal to noise.
*  If you see the same thing tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, the more ticks you get,
*  the easier it is to find it. And so it was really a shame that Kepler was just at the limit of where
*  we were expecting it to start to see Earth-like planets. And in fact, it really found zero. Zero
*  planets that are around stars like the Sun, orbits similar to the Earth around the Sun,
*  and could potentially be similar to our own planet in terms of its composition.
*  And so it's a great shame, but that's why it gives astronomers more to do in the future.
*  LW – Just to clarify, the transit method is our primary way of detecting these things.
*  And what it is, is when the object passes, occludes the source of light, just a tiny bit,
*  a few pixels. And from that, we can infer something about its mass and size and distance,
*  geometry, all of that. That's like trying to tell what, at a party, you can't see anything
*  about a person, but you can just see by the way they occlude others. So this is the method. But
*  is this a super far away? How many pixels of information do we have? Basically, how high
*  resolution is the signal that we can get about these occlusions?
*  MG – You're right in your description. I think, just to build upon that a little bit more,
*  it might be almost like your vision is completely blurry. You have an extreme
*  eye prescription, and so you can't resolve anything. Everything's just blurs. But you can
*  tell that something was there because it just got fainter for a short amount of time. Someone
*  passed in front of a light. And so that light in your eyes would just dim for a short moment.
*  Now, the reason we have that problem with blueness or resolution is just because the stars are so far
*  away. I mean, the closest stars are four light years away, but most of the stars Kepler looked
*  at were thousands of light years away. And so there's absolutely no chance that the telescope
*  can physically resolve the star or even the separation between the planet and the star
*  is too small, especially for a telescope like Kepler. It's only a meter across.
*  In principle, you can make those detections, but you need a different kind of telescope. We call
*  that direct imaging. And direct imaging is a very exciting, distinct way of detecting planets. But
*  it, as you can imagine, is going to be far easier to detect planets which are really far away from
*  their star to do that because that's going to make that separation really big. And then you
*  also want the star to be really close to us, so the nearest stars. Not only that, but you would
*  prefer that planet to be really hot because the hotter it is, the brighter it is. And so that
*  tends to bias direct imaging towards planets which are in the process of forming. So things which have
*  just formed the planet still got all of its primordial heat embedded within it and it's glowing.
*  We can see those quite easily. But for the planets more like the earth, of course, they've cooled
*  down. And so we can't see that the light is pitiful compared to a newly formed planet.
*  We would like to get there with direct imaging. That's the dream is to have the pale blue dot,
*  an actual photograph of it, maybe even just a one pixel photograph of it. But for now,
*  the entire solar system is one pixel, certainly with the transit method, most of the telescopes.
*  And so all you can do is see where that one pixel, which contains potentially dozens of planets and
*  the star, maybe even multiple stars, dims for a short amount of time. It dims just a little bit
*  and from that you can infer something. Yeah. I mean, it's like being a detective in the scene,
*  right? It's very, it's indirect clues of the existence of the planet.
*  It's amazing that humans can do that. We're just looking out in these immense distances
*  and looking, you know, if there's alien civilizations out there, like let's say one
*  exactly like our own, we're like, would we even be able to see an earth that passes
*  in the way of its sun and slightly dims? And that's the only sign we have of that,
*  of that alien human-like civilization out there is it's just a little bit of a dimming.
*  Yeah. I mean, it depends on the type of star we're talking about. If it is a star truly like the sun,
*  the dip that causes is 84 parts per million. I mean, that's just, it's like the same as a,
*  it's like a firefly flying in front of like a giant floodlight at a stadium or something. That's
*  the kind of the brightness contrast that you're trying to compare to. So it's extremely difficult
*  detection. And in the very, very best cases, we can get down to that. But as I said, we don't
*  really have any true earth analogs that have been in exoplanet candidate yet. Unless you relax that
*  definition, you say, it's not just, doesn't have to be a star just like the sun. It could be a star
*  that's smaller than the sun. It could be these orange dwarfs or even the red dwarf stars.
*  And the fact those stars are smaller means that for the same size planet passing in front of it,
*  more light is blocked out. And so a very exciting system, for example, is TRAPPIST-1,
*  which has seven planets, which are smaller than the earth. And those are quite easily detectable,
*  not with a space-based telescope, but even from the ground. And that's just because the star is
*  so much smaller that the relative increase in or decrease in brightness is enhanced significantly
*  because that's smaller size. So TRAPPIST-1e, it's a planet which is in the right distance for liquid
*  water. It has a slightly smaller size than the earth. It's about 90% the size of the earth,
*  about 80% the mass. And it's one of the top targets right now for potentially having life.
*  And yet it raises many questions about what would that environment be like? This is a star which is
*  one eighth the mass of the sun. Stars like that take a long time to come off that adolescence.
*  When stars first form, like the sun, it takes them maybe 10, 100 million years to sort of settle
*  into that main sequence lifetime. But for stars like these late M dwarfs, as we call them,
*  they can take up to a billion years or more to calm down. And during that period, they're producing
*  huge amounts of X-rays, ultraviolet radiation that could potentially rip off the entire atmosphere.
*  It may desiccate the planets in the system. And so even if water arrived by comets or something,
*  it may have lost all that water due to this prolonged period of high activity.
*  So we have lots of open-ended questions about these M dwarf planets, but they are the most
*  accessible. And so in the near term, if we detect anything in terms of biosignatures,
*  it's going to be for one of these red dwarf stars. It's not going to be a true
*  earth twin as we would recognize it as having a yellow star.
*  Well, let me ask you, I mean, there's a million ways to ask this question. I'm sure I'll ask it
*  about habitable worlds. Let's just go to our own solar system. What can we learn about
*  the planets and moons in our solar system that might contain life, whether it's Mars or some of
*  the moons of Jupiter and Saturn? What kind of characteristics, because you said it might not
*  need to be earth-like, what kind of characteristics might we be looking for?
*  When we look for life, it's hard to define even what life is, but we can maybe do a better job
*  in defining the sorts of things that life does. And that provides some aspects to some avenue for
*  looking for them. Classically, conventionally, I think we thought the way to look for life was
*  to look for oxygen. Oxygen is a byproduct of a synthesis on this planet. We didn't always have
*  it. Certainly, if you go back to the Ikean period, you have this period called the Great
*  Oxidation Event where the earth floats with oxygen for the first time and starts to saturate the
*  oceans and then the atmosphere. And so that oxygen, if we detect it on another planet,
*  whether it be Mars, Venus or an exoplanet, whatever it is, that was long thought to be evidence for
*  something doing photosynthesis. Because if you took away all the plant life on the earth,
*  the oxygen wouldn't just hang around here. It's a highly reactive molecule. It would oxidize things.
*  And so within about a million years, you would probably lose all the oxygen on planet Earth.
*  So that was conventionally how we thought we could look for life. And then we start to realize that
*  it's not so simple because A, there might be other things that life does apart from photosynthesis.
*  Certainly, the vast majority of the earth's history had no oxygen, and yet there was living
*  things on it. So that doesn't seem like a complete test. And secondly, could there be other things
*  that produce oxygen besides from life? A growing concern has been these false positives in biosignature
*  work. And so one example of that would be photosynthesis that happens in the atmosphere.
*  When ultraviolet light hits the atmosphere, it can break up water vapor. The hydrogen splits off to
*  the oxygen. The hydrogen is a much lighter atomic species, and so it can actually escape. Certainly,
*  planets like the earth's gravity. That's why we don't have any hydrogen or very little helium.
*  And so that leaves you with the oxygen, which then oxidizes the surface. And so there could be
*  a residual oxygen signature just due to this photosynthesis process. So we've been trying to
*  generalize. And certainly in recent years, there's been other suggestions of things we could look for
*  in the solar system and beyond. Nitrous oxide, basically laughing gas, is a product of microbes.
*  That's something that we're starting to get more interested in looking for. Methane gas in
*  combination with other gases can be an important biosignature. Phosphine as well. And phosphine is
*  particularly relevant to the solar system because there was a lot of interest for Venus recently.
*  You may have heard that there was a claim of a biosignature in Venus's atmosphere. I think it
*  was like two years ago now. And the judge and jury are still out on that. There was a very provocative
*  claim and signature of a phosphine-like spectral absorption. But it could have also
*  have been some of the molecule in particular, sulfur dioxide, which is not a biosignature.
*  So this is a detection of a gas in the atmosphere of Venus. And it might be controversial in several
*  dimensions. So one, how to interpret that. Two, is this the right gas? And three, is this even
*  the right detection? Is there an error in the detection? Yeah. I mean, how much do we believe
*  the detection in the first place? If you do believe it, does that necessarily mean there's life there?
*  And what gives? How can you have life in Venus's atmosphere in the first place? Because that's
*  been seen as like a hellhole place for imagining life. But I guess the counter to that has been
*  that, okay, yes, the surface is a horrendous place to imagine life thriving. But as you go up in
*  altitude, the very dense atmosphere means that there is a cloud layer where the temperature
*  and the pressure become actually fairly similar to the surface of the earth. And so it may be
*  there are microbes stirring around in the clouds, which are producing phosphine. At the moment,
*  this is fascinating. It's got a lot of us reinvigorated about the prospects of going back
*  to Venus and doing another mission there. In fact, there's now two NASA missions, Veritas
*  and Da Vinci, which are going to be going back before 2030 or the 2030s. And then we have a
*  European mission, I think, that's slated now. And even a Chinese mission might be coming along
*  the way as well. So we might have multiple missions going to Venus, which has long been overlooked.
*  I mean, apart from the Soviets, there really has been very little in the way of exploration
*  of Venus, certainly as compared to Mars. Mars has enjoyed most of the activity from NASA's
*  rovers and surveys. And Mars is certainly fascinating. There's this signature of
*  methane that has been seen there before. Again, there the discussion is whether that methane is
*  a product of biology, which is possible. Certainly that happens on the earth. Or whether it's some
*  geological process that we are yet to fully understand. It could be, for example, a reservoir
*  of methane that's trapped under the surface and it's leaking out seasonally. So the nice thing
*  about Venus is if there's a giant living civilization there, it'll be airborne so you
*  can just fly through and collect samples. With Mars and moons of Saturn and Jupiter, you're going
*  to have to dig under to find the civilizations that are dead or living. Right. And so yeah,
*  maybe it's easier than for Venus because certainly you can imagine just a balloon
*  floating through the atmosphere or a drone or something that would have the capability
*  of just scooping up and sampling. To dig under the surface of Mars is maybe feasible-ish,
*  especially with something like Starship that could launch a huge digger basically to the surface and
*  you could just excavate away at the surface. But for something like Europa, we really are still
*  unclear about how thick the ice layer is, how you would melt through that huge thick layer to
*  get to the ocean, and then potentially also discussions about contamination. The problem
*  with looking for life in the solar system, which is different from looking for life with exoplanets,
*  is that you always run the risk of, especially if you visit there, of introducing the life yourself.
*  It's very difficult to completely exterminate every single microbe and spore on the surface
*  of your rover or the surface of your lander. And so there's always a risk of introducing something.
*  I mean, to some extent, there is continuous exchange of material between these planets
*  naturally on top of that as well. And now we're sort of accelerating that process to some degree.
*  And so if you dig into Europa's surface, which probably is completely pristine, it's very unlikely
*  there has been much exchange with the outside world for its subsurface ocean, you are for the
*  first time potentially introducing bacterial spores into that environment that may compete
*  or may introduce spurious signatures for the life you're looking for. And so it's almost an
*  ethical question as to how to proceed with looking for life on those subsurface oceans.
*  And I don't think one we've really have a good resolution for at this point.
*  Ethical. So you mean ethical in terms of concern for preserving life elsewhere,
*  not to murder it, as opposed to a scientific one?
*  I mean, we always worry about a space virus, right? Coming here or some kind of external source.
*  And we would be the source of that potential contamination.
*  Or the other direction.
*  I mean, whatever survives in such harsh conditions might be pretty good at
*  surviving in all conditions. It might be a little bit more resilient and robust.
*  So it might actually take a ride on us back home.
*  Possibly. I mean, I'm sure that some people would be concerned about that.
*  I think we would hopefully have some containment procedures if we did sample return. Or you mean
*  you don't even really need a sample return. These days you can pretty much send a little
*  micro laboratory to the planet to do all the experiments in situ and then just send them back
*  to your planet, the data. And so I don't think this is necessary, especially for a case like that,
*  where you might have contamination concerns that you have to bring samples back. Although probably
*  if you brought back Europe and sushi, it would probably sell for quite a bit with the billionaires
*  in New York City. Sushi. Yeah. I would love from an engineering perspective just to see all the
*  different candidates and designs for the scooper for Venus and the scooper for Europa and Mars.
*  I haven't really looked deeply into the actual engineering of collecting the samples because
*  the engineering of that is probably essential for not either destroying life or polluting
*  with our own microbes and so on. That's an interesting engineering challenge. I usually,
*  for rovers and stuff, focus on the mobility aspect of it, on the robotics, the perception,
*  and the movement and the planning and the control. But there's probably the scooper is probably where
*  the action is. The microscopic sample collection. So basically you have to first clean your vehicle,
*  make sure it doesn't have any earth-like things on it. And then you have to put it into some kind
*  of thing that's perfectly sealed from the environment. So if we bring it back or we analyze it,
*  it's not going to bring anything else external in. Yeah, I don't know. That'd be an interesting
*  design there. Yeah. I mean, Curiosity has been leaving these little pods on the surface quite
*  recently. There's some neat photos you can find online and they kind of look like a lightsaber
*  hilts. To me, I think I tweeted something like, this weapon is your life. Don't lose it, Curiosity,
*  because it's just dumping these little vials everywhere. And it is scooping up these things.
*  And the intention is that in the future, there will be a sample return mission that will come
*  and pick these up. But the engineering behind those things is so impressive. The thing that
*  blows me away the most has been the landings. Especially I'm training to be a pilot at the
*  moment. So watching landings has become my pet hobby on YouTube at the moment and how not to do
*  it, how to do it with different levels of conditions and things. But when you think about landing on
*  Mars, just the light travel time effect means that there's no possibility of a human controlling
*  that descent. And so you have to put all of your faith and your trust in the computer code or the
*  AI or whatever it is that you've put on board that thing to make the correct descent. And so there's
*  this famous period called seven minutes of hell where you're basically waiting for that light
*  travel time to come back to know whether your vehicle successfully landed on the surface or not.
*  And during that period, you know in your mind simultaneously that it is doing these multi stages
*  of deploying its parachute, deploying the crane, activating its jets to come down and controlling
*  its descent to the surface. And then the crane has to fly away so it doesn't accidentally hit the rover.
*  And so there's a series of multi-stage points where any of them go wrong, the whole mission
*  could go awry. And so the fact that we are fairly consistently able to build these machines that can
*  do this autonomously is to me one of the most impressive acts of engineering that NASA have
*  achieved. Yes, the unfortunate fact about physics is the takeoff is easier than the landing.
*  And you mentioned Starship, one of the incredible engineering feats that you get to see is the
*  reusable rockets that take off but they land and they land using control and they do so perfectly
*  and sometimes when it's synchronous it's just it's beautiful to see. And then with Starship you see
*  the chopsticks that catch the ship. I mean there's just so much incredible engineering. But you
*  mentioned Starship is somehow helpful here. So what's your hope with Starship? What kind of
*  science might it enable possibly? There's two things. I mean it's the launch cost itself,
*  which is hopefully going to mean per kilogram it's going to dramatically reduce the cost of it.
*  So even if it's a factor of 10 higher than what Elon originally promised, this is going to be a
*  revolution for the cost to launch. That means you could do all sorts of things. You could launch
*  large telescopes which could be basically like JWST but you don't even have to fold them up.
*  JWST had this whole issue with its design that it's six and a half meters across and so you have to
*  there's no fuselage which is that large at the time. The Aries IV wasn't large enough for that
*  and so they had to fold it up into this kind of complicated origami. And so a large part of the
*  cost was figuring out how to fold it up, testing that it unfolded correctly, repeated testing and
*  there was something like 130 fail points or something during this unfolding mechanism.
*  And so all of us were holding our breath during that process. But if you have the ability to just
*  launch arbitrarily large masses, at least comparatively compared to JWST and very large
*  mirrors into space, you can more or less repurpose ground-based mirrors. The Hubble Space Telescope
*  mirror and the JWST mirrors are designed to be extremely lightweight and that increased their
*  cost significantly. They have this kind of honeycomb design on the back to try and minimize the weight.
*  If you don't really care about weight because it's so cheap, then you could just literally grab
*  many of the existing ground-based mirrors across telescopes across the world, four meter, five
*  meter mirrors and just pretty much attach them to a chassis and have your own space-based telescope.
*  I think the Breakthrough Foundation, for instance, is an entity that has been interested in doing
*  this sort of thing. And so that raises the prospects of having not just one JWST that just...
*  JWST is a fantastic resource, but it's split between all of us, cosmologists, star formation
*  astronomers, those of us studying exoplanets, those of us wanting to study the ultra deep
*  fields and the origin of the first galaxies, the expansionary of the universe. Everyone has
*  to share this resource, but we could potentially each have one JWST each that is maybe just studying
*  a handful of the brightest exoplanet stars and measuring their atmospheres. This is important
*  because if you... We talked about this planet Trappist-1e earlier. That planet, if JWST studied
*  it and tried to look for biosignatures, by which I mean oxygen, nitrous oxide, methane, it would take
*  it of order of 200 transits to get even a very marginal, what we'd call two and a half sigma
*  detection of those, which basically nobody would believe with that. And 100 transits, I mean, this
*  thing transits once every six days. So you're talking about sort of four years of staring at
*  the same star with one telescope. There'd be some breaks, but it'd be hard to schedule much else
*  because you'll have to continuously catch each one of these transits to build up your signal to noise.
*  And so JWST is never going to do that. In principle, technically, JWST could technically
*  have the capability of just about detecting a biosignature on an Earth-like planet around
*  a non-sun-like star. But still, impressively, we have basically the technology to do that,
*  but we simply cannot dedicate all of its time practically to that one resource. And so Starship
*  opens up opportunities like that of mass producing these kinds of telescopes, which will allow us to
*  survey the life in the universe, which of course is one of the grand goals of astronomy.
*  I wonder if you can speak to the bureaucracy, the political battles, the scientific battles
*  for time on the James Webb telescope. There must be a fascinating process of scheduling that.
*  All scientists are trying to collaborate and figure out what the most important problems are.
*  And there's an interesting network of interfering scientific experiments,
*  probably, that you have to somehow optimize over.
*  It's a really difficult process. I don't envy the TAC that are going to have to make this decision.
*  We call it the TAC, the Time Allocation Committee that make this decision.
*  And I've served on these before, and it's very difficult. I mean, typically for Hubble,
*  we were seeing at least 10, sometimes 20 times the number of proposals for telescope time versus
*  available telescope time. For JGST, there has been one call already that has gone out. We call it
*  cycle one, and that was oversubscribed by, I think something like six to one, seven to one.
*  And the cycle two, which has just been announced fairly recently, and the deadline is actually
*  the end of this month. So my team are totally laser focused on writing our proposals right now.
*  That is expected to be much more competitive, probably more comparable to what Hubble saw.
*  So it's hard.
*  More competitive than the cycle one you said already?
*  More competitive than the first cycle. So I said the first cycle of James Webb was about six to one,
*  and this will probably be more like 20 to one, I would expect.
*  These are all proposals by scientists and so on. And it's not like you can schedule at any time,
*  because if you're looking for transit times.
*  Yeah, you have a time critical element.
*  Yes, time critical element. And they're conflicting in non-obvious ways,
*  because the frequency is different, the duration is different. There's probably computational
*  needs that are different. There's the type of sensors, the direction pointing, all that.
*  Yeah, it's hard. And there are certain programs like doing a deep field study where you just more
*  or less point the telescope, and that's pretty open. I mean, you're just accumulating photons.
*  You can just point at that patch of the sky whenever the telescope is not doing anything
*  else and just get to your month, let's say a month of integration time is your goal over
*  the lifetime of JVST. So that's maybe a little bit easier to schedule. It's harder, especially
*  for us looking at cool worlds, because as I said earlier, these planets transit very infrequently.
*  So we have to wait. If you're looking at the earth transiting the sun and alien watching us,
*  they would only get one opportunity per year to do that observation.
*  The transit lasts for about 12 hours. And so if they don't get that time, it's hard. That's it.
*  If it conflicted with another proposal that wants to use another time critical element,
*  it's much easier for planets like these hot planets or these close-in planets,
*  because they transit so frequently, there's maybe 100 opportunities. And so then the TAC can say,
*  okay, they want 10 transits, there's 100 opportunities here. It's easier for us to
*  give them time. We're almost in the worst case scenario. We're proposing to look for
*  exomeons around two cool planets. And so we really only have one bite of the cherry for each one.
*  And so our sales pitch has been that these are extremely precious events. And more importantly,
*  JVST is the only telescope, the only machine humanity has ever constructed, which is capable
*  of finding moons akin to the moons in our solar system. Kepler can't do it. Even Hubble can't do
*  it. JVST is the first one. And so there is a new window to the universe because we know these moons
*  exist. They're all over the place in the solar system. You have the moon, you have Io, Callisto,
*  Europa, Ganymede, Titan, lots of moons are fairly similar size, sort of 30% the size of the Earth.
*  And this telescope is the first one that can find them. And so we're very excited about the profound
*  implications of ultimately solving this journey we're on in astronomy, which is to understand our
*  uniqueness. We want to understand how common is the solar system. Are we the architecture that
*  frequently emerges naturally, or is there something special about what happened here?
*  I think this is not the worst case, the best case. It's obvious. It's super rare. So I love
*  scheduling from a computer science perspective. That's my background. So algorithmically,
*  to solve a schedule problem, I would schedule the rarest things first. And obviously this is the
*  JWST is the first thing that can actually detect a cool world. So this is a big new thing. You can
*  show off that new thing happens rarely schedule it first. Perfect. You should be in the tech.
*  I'll file my application after we're done with this. I, you know, this part of me is the OCD.
*  Part of me is the computational aspect. I love scheduling a computing device because you have
*  that kind of scheduling on supercomputers on that scheduling problems fascinating. How do you
*  prioritize computation? How do you prioritize science, data collection, sample collection,
*  all that kind of stuff. It's actually kind of, it's kind of fascinating because data in ways you
*  expect and don't expect will unlock a lot of solutions to some fascinating mysteries. And so
*  collecting the data and doing so in a way that maximizes the possibility of discovery is really
*  interesting. Like from a computational perspective. I agree. There's a real satisfaction
*  extracting the maximum science per unit time out of your telescope. And that's the tech's job.
*  But the tech are not machines. They're not a piece of computer code. They will make their selections
*  based off human judgment. And a lot of the telescope is certainly within the field of
*  exoplanets because it's different fields of astronomy, but within the field of exoplanets,
*  I think a good expectation is that most of the telescope time that JWST have will go towards
*  atmospheric retrieval, which is sort of alluded to earlier, you know, like detecting molecules in
*  the atmospheres, not biosignatures, because as I said, it's really not designed to do that. It's
*  pushing JWST probably too far to expect it to do that. But it could detect, for example, a carbon
*  dioxide rich atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1e. That's not a biosignature, but you could prove it's like a
*  Venus in that case, or maybe like a Mars in that case. Like both those have carbon dioxide rich
*  atmospheres. It doesn't prove or disprove the existence of life either way, but it is our first
*  characterization of the nature of those atmospheres. Maybe we can even tell the pressure level and the
*  temperature of those atmospheres. So that's very exciting. But we are competing with that. And I
*  think that science is completely mind-blowing and fantastic. We have a completely different objective,
*  which is in our case to try and look for the first evidence of these small moons around these
*  planets, potentially even moons which could be habitable, of course. So I think it's a very
*  exciting goal. But ATT&CK has to make a human judgment essentially about which science are
*  they most excited by, which one has the highest promise of return, the highest chance of return.
*  And so that's hard because if you look at a planetary atmosphere, well, you know most of
*  the time the planet has an atmosphere already. And so there's almost a guaranteed success that
*  you're going to learn something about the atmosphere by pointing to the U.S.T. edit.
*  Whereas in our case, there's a harder sell. We are looking for something that we do not know for
*  sure exists yet or not. And so we are pushing the telescope to do something which is inherently more
*  risky. Yeah, but the existence is shown already gives a deep lesson about what's out there in the
*  universe. That means that other stars have similar types of variety as we have in our solar system.
*  They have an I.O., they have a Europa and so on, which means like there's a lot of possibility
*  for icy planets, for water, for planets that enable planets and moons that I mean that's
*  super exciting because that means everywhere through our galaxy and beyond, there is just
*  innumerable possibility for weird creatures. I agree. You don't have to convince me.
*  I mean, NASA has been on this quest for a long time and it's sometimes called Eater Earth.
*  It's the frequency of Earth like usually they say planets in the universe. How common are
*  planets similar to our Earth in terms of ultimately we'd like to know everything about
*  these planets in terms of the amount of water they have, how much atmosphere they have. But
*  for now, it's kind of focused just on the size and the distance from the star essentially. How
*  often do you get similar conditions to that? That was Kepler's primary mission and it really just
*  kind of flirted with the answer. It didn't quite get to a definitive answer. But I always say,
*  look, if that's our primary goal to look for Earth like I would say worlds, then moons has to be a
*  part of that because we know that Earth like from the capital data, the preliminary result is that
*  Earth like planets around Sun like stars is not an inevitable outcome. It seems to be something
*  like a one to 10% outcome. So it's not particularly inevitable that happens. But we do often see about
*  half of all Sun like stars have either a mini Neptune, a Neptune or a Jupiter in the habitable
*  zone of their stars. That's a very, very common occurrence that we see. Yet we have no idea how
*  often they have moons around them, which could also be habitable. And so there may very well be
*  if even one in five of them has an Earth like moon or even a Mars like moon around them,
*  then there would be more habitable real estate in terms of exo moons than exo planets in the universe.
*  So you can essentially 2x, 3x, 5x, maybe 10x the number of habitable worlds out there in the
*  universe. Our current estimate for like the Drake equation. Absolutely. So this is a one way to
*  increase the confidence and increase the value of that parameter. And just know where to look. I mean,
*  we would like to know where should we listen for technosignatures? Where should we be looking for
*  biosignatures? And not only that, but what role does the moon have in terms of its influence on
*  the planet? We talked about these directly image telescopes earlier, these missions that want to
*  take a photo to quote Carl Sagan, the pale blue dot of our planet, but the pale blue dot of an
*  exoplanet. And that's the dream to one day capture that. But as impressive as the resolution is that
*  we are planning and conspiring to design for the future generation telescopes to achieve that,
*  even those telescopes will not have the capability of resolving the Earth and the moon
*  within that. It'll be a pale blue dot pixel, but the moon's gray, grayness will be intermixed
*  with that pixel. And so this is a big problem because one of the ways that we are claiming
*  to look for life in the universe is a chemical disequilibrium. So you see two molecules that just
*  shouldn't be there. They normally react with each other or even one molecule that's just too reactive
*  to be hanging around the atmosphere by itself. So if you had oxygen and methane hanging out together,
*  those would normally react fairly easily. And so if you detected those two molecules in your pale
*  blue dot spectra, you'd be like, okay, we have evidence for life. Something's metabolizing on
*  this planet. However, the challenge is what if that moon was Titan? Titan has a methane rich
*  atmosphere. And what if the pale blue dot was in fact a planet devoid of life, but it had oxygen
*  because of water undergoing this photolysis reaction splitting into oxygen and hydrogen
*  separately? So then you have all of the hallmarks of what we would claim to be life, but all along
*  you were tricked. It was just a moon that was deceiving you. And so we are never going to,
*  I would claim, really understand or complete this quest of looking for life by signatures in the
*  universe unless we have a deep knowledge of the prevalence and role that moons have. They may even
*  affect the habitability of the planets themselves. Of course, our own moon is freakishly large. By
*  mass ratio, it's the largest moon in the solar system. It's a 1% mass moon. If you look at
*  Jupiter's moons, they're like 10 to the power minus four, much smaller. And so our own moon
*  seems to stabilize the obliquity of our planet. It gives rise to tides. Especially early on when
*  the moon was closer, those tides would have covered entire continents. And those rock pools
*  that would have been scattered across the entire plateau may have been the origin of life on our
*  planet. The moon forming impact may have stripped a significant fractional lithosphere off the Earth,
*  which without it, plate tectonics may not have been possible. We'd have had a stagnant lid
*  because there was just too much lithosphere stuck on the top of the planet. And so there are
*  speculative reasons but intriguing reasons as to why a large moon may be not just important but
*  central to the question of having the conditions necessary for life. So moons can be habitable in
*  their own right, but they can also play a significant influence on the habitability
*  of the planets they orbit. And further, they will surely interfere with our attempts to detect life
*  remotely from afar. So taking a tangent upon a tangent, you've written about binary planets.
*  And that they're surprisingly common. Or they might be surprisingly common.
*  What's the difference between a large moon and binary planets? What are binary planets?
*  What's interesting to say here about giant rocks flying through space and orbiting each other?
*  The thing that's interesting about binary objects is that they're very common in the universe.
*  Binary stars are everywhere. In fact, the majority of stars seem to live in binary systems.
*  When we look at the outer edges of the solar system, we see binary Kuiper belt objects all
*  the time. Asteroids basically bound to one another. Pluto-Sharon is kind of an example of that.
*  It's a 10% mass ratio system. It almost is by many definitions a binary planet, but now it's a
*  dwarf planet. So we know that the universe likes to make things in pairs.
*  So you're saying our Sun is an incel. So most things are dating, they're in relationships,
*  and ours is alone. It's not a complete freak of the universe to be alone, but it's more common
*  for Sun-like stars. If you count up all the Sun-like stars in the universe, about half of the Sun-like
*  star systems are in binary or trinary systems, and the other half are single. But because those
*  binaries are two or three stars, then cumulatively, maybe like a third of all Sun-like stars are single.
*  I'm trying hard to not anthropomorphize the relationship the stars have with each other.
*  I've met those folks also. So is there something interesting to learn about the habitability,
*  how that affects the probability of habitable worlds when they kind of couple up like that
*  in those different ways? It depends which way we're talking about the stars of the planet. Certainly,
*  if stars couple up, that has a big influence on the habitability. Of course, this is very famous
*  from Star Wars. Tatooine in Star Wars is a binary star system, and you have Luke Skywalker looking
*  at the sunset and seeing two stars come down. For years, we thought that was purely a product
*  of George Lucas's incredibly creative mind, and we didn't think that planets would exist around
*  binary star systems. It seems like too tumultuous an environment for a quiescent planetary disk,
*  circumstellar disk, to form planets from. And yet, one of the astounding discoveries from Kepler
*  was that these appear to be quite common. In fact, as far as we can tell, they're just as
*  common around binary stars, as single stars. The only caveat to that is that you don't get
*  planets close into binary stars. They have a clearance region on the inside where planets
*  maybe they form there, but they don't last. They are dynamically unstable in that zone.
*  But once you get out to about the distance that the Earth orbits the Sun or even a little bit
*  closer in, you start to find planets emerging. And so that's the right distance for liquid water,
*  so a distance for potentially life on those planets. And so there may very well be plenty
*  of habitable planets around the binary stars. Binary planets is a little bit different.
*  Binary planets, I don't think we have any serious connection of planet banarity to habitability.
*  Certainly when we investigated it, that wasn't our drive that this is somehow the solution to
*  life in the universe or anything. It was really just like all good science questions,
*  a curiosity driven question. What's the dynamic? Are they legit orbiting each other
*  as they orbit the star? So the formation mechanism proposed here, because it is very difficult to
*  form two protoplanets close to each other like this. They would generally merge within the disk,
*  and so that's why you normally get single planets. But you could have something like Jupiter and
*  Saturn form at separate distances. They could dynamically be scattered in towards one another
*  and basically not quite collide, but have a very close on encounter. Now, because tidal forces
*  increase dramatically as the distance decreases between two objects, the tides can actually
*  dissipate the kinetic energy and bring them bound into one another. So that seems, when you first
*  hear that, you think, well, that seems fairly contrived that you'd have the conditions just
*  right to get these tides to cause a capture. But numerical simulations have shown that about
*  10% of planet-planet encounters are shown to produce something like binary planets,
*  which is a startling prediction. And so that seems at odds with naively the exoplanet catalog for
*  which we know of so far no binary planets. And we propose one of the resolutions to this might be
*  that the binary planets are just incredibly difficult to detect, which is also counterintuitive.
*  Because remember how they form is through this tidal mechanism. And so they form extremely close
*  to each other. So the distance that Io is away from Jupiter, just a few planetary radii,
*  they're almost touching one another and they're just tidally locked facing each other for eternity.
*  And so in that configuration, as it transits across the star, it kind of looks like
*  you can't really resolve these two planets. It just looks like one planet to you that's
*  going across the star. The temporal resolution of the data is rarely good enough to distinguish
*  that. And so you'd see one transit, but in fact it's two planets very close together,
*  which are transiting at once. And so yeah, we wrote a paper just recently where we developed
*  some techniques to try and get around this problem and hopefully provide a tool where we could
*  finally look for these planets. The problem of detection of these planets when they're so close.
*  That was our focus was how do you get around this merging problem? So whether they're out there or
*  not, we don't know. We were planning to do a search for them, but it remains an open question.
*  And I think just one of those fun astrophysics, curiosity questions, whether binary planets exist
*  in the universe, because then you have binary Earths, you could have binary Neptune, all sorts
*  of wild stuff that would float the sci-fi imagination. I wonder what the physics on a
*  binary planet feels like. It might be trivial. I have to think about that. I wonder if there's
*  some interesting dynamics. Like if you feel multiple or would gravity feel different on
*  different parts of the surface of the sphere when there's another large sphere that's in.
*  Yeah. I would think that the force would be fairly similar because the shape of the object would
*  deform to a flat geopotential, essentially a uniform geopotential, but it would lead to a distorted
*  shape for the two objects. I think they'd become ellipsoids facing one another. So it would be
*  pretty wild when people like flat Earth or spherical Earth, you fly from space and see
*  a football shaped Earth. Finally, there's proof. And I wonder how difficult it would be to travel
*  from one to the other because you have to overcome the one. No, it might be kind of easy.
*  Yeah. I mean, they're so close to each other that helps. And I think the most critical
*  factor would be how massive is the planet. One of the challenges with escaping planets,
*  there was a fun paper when my colleagues wrote that suggested that super Earth planets may be
*  inescapable. If you're a civilization that were born on a super Earth, the surface gravity is so
*  high that the chemical potential energy of hydrogen or methane, whatever fuel you're using, simply
*  is at odds with the gravity of the planet itself. And so you would, our current rockets,
*  I'm not sure what the fraction, but maybe like 90% of the rocket is fuel or something by mass.
*  These things would have to be like the size of the Giza pyramids of fuel with just a tiny
*  tip on the top in order just to escape that planetary atmosphere. And so it has been argued
*  that if you live on a super Earth, you may be forced to live there forever. There may be no
*  escape unless you invent a space elevator or something. But then how do you even build the
*  infrastructure in space to do something like that in the absence of a successful rocket program?
*  And so the more and more we look at our Earth and think about the sorts of problems we're facing,
*  the more you see things about the Earth which make it ideally suited in so many regards.
*  It's almost spooky that we not only live on a planet which has the right conditions for life,
*  for intelligent life, for sustained fossil fuel industry, just happens to be in the ground. We
*  have plenty of fossil fuels to get our industrial revolution going, but also the chemical energy
*  contained within those fossil fuels and hydrogen and other fuels is sufficient that we have the
*  ability to escape our planetary atmosphere and planetary gravity to have a space program.
*  And we also happen to have a celestial body which is just within reach, the Moon, which doesn't
*  also necessarily have to be true. Were the Moon not there, what effect would that have had on our
*  aspirations of a space program in the 1960s? Would there have ever been a space race to Mars
*  or to Venus? It's a much harder, certainly for a human program, that seems almost impossible with
*  1960s technology to imagine. It's almost as if somebody constructed a set of challenging
*  obstacles before us, challenging problems to solve. They're challenging, but they're doable,
*  and there's a sequence to them. Gravity is very difficult to overcome, but we have given the size
*  of Earth, it's not so bad that we can still actually construct propulsion systems that can escape it.
*  And the same with climate change, perhaps. Climate change is the next major problem facing our
*  civilization, but we know it is technically surmountable. It does seem sometimes like there
*  has been a series of challenges laid out to progress us towards a mature civilization that
*  can one day perhaps expand to the stars. I'm a little more concerned about nuclear weapons,
*  AI, and natural or artificial pandemics, but yes, climate change.
*  Yeah, well, there you go. I mean, plenty of milestones that we need to cross,
*  and we can argue about the severity of each of them, but there is no doubt that we live in a world
*  that has serious challenges that are pushing our intellects and our will to the limit of
*  whether we're really ready to progress to the next stage of our development.
*  So thank you for taking the tangent, and there'll be a million more,
*  but can we step back to Kepler-1625b? What is it? And you've talked about this kind of journey,
*  this effort to discover exo-moons, so moons out there, or small, cool objects out there.
*  Where does that effort stand, and what is Kepler-1625b?
*  Yeah, I mean, I've been searching for exo-moons for most of my professional career, and I think
*  a lot of my colleagues think I'm kind of crazy to still be doing it. After five years of not
*  finding anything, I think most people would probably try doing something else. I even had
*  people say that to me. They said, professors, I remember at a cocktail party, took me to the
*  side, an MIT professor, and he said, you should just look for hot Jupiters. They're everywhere.
*  It's really, you can write papers. They're so easy to find. I was like, yeah, but hot Jupiters,
*  they're not interesting to me. I want to do something that I feel intellectually pushes me
*  to the edge. It's maybe a contribution that not no one else could do, but maybe it's not certainly
*  the thing that anybody could do. I don't want to just be the first to something for the sake of
*  being first. I want to do something that feels like a meaningful, intellectual contribution to
*  our society. This exo-moon problem has been haunting me for years to try and solve this.
*  Now, as I said, we looked for years and years using Kepler, and the closest we ever got was
*  just a hint for this one star. Kepler-1625 has a Jupiter-like planet in orbit of it.
*  That Jupiter-like planet is on a 287-day period, so it's almost the same distance as the Earth
*  around the Sun, but for a Jupiter. That was already unusual. I don't think people realize
*  that Jupiter-like planets are quite rare in the universe. Certainly, many Neptune's and Neptune's
*  are extremely common, but Jupiter's only about 10% of Sun-like stars have Jupiters around them,
*  as far as we can tell. When you say Jupiter, which aspect of Jupiter? In terms of its mass
*  and its major axis. Anything beyond about half an AU, so half the distance of the Earth and the Sun,
*  and something of order of a tenth of a Jupiter mass, that's the mass of Saturn,
*  up to say 10 Jupiter masses, which is basically where you start to get to brown dwarfs.
*  Those types of objects appear to be somewhat unusual. Most solar systems do not have Jupiters,
*  which is really interesting because Jupiter, again, like the Moon, seems to have been
*  a pivotal character in the story of the development of our solar system,
*  perhaps especially having a large influence of the development of the late heavy bombardment
*  and the rate of asteroid impacts that we receive and things like this. Anyway, to come back to 1625,
*  this Jupiter-like planet had a hint of something in the data. What I mean by that is when we looked
*  at the transit, we got the familiar decrease in light that we always see when a planet
*  trusses in front of the star, but we saw something extra. Just on the edges, we saw some extra
*  dips around the outside. It was right at the hairy edge of detectability. We didn't believe it because
*  I think one of the challenges of looking for something for 10 years is that you become your
*  own greatest skeptic. No matter what you're shown, you're always thinking, it's like falling in love
*  so many times and it not working out. You convince yourself it's never going to happen, not for me.
*  This just isn't going to happen. I saw that and I didn't really believe it because I didn't dare
*  let myself believe it. But being a good scientist, we knew we had an obligation to publish it,
*  to talk about the result and to follow it up and to try and resolve what was going on.
*  We asked for Hubble Space Telescope Time, which was awarded in that case. We were one of those
*  lucky 20 that got telescope time. We stared at it for about 40 hours continuously. To provide some
*  context, the dip that we saw on the Kepa data corresponded to a Neptune-sized moon around a
*  Jupiter-sized planet, which was another reason why I was skeptical. We don't have that in the
*  solar system. That seems so strange. Then when we got the Hubble data, it seemed to confirm exactly
*  that. There were two really striking pieces of evidence in the data that suggested this moon was
*  there. Another was a fairly clear second dip in light, pretty clearly resolved by Hubble. It was
*  about a five-sigma detection. On top of that, we could see the planet didn't transit when it should
*  have done. It actually transited earlier than we expected it to, about 20 minutes or so.
*  That's a hallmark of a gravitational interaction between the planet and the moon. We actually
*  expected that. You can also expect that if the moon transits after the planet, then the planet
*  should come in earlier than expected because the barycenter, the center of mass, lives between the
*  two of them, kind of like on a balancing arm between them. We saw that as well. The phase
*  signature matched up. The mass of the moon was measured to be Neptune mass, and the size of the
*  moon was measured to be Neptune radius. Everything just really lined up. We spent months and months
*  trying to kill it. This is my strategy for anything interesting. We just try to throw the kitchen sink
*  at it and say, we must be tricked by something. We tried looking at the centroid motion of the
*  telescope, the different wavelength channels that have been observed, the pixel-level information.
*  No matter what we did, we just couldn't get rid of it. We submitted it to Science. I think at the
*  time, Science, which is one of the top journals, said to us, would you mind calling your paper
*  discovery of an exo-moon? I had to push back, and we said, no, we're not calling it that.
*  Even despite everything we've done, we're not calling it a discovery. We're calling it evidence
*  for an exo-moon. For me, I'd want to see this repeat two times, three times, four times before
*  I really would bet my house that this is the real deal. I do worry, as I said, that perhaps that's
*  my own skepticism, self-skepticism going too far. But I think it was the right decision. Since that
*  paper came out, there has been continuous interest in the subject. Another team independently analyzed
*  that star and recovered actually pretty much exactly the same resources as us, the same dip,
*  the same wobble of the planet. A third team looked at it and they actually got something different.
*  They saw the dip was diminished compared to what we saw. They saw a little hint of a dip,
*  but not as pronounced as what we saw. They saw the wobble as well. There's been a little bit of
*  tension about analyzing the reduction of the Hubble data. The only way in my mind to resolve this is
*  just to look again. We actually did propose to Hubble straight after that. We said, look,
*  if our model is right, if the Moon is there, it came in late last time. It transited after the
*  planet. Because of the orbit, we can calculate that it should transit before the planet next time.
*  If it's not there, if it doesn't transit before, and even if we see a dip afterwards, we know that's
*  not our Moon. It's obviously some instrumental effect with the data. We had a causal prediction
*  as to where the Moon should be. I was really excited about that, but we didn't get the
*  telescope time. Unfortunately, if you go further into the future, we no longer have the predictive
*  capability because it's like predicting the weather. You might be able to predict the weather next
*  week to some level of accuracy, but predicting the weather next year becomes incredibly hard.
*  The uncertainties just grow and compound as you go forward into the future more and more.
*  How are you able to know where the Moon will be positioned so you're able to tell the orbiting
*  geometry and frequency?
*  Basically, from the wobbles of the planet itself, that tells us the orbital motion of the Moon.
*  It's the reflex motion of the Moon upon the planet.
*  Isn't it just an estimate where... I'm concerned about you making a strong prediction here because
*  if you don't get the Moon where the Moon leads on the next time around, if you did get in the
*  Hubble time, couldn't that mean something else if you didn't see that? Because you said it would
*  be an instrumental... I feel the strong urge to disprove your hero, which is a really good
*  imperative. It's a good way to do science, but this is such a noisy signal or blurry signal maybe,
*  low resolution signal maybe.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a five sigma signal. That's at the slightly uncomfortable edge. I mean,
*  it's often said that for any detection of a first new phenomena, you really want like a 20,
*  25 sigma detection. Then there's just no doubt that what you're seeing is real.
*  This was at that edge. I mean, I guess it's comparable to the Higgs boson, but the Higgs
*  boson was slightly different because there was so much theoretical impetus as to expect
*  a signal at that precise location. A Neptune-sized Moon was not predicted by anyone.
*  There's no papers you can find that expect Neptune-sized Moons around Jupiter-sized
*  planets. So I think we were inherently skeptical about its reality for that reason.
*  But this is science in action. We fit the wobbles, we fit the dips, and we have this 3G
*  geometric model for the motion of the orbit. And projecting that forward, we found that about
*  80% of our projections led to the Moon to be before. So it's not 100%. There was maybe 20%
*  of the cases it was over here. But to me, that was a hard enough projection that we felt confident
*  that we could refute the exit, which was what I really wanted. I wanted a refutable, that's the
*  basis of science, a falsifiable hypothesis. How can you make progress in science if you don't have
*  a falsifiable testable hypothesis? And so that was the beauty of this particular case.
*  LW So there's a numerical simulation with the Moon that fits the data that we observed,
*  and then you can now make predictions based on that simulation.
*  MG Yeah.
*  LW That's so cool. Okay.
*  MG It's fun. These are like little solar systems that we can simulate on the computer and imagine
*  their motions. But we are pushing things to the very limits of what's possible. And that's
*  double-edged sword. It's both incredibly exciting intellectually, but you're always risking, to some
*  degree, the pushing too far. LW So I'd like to ask you about the recent paper you co-authored,
*  an ExoMoon survey of 70 cool giant exoplanets and the new candidate coupler 1708 BI.
*  MG I would say there's like three or four candidates at this point,
*  of which we have published two of them. And to me, two are quite compelling and deserve
*  follow-up observations. And so to get a confirmed detection, at least in our case, we would need to
*  see it repeat for sure. One of the problems with some of the other methods that have been proposed
*  is that you don't get that repeatability. So for instance, an example of a technique that would
*  lack that would be gravitational microlensing. So it is possible with a new telescope coming up in
*  the future called the Roman Space Telescope, which is basically a repurposed spy satellite
*  that's the size of the Hubble mirror going up into space. It will stare at millions of stars
*  simultaneously and it will look to see, instead of whether any of those stars get dimmer for a short
*  amount of time, which would be a transit, it'll look for the opposite. It'll look to see if anything
*  get brighter. And that brightness increase is caused by another planetary system passing in front
*  and then gravitationally lensing light around it to cause a brightening. And so this is a method of
*  discovering an entire solar system, but only for a glimpse. You just get a short glimpse of it passing
*  like a ship sailing through the night, just that one photo of it. Now the problem with that is that
*  it's very difficult. The physics of gravitational lensing are not surprisingly quite complicated.
*  And so there's many, many possible solutions. So you might have a solution, which is this could be
*  a red dwarf star with a Jupiter-like planet around it. That's one solution. But another solution is
*  that it's a free-floating planet, a rogue planet like Jupiter with an Earth-like moon around it.
*  And those two solutions are almost indistinguishable. Now, ideally, we would be
*  able to repeat the observation. We'd be able to go back and see, well, if the moon really is there,
*  then we could predict its mass, its predicted motion and expect it to be maybe over here next
*  time or something. With microlensing, it's a one snapshot event. And so for me, it's intriguing as
*  a way of revealing something about the exomeon population. But I always come back to transits
*  because it's the only method we really have that's absolutely repeatable, that we'll be able to come
*  back and prove to everyone that, look, on the 17th of October, the moon will be over here and
*  the moon will look like this and we can actually capture that image. And that's what we see with,
*  of course, many exoplanets. So we want to get to that same point of full confidence,
*  full confirmation, the slam dunk detection of these exomeons. But yeah, it's been a hell of a
*  journey to try and push the field into that direction. And-
*  Is there some resistance to the transit method?
*  Not to the transit method. I just say to exomeons. So the transit method is by far the most popular
*  method for looking for exoplanets. But yeah, as I've alluded to, exomeons is kind of a niche
*  topic within the discipline of exoplanets. And that's largely because there are people I think
*  are waiting for those slam dunks. And it was like the, if you go back to the first exoplanet
*  discovery that was made in 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Kellos, I think it's true at the time
*  that they were seen as mavericks, that the idea of looking for planets around stars was considered
*  fringe science. And I'm sure many colleagues told them, why don't you do something more safe,
*  like study eclipsing stars, two binary star systems, we know those exist. So why are you
*  wasting your time looking for planets? You're going to get this alien moniker or something,
*  you'll be seen as a fringe maverick scientist. And so I think it was quite difficult for those
*  early planet hunters to get legitimacy and be taken seriously. And so very few people
*  risked their careers to do it, except for those that were either emboldened to try, or had maybe
*  the career, maybe like tenure or something. So they didn't have to necessarily worry about the
*  implications of failure. And so once that happened, once they made the first discoveries overnight,
*  you know, everyone and their dog was getting into exoplanets. And all of a sudden, the whole
*  astronomy community shifted and huge numbers of people that were once upon a time studying
*  eclipsing binaries, you know, changed to becoming exoplanet scientists. And so that was the first
*  wave of exoplanet scientists. We're now in a kind of a second wave or even the third wave, where
*  people like me to some degree kind of grew up with the idea of exoplanets as being normal.
*  You know, I was 11 years old, I guess, when the first exoplanet was discovered. And so to me,
*  it was a fairly normal idea to grow up with. And so we've been trained in exoplanets from
*  the very beginning. And so that brings a different perspective to those who have maybe transitioned
*  from a different career path. And so I suspect with exomoons and probably technosignatures,
*  astrobiology, many of the topics which are seen at the fringes of what's possible,
*  they will all open up into becoming mainstream one day. But there's a lot of people who are
*  just waiting for that assuredness that there is a secure career net ahead of them before they commit.
*  Yeah, it does seem to me that exomoons open wider or open for the first time the door to aliens.
*  So more seriously academically studying, all right, let's look at like alien worlds.
*  So I think it's still pretty fringe to talk about alien life, even on like on Mars and the moons,
*  and so on. You're kind of like, you know, it would be nice, but imagine the first time to
*  discover a living organism, that's going to change. Then everybody will look like an idiot for not
*  focusing everything on this. Because the possibility of the things will it's possible,
*  it might be super boring. It might be very boring bacteria, but even the existence of life elsewhere.
*  Yeah, some, I mean, that changes everything. That means life is everywhere.
*  Yeah, if you knew now that in five years, 10 years, the first life would be discovered elsewhere,
*  you knew that in advance, it would surely affect the way you approach your entire career as a,
*  especially someone junior in astronomy, you would surely be like, well, this is clearly going to be
*  the direction I have to dedicate my classes and my training and my education towards that direction.
*  All the new textbooks, all the writing. And I think there's a lot of value to hedging,
*  like allocating some of the time to that possibility, because the kind of discovery
*  we'll the kind of discoveries we might get in the next few decades. It feels what like we're on the
*  verge of a lot of getting a lot of really good data and having better and better tools that can
*  process that data. So there's just going to be a continuous increase of the kind of discoveries
*  open, like, but a slam dunk, that's hard to come by.
*  Yeah, I think a lot of us are anticipating, I mean, we're already seeing it to some degree
*  with Venus and the phosphine incident. But we've seen before with Bill Clinton's and the White
*  House lawn announcing life from Mars and there are inevitably going to be spurious claims or at
*  least claims which are ambiguous to some degree. There will be for sure a high profile journal,
*  like Nature or Science that will one day publish a paper saying,
*  buy a signature discovered or something like that on Trappist One or some other planet.
*  And then there will be years of back and forth in the literature. And that might seem frustrating,
*  but that's how science works. That's the mechanism of science at play, of people
*  scrutinizing the results to intense skepticism. And it's like a crucible, you burn away all
*  the relevance is until whatever is left is the truth. And so you're left with this product,
*  which is that, okay, we either believe or don't believe that biosignatures are there.
*  So there's inevitably going to be a lot of controversy and debate and argument about it.
*  We just have to anticipate that. And so I think you have to basically have a thick skin to some
*  degree academically to dive into that world. And you're seeing that with phosphine. It's been
*  uncomfortable to watch from the outside the kind of dialogue that some of the scientists have been
*  having with each other about that because- They get a little aggressive.
*  Yeah. And you can understand why because- Jealousy? I don't know. It's me saying,
*  not you. That's me talking. I'm sure there's some envy and jealousy involved on the behalf of the
*  on the, on the behalf of those who are not part of the visual discovery. But there's also,
*  in any case, just leave the particular people involved in Venus alone, in any case of making
*  it a claim of that magnitude, especially life, because life is pretty much one of the biggest
*  discoveries of all time. You can imagine scientifically, you can see, and I'm so
*  conscious of this in myself when I get close to, as I said, even the much smaller goal of setting
*  an exomoon, the ego creep in. And so as a scientist, we have to be so guarded against our own egos.
*  You see the lights in your eyes of a Nobel Prize or the fame and fortune and being remembered in
*  the history books. And we all grew up in our training learning about Newton and Einstein,
*  these giants of the field, Feynman and Maxwell. And you get the idea of these individual
*  contributions, which get immortalized for all time. And that's seductive. It's why many of us with
*  the skill set to go into maybe banking instead decided, actually, there's something about the
*  idea of being immortalized and contributing towards society in a permanent way that is more
*  attractive than the financial reward of applying my skills elsewhere. So to some degree, that ego
*  can be a benefit because it brings in skillful people into our field who might otherwise be
*  tempted by money elsewhere. But on the other hand, the closer you get towards when you start flirting
*  with that Nobel Prize in your eyes or you think you're on the verge of seeing something,
*  you can lose objectivity. A very famous example of this is Barnard Star. There was a planet
*  claimed there by Peter van der Kamp, I think it was in 1968, 69. And at the time, it would
*  have been the first ever exoplanet ever claimed. And he felt assured that this planet was there.
*  He was actually using the wobbling star method, but using the positions of the stars to see them
*  to claim this exoplanet. It turned out that this planet was not there. Subsequent analyses by both
*  dynamicists and theorists and those looking at the instrumental data established fairly
*  unanimously that there was no way this planet was really there. But Peter van der Kamp insisted it
*  was there despite overwhelming evidence that was accruing against him. And even to the day he died,
*  which was, I think, in the early 90s, he was still insisting this planet was there, even when we were
*  starting to make the first genuine exoplanet discoveries. And even at that point, I think
*  Hubble had even looked at that star and had totally ruled out any possibility of what he
*  was talking about. And so that's a problem. How do you get to a point as a scientist where
*  you just can't accept anything that comes otherwise? Because it starts out with the
*  dream of fame, and then it ends in a stubborn refusal to ever back down.
*  Of course, the flip side of that is sometimes you need that to have the strength to carry a belief
*  against the entire scientific community that resists your beliefs. And so it's a double-edged
*  sword. That can happen. But I guess the distinction here is evidence. So in this case,
*  the evidence was so overwhelming. It wasn't really a matter of interpretation. You would observe this
*  star with the same star, but with maybe 10, even 100 times greater precision for much longer
*  periods of time. And there was just no doubt at this point this planet was a mirage.
*  And so that's why you have to be very careful. I always say, don't ever name my wife or my daughter.
*  Name this planet after me that you discover. I can't ever name a planet after you,
*  because I won't be objective anymore. How could I ever turn around to you and say that planet
*  wasn't real that I named after you? So you're somebody that talks about,
*  and it's clear in your eyes and in your way of being, that you love the process of discovery,
*  that joy, the magic of just seeing something, a new observation, a new idea. But I guess the point
*  is when you have that great feeling is to then switch on the skepticism. To start testing
*  what does this actually mean? Is this real? What are the possible different interpretations
*  that could make this a lot less grand than I first imagined? So both have the wander
*  and the skepticism all in one brain. Yeah, I think generally the more I want something to be true,
*  the more I inherently doubt it. And I think that just comes from, I grew up with a religious family
*  and was just sort of indoctrinated to some degree, like many children are, that, okay,
*  this is just normal, that there's a God and this is the way the world is. God created the Earth.
*  And then as I became more well-read and literate of what was happening in the world scientifically,
*  I started to doubt. And it really just struck me that the hardest thing to let go of when you do
*  decide not to be religious anymore, and it's not really like a light bulb moment, but it just kind
*  of happens over 11 to 13, I think for me it was happening. But it's that sadness of letting go of
*  this beautiful dream, which you had in your mind of eternal life for behaving yourself on Earth,
*  you would have this beautiful heaven that you could go to and live forever. And that's very
*  attractive. And for me personally, that was one of the things that pulled me against it,
*  was it's like it's too good to be true. And it's very convenient that this could be so.
*  And I have no evidence directly in terms of a scientific sense to support this hypothesis.
*  And it just became really difficult to reconcile my growth as a scientist. And I know some people
*  find that reconciliation. I have not, maybe I will one day. But as a general guiding principle,
*  which I think I obtained from that experience, was that I have to be extremely guarded about
*  what I want to be true, because it's going to sway me to say things which are not true if I'm
*  not careful. And that's not what we're trying to do as scientists.
*  So you felt from a religious perspective that there was a little bit of a gravitational field
*  in terms of your opinions, like it was affecting how you could be as a scientist.
*  Like as a scientific thinker, obviously, you were young.
*  Yeah, I think that's true. Whenever there's something you want to be true,
*  it's the ultimate seduction intellectually. And I worry about this a lot with UFOs. It's true
*  already with things like Venus, phosphine, and searching for astrobiological signals.
*  We have to guard against this all the way through from however we're looking for life,
*  however we're looking for whatever this big question is. There is a part of us, I think,
*  I would love there to be life in the universe. I hope there is life in the universe, but
*  I've been on record several times as being fairly firm about trying to remain consciously
*  agnostic about that question. I don't want to make up my mind about what the answer is
*  before I've collected evidence to inform that decision. That's how science should work. If I
*  already know what the answer is, then what am I doing? That's not a scientific experiment anymore.
*  You've already decided, so what are you trying to learn? What's the point of doing the experiment
*  if you already know what the answer is? There's no point. It's so complicated because if I'm being
*  honest with myself, when I imagine the universe, the first thing I imagine about our world is that
*  we humans and me certainly as one particular human,
*  my first assumption is I know almost nothing about how anything works. First of all, that actually
*  applies for things that humans do know like quantum mechanics and all the things that there's
*  different expertises that I just have not dedicated to. Even that starting point. But if we take all
*  of knowledge as human civilization, we know almost nothing. That's kind of an assumption I have
*  because it seems like we keep discovering mysteries and it seems like history,
*  human history is defined by moments when we said, okay, we pretty much figured it all out.
*  And then you realise a century later when you said that you didn't figure out anything.
*  Okay, so that's like a starting point. The second thing I have is I feel like the entirety of the
*  universe is just filled with alien civilizations. Statistically, there's the important thing that
*  enables that belief for me is that they don't have to be human-like. They can be anything.
*  And it's just the fact that life exists and just seeing the way life is on earth that it just finds
*  a way. It finds a way in so many different complicated environments. It finds a way. Whatever
*  that force is, that same force has to find a way elsewhere also. But then if I'm also being honest,
*  I don't know how many hours in a day I spend seriously considering the possibility that we're
*  alone. I don't know when my heart is in mind or filled with wonder, I think about all the different
*  life that's out there. But to really imagine that we're alone, like really imagine all the
*  vastness that's out there. We're alone, not even bacteria. I would say you don't have to believe
*  that we are alone, but you have to admit it's a possibility of our ignorance of the universe so far.
*  You can have a belief about something in the absence of evidence.
*  Carl Sagan famously described that as the definition of faith. If you believe something
*  when there's no evidence, you have faith that there's life in the universe. But you can't
*  demonstrate, you can't prove it mathematically, you can't show me evidence of that.
*  Mathematically, math is a funny thing. The way physicists think, like intuition,
*  so basic reasoning. Is there some value to that?
*  Well, I'd say you can certainly make a very good argument. I think you've already made one.
*  Just the vastness of the universe is the default argument people often turn to.
*  That surely there should be others out there. It's hard to imagine. There are an order of 10 to the
*  22 stars in our observable universe. And so really the question comes down to what is the probability
*  of one of those 10 to the 22 planets, let's say, Earth-like planets, if they all have Earth-like
*  planets, going on to form life spontaneously. That's the process of abiogenesis, the spontaneous
*  emergence of life. Also the word spontaneous is a funny one.
*  Maybe we won't use spontaneous, but not being seeded by some other civilization or something
*  like this. It naturally emerges. Because even the word spontaneous makes it seem less likely.
*  There's just this chemistry and extremely random process.
*  It could be a very gradual process over millions of years of growing complexity in
*  chemical networks. Maybe there's a force in the universe that pushes it towards interesting
*  pockets of complexity that ultimately creates something like life, which we can't possibly
*  define yet. And sometimes it manifests itself into something that looks like humans, but it could be
*  a totally different kind of computational information processing system that we're too
*  dumb to even visualize. It's weird that complexity develops at all.
*  It seems like the opposite to our physical intuition, if you're training in physics,
*  of entropy that complexity is hard to spontaneously emerge in general.
*  That's an interesting problem. Certainly from an evolutionary perspective, you do see growing
*  complexity. There's a nice argument, I think it's by Gould, who shows that if you have a certain
*  amount of complexity, it can either become less complex or more complex through random mutation.
*  The less complex things are stripping away something, something that was necessary potentially to
*  their survival. In general, that's going to be not particularly useful in its survival. It's going to
*  be detrimental to strip away a significant amount of its useful traits. Whereas if you add something,
*  the most typical thing that you add is probably not useful at all. It probably just doesn't really
*  affect its survival negatively, but neither does it provide any significant benefit.
*  But sometimes on rare occasions, of course, it will be of benefit. If you have a certain
*  level of complexity, it's hard to go back in complexity, but it's fairly easy to go forward
*  with enough bites at the cherry. You will eventually build up in complexity. That tends to
*  be why we see complexity grow in certainly in an evolutionary sense, but also perhaps it's operating
*  in chemical networks that led to the emergence of life. I guess the real problem I have with the
*  numbers game, just to come back to that, is that we are talking about a certain probability of that
*  occurring. It may be to go from the primordial soup, however you want to call it, the ingredients
*  that the earth started with, the organic molecules, the probability of going from that initial
*  condition to something that was capable of Darwinian natural selection that maybe we could define as
*  life. The probability of that is maybe 1% of the time that happens, in which case you're right.
*  The universe will be absolutely teeming with life, but it could also be 10 to the power minus 10,
*  in which case it's one per galaxy, or 10 to the power of minus 100, in which case the vast majority
*  of universes even do not have life within it. Or 90%. You said 1%, but it could be 90% if the
*  conditions, the chemical conditions of a planet are correct or a moon are correct. I admit that.
*  It could be any of those numbers. The challenge is we just have no
*  rigorous reason to expect why 90% is any, because we're talking about a probability for probability.
*  Is 90% more a priori likely than 10 to the power minus 20?
*  Well, the thing is we do have an observation, N of 1, of earth. It's difficult to know what to do with
*  that, what kind of intuition you build on top of that, because on earth it seems like life finds a
*  way in all kinds of conditions, in all kinds of crazy conditions. It's able to build up from the
*  basic chemistry. You could say, okay, maybe it takes a little bit of time to develop some complicated
*  technology like mitochondria, I don't know, like photosynthesis, fine, but it seems to figure it
*  out and do it extremely well. Yeah, but I would say you're describing a different process.
*  Maybe I'm at fault for separating these two processes, but to me you're describing
*  basically natural selection evolution at that point, whereas I'm really describing
*  abiogenesis, which is to me a separate distinct process.
*  Do you limit it to human scientists? Yes, but why would it be a separate process?
*  Why is the birth of life a separate process from the process of life?
*  We're uncomfortable with the Big Bang. We're uncomfortable with the first thing, I think.
*  Where did this come from? I just twist that question around and say,
*  you're saying why is it a different process? I would say why shouldn't it be a different
*  process, which isn't really a good defense, except to say that we have knowledge of how
*  natural selection evolution works. We think we understand that process.
*  We have almost no information about the earliest stages of how life emerged on our planet. It may
*  be that you're right and it is a part of a continuum. It may be that it is also a distinct,
*  improbable set of circumstances that led to the emergence of life. As a scientist, I'm just trying
*  to be open-minded to both possibilities. If I assert that life must be everywhere,
*  to me, you run the risk of experimental bias. If you think you know what the answer is, if you look
*  at an Earth-like planet and you are preconditioned to think there's a 90% chance of life on this
*  planet, it's going to at some level affect your interpretation of that data. Whereas if I, however
*  critical you might be of the agnosticism that I impose upon myself, remain open to both possibilities,
*  then I trust in myself to make a fair assessment as to the reality of that evidence for life.
*  Yeah, but I wonder sort of scientifically, and that's really beautiful to hear and inspiring to
*  hear, I wonder scientifically how many firsts we truly know of
*  and that we don't eventually explain as actually a step number one million in a long process.
*  I think that's a really interesting thing if there's truly firsts in this universe.
*  For us, whatever happened at the Big Bang is a kind of first, the origin of stuff.
*  But it just, again, it seems like history shows that we'll figure out that it's actually a
*  continuation of something. But then physicists say that time is emergent and that causality in times
*  is a very human kind of construct. It's very possible that all of this, so there could be
*  really firsts of a thing to which we attach a name. So whatever we call life, maybe there is
*  an origin of it. Yeah, and I would also say I'm open to that idea of it being part of a continuation.
*  But the continuation maybe is more broader, and it's a continuation of chemical systems
*  and chemical networks. And what we call this one particular type of chemistry and this behavior of
*  chemistry life, but it is just one manifestation of all the trillions of possible permutations in
*  which chemical reactions can occur. And we assert specialness to it because that's what we are.
*  And so it's also true of intelligence. You could extend the same thing and say,
*  we're looking for intelligent life in the universe. Where do you define intelligence?
*  Where's that continuum of something that's really like us? Are we alone?
*  There may be a continuum of chemical systems, a continuum of intelligences out there.
*  And we have to be careful of our own arrogance of assuming specialness about what we are,
*  that we are some distinct category of phenomena. Whereas the universe doesn't really care about
*  what category we are. It's just doing what it's doing and doing everything in infinite diversity
*  and infinite combinations is essentially what it's doing. And so we are taking this one slice
*  and saying, no, this has to be treated separately. And I'm open to the idea that it could be a truly
*  separate phenomenon, but it may just be like a snowflake. Every snowflake is different.
*  It may just be that this one particular iteration is another variant of the vast continuum.
*  Yeah, maybe the algorithm of natural selection itself is an invention of earth. I also tend to
*  suspect that whatever the algorithm is, it operates at all levels throughout the universe.
*  But maybe this is a very kind of peculiar thing that's where there's a bunch of chemical
*  systems that compete against each other somehow for survival under limited resources. And that's
*  a very earth like thing. We have a nice balance of there's a large number of resources enough
*  to have a bunch of different kinds of systems competing, but not so many that they get lazy.
*  And maybe that's why bacteria were very lazy for a long time. Maybe they didn't have much competition.
*  Quite possibly. I mean, I try to, as fun as it is to get into the speculation about
*  the definitions of life and what life does and this gross network of possibilities,
*  honestly, for me, the strongest argument for remaining agnostic is to avoid that bias and
*  assessing data. And we've seen it. I mean, Percival Lowell, I talked about on my channel
*  maybe last year or two years ago, he's a very famous astronomer who in the 19th century was
*  claiming the evidence of canals on Mars. And from him, from his perspective, and even at the time,
*  culturally, it was widely accepted that Mars would, of course, have life. I mean, I think it seems
*  silly to us, but it was kind of similar arguments to what we're using now about exoplanets that,
*  well, of course, there must be life in the universe. How could it just be here?
*  And so it seemed obvious to people that when you looked at Mars with its polar caps,
*  even its atmosphere had seasons, it seemed obvious to them that that too would be a place where life
*  not only was present, but had emerged to a civilization, which actually was fairly
*  comparable in technology to our own because it was building canal systems. Of course,
*  a canal system seems a bizarre technosignature to us, but it was a product of their time. To them,
*  that was the cutting edge in technology. It should be a warning shot actually a little bit
*  for us that if we think solar panels or building star links or whatever, space mining is like an
*  inevitable technosignature, that may be laughably antiquated compared to what other civilizations
*  far more advanced than us may be doing. And so anyway, Percival Lowell, I think, was a product
*  of his time that he thought life was there. Inevitably, he even wrote about it extensively.
*  When he saw these lines, these lineae on the surface of Mars, to him, it was just obvious
*  they were canals. That was experimental bias playing out. He was told for one that he had
*  basically the greatest eyesight out of any of his peers. An ophthalmologist had told him that in
*  Boston, that his eyesight was absolutely spectacular. So he just was convinced everything he saw was
*  real. And secondly, he was convinced there was life there. And so to him, it just added up.
*  And then it kind of wasted decades of research of treating the idea of Mars being inhabited by this
*  canal civilization. But on the other hand, it's maybe not a waste because it is a lesson in history
*  of how we should be always on guard against our own preconceptions and biases about whether life
*  is out there and furthermore, what types of things life might do if it is there.
*  If I were running this simulation, which we'll also talk about because you make the case against it,
*  but if I were running a simulation, I would definitely put you in a room with an alien.
*  It's just to see mentally freak out for hours at a time. You for sure would have thought you will be
*  convinced that you've lost your mind. I mean, no, not that. But I mean, if we discover life,
*  we discovered interesting new physical phenomena, I think the right approach is definitely to be
*  extremely skeptical and be very, very careful about things you want to be true.
*  I'm not like some extreme denialist of evidence. If there was compelling evidence for life on
*  another planet, I would be the first one to be celebrating that and be shaking hands with the
*  alien on the White House lawn. I grew up with Star Trek and that was my fantasy was to be Captain
*  Kirk and fly across the stars, meeting other civilizations. So there's nothing more I'd want
*  to be true as I've said, but we just have to guard against it when we're assessing data.
*  But I have to say I'm very skeptical that we will ever have that Star Trek moment.
*  Even if there are other civilizations out there, they're never going to be at a point which is
*  in technological lockstep with us, similar level of development. Even intellectually, the idea that
*  they could have a conversation with us, even through a translator, I mean, we can't communicate
*  with Humback whales, we can't communicate with dolphins in a meaningful way. We can bark orders
*  at them, but we can't have abstract conversations with them about things. And so the idea that we
*  will ever have that fulfilling conversation, I'm deeply skeptical of. And I think a lot of us are
*  drawn to that. It is maybe a replacement for God to some degree, that father figure civilization
*  that might step in, teach us the air of our ways and bestow wisdom upon our civilization.
*  But they could equally be a giant fungus that doesn't even understand the idea of socialization
*  because it's the only entity on its planet. It just swells over the entire surface. And it's
*  incredibly intelligent because maybe each node communicates with each other to create essentially
*  a giant neural net, but it has no sense of what communication even is. And so alien life is out
*  there, surely going to be extremely diverse. I'm pretty skeptical that we'll ever get that
*  fantasy moment I always had as a kid of having a dialogue within the civilization.
*  So dialogue, yes. What about noticing them? What about noticing signals? Do you hope? So one thing
*  we've been talking about is getting signatures, biosignatures, techno signatures about other
*  planets. Maybe if we're extremely lucky in our lifetime to be able to meet life forms,
*  get evidence of living or dead life forms on Mars or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn,
*  what about getting signals from outer space, interstellar signals?
*  What would those signals potentially look like?
*  That's a hard question to answer because we are essentially engaging in
*  xenopsychology to some degree. What are the activities of another civilization?
*  A lot of that is inevitable. What does the word xenopsychology,
*  I apologize to interrupt, mean? Maybe I'm just fabricating that word really,
*  but they're trying to guess at the machinations and motivations of another intelligent being that
*  was completely evolutionary divorced from us. So it's like you said, exo-moons, exo-psychology,
*  extra-solar, psychology. Alien psychology is another way of maybe making it more grounded.
*  We can't really guess at their motivations too well, but we can look at the sorts of
*  behaviors we engage in and at least look for them. We're always guilty that when we look for
*  biosignatures, we're really looking for, and even when we look for planets, we're looking for
*  templates of Earth. When we look for biosignatures, we're looking for templates of Earth-based life.
*  When we look for tetanus signatures, we tend to be looking for templates of our own behaviors
*  or extrapolations of our behaviors. There's a very long list of tetanus signatures that
*  people have suggested we could look for. The earliest ones were of course radio beacons.
*  That was Project Osmo that Frank Drake was involved in trying to look for radio signatures,
*  which could either be just blurting out high-power radio signals saying, hey, we're here,
*  or could even have encoded within them galactic encyclopedias for us to unlock,
*  which has always been the allure of the radio technique. There could also be unintentional
*  signatures. For example, you could have something like the satellite system that we've produced
*  around the Earth, the artificial satellite system, Starlink type systems we mentioned.
*  You could detect the glint of light across those satellites as they orbit around the planet.
*  You could detect a geostationary satellite belt, which would block out some light as the planet
*  transited across the star. You could detect solar panels potentially spectrally on the surface of
*  the planet, heat island effects. New York is hotter than New York state by a couple of degrees
*  because of the heat island effect of the city. You could thermally map different planets and
*  detect these. There's a large array of things that we do that we can go out and hypothesize
*  we could look for. And then on the furthest end of the scale, you have things which go far beyond
*  our capabilities such as warp drive signatures, which have been proposed. You get these bright
*  flashes of light or even gravitational wave detections from LIGO could be detected.
*  You could have Dyson spheres, the idea of covering a star is completely covered by some kind of
*  structure which collects all the light from the star to power the civilization. And that would
*  be pretty easily detectable to some degree because you're transferring all of the
*  visible light thermodynamically. It has to be re-emitted to come out as infrared light.
*  So you'd have an incredibly bright infrared star, yet one that was visibly not present at all. And
*  so that would be a pretty intriguing signature to look for. Is there efforts to look for something
*  like that for different Dyson spheres out there with the strong infrared signal? There has been.
*  Yeah, there has been. And I think in the literature, there was one with the IRAS satellite,
*  which is an infrared satellite. They targeted, I think, of over 100,000 stars, nearby stars,
*  and found no convincing examples of what looked like a Dyson sphere star. And then Jason Wright
*  and his team extended this, I think, using WISE, which is another infrared satellite,
*  to look around galaxies. So could an entire galaxy have been converted into Dyson spheres
*  or a significant fraction of the galaxy, which is basically the Kardashev type three. This is when
*  you've basically mastered the entire galactic pool of resources. And again, out of 100,000 nearby
*  galaxies, there appears to be no compelling examples of what looks like a Dyson galaxy,
*  if you want to call it that. So that by no means proves that they don't exist or don't happen,
*  but it seems like it's an unusual behaviour for a civilization to get to that stage of development
*  and start harvesting the entire stellar output. Unusual, yes. And I mean, LIGO is super interesting
*  with gravitational waves, if that kind of experiment could start seeing some weirdness,
*  some weird signals, that compare to the power of cosmic phenomena.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's a whole new window to the universe, not just in terms of astrophysics,
*  but potentially for technoscientists as well. I have to say with the warp drives, I am sceptical
*  that warp drives are possible because you have kind of fundamental problem in relativity. You
*  can either really have relativity, faster than light travel or causality. You can only choose
*  two of those three things. You really can't have all three in a coherent universe. If you have
*  all three, you basically end up with a possibility of these kind of temporal paradoxes and time
*  loops and grandfather paradoxes. Well, can't there be pockets of causality, something like that?
*  Like where there's pockets of consistent causality? You could design it in that way.
*  You could be, if you had a warp drive or a time machine, essentially, you could be
*  very conscious and careful of the way you use it so as to not cause paradoxes or just do it in a
*  local area or something. But the real fundamental problem is you always have the ability to do it.
*  And so in a vast cosmic universe, if time machines were all over the place,
*  there's too much risk of someone doing it, of somebody having the option of essentially
*  breaking the universe with it. So this is a fundamental problem. Hawking has this chronology
*  protection conjecture where he said that essentially this just can't be allowed because
*  it breaks all our laws of physics if time travel is possible.
*  Current laws of physics, yes.
*  Correct. Yeah. And so we need to rip up relativity. I mean, that's the point is the current laws of
*  physics, so you'd have to rip up our current law of relativity to make sense of how FTL
*  could live in that universe because you can't have relativity, FTL and causality
*  sit nicely and play nicely together.
*  But we currently don't have quantum mechanics and relativity playing nice together anyway,
*  so it's not like everything is all a nice little fabric.
*  It's certainly not the full picture. There must be more to go.
*  So it's already ripped up, so might as well rip it up a little more.
*  And in the process, actually try to connect the two things because maybe in the unification of
*  the standard model and general relativity, maybe there lies some kind of new wisdom
*  about warp drives. So by the way, warp drives is somehow messing with the fabric
*  of the universe to be able to travel faster than the speed of light.
*  Yeah, you're basically bending space-time. You could also do it with a wormhole or
*  tack. Some of the hypothetical FTL systems don't have to necessarily be the Alcubair drive,
*  the warp drive. It could be any faster than light system. As long as it travels superluminally,
*  it will violate causality.
*  Presumably, that will be observable with LIGO.
*  Potentially, yeah, potentially. It depends on the properties of whatever the spacecraft is.
*  One problem with warp drives is there's all sorts of problems with warp drives.
*  It's like the start of that sentence. One problem with warp drives.
*  There's just this one minor problem that we have to get around. But when it arrives at its destination,
*  it basically collects this vast… It has an event horizon almost at the front of it,
*  and so it collects all this radiation at the front as it goes. And when it arrives,
*  all that radiation gets dumped on its destination, would basically completely exterminate the planet
*  when it arrives. That radiation is also incident within the shell itself. There's
*  Hawking radiation occurring within the shell, which is pretty dangerous.
*  And then it raises all sorts of exacerbations of the Fermi paradox, of course, as well.
*  You might be able to explain why we don't see a galactic empire. Even here, it's hard. You might
*  be able to explain why we don't see a galactic empire if everybody's limited to Voyager 2
*  rocket speeds of 20 km per second or something. But it's a lot harder to explain why we don't see
*  the stars populated by galactic empires when warp drive is imminently possible, because it makes
*  expansion so much more trivial that it makes our life harder. There's some wonderful
*  simulation work being done out of Rochester where they actually simulate all the stars in the galaxy
*  or a fraction of them. And they spawn a civilization and one of them, and they let it spread out at
*  sublight speeds. And actually the very mixing of the stars themselves, because the stars are not
*  static, they're in orbit of the galactic center and they have crossing paths with each other.
*  If you just have a range of even like five light years and your speed is of order of a few percent,
*  the speed of light is the maximum you can muster, you can populate the entire galaxy within
*  something like a million years or so. So a fraction of the lifetime of the galaxy itself.
*  So this raises some fairly serious problems because if any civilization in the entire history
*  of the galaxy decided to do that, then either we shouldn't be here or we happen to live in this
*  rare pocket where they chose not to populate to. And so this is sometimes called FACTE,
*  Hart's FACTE. The FACTE is that a civilization is not here now. An alien civilization is not
*  in present occupation of the earth. And that's difficult to resolve with the apparent ease
*  at which even a small extrapolation of our own technology could potentially
*  populate a galaxy in far faster than galactic history.
*  So to me, by the way, the Fermi paradox is truly a paradox for me. But I suspect that if aliens
*  visit earth, I suspect if they are everywhere, I think they're already here and we're too dumb
*  to see it. But leaving that aside, I think we should be able to, in that case, have very strong
*  obvious signals when we look up at the stars, at the emanation of energy required. We would see
*  some weirdness that like where these are these kinds of stars and these are these kinds of stars
*  that are being messed with, like leveraging the nuclear fusion of stars to do something useful.
*  The fact that we don't really see that, maybe you can correct me, wouldn't we be able to,
*  wouldn't we be able to, if there is like alien civilizations running galaxies,
*  wouldn't we see weirdnesses from an astronomy perspective with the way the stars are behaving?
*  Yeah, I mean, it depends exactly what they're doing. But I mean, the Dyson sphere example is
*  one that we already discussed where a survey of 100,000 nearby galaxies find that they are not,
*  have all been transformed into Dyson sphere collectors. You could also imagine them doing
*  things like we wrote a paper this recently of starlifting, where you can extend the life of
*  your star by scooping mass off the star. So you'd be doing stellar engineering essentially.
*  If you're doing a huge amount of asteroid mining, you would have a spectral signature
*  because you're basically filling the solar system with dust. By doing that, there'd be
*  debris from that activity. And so there are some limits on this. Certainly, we don't see
*  bright flashes, which would be one of these consequences. What drives us to say is as they
*  decelerate, they produce these bright flashes of light. We don't seem to see evidence of those
*  kinds of things. We don't see anything obvious around the nearby stars or the stars that we've
*  surveyed in detail beyond that, that indicate any kind of artificial civilization. The closest maybe
*  we had was Boyajian star. There was a lot of interest in. There was a star that was just very
*  peculiarly dipping in and out its brightness. It was hypothesized for a time that that may indeed
*  be some kind of Dyson-like structure, so maybe a Dyson sphere that's half built.
*  As it comes in and out, it's blocking out huge swaths of the star. It was very difficult to
*  explain it really with any kind of planet model at the time. But an easier hypothesis that was
*  proposed was it could just be a large number of comets or dust or something, or maybe a planet
*  that had broken apart, and as its fragments orbit around, it blocks out starlight.
*  It turned out with subsequent observations of that star, which especially the amateur astronomy
*  community made a big contribution to as well, that the dips were chromatic, which was a real
*  important clue that that probably wasn't a solid structure then that was going around it. It was
*  more likely to be dust. Dust is chromatic. By chromatic, I mean it looks different in different
*  colors, so it blocks out more red light than blue light. If it was a solid structure, it shouldn't
*  do that. It should be opaque, a solid metal structure or something. That was one of the
*  clear indications. The behavior of the way the light changed or the dips changed across wavelengths
*  was fully consistent with the expectations of what small particulates would do.
*  And so that's very hard. I mean the real problem with alien hunting,
*  the real problem with the warp drive and the one problem with alien hunting.
*  Actually, I'd say there's three big problems for me with any search for life, which includes UFOs
*  all the way to fossils on Mars, is that aliens have three unique properties as a hypothesis.
*  One is they have essentially unbounded explanatory capability. There's almost no
*  phenomenon I can show you that you couldn't explain with aliens to some degree. You could
*  say, well, the aliens just have some super high-tech way of creating that illusion.
*  The second one would be unbounded avoidance capacity. I might see a UFO tomorrow and then
*  the next day and then the next day and then predict I should see it on Thursday at the end
*  of the week. But then I don't see it, but I could always get out of that and say, well,
*  that's just because they chose not to come here. They can always avoid future observations fairly
*  easily. If you survey an exoplanet for biosignatures and you don't see oxygen,
*  you don't see methane, that doesn't mean there's no one living there. They could always be either
*  tricking their atmosphere, engineering it. We actually wrote a paper about that, how you can
*  use lasers to hide your biosignatures as advanced civilization. Or you could just be living
*  underground or underwater or something where there's no biosignatures. You can never really
*  disprove this life on another planet or on another star. It has infinite avoidance.
*  And then finally, the third one is that we have incomplete physical understanding of the universe.
*  If I see a new phenomena, which Boyaj and Star Wars is an example of that, we saw this new
*  phenomena of these strange dips we'd never seen before. It was hypothesized immediately this could
*  be aliens. It's like a god of the gaps, but it turned out to be incomplete physical understanding.
*  And so that happens all the time in the first pulsar that was discovered. Same story,
*  Jocelyn Bell, somewhat tongue in cheek called it Little Green Man 1 because it looked a lot like
*  the radio signature that was expected from an alien civilization. But of course, it turned out
*  to be a completely new type of star that we had never seen before, which was a neutron star
*  with these two jets coming out the top of it. And so that's a challenge. Those three things are
*  really difficult in terms of experimental design for a scientist to work around.
*  Something that can explain anything, can avoid anything, so it's almost un-falsifiable,
*  and could always just be to some degree, as you said, we have this very limited knowledge of
*  the infinite possibilities of physical law, and we're probably only scratching the surface
*  each time, and we've seen it so often in history, we may just be detecting some new phenomena.
*  Well, that last one, I think I'm a little more okay with making mistakes on.
*  It's exciting still.
*  So you might exaggerate the importance of the discovery, but the whole point
*  is to try to find stuff in this world that's weird and try to characterize that weirdness.
*  Sure, you can throw a little green man as a label on it, but eventually, it's as mysterious
*  and as beautiful, as interesting as little green men. We tend to think that there's some kind of
*  threshold, but there's all kinds of weird organisms on this earth that operate very
*  differently than humans that are super interesting. The human mind is super interesting. I mean,
*  like weirdness and complexity is as interesting in any of its forms as what we might think from
*  Hollywood, what aliens are. So that's okay. Looking for weirdnesses on Mars.
*  That's one of the best sales pitches to do technosignature work is that we always have
*  that as our fallback, that we're going to look for alien signatures. If we fail, we're going to
*  discover some awesome new physics along the way. And so any kind of signature that we detect is
*  always going to be interesting. And so that compels us to have not only the question of
*  looking for life in the universe, but it gives us a strong scientific grounding as to why this
*  sort of research should be funded and should be executed because it always pushes the
*  frontiers of knowledge. I wonder if we'll be able to discover and be open enough
*  to a broad definition of aliens where we see some kind of technosignature.
*  Basically like a Turing test, like this thing is intelligent. It's processing information in a very
*  interesting way. But you can say that about chemistry. You could say that about physics.
*  Maybe not physics, chemistry. Like interesting complex chemistry. You could say that this is
*  processing. This is storing information. This is propagating information over time. So I mean,
*  it's a gray area between a living organism that we would call an alien. And I think that's super
*  interesting. It's able to carry some kind of intelligence. Yeah. Information is a really
*  useful way to frame what we're looking for though, because then you're divorced from making
*  assumptions about even a civilization necessarily or anything like that. So any kind of information
*  rig signature, indeed you can take things like the light curve from Boyajian star and ask what is
*  the minimum number of free parameters or the minimum information content that must be encoded
*  within this light curve. And the hope is that maybe a good example would be from a radio
*  signature. You just detect something that has a thousand megabytes of parameters essentially
*  contained within it. That's pretty clearly at that point not the product of a natural process,
*  at least any natural process that we could possibly imagine with our current understanding
*  of the universe. And so thinking of even if we can't decode, which actually I'm skeptical
*  we'd be able to ever decode it in our lifetimes, it would probably take decades to fully
*  ever figure out what they're trying to tell us. But if there was a message there, we could at
*  least know that there is a high information content and there is complexity and that this is
*  a attempt at communication and information transfer and leave it to our subsequent generations to
*  figure out what exactly it is they're trying to say. What again a wild question and thank you for
*  entertaining them. I really really appreciate it. But what kind of signal in our lifetime,
*  what kind of thing do you think might happen, could possibly happen
*  where the scientific community would be convinced that there's alien civilizations out there?
*  What you already said, maybe a strong infrared signature for something like a Dyson Sphere.
*  Yeah, that's possibly that's also to some degree a little bit ambiguous because
*  that's the challenge. So I can interrupt is where your brain would be like you as a scientist would
*  be like, I know it's ambiguous, but this is really weird. Yeah, I think if you had some, I can imagine
*  something like a prime number sequence or a mathematical sequence like the Fibonacci series,
*  something being mathematically provable that this is not a physical phenomenon. Right. I mean,
*  yeah, prime numbers is pretty good case because there's no natural phenomena that produces prime
*  number sequences. It seems to be a purely an abstract mathematical concept as far as I'm aware.
*  And so if we detected, you know, see as a radio blips that were following that sequence,
*  it would be pretty clear to me or it could even be, you know, car Sagan suggested that
*  pi could be encoded and that or you might use the hydrogen line but multiplied by pi like some very
*  specific frequency of the universe, like a hydrogen line, but multiply it by a abstract
*  mathematical constant that would imply strongly that there was someone behind the scenes operating
*  that. I'm sorry, stored in which phenomena though? Radio wave, but the information, I mean,
*  we kind of toyed with this idea in a video I did about hypothetical civilization on my channel,
*  but one kind of fun way, I do want to bring this conversation towards time a little bit and
*  thinking about not just looking for life and intelligence around us right now, but looking
*  into the past and even into the future to some degree or communicating with the future.
*  And so we had this fun experiment of imagining a civilization that was born at the beginning of the
*  history of the galaxy and being the first and what it would be like for them. And they were
*  desperately searching for evidence of life, but couldn't find it. And so they decided to try and
*  leave something behind for future civilizations to discover, to tell them about themselves.
*  But of course, a radio signature is not going to work there because it has a power source and
*  that's a piece of machinery. It's going to eventually break down. It's going to be hard
*  to maintain that for billions of years time scale. And so you wanted something that was kind of
*  passive that doesn't require an energy source, but can somehow transmit information, which is hard
*  to think about something that satisfies those criteria. But there was a proposal
*  by one of my colleagues, Luke Arnold, which inspired a lot of us in technosignatures.
*  And he suggested that you could build artificial transitors. So you could build
*  sheets of material that transit in front of the star, maybe one thin sheet passes across first,
*  then two, then three, then five and seven. So you could follow the prime number sequence of these.
*  And so there'd be a clear indication that someone had manufactured those,
*  but they don't require any energy source because they're just sheets of material in front of the
*  star. They would eventually degrade from micrometeorites. Maybe they'll always become
*  destabilized, but they should have lifetimes far exceeding the lifetime of any battery or
*  mechanical electronic system that we could, at least without technology, conceive of building.
*  And so you can imagine then extending that and how could you encode not just prime number sequence,
*  but maybe in the spatial pattern of this very complex light curve we see, you could encode
*  more and more information through 2D shapes and the way those arc rotations happen. And maybe
*  you could even encode messages and in-depth information from that. You could even imagine
*  it being like a lower layer of information, which is just the prime number sequence.
*  But then you look closely and you see the smaller divots embedded within those that have a deeper
*  layer of information to extract. And so to me, something like that would be pretty compelling
*  that there was somebody who would manage, unless it's just a very impressive hoax,
*  that would be a pretty compelling evidence for this civilization.
*  And actually the methods of astronomy right now are kind of marching towards
*  being able to better and better detect a signal like that.
*  Yeah. I mean, to some degree it's just building bigger aperture in space,
*  the bigger the telescope, the finer ability to detect those minute signals.
*  Do you think the current sort of the scientific community, another weird question,
*  but just the observations that are happening now, do you think they're ready for a prime number
*  sequence in the sort of if we're using the current method, the transit timing variation method?
*  Like, do you think you're ready? Do you have the tools to detect the prime number sequence?
*  Yeah, for sure. I mean, there's 200,000 stars that Kepler monitored and it monitored them all
*  the time. It took a photo of each one of them every 30 minutes, measured their brightness,
*  and it did that for four and a half years. And so you have already, and Tess is doing it right now,
*  another mission. And so you have already an existing catalog and people are genuinely
*  scouring through each of those light curves with automated machine learning techniques.
*  We even developed some in our own team that can look for weird behavior. We wrote a code called
*  the weird detector, for instance, that was just the most generic thing possible. Don't assume
*  anything about the signal shape. Just look for anything that repeats. The signal shape can be
*  anything. Can we kind of learn the template of the signal from the data itself? And then it's like a
*  template matching filter to see if that repeats many, many times in the data. And so we actually
*  applied that and found a bunch of interesting stuff, but we didn't see anything that was the
*  prime number sequence, at least on the Kepler data. That's 200,000 stars, which sounds like a lot,
*  but compared to 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, it's really just scratching the surface.
*  Because there could be something much more generalizable than the prime number sequence.
*  It's ultimately the question of a signal that's very difficult to compress
*  in the general sense of what compress means. So maybe as we get better and better machine
*  learning methods that automatically figure out, analyze the data to understand how to compress it,
*  you'll be able to discover data that's for some reason is not compressible.
*  But then compression really is a bottomless pit because that's really what intelligence is,
*  is being able to compress information. Yeah. And to some degree, the more you,
*  I would imagine, I don't work in compression algorithms, but I would imagine the more you
*  compress your signal, the more assumptions that kind of go on behalf of the decoder,
*  the more skilled they really have to be. A prime number sequence is completely
*  encoded information essentially. But if you look at the Arecibo message, they were fairly careful
*  with their pixelation of this simple image they sent to try and make it as interpretable as possible
*  to be that even a dumb alien would be able to figure out what we're trying to show them here.
*  Because there's all sorts of conventions and rules that are built in that we tend to presume
*  when we design our messages. And so if your messages, assuming they know how to do an MP3
*  decoder, a particular compression algorithm, I'm sure they could eventually reverse engineer it
*  and figure it out, but you're making it harder for them to get to that point. So maybe I always
*  think you probably would have a two tier system, right? You'd probably have some lower tier key
*  system and then maybe beneath that you'd have a deeper compressed layer of more in depth information.
*  What about maybe observing actual physical objects? So first let me go to your tweet
*  as a source of inspiration. You tweeted that it's interesting to ponder that if Oort clouds
*  are ever mined by the systems of alien civilizations, mining equipment from billions
*  of years ago could be in our Oort cloud since the Oort clouds extend really, really, really,
*  really far outside the actual star. So mining equipment, just like basic boring mining
*  equipment out there. I don't know if there's something interesting to say about Oort clouds
*  themselves that are interesting to you and about possible non-shiny light emitting mining
*  equipment from alien civilization. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of the beauty of the field of
*  technosignatures and looking for life is you can find inspiration and intellectual joy in just the
*  smallest little thing that starts a whole thread of building upon it and wondering about the
*  implications. And so in this case, I was just really struck by, we kind of mentioned this a
*  little bit earlier, the idea that stars are not static. We tend to think of the galaxy
*  as having stars in a certain location from the center of the galaxy and they kind of live there.
*  But in truth, the stars are not only orbiting around the center of the galaxy, but those orbits
*  are themselves changing over time. They're processing. And so in fact, the orbits look
*  more like a spiral graph if you've ever done those as a kid, they kind of whirl around and
*  trace out all sorts of strange patterns. And so the stars intersect with one another. And so
*  the current closest star to us is Proxima Centauri, which is about 4.2 light years away,
*  but it will not always be the closest star. And over millions of years, it will be supplanted by
*  other stars. In fact, stars that will come even closer than Proxima within just a couple of light
*  years. And that's been happening, not just we can project that will happen over the next few
*  million years, but that's been happening presumably throughout the entire history of the galaxy for
*  billions of years. And so if you went back in time, there would have been all sorts of different
*  nearest stars throughout different stages of the Earth's history. And those stars are so close
*  that their Oort clouds do intermix with one another. So the Oort cloud can extend out to even
*  a light year or two around the Earth. There's some debate about exactly where it ends. It probably
*  doesn't really have a definitive end, but kind of more just kind of peters out more and more and
*  more as you go further away. By the way, for people who don't know, an Oort cloud, I don't know what
*  the technical definition is, but a bunch of rocks that kind of, no, objects that orbit the star,
*  and they can extend really, really far because of gravity. Correct. So these are objects that
*  probably are mostly icy rich. They were probably formed fairly similar distances to Jupiter and
*  Saturn, but were scattered out through the interactions of those giant planets. We see
*  a circular disk of objects around us, which kind of looks like the asteroid belt, but just further
*  away called the Kuiper belt. And then further beyond that, you get the Oort cloud. And the
*  Oort cloud is not a disk. It's just a sphere. It kind of surrounds us in all directions.
*  So these are objects that were scattered out three dimensionally in all different directions.
*  And so those objects are potentially resources for us, especially if you were planning
*  to do an interstellar mission one day, you might want to mine the water that's embedded within
*  those and use that as either oxygen or fuel for your rocket. And so it's quite possible.
*  There's also some rare earth metals and things like that as well, but it's quite possible that
*  a civilization might use Oort cloud objects as a jumping off point. Or in the Kuiper belt,
*  you have things like planet nine even. So there might even be objects beyond in the Oort cloud,
*  which are actually planet-like that we just cannot detect. These objects are very, very faint. So
*  that's why they're so hard to see. I mean, even planet nine, it's hypothesized to exist, but we've
*  not been able to confirm its existence because it's at something like a thousand AU away from us,
*  thousand times the distance of the earth from the sun. And so even though it's probably larger than
*  the earth, the amount of light it reflects from the sun, the sun is what just looks like a star
*  at that point, so far away from it that it barely reflects anything back. It's extremely
*  difficult to detect. So there's all sorts of wonders that may be lurking out in the outer
*  solar system. And so this leads you to wonder, in the Oort cloud, that Oort cloud must have intermixed
*  with other Oort clouds in the past. And so what fraction of the Oort cloud truly belongs to us,
*  belongs to what was scattered from Jupiter and Saturn? What fraction of it could in fact be
*  interstellar visitors? And of course, we've got excited about this recently because of Oumuamua,
*  this interstellar asteroid, which seemed to be at the time the first evidence of an interstellar
*  object. But when you think about the Oort cloud intermixing, it may be that a large fraction of
*  comets, comets are seeded from the Oort cloud that eventually come in. Some of those comets
*  may indeed have been interstellar in the first place that we just didn't know about
*  through this process. There even is an example, I can't remember the name, there's an example
*  of a comet that has a very peculiar spectral signature that has been hypothesized to have
*  actually been an interstellar visitor, but one that was essentially sourced through this Oort
*  cloud mixing. And so this is kind of intriguing. The outer solar system is like at the bottom of
*  the ocean. We know so little about what's on the bottom of our own planet's ocean. And we know
*  next to nothing about what's in the outskirts of our own solar system.
*  It's all darkness. Yeah.
*  So like, that's one of the things is to understand the phenomena, we need light.
*  And we need to see how light interacts with it or the light emanates from it. But most of our
*  universe is darkness. So it's, there could be a lot of interesting stuff. I mean, this is where
*  your interest is with the cool worlds and the interesting stuff lurks in the darkness, right?
*  Basically all of us, you know, 400 years of astronomy, our only window into the universe
*  has been light. And that has only changed quite recently with the discovery of gravitational
*  waves. That's now a new window. And hopefully, well, to some degree, I guess, solar neutrinos
*  we've been detecting for a while, but they come from the sun, not interstellar space.
*  But we may be able to soon detect neutrino messages as even been hypothesized as a way
*  of communicating between civilizations as well, or just do neutrino telescopes to study the
*  universe. And so there's a growing interest in what we'd call multi-messenger astronomy now.
*  So not just messages from light, but messages from these other physical packets of information
*  that are coming our way. But when it comes to the outer solar system, light really is our only window.
*  There's two ways of doing that. One is you detect the light from the Oort cloud object itself,
*  which as I just said, is very, very difficult. There's another trick, which we do in the Kuiper
*  belt, especially, and that's called an occultation. And so sometimes those objects will just pass in
*  front of a distant star, just coincidentally. These are very, very brief moments. They last
*  for less than a second. And so you have to have a very fast camera to detect them, which
*  conventionally astronomers don't usually build fast cameras. Most of the phenomena we observe
*  occurs on hours, minutes, days even. But now we're developing cameras which can take thousands
*  of images per second and yet do it at the astronomical fidelity that we need for this
*  precise measurement. And so you can see these very fast dips. You even get these diffraction
*  patterns that come around, which are really cool to look at. And I love it because it's almost
*  like passive radar. You have these pinpricks of light. Imagine that you live in a giant black
*  sphere, but there's these little pinholes that have been poked. And through those pinholes,
*  almost laser light is shining through. And inside this black sphere, there are unknown things
*  wandering around, drifting around that we are trying to discover. And sometimes they will pass
*  in front of those little pencil thin laser beams, block something out. And so we can tell that it's
*  there. And it's not an active radar because we didn't actually beam anything out and get
*  a reflection off, which is what the sun does. The sun's light comes off and comes back. That's
*  more like an active radar system. It's more like a passive radar system where we are just listening
*  very intently. And so I'm so fascinated by that, the idea that we could map out the rich architecture
*  of the outer solar system just by doing something that we could have done potentially for a long
*  time, which is just listening in the right way, just tuning our instrumentation to the correct
*  way of not listening, but viewing the universe to catch those objects.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's really fascinating. It seems almost obvious that your efforts,
*  when projected out over like 100, 200 years, will have a really good map through even methods,
*  basically, transit timing, high resolution transit timing, but basically the planetary and the planet
*  satellite movements of all the different star systems out there.
*  Yeah. And it could revolutionize the way we think about the solar system. I mean,
*  that revolution has happened several times in the past when we discovered Vesta in the 19th century.
*  That was, I think, the seventh planet for a while or the eighth planet when it was first discovered.
*  And then we discovered Ceres and there was a bunch of asteroid objects, Janus. And so for a while,
*  the textbooks had something like 13 planets in the solar system. And then that was just a new
*  capability that was emerging to detect those small objects. And then we ripped that up and said,
*  no, no, we're going to change the definition of a planet. And then the same thing happened when we
*  started looking at the outer skirts of the solar system. Again, we found Eris, we found Sedna,
*  these objects which resembled Pluto. And the more and more of them we found, make, make.
*  And eventually we again had to rethink the way we even contextualize what a planet is and
*  what the nature of the outer solar system is. So regardless as to what you think about the debate
*  about whether Pluto should be devoted or not, which I know often evokes a lot of strong feelings,
*  it is an incredible achievement that we were able to transform our view of the solar system in a
*  matter of years just by basically charge coupled devices, the things that's in cameras. Though the
*  invention of that device allowed us to detect objects which were much further away, much fainter
*  and revealed all of this stuff that was there all along. And so that's the beauty of astronomy.
*  There's just so much to discover and even in our own backyard.
*  LW – Do you ever think about this? Do you imagine what are the things that will completely change
*  astronomy over the next 100 years? Like if you transport yourself forward 100 years,
*  what are the things that will blow your mind when you look at, wait, what? Would it be just a very
*  high resolution mapping of things like, holy crap, like one surprising thing might be, holy crap,
*  there's like Earth-like moons everywhere. Another one could be just totally different devices for sensing.
*  Yeah, I think usually astronomy moves forward dramatically and science in general when you
*  have a new technological capability come online for the first time. And we kind of just gave
*  examples of that there with the solar system. So what kind of new capabilities might emerge
*  the next 100 years? The capability I would love to see is not just, I mean, in the next 10, 20 years,
*  we're hoping to take these pale blue dot images we spoke about. So that requires building something
*  like JWST, but on an even larger scale and optimize for direct imaging. You'd have to have
*  either a coronagraph or a star shade or something to block out the starlight and reveal those pale
*  blue dots. So in the next sort of decades, I think that's the achievement that we can look forward to
*  in our lifetimes is to see photos of other Earths. Going beyond that, maybe in our lifetimes,
*  towards the end of our lifetimes perhaps. I'd love it if we, I think it's technically possible,
*  Breakthrough Starshot giving us a lot of encouragement with to maybe send a small
*  probe to the nearest stars and start actually taking high resolution images of these objects.
*  There's only so much you can do from far away. If you want to have, and we can see it in the solar
*  system. I mean, there's only so much you can learn about Europa by pointing Hubble Space
*  Telescope at it. But if you really want to understand that moon, you're going to have to
*  send something to orbit it to hopefully land on it and drill down to the surface. And so the idea
*  of even taking a flyby and doing a snapshot photo that gets beamed back, that could be,
*  doesn't even have to be more than a hundred pixels by a hundred pixels. Even that would be a
*  completely game-changing capability to be able to truly image these objects. And maybe at home,
*  in our own solar system, we can certainly get to a point where we produce crude maps of exoplanets.
*  And one of the ultimate limits of what a telescope could do is governed by its size.
*  And so the largest telescope you could probably ever build would be one that was the size of the
*  sun. There's a clever trick for doing this without physically building a telescope. That's the size
*  of the sun, and that's to use the sun as a gravitational lens. This was proposed, I think,
*  by Von Eschlermann in like 1979, but it builds upon Einstein's theory of general relativity,
*  of course, that there is a warping of light, a bending of light from the sun's gravitational
*  field. And so a distant starlight, it's like a magnifying glass. Anything that bends light
*  is basically can be used as a telescope. It's going to bend light to a point.
*  Now it turns out the sun's gravity is not strong enough to create a particularly great telescope
*  here because the focus point is really out in the Kuiper belt. It's at 550 astronomical units away
*  from the Earth, so 550 times further away from the sun than we are. And that's beyond any of our
*  spacecraft we've ever gone. So you have to send a spacecraft to that distance, which would take
*  30, 40 years, even optimistically improving our chemical propulsion system significantly.
*  You'd have to bound it into that orbit, but then you could use the entire sun as your telescope.
*  And with that kind of capability, you could image planets to kilometer-scale resolution from afar.
*  That really makes you wonder. If we can conceive, maybe we can't engineer it,
*  but if we can conceive of such a device, what might other civilizations be currently observing
*  about our own planet? And perhaps that is why nobody is visiting us because there is so much
*  you can do from afar that to them, that's enough. Maybe they can get to the point where they can
*  detect our radio leakage, they can detect our television signals, they can map out our surfaces,
*  they can tell we have cities, they can even do infrared mapping of the heat island effects and
*  all this kind of stuff. They can tell the chemical composition of our planet. And so that might be
*  enough. Maybe they don't need to come down to the surface and study anthropology and see what our
*  civilization is like. But there's certainly a huge amount you can do, which is significantly
*  cheaper to some degree than flying there just by exploiting cleverly the physics of the universe
*  itself. So your intuition is, and that's very well made, be true that observation might be way easier
*  than travel from our perspective, from an alien perspective. We could get very high resolution
*  imaging before we could ever get there. It depends on what information you want. If you want to know
*  the chemical composition and you want to know kilometer scale maps of the planet,
*  then you could do that from afar with some version of these kind of gravitational lenses.
*  If you want to do better than that, if you want to image a newspaper set on the porch of somebody's
*  house, you're going to have to fly there. There's no way, unless you had a telescope the size of
*  such area as A star or something, you just simply cannot collect enough light to do that from many
*  light years away. So there is certainly reasons why visiting will always have its place depending
*  what kind of information you want. We've proposed in my team actually that the sun is the ultimate
*  pinnacle of telescope design, but flying to a thousand AU is a real pain in the butt because
*  it's just going to take so long. And so a more practical way of achieving this might be to use
*  the earth. Now the earth doesn't have anywhere near enough gravity to create a substantial
*  gravitational lens, but it has an atmosphere and that atmosphere refracts light, it bends light.
*  So whenever you see a sunset, just as the sun setting below the horizon,
*  it's actually already beneath the horizon. It's just the light is bending through the atmosphere.
*  It's actually already about half a degree down beneath. And what you're seeing is that curvature
*  of the light path and your brain interprets it, of course, to be following a straight line,
*  because your brain always thinks that. And so you can use that bending whenever you have bending,
*  you have a telescope. And so we've proposed to my team that you could use this refraction
*  to similarly create an earth size telescope. Called the Terrascope. The Terrascope. Yeah.
*  Great video on that. Yeah. And this- Do you have a paper on the Terrascope? I do. Yeah. Great.
*  Sometimes I get confused because they've heard of an earth size telescope because of the,
*  many have heard of the Event Horizon Telescope, which took an image of,
*  what's taken an image right now of the center of our black hole. And it's very impressive.
*  And this previously did messy 87 and nearby supermassive black hole. And so those images
*  were interferometric. So they were small telescopes scattered across the earth.
*  And they combined the light paths together interferometrically to create effectively an
*  earth sized angular resolution. Telescopes always have two properties. There's the angular
*  resolution, which is how small of a thing you can see on the surface. And then there's the
*  magnification. How much brighter does that object get versus just your eye or some small object?
*  Now, what the Event Horizon Telescope did, it traded off amplification or magnification
*  for the angular resolution. That's what it wanted. It wanted that high angular resolution,
*  but it doesn't really have much photon collecting power because each telescope
*  individually is very small. The telescope is different because it is literally collecting
*  light with a light bucket, which is essentially the size of the earth. And so that gives you both
*  benefits potentially, not only the high angular resolution that a large aperture promises you,
*  but also actually physically collects all those photons. So you can detect light from very, very
*  far away, through the outer edges of the universe. And so we propose this as a possible future
*  technological way of achieving these extreme goals, ambitious goals we have in astronomy.
*  But it's a very difficult system to test because you essentially have to fly out to these focus
*  points and these focus points lie beyond the moon. So you have to have someone who is willing to fly
*  beyond the moon and hitchhike an experimental telescope onto it and do that cheaply. If it
*  was something doing low earth orbit, it'd be easy. You could just attach a CubeSat to the next Falcon
*  9 rocket or something and test it out. It probably only costs you a few tens of thousands of dollars,
*  maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars. But there's basically no one who flies out that far,
*  except for bespoke missions such as a mission that's going to Mars or something that would
*  pass through that kind of space. And they typically don't have a lot of leeway and excess
*  payload that they're willing to strap on for radical experiments. So that's been the problem
*  with it. In theory, it should work beautifully, but it's a very difficult idea to experimentally
*  test. Can you elaborate where the focal point is that far away? So you get about half a degree bend
*  from the Earth's atmosphere when you're looking at the sun at the horizon, and you get that
*  two times over if you're outside of the planet's atmosphere. Because the star is half a bend to
*  you still on the horizon, then half a degree back out the other way. So you get about a one degree
*  bend. You take the radius of the Earth, which is about 7,000 kilometers, and do your arctan function,
*  you'll end up with a distance that's about two. It's actually the inner focal point, it's about
*  two thirds the distance of the Earth-Moon system. The problem with that inner focal point is not
*  useful because that light ray path had to basically scrape the surface of the Earth.
*  So it passes through the clouds, it passes through all the thick atmosphere, it gets a lot of
*  extinction along the way. If you go higher up in altitude, you get less extinction. In fact,
*  you can even go above the clouds. And so that's even better because the clouds are obviously going
*  to be a pain in the neck for doing anything optical. But the problem with that is that the
*  atmosphere, because it gets thinner at higher altitude, it bends light less. And so that pushes
*  the focal point out. So the most useful focal point is actually about three or four times the
*  distance of the Earth-Moon separation. And so that's what we call one of the Lagrange points,
*  essentially. And so there is a stable orbit, it's kind of the outermost stable orbit you could have
*  around the Earth. So the atmosphere does bad things to the signal. Yeah, it's absorbing light.
*  Is that possible to reconstruct, to remove the noise, whatever? So it's just strength,
*  it's nothing else. It's possible to reconstruct. I mean, to some degree, we do this as a technology
*  called adaptive optics that can correct for what's called wavefront errors that happen through the
*  Earth's atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere is turbulent. It is not a single plane of air of
*  the same density. There's all kind of wiggles and currents in the air. And so that each little layer
*  is bending light in slightly different ways. And so the light actually kind of follows a wiggly path
*  on its way down. What that means is that two light rays, which are traveling at slightly different
*  spatial separations from each other, will arrive at the detector at different times,
*  because one maybe goes on more or less a straight path and the one wiggles down a bit more before
*  it arrives. And so you have an incoherent light source. And when you're trying to imagery
*  construction, you always want a coherent light source. So the way they correct for this is that
*  if this path had to travel a little bit faster, the straight one goes faster and the wiggly one
*  takes longer, the mirror is deformable. And so you actually bend the mirror on the straight one
*  down a little bit to make it an equivalent light path distance. So the mirror itself has all these
*  little actuators. It's actually made up of like thousands of little elements, almost looks like a
*  liquid mirror because they can manipulate it in kind of real time. And so they scan the atmosphere
*  with a laser beam to tell what the deformations are in the atmosphere and then make the corrections
*  to the mirror to account for it. So you could do something like this for the Pteroscope, but it
*  would be cheaper and easier to go above the atmosphere and just fly out. I think so. It
*  would be very, it's a very, that's a very challenging thing to do. And normally when you
*  do adaptive optics, as it's called, you're looking straight up. So you're, you know, or very close to
*  straight up. If you look at the horizon, we basically never do astronomical observations on
*  the horizon because you're looking through more atmosphere. If you go straight up, you're looking
*  at the thinnest portion of atmosphere possible. But as you go closer and closer towards the horizon,
*  you're increasing what we call the air mass, the amount of air you have to travel through.
*  So here it's kind of the worst case because you're going through the entire atmosphere
*  in and out again with a Pteroscope. So you'd need a very impressive adaptive optic system to
*  correct for that. So yeah, I would say it's probably simpler, at least for proof of principle,
*  just to test it with having some satellite that was at a much wider orbit.
*  Now, speaking of traveling out into deep space, you already mentioned this a little bit.
*  You made a beautiful video called the journey to the end of the universe.
*  And sort of at the start of that, you're talking about Alpha Centauri.
*  So what would it take for humans or for human like creatures to travel out to Alpha Centauri?
*  There's a few different ways of doing it, I suppose. One is it depends on how fast your ship is.
*  That's always going to be the determining factor. If we devised some interstellar propulsion system
*  that could travel a fraction of the speed of light, then we could do it in our lifetimes,
*  which is I think what people normally dream of when they think about interstellar propulsion and
*  travel. That you could literally step onto the spacecraft, maybe a few years later, you step
*  off on Alpha Centauri B, you walk around the surface and come back and visit your family.
*  There would be, of course, a lot of relativistic time dilation as a result of that trip.
*  You would have aged a lot less than people back on Earth by
*  traveling close to the speed of light for some fraction of time.
*  The challenge of this, of course, is that we have no such propulsion system that can achieve this.
*  But you think it's possible. You have a paper called the Halo Drive.
*  Fuel-free relativistic propulsion of large masses via recycled boomerang photons.
*  So do you think, first of all, what is that? And second of all, how difficult are alternate
*  propulsion systems? Yeah. Before I took in the Halo Drive,
*  there was an idea because I think the Halo Drive is not going to solve this problem.
*  I'll talk about the Halo Drive in a moment, but the Halo Drive is useful for a civilization,
*  which is a bit more advanced than us that has spread across the stars.
*  And it's looking for a cheap highway system to get across the galaxy.
*  For that first step, just to context that, the Halo Drive requires a black hole. That's why
*  you're not going to be able to do this on the Earth right now. But there are lots of black
*  holes in the Milky Way. That's the good news. We'll come to that in a moment. But if you're
*  trying to travel to Alpha Centauri without a black hole, then there are some ideas out there.
*  There was a Project Daedalus and Project Icarus that were two projects that the
*  British Interplanetary Society conjured up on a 20, 30-year timescale. And they asked themselves
*  if we took existing and speculatively realistic attempts at future technology that are emerging
*  over the next few decades, how far could we push into the travel system? And they settled on
*  fusion drives in that. So if we had the ability to essentially either detonate,
*  you can always imagine nuclear fission or nuclear fusion bombs going off behind the
*  spacecraft and propelling it that way, or having some kind of successful nuclear fusion reaction,
*  which obviously we haven't really demonstrated yet as a propulsion system,
*  then you could achieve something like 10% the speed of light in those systems. But these are
*  huge spacecrafts. And I think you need a huge spacecraft if you're going to take people along.
*  The conversation recently has actually switched. And that idea seems a little bit antiquated now
*  and most of us have given up on the idea of people physically, biologically,
*  stepping on board the spacecraft. And maybe we'll be sending something that's more like a
*  micro probe that maybe just weighs a gram or two. And that's much easier to accelerate. You could
*  push that with a laser system to very high speed, get it to maybe 20% the speed of light. It has to
*  survive the journey. Probably a large fraction of them won't survive the journey, but they're cheap
*  enough that you could maybe manufacture millions of them. And some of them do arrive and are able
*  to send back an image. Or maybe even if you wanted to have a person there, we might have some way of
*  doing a telepresence or some kind of delayed telepresence or some kind of reconstruction
*  of the planet which is sent back so you can digitally interact with that environment in a way
*  which is not real time, but representative of what that planet would be like to be on the surface.
*  So we might be more like digital visitors to these planets. Certainly far easier practically
*  to do that than physically forcing this wet chunk of meat to fly across space to do that.
*  And so that's maybe something we can imagine down the road. The halo drive, as I said,
*  is thinking even further ahead. And if you did want to launch large masses, large masses could
*  even be planet size things. In the case of the halo drive, you can use black holes.
*  So this is kind of a trick of physics. I often think of the universe as like a big computer game
*  and you're trying to find cheat codes, hacks, exploits that the universe didn't intend for you
*  to use. But once you find them, you can address all sorts of interesting capabilities that you
*  didn't previously have. And the halo drive does that with black holes. So if you have two black
*  holes, which is a very common situation, a binary black hole, and they're inspiring towards each
*  other, LIGOs detected I think dozens of these things, maybe even over a hundred at this point.
*  And these things, as they merge together, they pre-merge a phase. They're orbiting each other
*  very, very fast, even close to the speed of light. And so Freeman Dyson, before he passed away,
*  I think in the 70s, he had this provocative paper called Gravitational Machines. And he suggested
*  that you could use neutron stars as an interstellar propulsion system. And neutron stars are sort of
*  the lower mass version of a binary black hole system essentially. In this case, he suggested
*  just doing gravitational slingshot, just fly your spacecraft into this very compact and
*  relativistic binary system. And you do need neutron stars because if there were two stars,
*  they'd be physically touching each other. So the neutron stars are so small, like 10 kilometers
*  across, they can get really close to each other and have these very, very fast orbits with respect
*  to each other. You shoot your spacecraft through, right through the middle, like flying through the
*  eye of a needle, and you do a slingshot around one of them. And you do it around the one that's coming
*  sort of towards you. So one of them will be coming away, one will be coming towards you at any one point.
*  And then you could basically steal some of the kinetic energy in the slingshot. In principle,
*  you can set up to twice the speed. You can take your speed and it becomes your speed plus twice
*  the speed of the neutron star in this case. And that would be your new speed after the slingshot.
*  This seems great because it's just free energy basically. You're not
*  doing any, you're not generating, you don't have a nuclear power reactor or anything to generate
*  this. You're just stealing it. And indeed you can get to relativistic speeds this way. So I loved
*  that paper, but I had a criticism. And the criticism was that this is like trying to fly
*  your ship into a blender, right? This is two neutron stars, which have huge tidal forces.
*  And they're whipping around each other once every second or even less than a second.
*  And you're trying to fly your spaceship and do this maneuver that is pretty precarious.
*  And so it just didn't seem practical to me to do this, but I loved it. And so I took that idea,
*  and this is how science is. It's iterative. You take a previous great man's idea and you just
*  sort of maybe slightly tweak it and improve it. That's how I see the Hiller drive. And I just
*  suggested, why not replace those out for black holes, which are certainly very common. And rather
*  than flying your ship into that hell hole of a blender system, you just stand back and you fire
*  a laser beam. Now, because black holes have such intense gravitational fields, they can bend light
*  into complete 180s. They can actually become mirrors. So the sun bends light by maybe a
*  fraction of a degree through gravitational lensing, but a compact object like a black hole
*  can do a full 180. In fact, obviously, if you went too close, if you put the laser beam too close,
*  the black hole would just fall into it and never come back out. So you just kind of push it out,
*  push it out, push it out until you get to a point where it's just skirting the event horizon.
*  And then that laser beam skirts around and it comes back. Now, the laser beam wants to do a
*  gravitational slingshot, but laser, I mean, light photons can't speed up unlike the spaceship case.
*  So instead of speeding up, the way they steal energy is they increase their frequency. So they
*  become higher energy photon packets, essentially, and they get blue shifted. So that you send maybe
*  a red laser beam that comes back blue, it's got more energy in it. And because photons carry
*  momentum, which is somewhat unintuitive and everyday experience, but they do, that's how
*  solar cells work. They carry momentum, they push things. You can even use them as laser
*  tweezers and things to pick things up. Because they push, it comes back with more momentum than
*  it left. So you get an acceleration force from this. And again, you're just seeing energy from
*  the black hole to do that. So you can get up to the same speed. It's basically the same idea
*  as Freeman Dyson, but doing it from a safer distance. And there should be a border of a
*  million or so or 10 million black holes in the Milky Way galaxy. Some of them would be even as
*  close to sort of 10 to 20 light years when you do the occurrence rate statistics of how close you
*  might expect feasibly want to be. They're of course difficult to detect because they're black,
*  and so they're inherently hard to see. But statistically, there should be plenty out there
*  in the Milky Way. And so these objects would be natural waypoint stations. You could use them to
*  both accelerate away and to break and slow down. And on top of all this, we've been talking about
*  astronomy and cosmology. There's been a lot of exciting breakthroughs in detection and exploration
*  of black holes. So the boomeranging photons that you're talking about, there's been a lot of work
*  on photon rings and just all the fun stuff going on outside the black holes. So all the
*  garbage outside is actually might be the thing that holds a key to understanding what's going
*  on inside. And there's the Hawking radiation. There's all kinds of fascinating stuff. There's
*  trippy stuff about black holes that I can't even, most people don't understand. The holographic
*  principle with the plate and the information being stored potentially outside of the black hole.
*  I don't even, I can't even comprehend how you can project a three-dimensional object onto a 2D and
*  somehow store information where it doesn't destroy it. And if it does destroy it, challenging all
*  the physics. All of this is very interesting, especially for kind of more practical applications
*  of how the black hole could be used for propulsion. Yeah. I mean, it may be that black holes are used
*  in all sorts of ways by advanced civilizations. I think, again, it's been a popular idea in
*  science fiction or science fiction trope that Sagittarius A star, the supermassive black hole
*  in the central galaxy could be the best place to look for intelligent life in the universe
*  because it is a giant engine in a way. You know, a unique capability of a black hole is you can
*  basically throw matter into it and you can get these jets that come out the accretion disks and
*  the jets that fly out. And so you can more or less use them to convert matter into energy V
*  equals MC squared. And there's pretty much nothing else except for, you know, annihilation with
*  its own antiparticle as a way of doing that. So they have some unique properties. You could perhaps
*  power a civilization by just throwing garbage into a black hole, right? Just throwing asteroids in,
*  how your civilization with as much energy as you really would ever plausibly need. And you could
*  also use them to accelerate away across the universe. And you can even imagine using small
*  artificial black holes as thermal generators, right? So the Hawking radiation from them
*  exponentially increases as they get smaller and smaller in size. And so a very small black hole,
*  one that you can almost imagine like holding in your hand would be a fairly significant heat
*  source. And so that raises all sorts of prospects about how you might use that in an engineering
*  context to power your civilization as well. You have a video on becoming a Kardashev type
*  one civilization. What's our hope for doing that? We're a few orders of magnitude away from that.
*  Yeah, it is surprising. I think people tend to think that we're close to this scale. The
*  Kardashev type one is defined as a civilization which is using as much energy as is essentially
*  instant upon the planet from the star. That's a border, I think, for the earth of something like
*  10 to the 5 Terahertz or 10 to the 7 Terahertz. It's a gigantic amount of energy. And we're using
*  a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of that right now. So if you became a Kardashev type one civilization,
*  which is seen not necessarily as a goal into itself, I think people think, well, why are we
*  aspiring to become this energy hungry civilization? Surely our energy needs might improve our
*  efficiency or something as time goes on. But ultimately, the more energy you have access to,
*  the greater your capabilities will be. I mean, if you want to lift Mount Everest into space,
*  there is just a calculable amount of potential energy change that that's going to take in order
*  to accomplish that. And the more energy you have access to as a civilization, then clearly the
*  easier that energy achievement is going to be. So it depends on what your aspirations are as a
*  civilization. It might not be something you want to ever do, but... Well, but we should make clear
*  lifting heavy things isn't the only thing. It's just doing work. So it could be computation. It
*  could be more and more and more and more sophisticated and larger and larger and larger
*  computation, which is it does seem where we're headed with the very fast increase in the scale
*  and the quality of our computation outside the human brain. Artificial computation. Yeah. I mean,
*  computation is a great example of... I mean, already I think some 10% of US power electricity
*  use is going towards the supercomputing centers. So there's a vast amount of our current energy
*  needs, which are already going towards computing, will surely only increase over time. If we start
*  ever doing anything like mind uploading or creating simulated realities, that cost will
*  surely become almost a dominant source of our energy requirements at that point. If civilization
*  completely moves over to this kind of post-humanism stage. And so it's not unreasonable
*  that our energy needs would continue to grow. Certainly historically they always have at about
*  2% per year. And so if that continues, there is going to be a certain point where you're running
*  up against the amount of energy which you can harvest because you're using... Even if you cover
*  the entire planet in solar panels, there's no more energy to be had. And so there's a few ways of
*  achieving this. I sort of talked about in the video how there were several renewable energy
*  sources that we're excited about, like geothermal, wind power, waves, but pretty much all of those
*  don't really scratch the surface or don't really scratch the itch of getting to a Kardashev type
*  one civilization. They're meaningful now. I would never tell anybody don't do wind power now because
*  it's clearly useful at our current stage of a civilization, but it's going to be a pretty
*  negligible fraction of our energy requirements if we got to that stage of development. And so there
*  has to be a breakthrough in either our ability to harvest solar energy, which would require maybe
*  something like a space array of solar panels of beaming the energy back down, or some developments
*  and innovations in nuclear fusion that would allow us to essentially reproduce the same process of
*  what's producing the solar photons, but here on earth. But even that comes with some consequences.
*  If you're generating the energy here on earth and you're doing work on it on earth, then that work
*  is going to produce waste heat and that waste heat is going to increase the ambient temperature
*  of the planet. And so even if this isn't really a greenhouse effect that you're increasing the
*  temperature of the planet, this is just the amount of computers that are churning. You can feel the
*  warmth coming off them if you do that much work of literally the entire instant energy of the planet
*  is doing that work. The planet is going to warm up significantly as a result of that. And so that's
*  it. That clearly indicates that this is not a sustainable path that civilizations as they
*  approach Kalashev type one are going to have to leave planet earth, which is really the point of
*  that video to show that it's a Kalashev type one civilization, even though it's defined as instant
*  energy upon a planet, that is not a species that is going to still be living on their planet,
*  at least in isolation, they will have to be harvesting energy from afar. They will have to
*  be doing work on that energy outside of their planet because otherwise you're going to
*  dramatically change the environment in which you live. Well, yeah, so the more energy you create,
*  the more energy you use, the higher the imperative to expand out into the universe, but also not just
*  the imperative, but the capabilities. And you've kind of as a side on your lab page mentioned that
*  you're sometimes interested in astro engineering. So what kind of space architectures do you think
*  we can build to house humans or interesting things outside of earth? Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of
*  fun ideas here. One of the classic ideas is an O'Neill cylinder or a Stanford torus. These are
*  like two rotating structures that were devised in space. They're basically using the centrifugal
*  force as artificial gravity. And so these are structures which tend to be many kilometers across
*  that you're building in space, but could potentially habitat millions of people in orbit of the earth.
*  Of course, you could imagine putting them, the expanse does a pretty good job, I think,
*  of exploring the idea of human exploration of the solar system and having many objects, many of the
*  small near earth objects and asteroids inhabited by mining colonies. One of the ideas we've played
*  around with our group is this technology called a quasi, a quasi is an extension. Again, we always
*  tend to extend previous ideas, ideas build upon ideas, an extension idea called a statite. A statite
*  was an idea proposed, I think by Ron forward in the 1970s, 1970s seem to have all sorts of wacky
*  ideas. I don't know what was going on then. I think the Stanford torus, the O'Neill cylinder,
*  statites, the gravitational lens, people were really having fun with dreaming about space in
*  the 70s. The statite is basically a solar sail, but it's such an efficient solar sail that the
*  outward force of radiation pressure equals the inward force of gravity from the sun.
*  And so it doesn't need to orbit. Normally you avoid, the sun is pulling us right now through
*  force of gravity, but we are not getting closer towards the sun, even though we are falling
*  towards the sun because we're in orbit, which means our translational speed is just enough to
*  keep us at the same altitude essentially from the sun. And so you're in orbit and that's how you
*  maintain distance. A statite doesn't need to do that. It can be basically completely static in
*  inertial space, but it's just balancing the two forces of radiation pressure and inward
*  gravitational pressure. A quasi is the in-between of those two states. So it has some significant
*  outward pressure, but not enough to resist fully falling into the star. And so it compensates for
*  that by having some translational motion. So it's in between an orbit and a statite. And so what that
*  allows you to do is maintain artificial orbits. So normally if you want to calculate your orbital
*  speed of something that's say half an AU, you would use Kepler's third law and go through that. And
*  you'd say, okay, if it's half an AU, I can calculate the period by P squared is proportional to A
*  cubed and go through that. But for a quasi, you can basically have any speed you want. It's just a
*  matter of how much of the gravitational force are you balancing out. You effectively enter an orbit
*  where you're making the mass of the star be less massive than it really is. So it's as if you're
*  orbiting a 0.1 solar mass star or 0.2 solar mass star, whatever you want. And so that means that
*  Mercury orbits with a pretty fast orbital speed around the sun because it's closer to the sun
*  than we are. But we could put something in Mercury's orbit that would have a slower speed.
*  And so it would co-track with the earth. And so we would always be aligned with them at all times.
*  And so this could be useful if you wanted to have either a chain of colonies or something that were
*  able to easily communicate and move between one another between these different bases.
*  You'd probably use something like this to maintain that easy transferability. Or you could even use
*  it as a space weather monitoring system, which was actually proposed in the paper. We know that
*  major events like the Carrington event that happened can knock out all of our electromagnetic
*  systems quite easily. A major solar flare could do that, a geomagnetic storm. But if we had the
*  ability to detect those higher elevated activity cycles in advance, the problem is they travel
*  obviously pretty fast. And so it's hard to get ahead of them. But you could have a station which
*  is basically sampling solar flares very close to the surface of the earth. And as soon as it detects
*  anything suspicious magnetically, it could then send that information straight back at the speed
*  light to your earth and give you maybe a half an hour warning or something. Something bad was
*  coming. You should shut off all your systems or get in your Faraday cage now and protect yourself.
*  And so these quasites are kind of a cool trick of again, kind of hacking the laws of physics.
*  It's like another one of these exploits that the universe seems to allow us to do
*  to potentially manifest these artificial systems that would otherwise be difficult to produce.
*  So leveraging natural phenomena.
*  Yeah. That's always the key is to work. In my mind is to work with nature. That's how I see
*  astro engineering rather than against it. You're not trying to force it to do something. That's
*  why I always think solar energy is so powerful because in the battle against nuclear fusion,
*  nuclear fusion, you're really fighting a battle where you're trying to confine plasma into this
*  extremely tight space. The sun does this for free. It has gravitation. And so that's in essence what
*  a solar panel does. It is a nuclear fusion reactor fueled energy system, but it's just using
*  gravitation for the confinement and having a huge standoff distance for its energy collection.
*  And so there are tricks like that. It's very naive, simple trick in that case,
*  where we can rather than having to reinvent the wheel, we can use the space infrastructure,
*  if you like, the astrophysical infrastructure that's already there to our benefit.
*  Yeah. I think in the long arc of human history, probably natural phenomena is the right solution.
*  That's the simple, that's the elegant solution because all the power is already there. That's
*  why a distance sphere in the long sort of, well, you don't know what a distance sphere would look
*  like, but some kind of thing that leverages the power, the energy that's already in the sun is
*  better than creating artificial nuclear fusion reaction. But then again, that brings us to the
*  topic of AI. How much of this, if we're traveling out there, interstellar travel or
*  doing some of the interesting things we'll be talking about, how much
*  of those ships would be occupied by AI systems do you think? What would be the living organisms
*  occupying those ships? Yeah, it's depressing to think about AI in the search for life because
*  it had, I mean, I've been thinking about it a lot over the last few weeks with
*  playing around with chat GPT-3 like many of us and being astonished with its capabilities.
*  You see that our society is undergoing a change that seems significant in terms of the development
*  of artificial intelligence. We've been promised this revolution, this singularity for a long time,
*  but it really seems to be stepping up its pace of development at this point.
*  And so that's interesting because as someone who looks fairly in life out there in the universe,
*  it sort of implies that our current stage of development is highly transitional and that
*  you go back for the last four and a half billion years, the planet was dumb, essentially. If you
*  go back the last few thousand years, there was a civilization, but it wasn't really producing any
*  technical signatures. And then over the last maybe a hundred years, there's been something that might
*  be detectable from afar. But we're approaching this cusp where we might imagine it. I mean,
*  we're thinking of like maybe years and decades with AI development typically when we talk about
*  this. But as an astronomer, I have to think about much longer timescales of centuries, millennia,
*  millions of years. And so if this wave continues over that timescale, which is still the blink of
*  an eye on a cosmic timescale, that implies that everything will be AI essentially out there if
*  this is a common behavior. And so that's intriguing because it sort of implies that we are special
*  in terms of our moment in time as a civilization, which normally is something we're averse to as
*  astronomers. We normally like this mediocrity principle. We're not special. We're a typical
*  part of the universe. It's not the cosmological principle, but in a temporal sense, we may be
*  in a unique location. And perhaps that is part of the solution to the Fermi paradox, in fact,
*  that if it is true that planets tend to go through basically three phases, dumb life for the vast
*  majority, a brief period of biological intelligence, and then an extended period of artificial
*  intelligence that they transition to, then we would be in a unique and special moment in
*  galactic history that would be of particular interest for any anthropologists out there in
*  the galaxy. This would be the time that you would want to study a civilization very carefully. You
*  wouldn't want to interfere with it. You would just want to see how it plays out, kind of similar to
*  the ancestor simulations that are sometimes talked about with the simulation argument, that you are
*  able to observe perhaps your own origins and study how the transformation happens.
*  And so, yeah, that has for me recently been throwing the Fermi paradox a bit on its head
*  and this idea of the zoo hypothesis that we may be monitored, which has for a long time been sort of
*  seen as a fringe idea even amongst the SETI community. But if we live in this truly
*  transitional period, it adds a lot of impetus to that idea, I think.
*  Well, even AI itself, by its very nature, would be observing us.
*  There used to be this concept of human computation, which is actually exactly what's feeding the
*  current language models, which is leveraging all the busy stuff we're doing to do the hard
*  work of learning. So the language models are trained on human interaction and human language
*  on the internet. And so AI feeds on the output of brain power from humans. And so it would be
*  observing and observing, and it gets stronger as it observes. So it actually gets extremely good
*  at observing humans. And one of the interesting philosophical questions that starts percolating
*  is what is the interesting thing that makes us human? We tend to think of it
*  you said there's three phases. What's the thing that's hard to come by in phase three?
*  Is it something like scarcity, which is limited resources? Is it something like consciousness?
*  Is that the thing that emerged the evolutionary process in biological systems that are operating
*  under constrained resources? This thing that it feels like something to experience the world,
*  which we think of as consciousness, is that really difficult to replicate in artificial systems? Is
*  that the thing that makes us fundamentally human? Or is it just a side effect that we attribute way
*  too much importance to? Do you have a sense, if we look out into the future and AI systems are the
*  ones that are traveling out there to Alpha Centauri and beyond, do you think they have to carry the
*  flame of consciousness with them? No, not necessarily. They may do, but it may not be
*  unnecessarily... I guess we're talking about the difference here between sort of an AGI,
*  artificial general intelligence, or consciousness, which are distinct ideas. And you can certainly
*  have one without the other. So I could imagine... I would disagree with the certainty in that
*  statement. Okay. Okay. I think it's very possible in order to have intelligence,
*  you have to have consciousness. Okay. Well, I mean, to a certain degree,
*  chat GBT-3 has a level of intelligence already. It's not a general intelligence, but
*  it displays properties of intelligence with no consciousness. So... Again, I would disagree. Okay.
*  Okay. Well, I don't know. Because you said, it's very nice you said, it displays properties of
*  intelligence in the same way it displays properties of intelligence. I would say
*  it's starting to display properties of consciousness. It certainly could fool you
*  that it's conscious. Correct. Yeah. So I guess like a Turing test problem, like if it's displaying
*  all those properties, if it cracks like a parrot, looks like a parrot, or cracks like a duck,
*  isn't it basically a duck at that point? So yeah, I can see that argument. It probably...
*  I mean, certainly as an... I tried to think about it from the observer's point of view as an
*  astronomer, what am I looking for? Whether that intelligence is conscious or not has little
*  bearing, I think, as to what I should be looking for when I'm trying to detect evidence of them.
*  It would maybe affect their behavior in ways that I can't predict. But that's again, getting
*  into the game of what I would call xenopsychology, of trying to make projections about the motivations
*  of an alien species is incredibly difficult. And similarly, for any kind of artificial intelligence,
*  it's unfathomable what its intentions may be. I mean, I would sort of question whether it would
*  be interested in traveling between the stars at all. If its primary goal is computation,
*  computation for the sake of computation, then it's probably going to have a different way of...
*  It's going to be engineering its solar system and the nearby material around it for a different goal,
*  if it's just simply trying to increase computer substrate across the universe.
*  And that, of course, if that is its principal intention to just essentially convert dumb
*  matter into smart matter as it goes, then I think that would come into conflict with our observations
*  of the universe, right? Because the Earth shouldn't be here if that were true. The Earth should have
*  been transformed into computer substrate by this point. There has been plenty of time in the history
*  of the galaxy for that to have happened. So I'm skeptical in the part that that's a behavior that
*  AI or any civilization really engages in, but I also find it difficult to find a way out of it,
*  to explain why that would never happen in the entire history of the galaxy amongst potentially,
*  if life is common, millions, maybe even billions of instant instantiations of AI could have occurred
*  across the galaxy. And so that seems to be a knock against the idea that there is life else,
*  or intelligent life else, in the galaxy. The fact that that hasn't occurred in our history
*  is maybe the only solid data point we really have about the activities of other civilizations.
*  Of course, the scary one could be that we just at this stage, intelligent alien civilizations
*  just started destroying themselves. It becomes too powerful. Everything's just too many weapons,
*  too many nuclear weapons, too many nuclear weapons style systems that just from mistake to aggression
*  to like the probability of self-destruction is too high relative to the challenge of avoiding
*  the technological challenges of avoiding self-destruction.
*  You mean the AI destroys itself or we destroy ourselves prior to the advent of AI?
*  As we get smarter and smarter AI, either AI destroys us or other, there could be just a million.
*  Like AI is correlated, the development of AI is correlated with all this other technological
*  innovation, genetic engineering, like all kinds of engineering at the nanoscale,
*  the mass manufacture of things that could destroy us or cracking physics enough to have
*  very powerful weapons, nuclear weapons, all of it. Just too much physics enables way too many
*  things that can destroy us before it enables the propulsion systems that allow us to fly
*  far enough away before we destroy ourselves. So maybe that's what happens to the other alien
*  civilization. Is that your resolution? I think
*  us in the technosignature community and the astronomy community aren't thinking about this
*  problem seriously enough, in my opinion. We should be thinking about what AI is doing to our society
*  and the implications of what we're looking for. And so the only, I think, part of this thinking
*  has to involve people like yourself who are more intimate with the machine learning and
*  artificial intelligence world. How do you reconcile in your mind, you said earlier that you think
*  you can't imagine a galaxy where life and intelligence is not all over the place?
*  And if artificial intelligence is a natural progression for civilizations,
*  how do you reconcile that with the absence of any information around us or any clues or hints of
*  artificial behavior, artificially engineered stars, or colonization,
*  computer substrate transformed planets, anything like that?
*  It's extremely difficult for me. The Fermi paradox, broadly defined, is extremely difficult for me.
*  And the terrifying thing is, one thing I suspect is that we keep destroying ourselves. The
*  probability of self-destruction with advanced technology is just extremely high. That's why
*  we're not seeing it. But then again, my intuition about why we haven't blown ourselves up with
*  nuclear weapons, it's very surprising to me from a scientific perspective. Given all the cruelty
*  I've seen in the world, given the power that nuclear weapons place in the hands of a very
*  small number of individuals, it's very surprising to me that we destroy ourselves. And it seems to
*  be a very low probability situation we have happening here. And then the other explanation
*  is the zoos, the observation that we're just being observed. That's the only other thing.
*  It's so difficult for me. Of course, all of science, everything is very humbling. It would
*  be very humbling for me to learn that we're alone in the universe. It would change...
*  You know what? Maybe I do want that to be true because you want us to be special. That's why I'm
*  resisting that thought maybe. There's no way we're that special. That's where my resistance comes
*  from. I would just say, the specialness is... Implicitly in that statement, there's kind of
*  an assumption that we are something positive. We're a gift to this planet or something,
*  to this planet or something. And that makes us special. But it may be that intelligence is more
*  of... We're like rats or cockroaches. We're an infestation of this planet. We're not some
*  benevolent property that a planet would ideally like to have if you can even say such a thing.
*  But we may be not only generally a negative force for a planet's biosphere and its own
*  survivability, which I think you can make a strong argument about, but we may also be
*  a very persistent infestation that may... Even in... Interesting thoughts. In the wake of a nuclear
*  war, would that be an absolute eradication of every human being, which would be a fairly extreme
*  event? Or would the candle of consciousness, as you might call it, the flame of consciousness,
*  continue with some small pockets that would maybe in 10,000 years, 100,000 years,
*  we see civilization reemerge and play out the same thing over again?
*  Yeah, certainly. But nuclear weapons aren't powerful enough yet. But yes,
*  to push back on the infestation, sure. But the word special doesn't have to be positive. I just mean...
*  I think it tends to imply that. I take your point. Yeah. But maybe...
*  Just maybe extremely rare, maybe. Yeah. And that to me, it's very strange
*  for me to be cosmically unique. It's just very strange. I mean, that we're the only thing
*  of this level of complexity in the galaxy just seems very strange to me.
*  I would just... Yeah. I do think it depends on this classification. I think there is... Again,
*  it's kind of buried within there as a subtext, but there is a classification that we're doing here
*  that what we are is a distinct category of life, let's say, in this case. When we talk about
*  intelligence, we are something that can be separated. But of course, we see intelligence
*  across the animal kingdom in dolphins, humpback whales, octopuses, crows, ravens. And so it's
*  quite possible that these are all manifestations of the same thing. And we are not a particularly
*  distinct class except for the fact we make technology. That's really the only difference
*  for our intelligence. And we classify that separately, but from a biological perspective,
*  to some degree, it's really just all part of a continuum. And so that's why when we talk about
*  unique, you are putting yourself in a box which is distinct and saying, this is the only example
*  of things that fall into this box. But the walls of that box may themselves be a construct of our
*  own arrogance that we are something distinct. But I was also speaking broadly for us, meaning all
*  life on earth. But then it's possible that there's all kinds of living ecosystems on other
*  planets and other moons that just don't have interest in technological development.
*  And maybe technological development is the parasitic thing. It destroys the organism broadly.
*  And then maybe that's actually one of the fundamental realities. Whatever broad way to
*  categorize technological development, that's just the parasitic thing that just destroys itself.
*  We're flirting around this idea of the great filter a little bit here. So we're asking,
*  where is this? Does it lie ahead of us? Nuclear war may be imminent. That would be a filter that's
*  ahead of us. Or could it be behind us and that it's the advent of technology that is genuinely
*  a rare occurrence in the universe and that explains the Fermi paradox. And so that's
*  something that obviously people have debated and argued about in SETI for decades and decades. But
*  it remains a persistent, people argue whether it should be really called a paradox or not. But
*  it remains a consistent apparent contradiction that you can make a very cogent argument as to
*  why you expect life and intelligence to be common in the universe. And yet everything,
*  everything we know about the universe is fully compatible with just us being here.
*  And that's a haunting thought. But I have no preference or desire for that to be true.
*  I'm not trying to impose that view on anyone. But I do ask that we remain open-minded until
*  evidence has been collected either way. The thing is, it's one of, if not the,
*  probably I would argue is the most important question facing human civilization or the most
*  interesting. I think scientifically speaking, like what question is more important than,
*  somehow, you know, there could be other ways to sneak up to it, but it gets to the essence of
*  what we are, what these living organisms are. It's somehow seeing another kind.
*  Yeah.
*  Helps us understand.
*  It speaks to the human condition, helps us understand what it is to be human to some degree.
*  I think, you know, I have tried to remain very agnostic about the idea of life and intelligence.
*  One thing I try to be more optimistic about, and I've been thinking a lot with our searches for life
*  in the universe, is life in the past. I think it's actually not that hard to imagine we are
*  the only civilization in the galaxy right now.
*  Living.
*  Yeah, that's currently extent. But there may be very many extinct civilizations. If each
*  civilization has a typical lifetime comparable to, let's say, AI is the demise of our own,
*  that's only a few hundred years of technological development, or maybe 10,000 years if you go back
*  to the Neolithic Revolution, the dawn of agriculture. You know, hardly anything can be
*  in cosmic time span. That's nothing. That's the blink of an eye. And so it's not surprising at all
*  that we would happen not to coexist with anyone else. But that doesn't mean nobody else was ever
*  here. And if other civilizations come to that same conclusion and realization, maybe they scour the
*  galaxy around them, don't find any evidence for intelligence, then they have two options. They can
*  either give up on communication and just say, well, it's never going to happen. We may as well just
*  worry about what's happening here on our own planet. Or they could attempt communication,
*  but communication is through time. And that's almost the most selfless act of communication,
*  because there's no hope of getting anything back. It's a philanthropic gift almost to that other
*  civilization that you can maybe might just be nothing more than a monument, which the pyramids
*  essentially are a monument of their existence, that these are the things they achieved. This
*  was their act, the things they believed in, their language, their culture. Or it could be maybe
*  something more than that. It could be sort of lessons from what they learned and their own
*  history. And so I've been thinking a lot recently about how would we send a message to other
*  civilizations in the future, because that act of thinking seriously about the engineering of how
*  you design it would inform us about what we should be looking for. And also perhaps be our best chance,
*  quite frankly, of ever making contact. It might not be the contact we dream of, but it's still
*  contact. There would still be a record of our existence as pitiful as it might be compared to
*  a two-way communication. And I love the humility behind that project, the Universal Project.
*  Yeah. It's humble. It humbles you to the vast temporal landscape of the universe,
*  just realizing our day-to-day lives, all of us will be forgotten. It's nice to think about something
*  that sends a signal out to other, yeah. It was almost like a humility of acceptance as well,
*  of knowing that you have a terminal disease, but your impact on the earth doesn't have to end with
*  your death, that it could go on beyond with what you leave behind for others to discover with maybe
*  the books you write or what you leave in the literature. Do you think launching the Roadster
*  vehicle out in space would be a good idea? Yeah. I'm not sure what someone would make of that.
*  I mean, there have been quasi-attempts at it beyond the Roadster. I mean, there's like plaques on,
*  there's the Pioneer plaques, there's the Voyager 2 golden record. It's pretty unlikely anybody's
*  going to discover those because they're just adrift in space and they will eventually mechanically
*  die and not produce any signal for anyone to spot. So you'd have to be extremely lucky to come
*  across them. I've often said to my colleagues that I think the best place is the moon. The moon,
*  unlike the earth, has no significant weathering. How long will the Apollo descent stages, which
*  are still set on the lunar surface, last for? The only real effect is micrometrize, which are slowly
*  dust smashing against them pretty much. But that's going to take millions, potentially billions of
*  years to erode that down. And so we have an opportunity, and that's on the surface. If you
*  put something just a few meters beneath the surface, it would have even greater protection.
*  And so it raises the prospect of that if we wanted to send something, a significant amount of
*  information, to a future galactic-spanning civilization that maybe cracks the interstellar
*  propulsion problem. The moon's going to be there for five billion years. That's a long time for
*  somebody to come by and detect maybe a strange pattern that we draw on the sand for them to,
*  you know, big arrow, big cross, like look under here, and we could have a tomb of knowledge of
*  some record of our civilization. And so I think when you think like that, what that implies to us,
*  well, okay, the galaxy is 13 billion years old, the moon is already four billion years old.
*  There may be places familiar to us, nearby to us, that we should be seriously considering
*  as places we should look for life and intelligent life or evidence of relics that they might leave
*  behind for us. So that thinking like that will help us find such relics. And it's like a
*  it's a beneficial cycle that happens. Yes. Yeah, exactly. It enables the science of society better,
*  like of social profiles and tech signatures and so on. Yeah. And it's inspiring. I mean, it's
*  it's also inspiring in that we want to leave a legacy behind as an entire civilization,
*  not just in the symbols, but broadly speaking, that's the last thing somehow. Yeah. And I'm part
*  of a team that's trying to repeat the golden record experiment. We're trying to create like
*  an open source version of the golden record that future spacecraft are able to download and
*  basically put a little hard drive that they can carry around with them and, you know, get these
*  distributed hopefully across the solar system eventually. And it's going to be called the
*  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Yeah, it could be. That's a good name for it. We've been toying
*  a little bit with the name, but I think probably just be golden record at this point, or golden
*  record version two or something. But I think another benefit that I see of this activity
*  is that it forces us as a species to ask those questions about what it is that we want
*  another civilization to know about us. The golden record was kind of funny because
*  it had photos on it and it had photos of people eating for instance, but it had no photos of
*  people defecating. And so I always thought that was kind of funny because if I was an alien,
*  if I was studying an alien, if I saw images of an alien, I would, I'm not trying to be like a pervert
*  or anything, but I would want to see the full, I want to understand the biology of that alien.
*  And so we always censor what we show. We should show the whole actual natural process and then
*  also say we humans tend to censor these things. We tend to not like to walk around naked. We tend
*  to not to talk about some of the natural biological phenomena and talk a lot about others. And actually
*  it's just be very like the way you would be to a therapist or something, very transparent about the
*  way we actually operate. Yeah. I mean, and Sagan had that with the golden record. I think he
*  originally, there's a male and a female figure to pitch on the golden record. And the woman
*  had a genitalia originally drawn and there was a lot of pushback from, I think, a lot of Christian
*  groups who were not happy about the idea of throwing this into space. And so eventually they
*  had to remove that. And so it would be confusing biologically if you're trying to study xenobiology
*  of this alien that apparently has no genitalia or the mandus, but for some reason the woman doesn't.
*  You know, and that's our own societal and cultural imprint happening into that information.
*  That's to be fair, just even having two sexes and predators and prey, just the whole, that could be
*  just a very unique earth like thing. So that might be confused about why there's like pairs of things.
*  Like why are you, like why is there a man and a woman in general? Like they could be, I mean,
*  they could be confused about a lot of things in general. I don't think the-
*  They don't even know which way to hold the picture.
*  Or there's the picture. They might not need, they might have very different sensory devices
*  to even interpret this. If they only have sound as their only way of navigating the world,
*  it's kind of lost to send any kind of, you know, there's been a lot of conversation about sending
*  video and audio and video and pictures. And that's one of the things I've been a little bit
*  resistant about in the team that I've been thinking, well, they might not have eyes. And so
*  if you lived in the Europa surface, having eyes wouldn't be very useful. If you lived in a,
*  on a very dark planet on the tightly locked night side of an exoplanet, having eyes wouldn't be
*  particularly useful. So it's kind of a presumption of us to think that video is a useful form of
*  communication. Do you hope we become a multi-planetary species? So we're almost sneaking up to that,
*  but you know, the efforts of SpaceX, of Elon, maybe in general, what your thoughts are about
*  those efforts. So you already mentioned Starship will be very interesting for astronomy, for science
*  in general, just getting stuff out into space. But what about the longer term goal of actually
*  colonizing, of building civilizations on other surfaces, on moons, on planets? It seems like a
*  fairly obvious thing to do for our survival, right? There's a high risk if we are committed
*  to trying to keep this human experiment going, putting all of our eggs in one basket is always
*  going to be a risky strategy to pursue. It's a nice basket though. It is a beautiful basket.
*  I personally have no interest in living on Mars or the moon. I would like to visit, but I would
*  definitely not want to spend the rest of my life and die on Mars. It's a hellhole. Mars is a very,
*  very difficult. I think the idea that this is going to happen in the next 10, 20 years seems
*  to be very optimistic. Not that it's insurmountable, but the challenges are extreme to survive on a
*  planet like Mars, which is like a dry frozen desert with a high radiation environment. It's
*  a challenge of a type we've never faced before. I'm sure human ingenuity can tackle it, but
*  I'm skeptical that we'll have thousands of people living on Mars in my lifetime. But I would relish
*  that opportunity to maybe one day visit such a settlement and do scientific experiments on
*  Mars or experience Mars, do astronomy from Mars, all sorts of cool stuff you could do.
*  Sometimes you see these dreams of outer solar system exploration and you can fly through the
*  clouds of Venus or you could just do these enormous jumps on these small moons where you
*  can essentially jump as high as a skyscraper and traverse them. There's all sorts of wonderful
*  ice skating on Europa might be fun. So digging around, I love the idea of us becoming into
*  planetary. I think it's just a question of time, our own destructive tendencies,
*  as you said earlier, add odds with our emerging capability to become into planetary.
*  And the question is, will we get out of the nest before we burn it down?
*  And I don't know. Obviously, I hope that we do, but I don't have any special insight that
*  there is a problem. There is somewhat of an annoying intellectual itch I have with
*  the so-called doomsday argument, which I try not to treat too seriously, but there is some element
*  of it that bothers me. The doomsday argument basically suggests that you're typically the
*  mediocrity principle, you're not special, that you're probably going to be born somewhere in
*  the middle of all human beings who will ever be born. You're unlikely to be one of the first
*  1% of human beings that ever lived and similarly the last 1% of human beings that will ever live,
*  because you'd be very unique and special if that were true. And so by this logic,
*  you can calculate how many generations of humans you might expect. So if there's been,
*  let's say, 100 billion human beings that have ever lived on this planet, then you could say
*  to 95% confidence, so you divide by 5%, so 100 billion divided by 0.05 would give you 2 trillion
*  human beings that would ever live, you'd expect by this argument. And so if let's say each planet,
*  in general, the planet has a 10 billion population, so that would be 200 generations of humans we
*  would expect ahead of us. And if each one has an average lifetime, let's say 100 years, then that
*  would be about 20,000 years. So there's 20,000 years left in the clock. That's like a typical
*  doomsday argument type. That's how they typically lay it out. Now, a lot of the criticisms of the
*  doomsday argument come down to, well, what are you really counting? You're counting humans there,
*  but maybe you should be counting years, or maybe you should be counting human hours.
*  Because what you count makes a big difference to what you get out on the other end. So this is
*  called the reference class. And so that's one of the big criticisms of the doomsday argument. But
*  I do think it has a compelling point that it would be surprising if our future is to one day
*  blossom and become a galactic spanning empire. Trillions upon trillions upon trillions of human
*  beings will one day live across the stars for essentially as long as the galaxy exists and the
*  stars burn. We would live at an incredibly special point in that story. We would be right at the very,
*  very beginning. And that's not impossible, but it's just somewhat improbable. And so part of that
*  irks against me, but it also almost feels like a philosophical argument because you're talking
*  about souls being drawn from this cosmic pool. So it's not an argument that I lose sleep about
*  for our fate of the doomsday, but it is somewhat intellectually annoying that
*  there is a slight contradiction there it feels like with the idea of a galactic spanning empire.
*  Yeah, but of course there's so many unknowns.
*  I for one would love to visit even space, but
*  Mars, just imagine standing on Mars and looking back at Earth.
*  Yeah, I mean, it would be incredible sight. It would give you such a fresh perspective as to
*  your entire existence and what it meant to be human. Yeah, and then come back to Earth. It would
*  give you a heck of a perspective. Plus the sunset on Mars is supposed to be nice. I loved what William
*  Schatner said after his flight. His words really moved me when he came down. And I think
*  it really captured the idea that we shouldn't really be sending engineers, our scientists into
*  space. We should be sending our poets because those are the people when they come down who can
*  truly make a difference when they describe their experiences in space. And I found it very moving
*  reading what he said. Yeah, when you talk to astronauts, when they describe what they see,
*  when they describe what they see, it's like this, like they discovered a whole new thing
*  that they can't possibly cover back into words. Yeah, it's beautiful to see. Just as a quick,
*  before I forget, I have to ask you, can you summarize your argument against the hypothesis
*  that we live in a simulation? Is it similar to our discussion about the doomsday clock?
*  No, it's actually probably more similar to my agnosticism about life in the universe.
*  And it's just sort of remaining agnostic about all possibilities. The simulation argument,
*  sometimes it gets mixed. There's kind of two distinct things that we need to consider. One
*  is the probability that we live in so-called base reality, that we're not living in a simulated
*  reality itself. And another probability we need to consider is the probability that
*  that technology is viable or possible and something we will ultimately choose to one day do.
*  Those are two distinct things. They're probably quite similar numbers to each other,
*  but they are distinct probabilities. So in my paper I wrote about this, I just tried to work
*  through the problem. I teach astro-sciistics, actually teaching it this morning. And so it
*  just seemed like a fun case study of working through a Bayesian calculation for it. Bayesian
*  calculations work on conditionals. And so when you hear what kind of inspired this project,
*  which is what I heard Musk said was like a billion to one chance that we don't live in a simulation,
*  he's right if you add the Bayesian conditional and the Bayesian conditional is conditioned upon the
*  fact that we eventually develop that technology and choose to use it, or it's chosen to be used
*  by such species, by such civilizations, that's the conditional. And you have to add that in
*  because that conditional isn't guaranteed. And so in a Bayesian framework, you can kind of
*  make that explicit. You see mathematically explicitly that's a conditional in your equation.
*  And the opposite side of the coin is basically in the trilemma that Bostrom originally put forward,
*  it's options one and two. So option one is that you basically never develop the ability to do that.
*  Option two is you never choose to execute that. So we kind of group those together as sort of the
*  non-simulation scenario, let's call it. And so you've got non-simulation scenario and simulation
*  scenario. And agnostically, we really have to give the, you know, how do you assess the model,
*  the a priori model probability of those two scenarios? It's very difficult and we can,
*  I think people would probably argue about how you assign those priors. In the paper,
*  we just assigned 50-50. We just said, this hasn't been demonstrated yet. There's no evidence that
*  this is actually technically possible, but nor is it that it's not technically possible. So we're
*  just going to assign 50-50 probability to these two hypotheses. And then in the hypothesis where
*  you have a simulated reality, you have a base reality set at the top. So there is even in the
*  simulated hypothesis, there's a probability you still live in base reality. And then there's a
*  whole myriad of universes beneath that, which are all simulated. And so you have a very slim
*  probability of being in base reality if this is true. And you have a hundred percent probability
*  of living in base reality on the other hand, if it's not true and we never develop that ability
*  or choose never to use it. And so then you apply this technique called Bayesian model averaging,
*  which is where you propagate the uncertainty of your two models to get a final estimate.
*  And because of that one base reality that lives in the simulated scenario, you end up counting this
*  up and getting that it always has to be less than 50%. So the probability you live in a
*  simulated reality versus a base reality has to be slightly less than 50%. Now that really comes down
*  to that statement of giving it 50-50 odds to begin with. And on the one hand, you might say,
*  look, David, I work in artificial intelligence. I'm very confident that this is going to happen
*  just of extrapolating of current trends. Or on the other hand, a statistician would say,
*  you're giving way too much weight to the simulation hypothesis because it's an intrinsically
*  highly complicated model. You have a whole hierarchy of realities within realities within
*  realities. It's like the inception style thing. And so this requires hundreds, thousands, millions
*  of parameterizations to describe. And by Occam's razor, we would always normally penalize inherently
*  complicated models as being disfavored. So I think you could argue on being too generous or
*  too kind with that, but I sort of want to develop the rigorous mathematical tools to explore it.
*  And ultimately it's up to you to decide what you think that 50-50 odds should be. But you can use
*  my formula to plug in whatever you want and get the answer. And I use 50-50.
*  But in that first pile, with the first two parts that the boss talks about, it seems like
*  connected to that is the question we've been talking about, which is the number of times
*  at bat you get, which is the number of intelligent civilizations that are out there that can
*  build such simulations. It seems like very closely connected because if we're the only ones
*  that are here and it could build such things that changes things.
*  Yeah. The simulation hypothesis has all sorts of implications like that.
*  I've always loved, Sean Carra pointed out a really interesting contradiction, apparently,
*  with the simulation hypothesis that I speak about a little bit in the paper.
*  But he showed that, or pointed out that in this hierarchy of realities, which then develop their
*  own AIs within the realities, or really ancestor simulations, I should say, rather than AI,
*  they develop their own capability to simulate realities. You get this hierarchy. And so
*  eventually there'll be a bottom layer, which I often call the sewer of reality. It's like the
*  worst layer where it's the most pixelated it could possibly be. Because each layer is necessarily
*  going to have less computational power than the layer above it. Because not only are you simulating
*  that entire planet, but also some of that's being used for the computers themselves that those are
*  simulated. And so that base reality, or the sewer of reality, is a reality where they are simply
*  unable to produce ancestor simulations because the fidelity of the simulation is not sufficient.
*  And so from that point of view, it might not be obvious the universe is pixelated, but they
*  would just never be able to manifest that capability. What if they're constantly simulating,
*  because in order to appreciate the limits of the fidelity, you have to have an observer. What if
*  they're always simulating a dumber and dumber observer? What if the sewer has very dumb
*  observers that can't? Scientists, they're the dumbest possible scientists. So it's very pixelated,
*  but the scientists are too dumb to even see the pixelations. So built into the universe always
*  has to be a limitation on the cognitive capabilities of the complex systems that are within it.
*  Yeah. So that sewer of reality, they would still presumably be able to have a very impressive
*  computational capabilities. They'd probably be able to simulate galactic formation or this kind
*  of impressive stuff, but they would be just short of the ability to, however you define it, create
*  a truly sentient, conscious experience in a computer. That would just be beyond their
*  capabilities. And so Carol pointed out that if you count up how many realities there should be,
*  probabilistically, if this is true, over here, the simulation hypothesis or scenario,
*  then you're most likely to find yourself in the sewer because there's just far more of them
*  than there are of any of the higher levels. And so that sort of sets up a contradiction because then
*  you live in a reality which is inherently incapable of ever producing ancestor simulations.
*  But the premise of the entire argument is that ancestor simulations are possible.
*  So there's a contradiction.
*  There's that old quote, we're all living in the sewer, but some of us are looking up at the stars.
*  This is maybe more true than we think.
*  To me, so there's of course physics and computational fascinating questions here,
*  but to me there's a practical psychological question, which is, how do you create
*  a virtual reality world that is as compelling and not necessarily even as realistic, but
*  almost as realistic, but as compelling or more compelling than physical reality?
*  Because something tells me it's not very difficult in a full history of human civilization.
*  That is an interesting kind of simulation to me because that feels like it's doable in the
*  next 100 years, creating a world where we're all prefer to live in the digital world.
*  And not like a visit, but like you're seen as insane. No, like you're required,
*  it's unsafe to live outside of the virtual world.
*  And it's interesting to me from an engineering perspective, how to build that,
*  because I'm somebody that sort of loves video games and it seems like
*  you can create incredible worlds there and stay there.
*  And that's a different question than creating a ultra high resolution, high fidelity simulation
*  of physics. But if that world inside a video game is as consistent as the physics of our reality,
*  then you can have your own scientists in that world that trying to understand
*  that physics world. It might look different.
*  And presumably they'd eventually forget, give it long enough, they might forget about their
*  origins of being once biological and assume this was their only reality.
*  Especially if you're now born, certainly if you're born, but even if
*  you were eight years old or something when you first started wearing the headset.
*  Yeah. Or you have a memory wipe when you go in. I mean, it also kind of maybe speaks to this issue
*  of like Neuralink and how do we keep up with AI in our world. If you want to augment your intelligence,
*  perhaps one way of competing and one of your impetus is for going into this digital reality
*  would be to be competitive intellectually with artificial intelligence that you could
*  trivially augment your reality if your brain was itself artificial. But I mean, one skepticism I've
*  always had about that is whether it's more of a philosophical question, but how much is that really
*  you if you do a mind upload? Is this just a duplicate of your memories that thinks it's you
*  versus truly a transference of your conscious stream into that reality? And I think when you
*  use almost like the teleportation device in Star Trek, but with teleportation,
*  quantum teleportation, you can kind of rigorously show that as long as all of the quantum numbers
*  are exactly duplicated as you transfer over, it truly is from the universe's perspective
*  in every way indistinguishable from what was there before. It really is in principle you and all the
*  sense of being you versus creating a duplicate clone and uploading memories to that human body
*  or a computer that would surely be a discontinuation of that conscious experience by virtue of the fact
*  you've multiplied it. And so I would be hesitant about uploading for that reason. I would see it
*  mostly as my own killing myself and having some AI duplicate of me that persists in this world,
*  but is not truly my experience. Typical 20th century human with an attachment to this particular
*  singular instantiation of brain and body. How silly humans used to be used to have rotary phones and
*  and other silly things. You're an incredible human being. You're an educator. You're a researcher.
*  You have like an amazing YouTube channel
*  looking to young people. If you were to give them advice,
*  how can they have a career that maybe is inspired by yours, inspired by wandering curiosity,
*  a career they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of? What advice would you give?
*  I certainly think in terms of a career in science, one thing that I may be discovered late but has
*  been incredibly influential on me in terms of my own happiness and my own productivity
*  has been this synergy of doing two passions at once. One passion in science communication,
*  and another passion research and not surrendering either one. I think that tends to be seen as
*  something that's an either or. You have to completely dedicate yourself to one thing
*  to gain mastery in it. That's a conventional way of thinking about both science and other disciplines.
*  I have found that both have been elevated by practicing in each. That's true in all
*  assets of life. If you want to become the best researcher you possibly can,
*  you're pushing your intellect and in a sense your body to a high level. To me,
*  I've always wanted to couple that with training of my body, training of my mind in other ways,
*  besides from just what I'm doing when I'm in the lecture room or when I'm in my office calculating
*  something. Focusing on your own development through whatever it is, meditation for me is
*  often running, working out and pursuing multiple passions provides this almost synergistic bliss
*  of all of them together. So often I've had some of the best research ideas from making a YouTube
*  video and trying to communicate an idea or interacting with my audience who've had a
*  question that sparked a whole trail of thought that led down this wonderful intellectual rabbit
*  hole or maybe to a new intellectual discovery. It can go either way sometimes with those things.
*  Thinking broadly, diversely and always looking after yourself in this highly competitive and
*  often extremely stressful world that we live in is the best advice I can offer anybody.
*  And just try if you can, it's very cheesy, but if you can follow your passions, you'll always be
*  happy. Trying to sell out for the quick cash out, for the quick book out can be tempting in the
*  short term. Looking for exo moons was never easy, but I made a career not out of discovering exo
*  moons, but out of learning how to communicate the difficult problem and discovering all sorts of
*  things along the way. We shot for the sky and we discovered all this stuff along the way.
*  We discovered dozens of new planets using all sorts of new techniques. We pushed this
*  instrumentation to new places and I've had an extremely productive research career in this
*  world. I've had all sorts of ideas working on techno signatures. Thinking innovatively
*  pushes you into all sorts of exciting directions. It's hard to find that passion, but you can
*  sometimes remember it when you were a kid, what your passions were and what fascinated you as a
*  child. For me, as soon as I hooked up a space boat when I was five years old, that was it. I was
*  hooked on space and I almost betrayed my passion at college. I studied physics, which I've always
*  been fascinated by physics as well, but I came back to astronomy because it was my first love
*  and I was much happier doing research in astronomy than I was in physics because it spoke to that
*  wonder I had as a child that first was the spark of curiosity for me in science.
*  RG So society will try to get you to look at hot Jupiters
*  and the advice is to look for the cool worlds instead. What do you think is the meaning of
*  this whole thing? Have you ever asked yourself why?
*  MG It's just a ride. We're on a roller coaster and we have no purpose. It's an accident in my
*  perspective. There's no meaning to my life. There's no objective deity who is over watching what I'm
*  doing and I have some fate or destiny. It's all just riding on the roller coaster and trying to
*  have a good time and contribute to other people's enjoyment of the ride.
*  RG Yeah, try to make it a happy accident. MG Yeah, I see no fundamental
*  providence in my life or in the nature of the universe. You just see this universe as this
*  beautiful cosmic accident of galaxies smashing together, stars forging here and there, and
*  planets occasionally spawning maybe life across the universe. We are just one of those instantiations
*  and we should just enjoy this very brief episode that we have. I think trying to
*  look at it much deeper than that is, to me, not very soul satisfying. I just think
*  enjoy what you've got and appreciate it. RG It does seem like noticing that beauty
*  helps make the ride pretty fun. MG Yeah, absolutely.
*  RG David, you're an incredible person. I haven't covered most of the things I wanted to talk to
*  you about. This was an incredible conversation. I'm glad you exist. I'm glad you're doing everything
*  you're doing. I'm a huge fan. Thank you so much for talking to me. This was amazing.
*  MG Thank you so much, Lex. It's a real honor. Thank you.
*  RG Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Kipping. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, let me leave you with some words from Carl
*  Sagan. Perhaps the aliens are here, but are hiding because of some Lex Galactica, some ethic of
*  non-interference with emerging civilizations. We can imagine them, curious and dispassionate,
*  observing us as we would watch a bacterial culture in a dish to determine whether this year,
*  again, we managed to avoid self-destruction. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
