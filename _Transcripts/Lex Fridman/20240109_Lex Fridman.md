# Tal Wilkenfeld: Music, Guitar, Bass, Jeff Beck, Prince, and Leonard Cohen | Lex Fridman Podcast #408
**Lex Fridman:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qfwPv7clEw)
*  I am standing on the edge of the cliff the entire night.
*  And if I, you know, mess something up, mess it up,
*  like what even is a mistake?
*  But if I do like a little clunker or whatever it is,
*  it's like, so what?
*  Like, I wouldn't have played half the stuff that I'm playing
*  if I wasn't constantly standing
*  on the edge of the cliff like wild.
*  Why are you standing on the edge of the cliff?
*  Because at the edge of the cliff is all possibilities.
*  The following is a conversation with Tal Wilkenfeld,
*  a singer-songwriter, bassist, guitarist,
*  and a true musician who has recorded and performed
*  with many legendary artists, including Jeff Beck, Prince,
*  Eric Clapton, Incubus, Herbie Hancock,
*  Mick Jagger, Jackson Brown, Rod Stewart, David Gilmore,
*  Pharrell, Hans Zimmer, and many, many more.
*  This was a fun and fascinating conversation.
*  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors
*  in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Tal Wilkenfeld.
*  There's a legendary video of you playing with Jeff Beck.
*  We're actually watching it in the background now.
*  So for people who don't know,
*  Jeff is one of the greatest guitarists ever.
*  So you were playing with him
*  at the 2007 Crossroads Festival.
*  And people should definitely watch that video.
*  You were killing it on the bass.
*  Look at that face.
*  Were you scared?
*  What was that experience like?
*  Were you nervous?
*  You don't look nervous.
*  Yeah, yeah, I wasn't nervous.
*  I think that you can get an adrenaline rush before a stage,
*  which is natural, but I think as soon as you bring fear
*  to a bandstand, you're like limiting yourself.
*  You're kind of like,
*  walling yourself off from everyone else.
*  If you're afraid, like what is there to be afraid of?
*  You must be afraid of making a mistake
*  and therefore you're coming at it as like a perfectionist
*  and you can't come at music that way
*  or it's not gonna be as expansive and vulnerable and true.
*  So, no, I was excited and passionate
*  and having the best time.
*  And also, the fact that he gave me this solo,
*  the context of this performance is that
*  this was a guitar festival.
*  It's one of the biggest guitar festivals in the world
*  because Eric Clapton's festival.
*  And there's like 400 guitarists
*  that are all playing solos all night.
*  And we were towards the end of the night.
*  And I could tell Jeff got a kick out of,
*  I'm not gonna solo on one of my most well-known songs,
*  Castlevania and His Lovers.
*  Well, Stevie Wonder wrote it,
*  but people know Jeff for that song and his solo on it.
*  Like I'm gonna give it to my bass player.
*  And he did and like-
*  You took it.
*  He's like bowing.
*  He didn't have to do that.
*  But you really stepped up there.
*  It just shows what a generous musician he is.
*  And that's evident in his playing across the board.
*  He is a generous, loving, open musician.
*  He's not there for himself.
*  He's there for the music.
*  And he thought, well,
*  this would be the perfect musical thing to do.
*  And it kind of all started
*  like when I went to audition for him,
*  I auditioned for him,
*  which was an interesting experience
*  because I got food poisoning on the plane.
*  And so like literally when the plane landed,
*  I went straight into an ambulance,
*  into a hospital overnight.
*  The manager picked me up and I showed up at Jeff's door,
*  which was like a three hour drive,
*  like through windy country roads.
*  And he answered the door and he's like,
*  okay, you're ready to play?
*  So we went upstairs and started rattling off the set.
*  And when it came to this song,
*  Cos of It and His Lovers,
*  he just said solo and he loved it and kept the solo in it.
*  So that's kind of how,
*  because there was no bass solo
*  before I was playing in his band.
*  So this whole thing was kind of new.
*  So even with food poisoning,
*  like you could step up.
*  Yeah.
*  That's just like what, instinct?
*  It's just being able to differentiate from the body
*  and from like expression music.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's interesting you said fear walls you off
*  from the other musicians.
*  And what are you afraid of?
*  You're afraid of making a mistake.
*  You know, Beethoven said,
*  to play a wrong note is insignificant,
*  to play without passion is inexcusable.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think the old man had a point?
*  Yeah.
*  Different styles of music invite varying degrees of,
*  I would say uncertainty or unsafety
*  in the way that people might perceive it.
*  So for instance, like the tour that I was just on,
*  like playing all my brother's songs,
*  like I am standing on the edge of the cliff the entire night.
*  And if I, you know, mess something up, mess it up,
*  like what even is a mistake?
*  But if I do like a little clunker or whatever it is,
*  it's like, so what?
*  Like I wouldn't have played half the stuff that I'm playing
*  if I wasn't constantly standing on the edge of the cliff,
*  like wild.
*  And so I don't care about those few little things.
*  I care about the overall expression.
*  And then there's other gigs that, you know, for instance,
*  if I got called for like a pop or a country session
*  or a show, in those environments,
*  they may want you to play safe.
*  Like just play the pot and play it with a great groove
*  and time and great dynamics
*  and don't really veer away from the pot and stuff.
*  And I've done plenty of those gigs too.
*  It's just a different like hat you put on.
*  What do you get from the veering,
*  from the veering off the beaten path?
*  You just love it or is that gonna make
*  the performance better?
*  Like why are you standing on the edge of the cliff?
*  Because at the edge of the cliff is all possibilities
*  and unknown.
*  You don't know what's coming.
*  And I love being there in the unknown.
*  Otherwise it's just like, well, why are we doing this?
*  Am I just like a clown on stage,
*  like showing you my skills
*  or what I've studied in my bedroom?
*  It's like, no, like I wanna be like pure expression
*  happening right now and responding in real time
*  to everything that's happening.
*  And anytime I'm not doing that,
*  it's like it's a waste of everybody's time.
*  Have you ever messed it up real bad?
*  Mess what up?
*  I mean, you know comedians bomb, you're a big fan of comedy.
*  Have you ever bombed on stage?
*  Probably.
*  I think it's all about recovery.
*  You know, in the more times that you fall off the cliff,
*  the quicker you know how to recover
*  and the varying ways that you can recover
*  to the point in which it's concealed so much
*  that maybe a listener might not even know
*  that you're recovering.
*  And eventually you learn to fly
*  if you take that metaphor all the way off the cliff.
*  You know, you learn, all right.
*  I remember one time when I was really young,
*  well, not really young, but like when I was 21 or 22.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But when I was first playing with Jeff Beck
*  and we played at what I consider the best,
*  the coolest jazz festival, it's Montreux Jazz.
*  And like Miles played there, everyone played there
*  and they have the best speaker system ever.
*  I was excited for months.
*  And the drummer Vinnie was like practicing
*  for like eight hours in the bus on the way there.
*  And everyone was like on fire on stage.
*  And I remember playing a note, just one note
*  that I really didn't like.
*  And I let it go in the moment on stage,
*  but as soon as I got off stage, I was really sad.
*  And so I sat like on this road case,
*  everyone was out celebrating.
*  I was like sat on this road case with a sad face like,
*  hoo hoo.
*  And then Claude Knobbs, like the owner of the,
*  you know, the whole festival came out to me.
*  He's like, doll, what's wrong?
*  And I'm like, I played a bad note.
*  I'm such a child.
*  And like he said all this wise stuff that, you know,
*  Miles Davis had imparted to him and like,
*  it fully cheered me up.
*  He's like, is there anything that would make you feel better?
*  And I was like, caviar.
*  The dude came back 10 minutes later with this huge thing.
*  It was a joke.
*  It was a joke, but he actually brought me caviar.
*  But anyway, that's the one time that I remember being sad
*  about a performance.
*  Now I'm just like, okay, whatever.
*  Like it's done.
*  Was it a physical slip of like the fingers or was it,
*  did you intend to play that note?
*  That I can't remember.
*  I can't remember if it was just a bad choice
*  that sounded like a clanger or why it happened.
*  It was so long ago,
*  but I don't get depressed about that anymore.
*  That'd be funny if that was like your biggest
*  and only regret in life is that note.
*  It haunted you in your dreams.
*  And then like, you know, like I'm on my deathbed
*  and just everyone's just bringing me caviar.
*  Joke went way too far.
*  You talked about confidence somewhere.
*  I don't remember where.
*  So I wanna ask you about how much confidence
*  it takes to be up there.
*  You said something that Anthony Jackson told you
*  as encouragement, a line that I really like that quote,
*  on your worst day, you're still a bad motherfucker.
*  That's actually a Steve Gad quote.
*  And Steve used to tell that to Anthony
*  because Anthony used to get real depressed
*  if he did a wrong thing or not perfect thing.
*  And Steve Gad used to say this to Anthony Jackson.
*  And then Anthony was my first bass mentor
*  or just mentor in general.
*  For people who don't know, he's a legendary bassist.
*  He's a legendary bassist.
*  And I started playing the bass when I was 17.
*  And I moved to New York and I met Anthony
*  and he started mentoring me a bit in a very not typical way.
*  Like he would just sit in his car with me for hours
*  and talk music.
*  And-
*  You guys just listen to music and analyze it.
*  Exactly.
*  And that was the best form of learning, I think.
*  Just like, well, what do you perceive here?
*  And well, I heard this and just discussing that.
*  Jazz usually or?
*  No, all styles of music.
*  And yeah, he told me that story about on your worst day.
*  Because, you know, like, yeah, even then,
*  like when I was like 18, 19,
*  I get sad sometimes about performances.
*  Like I could have done this.
*  It's like, I don't do that anymore, thankfully.
*  Or I'd be miserable.
*  So you still, you always kind of feel pretty good.
*  Yeah, yeah, now I do.
*  Now it's just, I sense the body feeling fatigued,
*  especially if it's a very long show.
*  Like the ones I just did with three hour shows
*  and we did, you know, one to three hour sound checks.
*  So that's a lot of physical activity every day.
*  So I just feel the body being tired,
*  like fatigued, the ears are fatigued.
*  That's about it.
*  I don't really reflect on the show much.
*  You're almost like from a third person perspective,
*  feel the body, get tired and just accept it.
*  Yeah, I don't wanna identify with it
*  because then I'm tired, but I'm not tired.
*  I'm usually like energized.
*  It's like with the food poisoning,
*  the mind is still capable of creative genius,
*  even if the body is gone, something like that.
*  So no self-critical component
*  to the way you see your performances anymore?
*  There is critique, but not in the way
*  that it would diminish my sense of self.
*  It's different.
*  I can just kind of look at something and be like,
*  okay, well actually next time I'll do this choice
*  and this choice maybe,
*  maybe this would serve the song better.
*  Maybe this would help the groove feel more like this,
*  but it's not like I suck because I did this
*  and I'm a loser.
*  Do you think that's bad?
*  Because even when I asked that question,
*  I had a self-critical thought,
*  then why'd you ask that question?
*  That's the wrong question.
*  I always have the self-critical engine running.
*  Is it necessarily a bad thing?
*  It depends if it's affecting you negatively.
*  What is negative anyway?
*  Well, if it brings your frequency down
*  and you feel less joyful inside,
*  unless you don't feel like complete,
*  you feel less than, less worthy of something,
*  then you could call that bad
*  if you aspire to not feel that way.
*  Yeah, I aspire to not feel that way in the big picture,
*  but in the little picture,
*  like there's a little pain is good.
*  That's fair.
*  So confidence.
*  You seem like, in this performance, you seem confident.
*  You seem to be truly walking the bad motherfucker way of life.
*  I kind of, a word that I prefer over confidence is trust.
*  Because I think with confidence is almost like,
*  there's a belief assigned to it
*  that I am this thing that you believe in.
*  Whereas trust is just simply knowing
*  that you can get up there
*  and handle whatever is gonna come your way.
*  And it's more of an open feeling where it's like,
*  yeah, I could do this, sure.
*  But not like, I'm a bad motherfucker.
*  You know what I mean?
*  There's a huge difference.
*  Because I've shared the stage with people
*  who have a lot of confidence.
*  And it can be like a brick wall,
*  just like fear is a brick wall.
*  So the brick wall is a bad thing.
*  Like the thing you have with Jeff here on stage.
*  Is not a brick wall.
*  There's no wall, there's chemistry.
*  How can you explain that chemistry, the two you had?
*  Trust and lack of fear, yeah.
*  And also I will say that each individual
*  has developed likes and dislikes over their lifetime.
*  And that can be like, in this case,
*  we're just talking aesthetic likes and dislikes.
*  So in this particular case, obviously our likes and dislikes
*  are very much aligned such that the things I do
*  to compliment him, he enjoys and vice versa.
*  But it could be two very trusting, open musicians on stage
*  that don't have walls up, but their choices are
*  very different and one person likes heavy metal
*  and the other person likes classical.
*  So it's gotta be both.
*  So you guys were good at like, yes,
*  and-ing each other musically.
*  Definitely.
*  Is that where your most at peace in a meditative way
*  is on stage?
*  It used to be that it would only be on stage.
*  It started with that.
*  That was almost like my way in to flow state
*  and meditation was playing music.
*  And then back in the day when I kind of crashed after shows,
*  I wanted to change that.
*  I wanted to always feel like I'm in flow state.
*  So-
*  Have you succeeded?
*  I've gotten a lot better.
*  I'm still obviously on the journey, but yes.
*  So you meditate, I think you said somewhere
*  that you meditate before shows or just in general?
*  I meditate every day.
*  When I'm on tour with my band, I ask that we all meditate
*  together for at least 20 minutes.
*  And I don't dictate which type of meditation.
*  I don't put on a guided meditation
*  because everyone has their own thing they want to do.
*  Maybe someone might be praying in their head.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  It's just the idea that we all put our phones down
*  and we all are in one room connecting energetically,
*  spiritually, and just letting our lives go for a sec.
*  And then we walk straight on the stage
*  and it's always really connected.
*  And there were a couple of gigs
*  where we ran out of time for that.
*  And I could tell there was a major difference
*  in the performance.
*  So it both connects you and centers you,
*  all of those things.
*  Yeah, but then when I'm home,
*  I love to meditate and I've tried various styles
*  of meditation and studied various types of things.
*  So I don't do just one thing.
*  I kind of customize it depending on where I'm at in my life.
*  You and the world lost Jeff back a year ago.
*  You told me you really miss him.
*  How's the pain of losing Jeff change you?
*  How's the pain of losing Jeff change you?
*  Maybe deepen your sense of the world.
*  You know, it's hard to accept
*  that we won't create something musically again
*  in this lifetime.
*  But in terms of the grief,
*  grief was easier for me
*  because I went through a major grief period in 2016 and 17.
*  And that was the first time I'd really gone through
*  the process of grief
*  like in a non-family situation,
*  like with friends and mentors and people
*  that I'd created with, which is different.
*  It's a different kind of connection.
*  When my grandparents died,
*  it's like there was nothing left unsaid
*  and I was at peace with what was happening.
*  With this, when Prince died out of the blue
*  in mid 2016 and then Leonard Cohen died in November,
*  that just tore me to shreds
*  because Leonard Cohen was not just someone
*  that profoundly inspired me musically and lyrically,
*  but spiritually we had a very deep connection.
*  And that was the basis of a lot of our conversation
*  was spirituality.
*  And so at that time I felt like a piece of me went missing.
*  And that was a very long process
*  where I just stayed in my place
*  and didn't wanna play a note of music.
*  I kinda wanted to just get rid of all my stuff.
*  So I had a friend come over and he's like,
*  you should just, why don't you come to the comedy store?
*  I'm like, comedy store?
*  Like, what am I gonna go to some store and buy clown suits?
*  Like, what are you talking about?
*  What's a comedy store?
*  He's like, no, no, no, like the comedy store,
*  a place where comedians go,
*  I'm like, okay, well, I've never seen standup.
*  I've seen Seinfeld on TV,
*  that's like the extent of my standup experience.
*  So he took me to the comedy store
*  and every single one of those comedians embraced me
*  like I was family.
*  It didn't even take a day.
*  I was like part of the family
*  and I made like 25 best friends.
*  And I ended up throwing all my stuff in storage
*  and like finding a little room to stay in
*  where I rented my gear out.
*  And that was me paying,
*  my rent paying was me loaning the gear
*  because I didn't want any responsibilities financial.
*  I just wanted to be completely free
*  so that I could like just process it
*  and not feel like I had to commit to anything work-wise
*  or creatively, I just wanted to unplug.
*  So this was like a fun and very different way to unplug
*  because previously I may have just gone to a monastery
*  and spent weeks at a monastery or months.
*  But in this case, I was like, you know what?
*  This is a different kind of experience.
*  I'm gonna just hang out with comedians
*  and stay in this room.
*  With no responsibility really.
*  Yeah, other than to really deeply connect
*  with this grief that I'm experiencing.
*  I'm not going to negate it.
*  I'm gonna really fully connect to it.
*  And I did and it was tough.
*  And then more people in 2017 were leaving,
*  Greg Almond, Tom Petty.
*  I mean, it was like, these are people
*  that I worked with all these people
*  and like had great connections with them
*  and they were all going and the world was mourning
*  the loss of these people
*  because of everything that they'd given to the world.
*  They'd changed the world's lives,
*  not just mine because I knew them personally.
*  And so that was also complicated
*  and why for me it was interesting to be grieving
*  the loss of these musicians with comedians.
*  And I learned a lot.
*  It changed my life because I just learned to laugh
*  at absolutely anything, everything.
*  I mean, my grandpa had a really great sense of humor too.
*  My grandpa's a Holocaust survivor
*  and he could just laugh at anything.
*  And so I already kind of have that in me,
*  but being around all these comedians
*  just kind of exaggerated that for me
*  and that really changed things for me for the better.
*  So then when Jeff Beck died, it was like,
*  okay, I've got these tools.
*  I know what this is and I'm gonna go through it again
*  and I'm gonna be on tour with Incubus in two days.
*  Yeah.
*  And so Mike Durnt from Green Day, he called me up
*  and he said, hey, like I know you're going through a lot.
*  And I said, yeah, I don't even know what I'm gonna play.
*  Like I really want a vintage jazz bass for this.
*  And I only have a seventies one
*  that I don't really think is appropriate.
*  I really need a sixties one, blah, blah, blah.
*  And Mike's like, I'm gonna hook you up.
*  He showed up to my place the next day
*  with a truckload of old P-basses and jazz basses
*  and brought them all into my studio and I'm playing them.
*  And then I pulled one out of the case
*  and it's Olympic white, just like Jeff Beck.
*  And I play it and not only did I get goosebumps
*  and started crying, but I looked over at Mike
*  and same thing was happening.
*  And he's like, I guess Jeff might be happy about this.
*  And he's like, well, I didn't wanna let this one go.
*  I was just trying to cheer you up a bit
*  and maybe loan it to you for the tour,
*  but if you really want it, it's yours.
*  And I was like, oh my God, this is like,
*  like Mike Doent is the nicest guy ever.
*  So that happened.
*  So that bass's name is Jeff and it's a white jazz bass.
*  And I played it on the Incubus tour.
*  But yeah, I do feel like I'm more equipped
*  to handle grief now.
*  Tell me about the Comedy Store a little bit more.
*  Do you think comedians and musicians
*  in some deep fundamental way are made from the same cloth?
*  Like are they spiritually connected somehow?
*  I think everyone's connected spiritually in the same way.
*  So I think personality wise, comedians and musicians
*  are quite different actually.
*  In what way?
*  Well, you'd have to subdivide even musicians
*  into different categories too,
*  because the thing that I appreciate about comedians
*  is that you go to a restaurant with them
*  and like all the observational humor of like,
*  they'll notice everything and make you laugh about it,
*  which a really great songwriter does the same thing too.
*  And my favorite lyricists like Leonard Cohen,
*  Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Warren Zvon,
*  they add comedy into their lyric.
*  And like, so those types of people,
*  I would liken to hanging out with a comedian.
*  It's very different from like say somebody
*  that is an instrumental guitarist or something like that,
*  that they're more focused on,
*  whether it's like a kinesthetic thing
*  or like a physical thing or whatever it is,
*  they're not quite doing the observational thing
*  in the same way.
*  So I just appreciate like my favorite thing to do
*  is go out and laugh,
*  especially because like I can tend to be pretty analytical
*  and be in my head.
*  And so anything that just kind of lets me be in my heart
*  and just enjoy life.
*  I think there's a photo of you with Deshapelle on stage.
*  What was that about?
*  So right after Leonard Cohen passed away,
*  the Comedy Store threw me a birthday party.
*  It was this crazy lineup.
*  And like, it was like I'd play a song with my band
*  and then Jackson Brown sat in and like sung a song.
*  And then like Dave Chappelle came up and said some jokes.
*  It was like one of my favorite nights ever.
*  It was cool.
*  It was a very healing birthday party.
*  Yeah, there's something magical about that place.
*  It's really special.
*  Yeah, well, the mothership has some magic to it too.
*  It's really cool.
*  It's different, totally different vibe,
*  but like super awesome.
*  You said that Leonard Cohen is a song writing inspiration
*  of yours.
*  I saw you perform his song, Chelsea Hotel,
*  brilliantly on the internet.
*  It's about, for people who don't know,
*  his love affair with Janet Joplin.
*  How does that song make you feel?
*  Great, I love that song.
*  Which aspect?
*  Musically, the melancholy feeling, the hopeful feeling,
*  the cocky feeling, all of it.
*  Like every single line has a different feeling to it really.
*  Yeah, but as a whole piece, I appreciate it so much.
*  I actually lived at the Chelsea Hotel.
*  And when Leonard and I first met,
*  that was one of the first things we talked about was,
*  you know, I lived there where all that stuff went down
*  before they tore it apart.
*  And yeah, it's just a beautiful song.
*  You know, what makes me sad the way it ends,
*  I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best.
*  I can't keep track of each fallen robin.
*  I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, that's all.
*  I don't even think of you that often.
*  You know that line, I don't even think of you that often
*  always like breaks my heart for some reason.
*  Like how ephemeral, how short lasting,
*  like certain love affairs can be.
*  Just kind of like, huh.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think he meant it?
*  I always think he doesn't,
*  he's trying to convince himself of it.
*  It could be both or either, you know?
*  I mean, that's the beautiful thing about poetry and lyric
*  is that it's supposed to be open.
*  Yeah, I wonder if it's also open to him,
*  depending on the day, you know?
*  Definitely, I mean, the thing that he taught me
*  or his advice to me was when you're writing a song,
*  look at it the next morning,
*  like just first thing and read it,
*  and then take a walk, smoke a joint, read it again.
*  Go have a fight with your daughter.
*  Come back, read it again.
*  Get drunk, read it again.
*  Wait a week, read it again.
*  Just so that, you know, from every state and every position
*  that the wider the lens is gonna be
*  from an audience perspective,
*  you want things to mean multiple things.
*  So there's one line I read somewhere
*  that he regrets putting in the song.
*  So I've got to ask you about it, it's pretty edgy.
*  It's about giving me head on the unmade bed.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think that's a good line or bad line?
*  I think it's an amazing line.
*  That's one of the best lines in the song.
*  Yeah, right.
*  When he put that song out, obviously he didn't regret it
*  or he wouldn't have put that lyric in the song.
*  I think what happened was that eventually word got out
*  either from him or from somebody else
*  that the song was about Janis Joplin.
*  Yes.
*  And so at that point, he regretted the indiscretion.
*  So it wasn't that he regretted how great the line was.
*  It was just, you know, the privacy factor.
*  But then again, Leonard's known for rewriting his lyrics.
*  In his live shows, you'll see a bunch of songs
*  where it's like new lyrics.
*  And he didn't do it because he didn't like the old lyrics.
*  He just did it because he could, because he's Leonard.
*  And it's like, why not have fun with words
*  the way musicians have fun, you know,
*  improvising solos on stage.
*  And he could have changed that line in Chelsea Hotel
*  after in retrospect, and he never did.
*  I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel.
*  You were talking so brave and so sweet,
*  giving me head on the unmade bed
*  while the limousines wait in the street.
*  It's so powerful.
*  It's a powerful line.
*  It just kind of shocks you.
*  Well, that's what's so great about it.
*  Yeah.
*  But also heartbreaking because it doesn't last.
*  Especially actually to me, it adds more meaning
*  once you know it's Janis Joplin.
*  It's like, okay, these two stars kind of collided for a time.
*  Yeah.
*  But why is it heartbreaking?
*  It could also be just beautiful
*  that they had a little fling.
*  Yeah, everything's beautiful.
*  Thank you.
*  Even the dark stuff.
*  What's not beautiful?
*  Everything is beautiful
*  if you look long enough and deeply enough.
*  What were we saying?
*  Oh, what do you think about Hallelujah?
*  Like, what do you think about the different songs of his?
*  And why'd you choose Chelsea Hotel to perform?
*  Because I lived there and it was like,
*  it meant something to me to sing that song.
*  And actually when I put that song out on YouTube,
*  that's when he sent me an email.
*  He's like, hey, do you wanna come over?
*  So this is how you guys connected?
*  No, we met in a rehearsal studio.
*  I ended up watching their whole rehearsal
*  and sitting there next to Roshi,
*  his like 105 year old monk, which was really great.
*  I remember when I was like shaking his hand.
*  So I was like, it was just me and Roshi on the couch
*  watching Leonard with his band.
*  And we were shaking hands and he grips my hand like this,
*  so it doesn't let it go.
*  And he said, he looked at my eyes and he said, where are you?
*  And I said, in the handshake.
*  Yes.
*  Wow, you passed the test.
*  Passed the Roshi test.
*  And then what's funny was that the next thing
*  that happened about five minutes later
*  was Leonard Cohen got down on his knees
*  and opened up a jar, I'm not kidding you, of caviar.
*  This is not a callback.
*  Well, it is in a way, in a deep fundamental way.
*  He started feeding the monk caviar.
*  Yeah.
*  And that healed my Montreux Jazz Festival sadness forever.
*  The end.
*  Do you think there's a kind of like weird,
*  like there's a sense of humor to it all somehow?
*  Like, why does that happen?
*  Why does that happen?
*  Why stuff like that happens?
*  Or that the Jeff bass speaks to you?
*  Why do we need to know?
*  You believe in that stuff?
*  In what stuff?
*  That there is a rhyme to the whole thing somehow?
*  Like, there's a frequency to which
*  magical things of that nature can happen.
*  I'm divided about that answer
*  because I think just things are flowing.
*  I don't think anything's kind of like planned out.
*  Like through time, it's like an orchestra playing
*  of different experiences and circumstances
*  that are somehow connected.
*  I think everything's connected, so yes.
*  But predetermined means like-
*  I don't believe in the predetermined stuff necessarily,
*  which is different from whatever your previous comma is.
*  And comma is a whole other kind of conversation.
*  I don't mean comma as in like good comma, bad comma,
*  just comma meaning the collection of things
*  you've acquired over this lifetime or other lifetimes.
*  Just whatever that is is going to influence your future.
*  Well, you had a really interesting trajectory through life.
*  Maybe I just read it that way
*  because I've had a lot of stuff happen to me
*  that's like lucky, feels lucky.
*  And sometimes I wonder like, huh?
*  This is weird.
*  It does feel like the universe
*  just kind of throws stuff at you with a chuckle.
*  I don't know, not you, the proverbial you, one.
*  Yeah.
*  You said you sometimes watch classic movies
*  to inspire your songwriting,
*  and you mentioned watching Taxi Driver.
*  I love that movie.
*  And I think you mentioned that you wrote a love song
*  based on that movie.
*  So Travis Bickle, for people who don't know,
*  is a taxi driver and he's deeply lonely.
*  What do you think about that kind of loneliness?
*  I think that loneliness is a product
*  of feeling separate from the world
*  and separate from others.
*  And that the less you experience that separation,
*  the less you'll feel lonely.
*  How often have you felt lonely in this way,
*  separated from the rest of the world?
*  It's less and less every single year
*  because I work very hard at it.
*  Feeling a part of the world?
*  Yeah, just meditating and studying scriptures.
*  Don't you think that, I mean,
*  isn't there a fundamental loneliness
*  to the human experience?
*  Just- In what sense?
*  That all the struggles, all the suffering you experience
*  is really experienced by you alone?
*  Is it?
*  Maybe at the very bottom it's not.
*  It's kind of all the same stuff.
*  You didn't feel alone in 2016, 2017?
*  I felt like I lost a piece of myself
*  that I had given to somebody else.
*  And I feel like people feel that in romantic exchanges,
*  whether it's long-term, short-term.
*  You give a piece of yourself,
*  and then if that person dies
*  or you break up with that person,
*  you feel like you've lost that piece of yourself,
*  which I feel like is very different experience
*  than if you just are opening yourself
*  rather than giving a piece of yourself.
*  You're just opening yourself to somebody or something.
*  So opening is fundamentally not a lonely experience.
*  Mm-mm, no, it's a loving experience.
*  And then losing a piece of yourself can be.
*  Yeah, because you can't lose a piece of yourself
*  if you are the same self as every other self.
*  Right, right, so if you see yourself
*  together with everybody, then there's no losing.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, it's a beautiful way to look at it.
*  You said that there's something healing
*  about being in an empty hotel room
*  with no attachments except your suitcase.
*  You know, a lot of people will talk about hotel rooms
*  being a fundamentally lonely experience,
*  but you're saying it's healing.
*  Yeah, because I just get to sit there
*  and not worry about all this stuff,
*  like these meaningless attachments.
*  I've got my suitcase with my necessities,
*  or my three suitcases sometimes.
*  And I can just sit there and meditate
*  and just be with myself, and it's so awesome.
*  And usually you plan your touring for,
*  you kind of get the business aspect
*  of things taken care of in advance
*  so you can kind of just really be flowing day to day
*  on a tour, and it's a great feeling.
*  It's funny because this last tour that I did,
*  we didn't have hotels every night.
*  We had hotels maybe like once a week,
*  and I hadn't done that before.
*  Usually I'm frequently in hotels,
*  so I didn't get that space that I'm really used to getting.
*  You missed them.
*  I very much missed it and had to be very creative.
*  And I ended up like going into the back lounge
*  when everyone was asleep and meditating back there,
*  or before everyone woke up.
*  And I actually joined,
*  there was an online meditation retreat that was happening.
*  It was 12 hours a day of silent meditations
*  that happens once a year,
*  and I love this particular group of people.
*  And they knew I was on tour,
*  so they're like, just join when you can.
*  And so I was on the tour doing the meditation retreat
*  at the same time.
*  It was so fun.
*  It was so fun because I was in the back lounge,
*  the bus is moving around like this,
*  my laptop, the Zoom is like,
*  shh, shh, and I'm just sitting meditating.
*  It was like, yeah, this is the shit.
*  It's silent.
*  So they're all connected through Zoom
*  and just doing 12 hours a day?
*  Yeah.
*  That's cool.
*  These particular retreats that I started doing,
*  it's not straight silent.
*  There are, you know, silent sits every hour for 50 minutes,
*  and then there's some talks.
*  And these people that I've been working with
*  are really cool because they're integrating
*  spiral dynamics into Zen,
*  and it's like the coolest combination.
*  What's spiral dynamics?
*  Oh, like Ken Wilber, do you know Ken Wilber?
*  Integral theory.
*  Yes, can you explain a little bit?
*  So I vaguely know of him because of this notion that
*  everything is one, like everything is integrated,
*  that every field has truths and falsehoods
*  and we should integrate the truths.
*  Yeah.
*  It's hard to explain how it applies
*  to this type of meditation
*  because it's in the guided parts of the meditation
*  that this whole like holonic theory is like brought in
*  about transcending and including
*  every aspect of your being.
*  Because he talks about levels of development
*  and in consciousness and how this applies
*  to every single religion or non-religion
*  that there are these levels of development
*  and that go all the way up to enlightenment.
*  No matter what you start off with,
*  it could be Christianity, Buddhism, Vedanta,
*  doesn't matter, like anything.
*  Then I just like it when everything is,
*  and everyone is taken into account.
*  It doesn't matter where you're coming from,
*  that there is a way to be self-realized, self-actualized.
*  There are self-actualized beings from all walks of life
*  with very, very different paths.
*  There's no one path.
*  I mean, in this particular retreat I do,
*  there's like a lot of silences
*  and then there's some guided meditations.
*  But I've tried a lot of different avenues
*  and they're all great.
*  So I wouldn't just say, just try this one thing.
*  I've studied the Upanishads with Vedanta teachers
*  and gone through those texts for months and months
*  and stayed at monasteries and how they break it down
*  makes total sense to my mind and heart.
*  And more importantly than my mind, my inner knowing,
*  it resonates.
*  Inner knowing.
*  Yeah, because like your mind is like the thinking tool.
*  Like it's not you, you're not your mind.
*  You're not your thoughts, you're not your body.
*  So it's like just the you.
*  Like that knowing that you have,
*  that's kind of when something resonates there,
*  that's usually when you go with something.
*  What is living in a monastery like?
*  It's the best.
*  What are we talking about?
*  It's just an empty room with like a tiny single bed
*  and a sheet and a pillow and that's it.
*  That's it.
*  You have to eat the same thing as everyone.
*  What's the food like?
*  What is it?
*  Very plain, cheap, basic food.
*  Which is funny for someone like me
*  because I'm pretty particular about my diet.
*  You brought over like 20 different ingredients.
*  Yeah.
*  So what was the like day in the life of Tal
*  at a monastery?
*  You wake up at 5 a.m. to the bell
*  and you go and meditate like constantly
*  till bedtime other than two meals.
*  How are you sitting?
*  Are you in a group?
*  Is there other people there?
*  And you're just sitting there?
*  Well, if you're talking about the Zen monastery,
*  because I stayed in the Zen monastery
*  and I did a thing with that.
*  The guy was telling you about that kind of
*  the integral Zen thing where he uses Ken Wilbur's work
*  in combination with Zen.
*  That's a little bit different because he does talks.
*  We talk about things.
*  And that's very separate from the monastery,
*  like the Vedanta monasteries I've stayed at,
*  which there's very little meditation
*  in terms of sitting silently.
*  Instead, we are meditating on the scriptures
*  like the Upanishads and we're like diving into that.
*  What were the differences that take us
*  from the experiences?
*  The two different, the integral one
*  and the meditating on the scriptures.
*  They're both incredibly, have been incredibly helpful to me
*  because the Vedanta, anytime I go into my head
*  about something, the answer is there
*  based on this knowledge.
*  And with the Zen monastery, it's like,
*  you just gotta put your butt in the seat
*  and sit and wait and maybe something will happen.
*  Maybe it won't, but just keep sitting
*  and it's very disciplined and you go through a lot.
*  Your body's purging a lot.
*  There's a lot and you don't necessarily have the answers
*  as to what is happening.
*  And so I think for somebody like me, I need both.
*  I need to be in a place where there's complete uncertainty
*  but complete discipline and just doing the regimented thing.
*  And then there's the me that feels very satisfied
*  from an analytical standpoint,
*  understanding what's happening,
*  like what is the gross and the subtle body?
*  And I wanna understand these things
*  about what it is to be a human.
*  So I like them both.
*  Understand what it means to be a human.
*  So having that patience and just sitting with yourself
*  helps you do that?
*  Yes, more so like the analysis part.
*  Oh, so the analysis, the actual, okay, got it.
*  But sitting with yourself, there's no better education.
*  Of like facing every demon and it's all gonna come out
*  and it's not gonna be pretty.
*  But then there's things that happen on the other side of it
*  that are so profound.
*  Have you met most of your demons?
*  I've met the demons that have come out.
*  Oh, there might be more.
*  Who knows, yeah.
*  Okay, well, to be continued.
*  Since I think I heard you say
*  that you wrote a love song after Taxi Driver,
*  what kind of love songs do you write more of?
*  Broken, so you're a songwriter first for people who don't know.
*  They might think you're primarily a bassist,
*  but you're- But they're wrong.
*  So do you write mostly broken heart ones
*  or like hopeful love songs, in love songs,
*  about to be in love songs, soon to fall in love songs?
*  Well, the last album I put out is pretty self explanatory
*  as to what that is.
*  A lot of pain though?
*  There was, yeah.
*  Some of it was storytelling
*  and some of it was real experience
*  and it's always like a combination of things.
*  I serve the song.
*  So sometimes you use your own life experience
*  to tell a song and sometimes you may watch a movie
*  and a lot of that script merges with your own experience
*  and that tells the right story
*  for the point you're trying to make in the song.
*  So it varies from song to song,
*  in terms of what a biographical it is.
*  Yeah, I was at the end of Taxi Driver when,
*  what's her name, Betsy?
*  Because Travis becomes a hero,
*  she tries to get with him and he rejects her.
*  Also, that was powerful.
*  My favorite love songs are the ones
*  where you're not sure it's about romantic love
*  or love of God or love of life or just pure, just love.
*  Like I was thinking like George Harrison writes songs
*  like that, like What is Life?
*  Or like Bob Dylan's song that George Harrison covered,
*  If Not For You.
*  Yeah, it's just grateful, grateful for his love.
*  Right, right, that's kind of like where,
*  well what I'm experiencing now
*  and so who knows what'll end up coming out but.
*  Do you've been writing this kind of?
*  Yeah, I've been writing.
*  A little bit?
*  I don't have like an intention of like
*  putting something out in any particular timeframe
*  but I'm just writing and letting things flow.
*  And yeah, there's like a bunch of like Leonard Cohen songs
*  to where you're like there's so many ways
*  to interpret this song and there's so many ways.
*  I just love songs that aren't like so,
*  like specifically about one thing.
*  You know, I really love the song to play it,
*  to listen to Wonderful Tonight by Eric Clapton
*  and I thought it was pretty straightforward.
*  And then I had a conversation with Eric Weinstein
*  who's a mutual friend of ours and he told me
*  it's not about what I thought it's about.
*  Oh yeah, what did he say?
*  It's a more complicated story.
*  It's actually a man, so Wonderful Tonight
*  is a story about a man being just finding his wife
*  beautiful and appreciating it throughout.
*  But he said it was actually a man missing his wife.
*  He's imagining that she's lost because of the decisions
*  he's made in his life.
*  So it's pain.
*  He had a long, beautiful Eric Weinstein-like explanation
*  of why.
*  I love this.
*  Have you and Eric played music?
*  No, we just hung out and had very long conversations
*  about everything.
*  He's a bit of a musician, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, you picked up the guitar when you were 14.
*  Let's go back.
*  And one interesting thing that just jumped out at me
*  is you said you learned how to practice in your head
*  because you only had 30 minutes.
*  Your parents would only let you practice for 30 minutes.
*  I read somewhere that Coltrane did the same.
*  He was not the practice part,
*  but he was able to play instruments in his head
*  as a way to think through different lines,
*  different musical thoughts, that kind of stuff.
*  I just, maybe can you tell the story of that?
*  Yeah, I just grew up in an environment
*  that was focused on academia.
*  I fell in love with guitar
*  and really just wanted the focus to be that.
*  My limit was 30 minutes a day for,
*  I don't even remember how many times a week,
*  might've been every day or five days a week, whatever.
*  So your parents didn't want you to play more than that?
*  No.
*  I just learned how to visualize the fretboard in my head
*  and I'd practice all day in my head.
*  It's kind of like the Queen's Gambit, the TV show,
*  with Anya Taylor-Joy and she just like,
*  she's it on the ceiling.
*  I used to do that with the fretboard.
*  Yeah, just practice.
*  And I actually recommend it to every musician
*  because if you're just practicing here,
*  you don't know what is more dominant necessarily.
*  Is it this or is it your motor skills?
*  If you just take that away and do it here,
*  you know you've got it.
*  So I'm glad that that happened
*  and that I learned how to do that.
*  And in terms of learning fast,
*  because I had to learn how to,
*  well, I had to try to absorb a lot of information
*  in a short amount of time when I did have the instrument.
*  I kind of would do things in bursts,
*  even in that half an hour,
*  I would just go play for a couple of minutes
*  and then I'd stop for a minute.
*  And then I'd do it again.
*  And I noticed there was like a huge difference
*  between the first time and the second time.
*  Whereas if I just kept repeating stuff,
*  it would be like much slower.
*  Well, what did you do in that minute?
*  Just hang out.
*  Just integrate?
*  Yeah, it's like my brain was telling me like,
*  just chill out for a sec, that's enough information.
*  Let me take a second to integrate that.
*  That's at least what it felt like to me.
*  And the most hilarious thing happened
*  a couple months ago,
*  I know you're friends with Andrew Huberman.
*  So he put out some clip,
*  which was a part of one of his podcasts about learning.
*  And he said that there was some research done
*  on learning fast and that if you practice something
*  for a minute or so,
*  and then you let your brain rest for 30 seconds or a minute,
*  that in that 30 seconds or a minute,
*  your brain does the repetition 20 to 30 times faster
*  and in reverse.
*  And I was like, whoa, that's so cool.
*  Cause that's what I used to do when I was a kid.
*  Like now there's science that proves that,
*  which is really cool for musicians to know
*  that that's a good way to practice efficiently.
*  Cause you know, like some musicians,
*  they're like practicing for six, seven, eight hours a day.
*  I've never done that.
*  I've never practiced more than an hour a day, even now.
*  Like I've just, just that's my technique and it works.
*  Are you also practicing in your head sometimes?
*  Now I'm not practicing as much.
*  I'm more always writing songs in my head.
*  So that's why I like silence.
*  That's why I love being in the empty hotel room
*  and being alone or, you know,
*  songs come to me while I'm showering
*  or walking around doing the dishes or occasionally
*  when I'm hanging out with friends or like comedians
*  and people just like say shit and I'll be like,
*  that's cool line.
*  I'm just like jot it down on my phone.
*  So it's not always musical, it's sometimes lyrical.
*  It's more lyrical than musical now.
*  Because it's like, for me it's like,
*  there's so much music in the world.
*  If I'm going to write a song,
*  I want the song to be about something interesting.
*  And so yeah, the words matter to me.
*  Yeah, and the right work and it has so much power.
*  It's crazy.
*  Like we said, with Leonard Cohen,
*  and then they're often simple.
*  The really powerful ones are simple.
*  And like when you mentioned Hallelujah,
*  you know he wrote like 80 verses to Hallelujah
*  before he narrowed it down to like four.
*  And it took him like 15, 20 years to write that song.
*  So some writers will do that.
*  And then other writers just vomit it out
*  and it's beautiful.
*  Like I've heard that Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell,
*  they're fast writers, they just kind of comes out.
*  That makes me feel so good to know
*  Leonard Cohen wrote so many verses of that.
*  Like that was so deliberately crafted.
*  Extensively, rigorously crafted.
*  He just would spend months and years
*  and constantly refining and refining.
*  Do you have songs like that for yourself?
*  Or you've been refining for many years?
*  It's song dependent.
*  Some just flow out and it's like, oh, there it is.
*  Everything's there.
*  And then other songs, it's like,
*  you might have started it with music
*  and there's some words that come out
*  and then trying to fill in the rest of the words.
*  Sometimes it can be like a square peg and a round hole.
*  And other times it's like, oh no, I can, you know,
*  it depends.
*  Sometimes it becomes like a math problem
*  and hopefully it doesn't.
*  Because you just wanna say what's right for the song.
*  And usually when you write it all together,
*  like the lyric and the melody and the chords
*  and everything's kind of developing at once,
*  at least for the first draft, that's very, very helpful.
*  Like Sondheim used to write like that.
*  Just like he wouldn't move on until,
*  like he would just go this way.
*  Whereas for me, it's just like,
*  I'll just go with what seems to be coming naturally
*  and I'll just let it be what it is.
*  And then you come back and you say,
*  okay, well, what do I have to do to this now?
*  Well, like what's needed?
*  Just to linger on the learning process.
*  What would you recommend for young musicians
*  and how to get good?
*  What are the different paths a person can take
*  to understand it deeply enough to create something special?
*  I think first and foremost,
*  understanding why you are playing music
*  because you have something that you're trying to express
*  or that you're just in love with expression itself,
*  with art itself.
*  Those are great reasons to start this journey.
*  The why should be-
*  I think the why is really important
*  because it's a jagged lifestyle and there's a lot in it.
*  And so if you don't have your purpose,
*  if you're not centered in your purpose,
*  then all that jagged lifestyle
*  is probably gonna get to you.
*  Jagged?
*  It's jagged.
*  Yeah, it's jagged.
*  It's all over the place.
*  It's uncertain.
*  It's one thing, one moment,
*  and a completely different thing another moment.
*  You never know what's gonna happen.
*  And if you thrive on variety, which I love variety,
*  then it's perfect.
*  But also every human being needs
*  a certain amount of certainty and structure.
*  And so the certainty can come from your inner knowing,
*  knowing that you're doing exactly what you want to be doing
*  and knowing what your purpose is in doing it,
*  in this expression.
*  Otherwise you're just kind of like a leaf blowing in the wind.
*  Like in the early days touring,
*  just playing club seems like tough.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a lot.
*  Yeah, it's a lot of like the physical labor aspect
*  of it is really hard.
*  Playing on stage to two people or 2,000 or 20,000,
*  that doesn't make a difference.
*  I mean, it makes a difference to the ticket sales,
*  which informs how, what level of luxury
*  you might have on the road or not.
*  But other than that,
*  it's just people there listening to music.
*  The music doesn't change.
*  Does it make it tough for one's two people versus 200?
*  No.
*  So even if nobody recognizes whatever the thing you're doing.
*  No, because the idea is to be doing,
*  like having a great conversation on stage.
*  The audience can come and go?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I always like,
*  like there's certain points in shows where I'm just like,
*  I consciously am like,
*  oh, yes, there's an audience over there.
*  Cause I'm so like wrapped up
*  in whatever's happening on stage.
*  You forget yourself.
*  Well, maybe I'm remembering myself.
*  Oh, damn.
*  Callback somehow feels like one.
*  Okay.
*  You think every instrument is its own journey?
*  Is you play guitar, you play bass, you sing.
*  Just the mastery of an instrument,
*  or let's avoid the word mastery,
*  the understanding of an instrument is its own thing,
*  or are they somehow like
*  physical manifestations of the same thing?
*  Both.
*  You know, like every instrument has its strengths
*  beauty limitations, range,
*  like possible range that can, you know,
*  be extended to some degree or another,
*  depending on who you are,
*  like trumpet or something, you know,
*  like certain people can hit higher notes than others,
*  blah, blah, blah.
*  But that being said,
*  we're all playing the same 12 or 24,
*  however you divide the octave, that many notes,
*  you know, we're all playing the same notes.
*  So in that sense, it's all the same thing.
*  It's just music or better yet,
*  it's just art or expression.
*  But yeah, every instrument has, you know,
*  you got to go through the physical,
*  the physical aspects of it,
*  the motor skills and all of that.
*  And hopefully you get through that really quickly
*  so you can get to the expression quickly.
*  Cause if you get stuck in just that first phase,
*  that'd be really boring.
*  Yeah, but that's a pretty long phase,
*  the technical skill required to really play an instrument.
*  For some people it's a long thing
*  and some people it's short.
*  It very, very much varies.
*  It might have to do with like how you learn
*  and getting to know like your strengths in learning,
*  like more oral or more like, is it more like,
*  what's your strength?
*  And playing off of those strengths.
*  So for me, like it was, like I was saying earlier,
*  it was just an intuitive thing that I knew,
*  I can feel when my brain is full,
*  like that it needs processing time.
*  And so I listened to that, I don't push past it.
*  Even if it's like one minute and I do something,
*  I'm like, okay, silence.
*  And then I come back and I trust
*  that it's gonna be there and is there.
*  So just trusting yourself, I think is really important.
*  Trusting that you know you better
*  than anybody else is gonna know you.
*  So that's the kind of thing with teachers
*  that can be either really, really helpful and great
*  or really not great.
*  Like I'm primarily self-taught.
*  I've had amazing mentors of all walks of life.
*  And I think I'm unbelievably blessed
*  that my mentors are some of my favorite musicians on earth,
*  whether it's Leonard Cohen or Jeff Beck or Wayne Shorter,
*  whoever these people are,
*  like they are my favorite musicians.
*  So not everyone has that opportunity,
*  but the opportunity that we have now
*  that I didn't have when I was starting
*  is that everything's on YouTube.
*  Like every interview with every genius,
*  like you don't need to necessarily
*  have these people in person now.
*  I mean, and then I'll say to that, yes and no.
*  I agree with myself and then I don't agree with myself.
*  And the reason is I do believe
*  that there is something that happens
*  when you're in person with a master.
*  In some cases that there is something transferred
*  that is not intellectual, it's not spoken,
*  it's something else that happens, that can happen.
*  That I've experienced and I really value that.
*  And I think that applies to specific disciplines
*  and also generally.
*  Like I've been around Olympic gold medalists
*  just to hang out with them for several days.
*  And there's something about greatness.
*  There's a way about them
*  that kind of permeates the space around them.
*  You kind of learn something from it.
*  Even if you don't practice that particular discipline.
*  If you're able to see it.
*  I also like what you said about the playing stuff
*  in your head.
*  That it forces you to not be lost
*  in the physical learning of the instrument.
*  I think that's one of the things I probably regret
*  a little bit.
*  So I play both piano and guitar
*  and I've become quite over the years,
*  technically proficient at the instruments.
*  But I think my mind is underdeveloped because of that.
*  Meaning I can't really...
*  I can feel the music when it's created,
*  but I can't create out of the feeling.
*  I haven't practiced projecting the feeling onto the music.
*  I'm not like a musician.
*  It's a different muscle.
*  If you really want to create beautiful things,
*  the creation happens here, not with your hands.
*  I think it's more here.
*  Or whichever.
*  It's some part of the body, but it's not with your fingers.
*  Yeah, because I think the fingers is more this.
*  Sure.
*  And then...
*  Yes, it is here.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's just nice that you said that
*  because it's really good advice if you want to create.
*  Yeah, slowing down is really great too.
*  What do you mean slowing down?
*  Slowing everything down.
*  It could be, you know,
*  I can play something really fast,
*  but I may want to like practice it.
*  Yeah.
*  Like...
*  Go slow as possible.
*  Because there's all these micro movements
*  and that are happening that if you just go...
*  Like you can't pay as close attention to the exact tone
*  that you're pulling from each note.
*  And there's a lot to pay attention to
*  how my fingers are touching the string here.
*  Like I can change my tone a million ways
*  just by the direction of this finger.
*  And same with how this lands
*  and how hard I'm attacking the string.
*  And with what intention am I hitting the string?
*  Emotionally, physically.
*  And so even if you can go...
*  Play that so slow.
*  See how locked into a pocket you can be.
*  See how you like feel every aspect of that.
*  Because then when it gets sped up,
*  it's still there with you.
*  Yeah.
*  That's brilliant.
*  It's kind of like the transcended and included thing
*  that Ken Wilber talks about.
*  It's like...
*  And I guess that's what meditation can do for you
*  is to really listen to you,
*  like observe every aspect of your body,
*  the breath and all this.
*  Here you're observing every element,
*  like every super detailed element of playing a single note.
*  Yeah.
*  It's cool that if you speed it up,
*  it's still there with you.
*  It is.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Because I know that I'm not the only one
*  because I hear...
*  There are certain people, it's like they play really fast,
*  but I don't hear the fullness of tone always.
*  And it's like, well, it's probably because maybe they didn't...
*  Maybe it's because they didn't slow it down
*  and really sit with each note
*  and let it like resonate through their whole being.
*  It's spiritual.
*  It's like a spiritual expression.
*  It's not just like, you know...
*  It's not a sport.
*  A lot of people treat music like a sport.
*  Yeah.
*  Since starting to learn more,
*  like Steve Avery Vaughan versus Jimi Hendrix,
*  I would spend quite a long time on single notes
*  or just bending, just like, just listening
*  to what you can do with bends, spending.
*  Just thinking like people like BB King
*  and all these blues musicians,
*  like spend a career just making a single note cry.
*  Yeah.
*  There's like an art form to that.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think you putting it like, taking it really slow,
*  which I never really thought of,
*  is a really good idea.
*  Like really slow it down.
*  That's the same with like sitting with your own emotions.
*  It's like we, when emotions are overwhelming to us,
*  we get real busy or we move real fast
*  because it's like we don't wanna feel our feelings.
*  And those are the moments to slow yourself down.
*  And observe it, anger, jealousy.
*  And just be with it.
*  Yeah, just be with it.
*  Be like, be cool with it.
*  Like love it.
*  Love the anger.
*  It's all beautiful.
*  Can you educate me on the difference between bass?
*  Bass and bass?
*  Okay, well one is a fish.
*  At least I pronounced it correctly.
*  That's good.
*  It's all about the bass.
*  Can you pronounce my name?
*  Tal.
*  Wow.
*  Most people say tal.
*  Tal.
*  Or tall.
*  Tall, who says tall?
*  Like so many people.
*  In the south maybe.
*  I don't know, but the fact that you use my name right,
*  you get extra points.
*  Tall, I didn't know it was a game.
*  Am I winning?
*  Yep.
*  I like winning.
*  How do you play the bass?
*  What's the difference between fingerstyle and slap?
*  Slap is like this, fingerstyle is like this.
*  You ever play bass with a pick?
*  Yeah, sometimes.
*  I'm not accusing you of anything.
*  No accusation taken?
*  I don't know if these are sensitive topics.
*  That would be pretty hilarious if I was sensitive
*  about bass techniques, but not about love.
*  It just looks so cool to slap it,
*  and I don't understand what that's about.
*  Like that thumb thing.
*  Yeah, I slap less, a lot less, almost never actually.
*  It has a very distinctive sound
*  and does a very distinctive thing to a song
*  that is not something I hear needed very often
*  in music today.
*  But in certain styles, like funk,
*  it sounds awesome and it makes sense.
*  It was something that was a bit overused at one point.
*  For instance, like my mentor, Anthony Jackson,
*  he refused to slap.
*  He actually said, if you want me to slap,
*  I'll leave this gig.
*  So I'm not like that.
*  See, that's why I said sensitive.
*  See, I was reading into it.
*  Because he's sensitive about it.
*  I was feeling the spiritual energy
*  of the sensitivity of the topic.
*  Anthony Jackson.
*  And then, I mean, I'm playing electric bass,
*  so generally speaking, you don't particularly
*  want to hear electric bass on straight ahead jazz anyway.
*  You want to hear an upright bass.
*  But if I was to play jazz on electric bass,
*  I might even kind of sound like palm mute.
*  Instead of going like,
*  I might go to very.
*  Anything to kind of make the notes shorter
*  and less resonant and kind of fade away quick.
*  Because the upright does that naturally.
*  And I have a different bass, a hollow body harmony
*  that sounds closer to an upright that I'll use.
*  On my song, Under the Sun, that I put out,
*  that was on a harmony bass.
*  And it has kind of an upright acoustic kind of tone to it,
*  but with more sustain.
*  And is jazz fusion the style where you have
*  like an electric bass?
*  Can you educate me what jazz fusion is?
*  Again, you can have both.
*  You can have both on.
*  You can have either on anything.
*  There's no real rules now.
*  I've heard you say something interesting,
*  which is, well, a lot of things you say is interesting.
*  Just one thing.
*  Just one.
*  And it's what time you're leaving.
*  What time was that again?
*  Three minutes.
*  That it's maybe easier sometimes to define a musical genre
*  by the don'ts than the dos.
*  The don'ts than the dos.
*  What are the don'ts of jazz and rock?
*  What are the don'ts of jazz fusion?
*  What are the don'ts?
*  In any domain of life, what are the don'ts?
*  The don'ts is just to please leave your fear at the door.
*  And the dos is to be open to anything
*  and open your ears, like respond to what's happening now.
*  I think that quote you're talking about
*  might have been more about
*  an individual musician's unique sound
*  because everyone has their sound.
*  If they've developed their voice
*  and they've listened to their own aesthetic preferences,
*  of which everyone is slightly different,
*  everyone has slightly different likes and dislikes,
*  then you'll have a unique sound on your instrument
*  and your unique sound is defined more by the choices you make
*  rather than, I mean, it's equally as defined
*  by the choices you make and the choices you don't make.
*  I mean, it's the flip side of the same coin, really.
*  There's certain musicians you can just tell it's them.
*  Just you hear a few notes and you're like,
*  okay, it's them.
*  Tone, sometimes it's tone,
*  sometimes it's the way they play a rhythm.
*  Yeah, that quote you're talking about
*  might have even had to do with someone's real limitations
*  on an instrument that then that would define their sound
*  as the things that they can't, like actually can't do
*  versus what you're choosing to do
*  versus not choosing to do,
*  which is that flip side of the same coin thing.
*  How many fingers you play with?
*  It seems like a lot of the greatest musicians
*  aren't technically like perfect.
*  The imperfections is the thing that makes them unique
*  and where a lot of the creativity comes from.
*  I mean, Hendrix, Hendrix had a lot of those things.
*  The way he put like a thumb over the top.
*  Well, his hands were huge.
*  There was no other place for the thumb to go.
*  And it was great that he could reach the E string
*  and that was an advantage.
*  And he was a lefty playing a right and a guitar.
*  Flipped, I guess.
*  That's weird.
*  That probably doesn't have much of an effect,
*  maybe a spiritual one, I don't know.
*  Actually flipping a guitar is different.
*  It does bring out something different in you
*  because I've done it like flipped in,
*  it's like, oh wow, yeah, it's really different.
*  I remember talking to my osteopath about like,
*  because there's so much weight on this shoulder
*  while I'm playing all the time.
*  And they were saying like, well, just after shows,
*  just literally just turn it upside down
*  and do the exact same thing in the opposite way.
*  It'll like even out your body.
*  And I was like, it's good advice.
*  Have you actually tried it?
*  Mm-hmm. Okay, all right.
*  I'll write that down.
*  All right, well, do you know a guy named Davey504?
*  I've heard of him.
*  I recently learned of him.
*  He's a YouTuber and a bass player.
*  He's amazing.
*  He combines memes and also just
*  these brilliant bass compositions
*  and says slap like a lot.
*  He's big into slapping.
*  That's how, he's the one that kind of,
*  you realize this is a thing.
*  Okay, and he also said that you're one of the best,
*  not the best bassists in the world.
*  There was a bunch of his fans that wrote in
*  and he analyzed the Jeff Beck thing
*  that we watched at Crossroads.
*  He's one of the greatest solos ever,
*  bass solos ever, so shout out to him.
*  What does that make you feel like?
*  You're the greatest of all time.
*  Chocolate cookies.
*  Chocolate, is that your favorite?
*  I like macadamia nut,
*  like if you really want to get into it
*  with like white chocolate.
*  Yeah, that's a rare one for people to say is the favorite.
*  Chocolate chip is just like easy.
*  You can kind of get them anywhere.
*  Yeah, last thing you want to be is easy.
*  In this world, you don't want to be easy.
*  You said that I love rock and roll, quote,
*  I love folk, I love jazz, I love Indian classical music.
*  I really love all kinds of music
*  as long as it's authentic and from the heart.
*  So when you play rock versus jazz,
*  you played all kinds of music.
*  What's the difference technically, musically,
*  spiritually for you?
*  Well, there's no spiritual difference.
*  Okay, cross that off the list.
*  But, well, musically, yeah,
*  it's kind of like what we were saying earlier.
*  It's like each genre has its language
*  of what makes it that genre.
*  And that would be a good thing to say it's defined
*  by the dos and don'ts because yeah, it's like,
*  I'm trying to think, basically I put the song first
*  and I think of the song as the melody, the lyrics,
*  and then the harmony and obviously the groove.
*  So the song goes before the genre in a sense.
*  Each song is like its own thing.
*  They're both things that are held in my mind.
*  It's like, okay, genre and then song,
*  which is comprised of those basic elements.
*  And I tend to kind of prioritize lyric
*  because somebody is trying to express something over music.
*  And so the lyric is very, very important.
*  And so then the choices come from there.
*  It's like, okay, within the genre of X,
*  this is the typical language.
*  And then how do I best serve this lyric?
*  And then where else can I pull from
*  that might not be in these two bags
*  that would put a little twist on it?
*  So those are all the kinds of things
*  that I might be thinking about.
*  But I don't like twists for the sake of twists either.
*  I like twists because I wanna hear something
*  that might be fresh.
*  But when someone does something just to be hip,
*  it's annoying to me.
*  I think you can hear the difference.
*  It's like when people like, they write in odd time signatures
*  or like they write all these riffs just because they can,
*  just because they have the chops to do it
*  or they know how to play in 1116 and whatever.
*  But it's like, but if it's not actually creating
*  a piece of music that's going to move somebody,
*  then why are you doing it?
*  And so I think a lot of the questions I'm asking myself
*  when I'm approaching a song are mainly philosophical
*  and aesthetic.
*  So you like to stand on the edge of the cliff,
*  not for the thrill of it,
*  but because that's where you find something new, potentially.
*  Yeah, and it's thrilling.
*  But you're not doing it just for the thrill.
*  I'm not doing it for the thrill.
*  It just happens to be thrilling.
*  All right.
*  Because you can always reel it back in.
*  Can you though?
*  Yeah, you can.
*  You can like do a totally like disciplined,
*  like I can go into a session and okay,
*  my favorite thing about going into a session
*  with musicians that I adore is that we don't hear the demo
*  because if you hear a demo,
*  you're hearing what the producer or songwriter
*  have already imagined that every instrument is playing.
*  And then it's like, well, I've already heard what you want.
*  Now my mind is part of my mind is focused
*  on what I already know you want
*  and what the destination is going to be.
*  Why did you bring me in here?
*  I want to not hear it.
*  I just want you to set it a piano and sing the song.
*  I want to hear the chords and the lyric
*  sit in an acoustic chair, play it
*  and then let's all go in the room and then take one.
*  I would say 80% of the time, take one has the most gold.
*  And there might be like a mistake or two
*  or someone forgot to go to the B section
*  and you might want to like punch that in
*  so that you're hitting the right chord.
*  But all the magic is in that take.
*  And then sometimes it happens where it's like you go,
*  it's like we're rehearsing and take one, two, three, four,
*  and then you're like thinking about it too much
*  and then you go and you have a dinner and you come back
*  and the next take one after dinner is the one.
*  Like it's usually after there's some sort of a break.
*  But obviously there's exceptions to that rule.
*  Sometimes it's take two and three.
*  Yeah, you said that this is something
*  that surprised you about recording with Prince
*  is that he would just, so much of it would be take one.
*  So quick, it would just move so quickly.
*  Well, with that particular album that we made together,
*  it's called Welcome to America.
*  He called me up and asked me,
*  he said, I want to make a band with you.
*  I'm like really inspired by what you're doing with Jeff Beck.
*  I want to make a trio.
*  Do you like the drum rolls of Jack D'Ganette
*  was like his first question to me.
*  I'm like, well, yeah, who doesn't?
*  Who doesn't like Jack D'Ganette?
*  Like one of the greatest of all time.
*  And he's like, well, sounds like,
*  because we had a discussion about drumming,
*  sounds like you're kind of particular about drummers.
*  So why don't you find us the drummer
*  and I'll trust you to find the drummer.
*  You can audition some people, send me some recordings
*  and maybe your two favorites
*  and I'll pick out of the two or something.
*  So I did that, went on a journey, found a couple guys.
*  He picked the one we went in
*  and he basically just would be like,
*  okay, so the A section is gonna go like this
*  and then the B section,
*  I think we're gonna go to G and da da
*  and then the bridge, I might go to B flat
*  but maybe I'll hold off and da da da.
*  Okay, let's go.
*  One, two, three, four.
*  And then we recorded it to tape.
*  There was no punch, he did not want me to punch anything.
*  Like it was like, and there was one song called
*  Same Page Different Book.
*  And he like talked through it just like he did.
*  And then he had me soloing between each phrase
*  like little fills.
*  I didn't know that that was gonna come up
*  and he loved that.
*  He loved to have me on the edge of my seat
*  like falling off the cliff.
*  That was my first real falling off a cliff moment
*  from somebody else holding me at the edge of the cliff.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Now I just do it on my own
*  because it's so fun and it makes sense.
*  It's the best thing for the music.
*  We say punch the tape, is that when you actually record it?
*  If you record to tape and there's like,
*  say like you hit a bum note,
*  to punch in means to like fix that note.
*  Like re-record over that one little area
*  and punch that note in.
*  He didn't want that.
*  He's like, all my favorite records just like,
*  whatever happened, happened.
*  That's that moment in time, let's make a new moment in time.
*  It's great.
*  Nobody makes records like that anymore.
*  Everyone wants to edit and edit and re-record
*  and this and that.
*  And unfortunately with a lot of music,
*  and I'm not saying all music
*  because there's plenty of great music coming out,
*  but there's the danger of it being flat
*  because every little imperfection is digitally removed.
*  Well, that's one of the promising things about AI
*  is because it can be so perfect
*  that the thing will actually come back to
*  and value about music is the imperfections
*  that humans can create.
*  There'll be a greater valuation of imperfections.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you can kind of program imperfections too.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  That's also very sad.
*  But then you get closer and closer
*  what it means to be human.
*  And maybe there'll be AI's among us.
*  They'll be human flawed like the rest of us,
*  mortal and silly at times.
*  Another big sigh.
*  Is it fair to say that you're very melodic on bass?
*  Like you make the bass sing more than people normally do?
*  Is that a compliment?
*  Yes, I think so.
*  Thank you.
*  Moving on to the next question.
*  By way of understanding,
*  there's something about the way you play bass
*  that just kind of pulls you in
*  the way when you listen to somebody play a guitar,
*  like a guitar solo.
*  The thing I love about Jeff Beck
*  is that he played the guitar like a singer.
*  And I think that the way that Wayne Shorter
*  played his saxophone, it's like a singer.
*  And I think everyone, every musician aspires
*  to just sound like a singer.
*  See, he make it sing.
*  Let me ask you about, just come back to Hendrix.
*  Because you said that you had three CDs,
*  Jimi Hendrix, Herbie Hancock, and Rage Against the Machine.
*  First of all, great combination.
*  I'm a big Rage fan.
*  It's so funny, because when I listen to some of the music
*  that I create, like my solo music,
*  I'm like, I could see how this is a combination
*  of Herbie Hancock, Rage Against the Machine,
*  and Jimi Hendrix.
*  I hear the influences, it's funny.
*  Just from your musician perspective,
*  what's interesting to you about,
*  what really stands out to you about Hendrix?
*  I just would love to hear
*  like a real professional musician's opinion of Hendrix.
*  I love that he is two voices combined into one voice.
*  So it's like, there is his voice on the guitar,
*  and there is his singing voice,
*  and there is the combination of the two
*  that make one voice.
*  And of course, the third element is his songwriting.
*  And all of this have this beautiful chemistry,
*  and all work geniusly perfectly together.
*  And there's nothing like it.
*  And he always beat himself up about being a singer,
*  and he didn't like his voice,
*  but it's like, my favorite singers are the singers
*  that don't sound like singers.
*  Bob Dylan. Bob Dylan.
*  You like Bob Dylan. Love Bob Dylan.
*  You love his voice too.
*  I love his voice.
*  Can you explain your love affair with Bob Dylan's voice?
*  He's expressing his lyrics.
*  It's just pure expression.
*  Exactly what he means.
*  I feel everything that he's saying
*  with 100% authenticity.
*  That's what I wanna hear from a singer.
*  I don't care how many runs you can do,
*  and like, I wanna believe what you're saying.
*  A lot of cone is that.
*  There's countless, like Neil Young.
*  I mean, there's so many musicians.
*  I love Elliott Smith for that reason.
*  Let me ask you about mentorship.
*  You said teachers and mentors.
*  You had mentors.
*  What's a good mentor for you?
*  Harsh or supportive?
*  Supportive.
*  Supportive.
*  You seen Whiplash, the movie?
*  So that guy, somebody screaming at you,
*  like kicking you off the cliff?
*  Not necessary.
*  I feel like anybody that's truly passionate
*  about something that they wanna be great at
*  or a master of or this and that,
*  they've already got that person inside their own head.
*  You don't need somebody else to do that for you.
*  I think you need love, acceptance, guidance, support, time.
*  Advice, if you ask for it.
*  Just a space, just a nice open space.
*  All my mentors were just that for me.
*  They didn't tell me to do anything.
*  They didn't care.
*  Like, cause they're not,
*  why do they need to be invested in where I'm going?
*  Only I know where I'm going.
*  So for some mentor to come and be like,
*  this is what you need to be doing in practice,
*  it's like, but why?
*  What if that's not my path?
*  Am I going to be like,
*  but why?
*  What if that's not my path?
*  That might be your path.
*  So I'm not really, again, otherwise it feels like a sport.
*  Like who can run the fastest race?
*  And it's like, well, okay, well,
*  I get that for that for sport.
*  Maybe it makes sense to have someone a bit more hardcore,
*  but still like,
*  I would say athletes have the same mentality.
*  They've got that in them already too.
*  So I think more like of a strategic approach
*  to mentorship works really well
*  and mainly just having an open space
*  and just being available to someone.
*  And kind of show that they see the special in you
*  and they give you the room to develop that special,
*  whatever.
*  Exactly.
*  Cause if you do have that harsh critic inside you,
*  it's like, it is nice to have somebody that isn't like
*  your family or someone that's not obligated in any way
*  that just sees your talent and they're like,
*  yeah, I dig what you're doing, keep doing it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's funny that that's not always easy to come by.
*  Do you have any mentors?
*  Yeah, I've had a few recently,
*  but for most of my life, people didn't really,
*  I'm very much like that too.
*  Like somebody to pat me on the back and say,
*  like see something in you of value.
*  Yeah, I didn't really have that.
*  Do you wish you did?
*  Yeah, but maybe the wishing that I did
*  is the thing that made me who I am,
*  not having the longing for that.
*  Maybe that's the thing that helped me develop
*  a constant sense of longing, which I think
*  is a way of, because I have that engine in me,
*  it really allows me to deeply appreciate
*  every single moment, every single,
*  everything that's given to me.
*  So like just eternal gratitude.
*  So you never know which are the bad parts
*  and the good parts.
*  So if you remove one thing, it might be,
*  the whole thing might collapse.
*  I suppose I'm grateful for the whole thing.
*  That one note you screwed up so many years ago.
*  That might've been essential.
*  What about, because you do Jiu-Jitsu.
*  Yes.
*  Do you?
*  My dad does.
*  My dad's super into it.
*  I love my dad.
*  He's the coolest.
*  But no, I don't do it.
*  He's a blue belt right now.
*  Nice, nice.
*  You ever been on the mat with him?
*  Not yet, but I plan on it.
*  Should do it.
*  What belt are you?
*  Black belt.
*  Sick.
*  Do you wanna go on the?
*  You got the shit talking part of Jiu-Jitsu down.
*  You just have to do the technique.
*  But for that, for instance,
*  do you need a harsh mentor or a teacher?
*  Yeah, but you said it really beautifully.
*  To me, I agree.
*  There's a difference between sport and art.
*  They overlap, for sure,
*  but there's something about sport
*  where perfection is actually,
*  perfection, perfection is really the thing
*  you really wanna get to, the technical perfection.
*  With art, it feels like technical perfection
*  is almost a way to get lost on the path to wherever,
*  something unique.
*  But yeah, with sport, I definitely,
*  I'm one of the kind of athletes
*  that loves to have a dictatorial coach.
*  Somebody that helps me really push myself to the limit.
*  But you're the one that's kind of dictating
*  how hard you're getting pushed in a way.
*  You're choosing your mentor.
*  That whiplash video is like, he didn't ask for that.
*  In a way he might've.
*  Well, maybe, maybe subconsciously.
*  I mean, there's-
*  It's a movie, so.
*  Next you're gonna tell me they're just actors.
*  How do we choose things?
*  You don't always choose,
*  but you kind of maybe subconsciously choose.
*  And some of it, some of the great Olympic athletes
*  I've interacted with, their parents for many years
*  would force them to go to practice
*  until they discovered the beauty of the thing
*  that they were doing and then they loved it.
*  So at which point does something that looks like abuse
*  become a gift?
*  It's weird.
*  It's all very weird.
*  But for you, support and space to discover the thing,
*  the voice, the music within you.
*  It's my personal choice,
*  because I'm very familiar with the inner critic
*  and I can bring her out at any point.
*  I don't need help with that.
*  Oh, so you do have-
*  Yeah, she's on call.
*  She was on overdrive.
*  That's why now I'm, I had to work on that so much.
*  Yeah, you have a really happy way about you right now.
*  Thanks.
*  You're very zen.
*  Can I ask you about Bruce Springsteen?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  A lot of songs of his I listen to
*  make me feel this melancholy feeling.
*  It's not just Bruce Springsteen,
*  but Bruce does a lot.
*  What is that about songs that arouse a kind of sad feeling
*  or longing feeling or feeling?
*  What is that?
*  What is that about us humans
*  on the receiving end of the music?
*  Frequencies, each frequency does elicit
*  a different kind of emotional response.
*  That is real.
*  You mean like on the physics aspect?
*  Yeah, yeah, the physical level.
*  So there is that.
*  Combined with the right kind of lyric
*  and the right kind of melody of the right kind of chord
*  will elicit a very particular kind of emotion.
*  And it is scientific.
*  It can be analyzed.
*  I don't particularly want to analyze it
*  because I don't want to approach things with that
*  in advance.
*  I don't want it to inform where I'm going.
*  I like the feeling to lead me naturally
*  to where I'm writing.
*  But yeah, there's a real chemical element to that.
*  And then also, like I was saying,
*  the lyric, what it means to you,
*  which poetry is supposed to mean something to everybody,
*  like different.
*  It's not supposed to mean one thing.
*  You can't analyze and be like,
*  this is what this poet meant.
*  And like we were talking about with Leonard earlier,
*  it's like the broader you can leave a lyric, the better.
*  You can appeal to people in so many different ways.
*  And even to the songwriter,
*  I'll sing some of my songs from five years ago
*  and I'll be like,
*  I didn't even think that it could have meant that,
*  but I guess it does, that's funny.
*  I'll just giggle on stage suddenly
*  because a lyric will hit me differently
*  from a different new experience or something.
*  Have you ever cried listening to a song?
*  Of course.
*  We'd like a baby in a bathtub.
*  Which,
*  who's a regular go-to then?
*  Leonard. Leonard.
*  Yeah.
*  Hallelujah is a song that makes,
*  consistently makes me feel something.
*  It's holy.
*  His work is holy.
*  And if you were in his presence,
*  I guess there was a lot to that being.
*  What advice would you give to young folks
*  on how to have a life they can be part of?
*  Just tackle the demons as early as possible,
*  whether it's through your art or through meditation
*  or through whatever it means.
*  Diaries, whatever it is,
*  just walk towards the things that are scary.
*  Because if you don't, they'll just expand.
*  They become bigger.
*  If you avoid the demons, they become bigger.
*  What does that mean for you today?
*  Are you still missing Jeff?
*  I'll always miss Jeff,
*  but I don't feel like a piece of me is missing.
*  And same with Leonard.
*  It's that I did give them a piece of myself
*  and maybe they gave me a piece of them
*  that I hold with me and I cherish,
*  but it doesn't feel like I'm less than
*  or they're less than or anything's less than.
*  Just,
*  you learn to appreciate the impermanence
*  of everything in life,
*  impermanence of everything except for consciousness,
*  I guess you could say is the only thing that is permanent.
*  So everything else, you learn to appreciate that impermanence
*  because the limited amount of time,
*  like in this particular body is,
*  it's enticing, kind of gives you like a time limit,
*  which is cool.
*  I like that.
*  So you've come to accept your own?
*  Yeah, like it's cool that I'm like,
*  okay, I've got this amount of,
*  maybe this amount of time, who knows?
*  But if I was, yeah, if I died today,
*  I'd be really happy with my life.
*  It's not like I'm like, oh, I missed out on this and that.
*  So you really wanna make sure that every day
*  could be your last day and you're happy with that?
*  I've always lived that way.
*  Yeah, I felt this way since I was in my early 20s.
*  I'd be like, yeah, I could die today.
*  I don't wanna die, I have no reason to die.
*  But if I did, I know that I put my everything,
*  all my effort and all my passion and all my love
*  into whatever I've already done.
*  So if my time's up, then my time's up.
*  What role does love play in this whole thing,
*  in the human condition?
*  Well, love is everything.
*  I mean, if you define love,
*  if you're talking about love as in romantic love
*  or paternal or maternal love,
*  or if you're talking about love as in,
*  you know, in an Eastern tradition,
*  like Vedanta, for instance,
*  love is consciousness, love is everything.
*  That's the only permanent thing.
*  Yeah, or if you were to come from a Zen
*  or like a Buddhist perspective,
*  they would say nothingness, like emptiness is,
*  versus fullness.
*  Well, those guys are really obsessed
*  with the whole suffering thing and letting go of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I was wondering if you would do me the honor
*  of playing a song.
*  Do you want a suffering song or a suffering song?
*  I think I would love a suffering song.
*  Cool.
*  Do you want to sound check and make sure I'm not?
*  Sound check.
*  One, two.
*  Yeah, it sounds really good.
*  This one too.
*  All right, count me off.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know how to count somebody off.
*  Where do I start?
*  A nine or three, two, one.
*  Yeah, you got it.
*  One, two, three, four.
*  You got it.
*  One, two.
*  One, two.
*  ["I Call Out To The Ocean"]
*  I call out to the ocean.
*  My tears fall into the sea.
*  For the valves that have been broken
*  across the dunes of time repeatedly.
*  Like a night in battered armor.
*  In battered armor.
*  I lay my sword upon the ground.
*  Cause I can keep fighting these same battles.
*  More has been lost than has been found.
*  It's hard to feel things changing.
*  After all's been said and done.
*  We spend our lives rearranging.
*  Everything under the sun.
*  I walk the same road to work each Monday.
*  Every step tears at my heel.
*  Tears at my heel.
*  I sleep not to dream, but to forget on Sunday.
*  I spoke just turning with the wheel.
*  It's hard to feel things changing.
*  After all's been said and done.
*  We spend our lives rearranging.
*  Everything under the sun.
*  Reaching for the sky, feet buried in the ground.
*  Looking for some way out of the circle spinning round.
*  My eyes on the horizon seeking out the light.
*  But don't let me be lost forever in the night.
*  Cause it's hard to feel things changing.
*  After all's been said and done.
*  After all's been said and done.
*  We spend our lives rearranging.
*  Everything under the sun.
*  Under the sun.
*  Under the sun.
*  I should produce your next record.
*  Please.
*  Love don't rescue me.
*  I've got nowhere better I wanna be.
*  I wanna be hell, but not the best I can be.
*  I wanna be the best I can be.
*  I wanna be hell, but not beholden.
*  Stand in my ground with one eye open.
*  This fight doesn't quite add up.
*  This fight doesn't quite add up.
*  Love, I thought you were free.
*  But now I'm on the hook for all you've given me.
*  Doesn't matter what I say or think or do.
*  I'm just a nobody with the lens you're looking through.
*  This fight keeps me tied to the worst in me.
*  And it's killing me.
*  Killing me.
*  Love, I'm losing my voice.
*  You led me to believe I had a choice.
*  But let's pause, retract our claws.
*  You could take my side while I take yours.
*  This fight keeps me tied to the worst in me.
*  Tied to the worst in me.
*  And it's killing me.
*  Killing me.
*  Love, come rescue me.
*  I've got nowhere better I wanna be.
*  I've got nowhere better I wanna be.
*  I've got nowhere better I wanna be.
*  This fight keeps me tied to the worst in me.
*  And it's killing me.
*  Killing me.
*  Killing me.
*  Killing me.
*  Well, there's nowhere else I'd rather be right now.
*  Tal, thank you for the private concert. You're amazing.
*  You really are amazing. And it was a pleasure to meet you and really a pleasure to talk to you today.
*  Do I get a private concert now if you're playing chess with yourself?
*  We're out of time, so we gotta go.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tal Wilkenfeld.
*  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, let me leave you with some words from Maya Angelou.
*  Music was my refuge. I could crawl into the spaces between the notes and curl my back to loneliness.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
*  Thank you.
