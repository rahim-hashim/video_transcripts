# Destiny: Politics, Free Speech, Controversy, Sex, War, and Relationships | Lex Fridman Podcast #337
**Lex Fridman:** [November 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqeuFiAUU4o)
*  If you have a democratic style of governance, you are entrusting people with one of the most awesome
*  and radical of responsibilities. And that's saying that you're going to pick the people that are
*  going to make some of the hardest decisions in all of human history. If you're going to trust people
*  to vote correctly, you have to be able to trust them to have open and honest dialogue with each
*  other. Whether that's Nazis or KKK people or whoever talking, you have to believe that your
*  people are going to be able to rise above and make the correct determinations when they hear these
*  types of speeches. And if you're so worried that somebody is going to hear a certain political
*  figure and they're going to be completely radicalized instantly, then what that tells me is
*  that you don't have enough faith in humans for democracy to be a viable institution, which is
*  fine. You can be anti-democratic, but I don't think you can be pro-democracy and anti-free speech.
*  The following is a conversation with Stephen Bonnell, also known online as Destiny. He's a
*  video game streamer and political commentator, one of the early pioneers of both live streaming
*  in general and live streamed political debate and discourse. Politically, he is a progressive,
*  identifying as either left or far left, depending on your perspective.
*  There are many reasons I wanted to talk to Stephen. First, I just talked to Ben Shapiro
*  and many people have told me that Stephen is the Ben Shapiro of the left in terms of political
*  perspective and exceptional debate skills. Second reason is he skillfully defends some nuanced,
*  non-standard views, at the same time being pro-establishment, pro-institutions and pro-Biden,
*  while also being pro-capitalism and pro-free speech. Third reason is he has been there at
*  the beginning and throughout the meteoric rise of the video game live streaming community.
*  In some mainstream circles, this community is not taken seriously, perhaps because of its
*  demographic distribution skewing young or perhaps because of the sometimes harsh style of communication.
*  But I think this community should be taken seriously and shown respect. Millions of young
*  minds tune in to live streams like Destiny's to question and to try to understand what is going
*  on with the world, often exploring challenging, even controversial ideas. The language is
*  sometimes harsher and the humor sometimes meaner than I would prefer. But I, Grandpa Lex, put on
*  my rain boots and went into the beautiful chaotic muck of online discourse and have so far survived
*  to tell the tale, with a smile and even more love in my heart than before. On top of all this,
*  we were lucky to have Melina Goranson, a popular streamer and world traveler,
*  join us at the end of the conversation. You can check out her channel on twitch.tv slash Melina
*  and you can check out Steven's channel on youtube.com slash Destiny. This is the Lex
*  Freedom podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,
*  dear friends, here's Destiny. I don't know if you watched me watching your yay interview.
*  Thank you so much. I'm so curious when you're navigating a conversation like that,
*  how intentional is the thought process between building rapport and pushing and giving a little
*  and letting like zero intention. I was watching and thank you so much. It was very kind for you
*  to review that conversation. It meant a lot that you were complimenting parts on the technical
*  aspects of the conversation, but no zero. And I'm actually deliberately trying to avoid, I think
*  you've called it debate brain, which is just another flavor of thinking about like the meta
*  conversation, trying to optimize how should this conversation go? Because I feel like the more
*  you do that, the better you get at that, the less human connection you have, like the less genuinely
*  you're actually sitting there in the moment and listening to the person. You're more like calculating
*  what's the right thing to say versus like feeling what is that person feeling right now? What are
*  they thinking? That's what I'm trying to do is like putting myself in their mind and thinking,
*  what does the world look like to them? What does the world feel like to them? And so from that,
*  I truly try to listen. Now I'm also learning, especially because Rogan and others have been
*  giving me shit for not pushing back. It's good sometimes to say from a place of care for the
*  other human being to say, stop. What did you just say? I don't think that represents who you are
*  and what you really mean. Or maybe if it does at that time represents who they are,
*  I can see a better world if they grow into a different direction, try to point that
*  direction out to them. There's a really complicated dance between letting somebody share their full
*  story versus letting somebody like essentially like proselytize your audience. And it's like,
*  okay, hold on, let's take him in here. But yeah, I used to be four or five years ago,
*  it was attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, whatever you said. And now I'm leaning way more
*  towards they're like, okay, well, tell me how you feel about everything. And then we'll go from
*  there. So a lot of people like my new approach, some older fans will watch and they're like,
*  why are you letting this guy just ramble on? You know, he said like five or six wrong things,
*  and you're only going to call them out on two of them. And it's like, it's just different styles
*  of conversation. But yeah. Do you do a lot of research beforehand too? Depending on the
*  conversation. Yeah. So if we're going to talk like vaccines and stuff, yeah, that's a ton of reading
*  and stuff that I never thought I'd know going into it. If it's a more personal, like political
*  philosophy conversation, there's not as much you can prepare for just it truly depends on the
*  conversation. How much are you actually listening to the other person? I'm always listening. You
*  have to listen because as soon as you stop listening, the quality of everything falls apart,
*  the connection disappears, the quality of the conversation disappears. But my natural
*  inclination is to just be way more aggressive than normal. So I have to constantly remind myself,
*  I guess you would call it a meta conversation when I'm like, okay, he's probably saying this
*  because of that, or we'll let him go here and then we'll stop later. But yeah, because my
*  preferred style of conversation is like, I'm going to talk and the second I say something you
*  disagree with, then let's iron it out. Right? I think in like syllogisms, like, okay, here's premise
*  A. Good. Okay. Premise B. Okay. And then conclusion. And then as long as we're both deductively sound,
*  we're not crazy, no psychosis, then we're going to agree on everything. Whereas other people like to,
*  most people think in stories, like narratives, like a whole, there's a whole like narrative and
*  the individual facts don't matter as much because they'll pick and choose what they want. And
*  it's really hard because everybody thinks narratives have to function in that world,
*  but it's frustrating for me sometimes. Well, I've seen you had a lot of excellent debates.
*  One of them I just recently last night watch is on systemic racism. And it's the first time I've
*  seen you completely lose your shit. Oh, shoot. Who was that again? I'm not sure exactly, but you were
*  just very frustrated and sorry, not lose your shit, but you're frustrated constantly because
*  of the thing let's lay out one, two, three. And every time you try to lay it out, it would
*  falter. I think it had to do with sort of, can you use data to make an argument or do you need to use
*  a study that does an interpretation of that data? And then there's like this tension between, I think
*  this is a behavioral economist that you were talking to. And the point is you do this kind of
*  nice layout that the whole point of behavioral economics, it says there's more to it than just
*  the data. You have to give a context and like do the rich rigorous interpretation in the context
*  of the full human story. And then there was like a dance back and forth. Sometimes you use data,
*  sometimes not. And you were getting really frustrated and shutting down. And so that
*  felt like a failure mode. I've seen Sam Harris have similar sticking points. Like if we can't
*  agree on the terminology, we can't go on. To me, I feel like the Wittgenstein perspective is like,
*  I think if you get stuck on any one thing, you're just not going to make progress. You have to,
*  part of the conversation has to be about doing a good dance together versus being dogmatically
*  stuck on the path to truth. I think the true challenge is identifying what of those sticking
*  points are important versus what is not important. It's like if I'm having an argument with somebody
*  about like Jewish representation in media, it might be like a big conversation and they might
*  say a couple things. I think Jewish people, they tend to help their own or whatever. And it's like,
*  okay. But for the purpose of the conversation, we can keep moving. But if they casually drop,
*  I think that's why the Holocaust numbers are blown up from like 100,000 to 6 million. And that's
*  why I was like, okay, well, hold on. If you think this, we have to stop here because
*  this is going to be, it's not just a language game in this part. If you really believe this fact,
*  then the whole rest of the conversation is going to be informed by that belief.
*  But it has to be something that doesn't bother you personally. You have to step outside your own ego.
*  So Holocaust denial is somebody that would bother a lot of people. And there's some things,
*  just observing you, I feel like when you get really good at conversation, you can become a stickler
*  to, you might have your favorite terms that really bothers you. People don't agree on those terms.
*  Begs the question. You mean raising the question. Yeah, I usually just want,
*  see, those people say stuff, I just let it slide. Yeah. Because you can't, because if you fight,
*  when you're having a conversation with somebody and you're talking to their audience at the same
*  time, because that's really what's happening, you never want to come off as over combative or
*  over aggressive because it puts people in like, there's like a trigger in your brain. And this is
*  true of relationships, of friendships, of persuasive rhetoric or whatever. There's a
*  trigger in the brain. And as soon as that defensive trigger gets like flipped on, everything is over.
*  You've lost the ability to persuade because everything becomes a fight at that point.
*  Well, I wanted to talk to you because I heard somewhere that you were referred to as the Ben
*  Shapiro of the left. And since I'm talking with Ben as well, I wanted to sort of complete spiritually
*  this platonic political philosophy puzzle in my head. You are a progressive, but a progressive
*  with many nonstandard progressive views. And you had a heck of a fascinating journey through all
*  of that. And like I said, I think you argue with passion, sometimes with excessive amounts of
*  passion, but almost always with good faith and with rigor, with seriousness. I asked on your
*  subreddit, which is an excellent subreddit, shout out to the destiny subreddit so much,
*  at least for that particular post. What I really loved is when I asked for questions for you,
*  they were like, holy shit, there's adults in there, let's all behave. Nobody say incest. I was like,
*  what was going on here? But actually the questions that rose to the top were really good. So
*  somebody said that destiny was speaking of your journey, was a conservative in his early teens.
*  Then he became a libertarian. Then he became a left-wing social justice warrior. Then he flirted
*  with socialism. And now he is a social Democrat liberal. I've also heard you refer to yourself
*  as a far left person. So to the degree there's truth to that journey, can you take me through
*  your evolution through the landscape of political ideologies that you went through?
*  So my dad comes from Kentucky and my mom is a Cuban immigrant. Cubans are notorious for being
*  very conservative in the United States for historical reasons and for other reasons. But
*  my upbringing was a very Republican one. I grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Michael
*  Savage, on the radio, Billy Cunningham. I think Sean Hannity a little bit later on, that was my
*  whole upbringing politically. I remember I was writing, I had written articles for the school
*  journal in favor of defending the war in Iraq and defending Bush from all the criticism, etc. So
*  that was my upbringing. I think once I hit high school college, I had my edgy libertarian-esque
*  high school phase of reading Ayn Rand, of figuring out that, oh my God, nothing in life matters
*  except for class and money. That's actually the answer to everything. I got to college,
*  I became a Ron Paul fan, very big Ron Paul fan. And then from there, I work, do life, life happens
*  at the lowest point of my life in terms of where I'm working. Financially, everything is
*  in ruin in my life. There's a whole bunch of dumb stuff that's happened. Probably my most conservative
*  point. I don't know what it is about being poor and thinking you can work your way out of it,
*  you can do whatever. It's just my upbringing is always just like, if you're not having financial
*  success, just work, work, work, work, work. And then I got into streaming, very, very lucky break.
*  Everything just lined up at the right time. And then as I've progressed through streaming,
*  I would say through the years, I've gradually fallen more and more to the left, especially
*  once my kid turned four, five, six years old. And I started to see how much different his life was
*  just because of the financial opportunities that I was able to provide for him through no merit of
*  his own. And that started to radically change how I viewed the world in a lot of ways.
*  So actually, let's linger on that low point. You worked at McDonald's, you worked at a casino,
*  you did carpet cleaning. What was the lowest point?
*  Definitely the carpet cleaning.
*  Really?
*  Absolutely.
*  Why was it the lowest point? That's when you were just flirting with starting streaming?
*  My whole life has been a series of lucky breaks, really, truly. I grew up playing a lot of video
*  games. But back in my day, our day, you had to read, there's a lot of text on the screen.
*  Back in my day, we used to play-
*  They didn't all talk to you. Yeah, because nowadays everything's voice acted. But back then,
*  you had to read a lot. I was a really good reader and a really good vocabular.
*  Yeah, I've heard you actually say that. What games are we talking about? What do you mean,
*  just reading? You're talking about like RPGs?
*  Yeah, JRPGs. So like Final Fantasy games, Fantasy stars, like all of these, like any
*  RPG that would have been on the SNES, Sega, PlayStation, these are the things that I'm-
*  Let's pause on that.
*  Okay.
*  I just talked to Todd Howard, who's of the Elder Scrolls fame and the Fallout fame and beyond.
*  What's your thoughts on Elder Scrolls? Why is Skyrim the greatest RPG of all time?
*  Man, I really don't like Skyrim or Fallout or those types of games.
*  You don't love it? Oh, really?
*  No, not at all.
*  Why do you hate Skyrim?
*  Yeah, so I really like characters and compelling stories and narratives around those characters.
*  I like to see them grow and change, kind of like a movie or a story. So in your Final
*  Fantasy games, you've got characters. There are a lot of classical tropes of like a character
*  starts off kind of like edgy angsty all on their own. They develop relationships, friendships.
*  They realize that the life is more about themselves and they do that. I like that growth.
*  That's kind of what you see in all of those old role playing games. I didn't like the open
*  world ones as much because your main character is just like a blank slate, never talks. It's
*  for you to like project onto, but there's not the same like linear narrative of like growth for the
*  characters. That's fascinating. There's an actual story arc to the character that's more crafted
*  in a beautiful way by the designers of the game. Yeah.
*  I don't think one is better or worse. I tend towards like I want to hear a compelling story
*  around like a set of characters that like grow and change as the game goes on.
*  Oh, that's beautifully put then. Yeah, I just really loved being able to leave the town.
*  You go outside the town and you look outside its nature and the world of possibilities is before
*  you. You can do whatever the fuck you want. I mean that immensity are just being lost in the
*  world. That was really immersive for me, but yeah, you're right. Whatever attracts you about a world.
*  So you were just starting to play video games. You go out, play the video games. That's one of
*  your lucky breaks. There's just like a lot of random skills you pick up depending on the type
*  of game you play. I played a lot of text-based games on the computer, so I was a very fast
*  typer. I'm still a very fast typer. Read a lot, learned weird kind of math stuff for some of the
*  calculations, some of the games. I think I'm pretty good at getting information, figuring stuff out,
*  learning patterns, all of that. And then that plus the reading and everything with the games meant
*  that I, I don't want to say I excelled in school because my grades were pretty bad, but I was in
*  like all honors, all AP classes or whatever. A lot of dual enrollment, a lot of AP credit going
*  into college. So I did pretty well in school, probably better than I should have, but it was
*  because I had the game stuff that was like really powering a lot of my brain there while I was trying
*  to sleep through class. So you're able to soak in information, integrate it, quickly take notes.
*  Generally, I think I'm pretty good at that. Yeah. You do this a lot when you stream your typing
*  stuff. Is there a system in that note taking and what note, what do you use for note taking?
*  It doesn't matter. I use a notepad. The original. Yeah, notepad.exe, not the plus plus, not
*  is there genius to the madness behind that or you just don't give a shit? No, I mean like it's going
*  to depend on the style of conversation. If I'm with somebody that is very meticulously organized
*  their thoughts and they're a, uh, find a better word here for Rambler. You can edit that in better
*  word for Rambler. Somebody that talks a lot and a lot, I'll start like taking notes, bullet points
*  like this, this, this, this, this, this, this, because, um, there's a style of conversation
*  where I say seven or eight different things. And then when you go to respond to everything I said,
*  I cut you off immediately. And we argue that point. But if somebody is going to do that,
*  he's just like, hold on. You just said these eight things. I'm going to respond to every single one.
*  I've written them all down and then you can go if you want to go point by point, we can,
*  but you just said all this and I wrote it down somewhere to go. So what are you actually writing
*  down? Like a couple of words per point they left? Honestly, like there are very few unique
*  conversations in politics. Like a lot of them are kind of retreading old grounds. So if we're
*  having a debate on abortion, um, somebody might say like, oh, well I believe this thing about
*  viability and I believe this thing about, you know, when they're a fetus versus a human and
*  I'll just write down like those points. So that when I go to respond, I kind of have like a,
*  like note cards, like a guiding thing there to keep me centered on my response.
*  Political discourse is the kind of tree you're walking down. I got it. And you're like taking
*  Just to keep my focus guided. So I'm not like running off on a weird tangent or responding
*  to something I didn't say or something. Yeah. What about like doing research? It's just,
*  is there a system to your note taking? Because mentally you seem to be one of the most organized
*  people I've listened to. So is there, is it in your mind or is there a system that's on paper?
*  A little of both. I feel like the human mind is a beautiful thing if you have interest in an area.
*  So like what I'll tell people is let's say there's like a totally new topic that I'm researching. I
*  don't know anything. And I've, I'll do a couple of these on stream. I think they're boring, but
*  people watch it. I might open a Wikipedia article and I'll read and I hit something I don't know.
*  And then I open the next Wikipedia article and I'll read it. And then I might have like seven tabs
*  open and I'll read and I'll read and I'll read. Um, and I'll read a ton of stuff, maybe for hour,
*  two, three, four hours of stuff. And then by the end, you know, someone in chat will ask me like,
*  do you even remember like this particular thing? And I'll say, not really. No, not too much.
*  But what happens is, as long as you've seen it once, what will happen is like the next day
*  of the day after we'll read something else and we're like, oh, I remember that thing from this
*  thing. I remember like vaguely that. And then if you see it like a third time, you're like, oh,
*  this makes sense. Because especially when it comes to, oh, here's like a little trick on stuff. If
*  you're ever reading any news and there's a place that pops up, always look at it on a map because
*  so much of history is like on a map. It's so important to like know the geography. It makes
*  things make so much more sense. Um, but yeah, once I, once I start to see stuff over and over again,
*  just because I've like read it a few times, stuff will start to kind of connect to my mind and like,
*  oh yeah, well this makes sense. Of course these people believe this because of this, or of course,
*  like this happened here. It's because you know, that happened there. Um, so yeah, it's a lot of
*  that. If there's like a topic that I'm doing specific research for, um, so like a vaccine
*  related stuff is a big one. Uh, the Ukrainian Russian conflict is a big one that I'll break out
*  a note. Um, I'll probably get like a Google doc and I'll just start like writing like an outline
*  of kind of the rough points of everything just to organize my thoughts around different topics.
*  Yeah. We're just going to go on tangent upon attention upon attention. We'll return to the
*  low point of your life at some point. Always returning from the philosophy to the psychology.
*  So you did, uh, the Ukraine topic. One question is what role does us play in this war? Could they
*  have done something to avoid the war? Uh, did they have a role to play in forcing Vladimir Putin's
*  hand? Do they have a role to play in, um, deescalating the war towards a peace agreement
*  and the opposite? If it does escalate, uh, towards something like the use of a tactical nuclear
*  weapon, are they to blame or are we to blame? Oh man. So I just had an email a while ago with
*  great words. Um, there's a specific way to navigate a conversation where you can kind of like
*  contribute to a negative event, but you're not really the one responsible for it. Um, like the
*  classic example is a woman goes out late at night, gets a little bit too drunk and then something
*  happens and it's like, well, there might've been steps you could have taken to mitigate the risk.
*  It's not her fault of what happened because the, um, responsibility rests on the, on the agent
*  making the choice, right? There's a chooser at some point that is choosing to do wrong or evil.
*  I don't believe in any of the arguments that say the United States has contributed to Russia's
*  position on Ukraine or the actions that they've taken on Ukraine. Um, there are several arguments
*  that some people, uh, some even political scholars are, are, are putting out there to say that the
*  United States is to blame, but I find them completely unconvincing. I think that when you
*  ask the question of like, what is the United States role or what has our role been? I think
*  it's really important for us. I don't think we even agree as a country on what our role should be,
*  which I think is a hard one because you've got this kind of, there's this growing populist
*  movement in the United States. It might be the far left and the far right. And I think populists
*  tend to have this kind of isolationist view of the world where the United States should just be our
*  own thing. We shouldn't be telling anybody what to do. We shouldn't be the world police. And then
*  kind of more in these like center, left center, right positions. And then across a lot of Europe,
*  you've got, well, okay, the United States is kind of like the big kid on the block. Like we're
*  looking to them for guidance and leadership on situations like what's going on in Ukraine.
*  So insofar as the original question is like, what is the United States responsibility? I think we
*  have a responsibility to ensure the relative freedom, prosperity and stability across Europe.
*  I think that defending Ukraine's sovereignty and right to their borders is a part of that.
*  And I don't believe that prior to the invasion in 2022, I don't think the United States was
*  contributing to Russia invading that country. I know there are arguments given that like the
*  expansion of NATO has something that's been threatening to Russia, but the Baltics joined
*  and Russia didn't do anything about it. The invasion to Crimea was very clearly a response
*  to the revolution in 2014. The invasion on the borders is clearly a response to Ukraine winning
*  that civil war in the Southeast and the Donbass and Russia becoming more aggressive. I don't think
*  that you can blame any of that on NATO expansion. There's no NATO countries that are threatening
*  Russia or invading Russia. Do you think there is a nuclear threat? Do you think about this? Do you
*  worry about this that there is a threat of a tactical nuclear weapon being dropped?
*  I think that possibility exists either way. And I think the responsibility for that is on Russia
*  because it just can't be the case that if you have nukes, you're allowed to invade countries
*  and take their land. Because of anything, I think that that down the road also increases the
*  potential for nuclear problems in the future. Because at that point, either every single country
*  has to acquire their own nuclear weapons because if you don't, Russia is going to mess with you.
*  Or every single country has to join NATO. And now what? We're back at square zero, ground zero,
*  square one, where people are like, oh, well, look, all these countries joining NATO is aggressive
*  towards Russia. What are you going to do? Yeah, you've mentioned that there's a complicated
*  calculus going on with the countries that have nuclear weapons. And what's our responsibility?
*  Are you allowed to do anything you want to countries that don't have nuclear weapons?
*  That's a really tricky discussion. For sure. Because what is US supposed to do if Russia
*  drops a tactical nuclear weapon? There's a set of options, none of which are good. And
*  it's such a tricky moment right now, because the things that Biden and other public figures say,
*  I feel like has a significant impact on the way this game turns out. Because I think mutually
*  sure destruction is partially a game of words. I mean, I believe in the Polaroid conversation
*  of leaders talking to each other. I feel like you have to have a balance between threat and compromise
*  and empathy for the needs, the geopolitical, the economic needs of a nation, but also respect
*  and represent your own interests. So it's a tricky one. How do you play the hand?
*  It reminds me of, I don't know if you've ever heard in evolutionary psychology or evolutionary
*  biology, there are things called tit for tat strategies. It kind of reminds me of that where
*  it's like, there are a whole bunch of these little biological mechanisms where creatures will develop
*  like socializing like tit for tat. If you do something bad to me, I'm going to do something
*  bad for you. And then more complicated schemes will come out where it'll be like tit, tit for tat,
*  or it's like you can make one mistake and then I'm going to get you if you do a second one,
*  or it could be tit, tit, tit for tat, or there could be tit for tat, tat for tat. There's like
*  all these like back and forth where creatures kind of optimize themselves. And yeah, I think
*  something the United States did really well in terms of that kind of conversational strategy,
*  and I proved this in the beginning was Biden was very clear about setting out like the exact level
*  of US involvement for the war. We're not going to do a no fly zone. There's not going to be US troops
*  on the ground in Ukraine, but we are going to send a whole bunch of money and a whole bunch of arms
*  and a whole bunch of intel to them. And I thought he did a good job at laying out like the limitation
*  of the US involvement while opening as much as we could in the ways that we could help.
*  But the yeah, that looming threat of some sort of tactical nuclear weapon, I think on the table
*  right now is like it's going to be the annihilation of like Russian sea forces and everything. But
*  you know, what happens if it continues to escalate? That's like a world that nobody wants to,
*  nobody wants to be in. Yeah. So we talked about difficult conversations. And again,
*  thank you so much for reviewing the conversation. Let me ask you about Putin.
*  Speaking of difficult conversations. So if you sit down, if I sit down with somebody like Vladimir
*  Putin or Vladimir Zelensky, what's the right way to have that conversation? Oh, man, we can talk
*  about that one. Or we could talk about somebody more well understood through history, like
*  something like Stalin or Hitler, something like that. Maybe that's an easier example
*  to illustrate how to handle extremely difficult conversations. Yeah, I mean, I can handle really
*  difficult conversations between like two people, leaders of countries, though, you're there so much
*  that you are representing in that conversation. I guess the thing that would be interesting to me
*  would be like, what is Vladimir Putin's interest? Like, what is the genuine interest that he has
*  in the conflict? Because I think finding out like, what is your buy in or what is your like,
*  what is the driving force keeping you here is probably the most important thing.
*  I think for Zelensky, I think it's quite a bit more simpler because he's on the defense. So
*  it's defending his country and his people. For Putin, I've heard all sorts of things.
*  Dugan has his writings on, you know, like the East versus the West, the collapse of the West
*  in the face of like all of the liberalism and the weird LGBT stuff that they criticize. You've got
*  the desire to like return to this like former Soviet Union-esque thing. You've got Putin's
*  quotes that collapse of the Soviet Union was the biggest geopolitical disaster, you know,
*  of 20th century. And I guess figuring out like, what is Putin after? I'm not actually sure. I don't
*  know the answer to that question. I know a lot of people write about it, but yeah. Well, there's a
*  lot of answers to that question. There's a lot of answers that he can give to that question. So say
*  I sit down with him for three hours and talk about it. I think this is a really interesting
*  distinction because you do do difficult conversations in the space of ideas,
*  but also in your stream you have, I mean, there's a bunch of drama going on. There's
*  there's a human psychology is laid out in its full richness before you. So to me with leaders, I think
*  a part of the conversation has to be about the human psychology. Not like a meta conversation,
*  but like really understand what they feel, what they fear, who they are as a human being.
*  As a family man, as a person proud of their country, as a person with an ego, as a person who's been
*  affected, if not corrupted by powers, all of us can be and likely are. So all of that,
*  that gives context to then the answers about what do you want in this war? Because the answers
*  about what you want in this war will be political answers. It's like a game that's being played,
*  again, with words and politicians are incredibly good at playing that game. I think the deeper
*  truth comes from understanding the human being from which those words come. And I think that's
*  what you do. I don't know if you do those kinds of conversations where I never talked to any
*  country leaders. So no, not a country leader, but say a controversial figure or somebody that
*  represents a certain idea. Don't just talk in the space of ideas or challenge the ideas,
*  but understand who is this person, how did you come to those ideas?
*  Oh yeah, when I've had, there've been a couple of very controversial
*  riot-leaning figures. So the two, obviously the mainstream is either Lawrence Southern and Nick
*  Fuentes. And those types of conversations initially aren't very political at all. Yeah,
*  it's more like, obviously we believe in very, very, very different things, but like beliefs
*  don't happen accidentally. So how did you get to where you are? Those are way more personal
*  conversations, that's true. Is there things you regret about those conversations where you
*  failed? Is there things you're proud of where you succeeded? For things that I'm proud of,
*  I feel like I'm really good at attempting to understand people without judgment.
*  That I think a lot of people feel like they can have conversations with me where they can share
*  a lot and I'm not going to jump down their throat for them having a politically incorrect
*  observation or for them being judgmental to somebody else or having like a feeling that's
*  maybe not something they should have, something they're embarrassed about. So I think I do a
*  really good job at that. And then by extension of that, I've gotten the ability to hear perspectives
*  from so many different people that I think I can understand a lot of different perspectives.
*  For failures of mine, I mean, it's always going to be on stream, it'll be like I didn't push back
*  hard enough or I didn't know like a certain fact for a conversation. These are usually the, they're
*  going to be on these like very technical grounds generally. I'm pretty happy with like the direction
*  my conversations have gone recently, especially over like the past six months. So your goal is to
*  de-radicalize the audience of those folks. So that used to be my goal. My goal was
*  de-radicalization. Now I'm kind of hoping that that's just the byproduct. So the goal I think
*  is to talk to somebody and to show they believe this because of these reasons. And if you want to
*  change people's beliefs, we have to talk about the underlying reasons for why they think the things
*  they think. It's not enough to just say like that belief is bad because it's like, well, they
*  believe it for a whole bunch of things that are true and real to them at least. So you have to
*  address all of the underlying things that they believe before you can change the overlying belief.
*  So if I'm having a conversation with somebody, it'll be like, okay, why do you feel this about
*  that, that and that? Okay, I understand that. Maybe like a better way to solve that would be like
*  this or that instead of this thing. So to what degree do you have to empathize with the person's
*  worldview versus pushback? That's always the hard one. When I'm talking to other people,
*  it's almost always me stepping as much inside their bubble as I can. I have to like live and
*  breathe their worldview and be able to speak their worldview in order to like navigate their
*  thoughts. Because my worldview is, I don't even I'm not even use this as an insult. I don't know
*  if I am a little bit autistic or something. But when I break apart things, I just want to see like
*  study, study, study, fact, fact, fact. That's how my mind works for everything. That's just how that's
*  what I like to see. Like personal stories don't do much for me. Narrators don't do much. I mean,
*  just show me like the data and the studies or whatever. But for other people, I think most
*  brains are more human than that. And they tend to see things that more kind of like surreal pictures
*  that are kind of painted and the brushstrokes are way broader. And you know, they don't care about
*  the itty bitty tiny fact. So if I'm talking to somebody else, I'm trying to get into their head,
*  and I'm trying to change their mind on things, I'm going to be stepping into their world. And I'm
*  going to try to be working through that framework. Really good example might be, we'll say like,
*  when it comes to trans issues for minors, okay, 16 or 17 year old needs to get on puberty blockers,
*  the way that I want that debate to play out is, let's look at all the data, let's see what are the
*  outcomes, let's see what are the processes for getting a medication, and then we'll evaluate
*  all of that. And then we'll go in whatever like points more favorably. But that's wholly unconvincing
*  to most people, right? So as a parent, if I'm having that conversation with another parent,
*  the easiest way for me to have that conversation is like, hey, we both have kids, imagine how
*  horrible it would be if we felt like our kids needed help. And the government was trying to
*  get between us and their doctor in that conversation. That might be how that talk plays out, which
*  I think that's a really good argument. Because I think there probably are times that the government
*  should get in between. But I'll have that conversation because now I'm in a world where
*  they understand what I'm saying, I'm resonating with the way that they feel about things. And
*  I can make progress with the way that they're kind of viewing the world because I'm talking
*  in a language they understand. So on this particular topic of trans issues, is that the reason you were
*  banned from Twitch? I'm not sure. I don't know. They just said hate speech, but I don't use like
*  slurs or anything. So it's hard to know exactly. So I think you made the claim that trans women
*  shouldn't compete with cis women in women's athletics. Can you make this case and can you
*  still man the case against it? I think in your community, there's a lot of trans folks who love
*  you. And there's a lot who hate you. Yeah. And so if you can walk the tight rope of this conversation
*  to try to still man both sides. One of the argumentative strategies I say is that like,
*  anytime you have a conversation, you should be able to argue both sides better than anybody else,
*  you know. So for the my side, the genuine belief side, it feels like overwhelmingly,
*  all of the data is showing that trans, mostly trans women, even after I think three years on some
*  sort of like HRT or, you know, estrogen stuff, they're still maintaining these advantages from
*  their male puberty over cisgender women. And if that is the case, if we are going to draw these
*  distinctions around our sports between women and men, it feels unfair to have a category inside the
*  women's sports that are maintaining advantages that are coming from a male puberty, regardless
*  of the amount of time they've spent on hormone replacement therapy. So that would be my argument
*  on that side. So it's unfair from a performance enhancement aspect. So the same way we ban
*  performance, performance enhancing drugs that involve increasing of testosterone in that same
*  way would be unfair. Essentially. Yeah. So what's the case against the key? Yeah. So the case in
*  favor of them competing together is that realistically, there's not going to be a trans sports category.
*  Realistically, trans women aren't going to be competitive with cis men because they've gone
*  through these huge, you know, like hormone changes by the medication they're taking.
*  And that when we look at how sports are kind of done anyway, there's a whole bunch of biological
*  differences between people within sports categories that are determining their placement
*  in the professional world. So for instance, somebody like me is probably never going to
*  go far in the NBA because I'm not tall enough. I think the average height in the NBA, don't doubt
*  myself. Yeah. I want to say like six, six or something. They're huge people. Or, you know,
*  you look at like Michael Phelps is a classic example of a guy whose torso is like so long,
*  his body is built for swimming. And I think there are some trans people that will look at that or
*  somebody advocating for this position. They'll look at that and go, okay, realistically, the way
*  that Michael Phelps' body processes lactic acid, the shape physiologically of his body, is going
*  to put him in a level of competition that so many men are never going to reach just because of biology.
*  How is it fair that you can have these biological outliers competing in these categories, but then
*  when we come to like sports categories with trans and cis women, you're going to take trans women
*  and say that they can't compete against cis women. Can't you also just say that they have some level
*  of biological difference there? Like, is it really going to be that great of a difference than what
*  Michael Phelps has versus the average swimmer or an NBA player has versus like the average height male?
*  Yeah. Do you think we're going to get into some tricky ethical territory as we start to be able
*  to, through biology and genetics, modify the human body? Absolutely. I feel like those things are
*  coming sooner than we wanted them to. Oh, man, dude, have you seen the AI art? Yes. That's a-
*  Of course. I'm an AI person. Oh, okay, then yeah. That's always been like, what's going to happen
*  when robots can do art better than humans? LOL. Like, well, we'll see in 20 years and 20 years and
*  20 years. And now you have AI art winning competitions. And it's funny because robots are essentially-
*  There's a robot behind you, by the way. A robot behind me. Oh, nice. Robots are really good-
*  Careful what you say. Yeah. Oh, God, I'll be careful. That's not like one of the Chinese ones with a gun on it, right?
*  Okay. Hopefully not. We'll see, depending on what you say. Yeah. Okay. Robots are really good at showing
*  the limitations of the human mind in categories that we didn't believe we were limited before.
*  I think that humans have this idea intrinsically that we have some type of innovative, creative drive
*  that is just outside of the bounds of physical understanding. And with a sophisticated enough
*  program, we see that maybe that's not actually true. And that's a really scary thing philosophically
*  to deal with because we feel like we're very special, right? We own the planet, we make computers,
*  and the idea that you can start to get these robots that can do things that's like, okay,
*  you can do math, fine. Okay, you can do calculations, fine. But you can't do art. That's the human stuff.
*  And then when they start to do that, it's like, oh, shoot. And that terrifies you a little bit,
*  like losing the human species, losing control of our dominance.
*  Over the surf. I don't think it's necessarily losing control of our dominance. I mean, I guess
*  like a Skynet thing could come in at some point. But I think it brings us to this really fundamental
*  level of like, what does it mean to be human? What is it that we're good at? What should we be doing
*  with technology? We never really asked that question in the Western world. It's always the
*  technology is normative in that technology equals good and more technology equals better. That's
*  been the default assumption. In fact, if you ask a lot of people, how do you know if civilization
*  has progressed over the past 100 or 200 years? They don't say we have better relationships. We
*  have longer marriages. We have blah, blah, blah. They'll say technology has improved. We've got
*  crazy phones. We've got crazy computers. And the idea that more technology might be bad has never
*  even crossed somebody's mind unless it's used for like a really bad thing. So. Well, it's interesting.
*  We kind of think as more and more automation is happening, we're going to get more and more
*  meaning from things like being artists and doing creative pursuits. And here's like, oh, shit.
*  If the art, if the creative pursuits are also being automated, then what are we going to gain
*  meaning from? What are the activities from which you'll gain meaning? You know, my whole life I've
*  been working on artificial intelligence systems. There's been different revolutions. One of them
*  is the machine learning revolution. And it's interesting to build up intuition and destroy
*  that intuition about what is and isn't solvable by machines. I think for the longest time I grew up
*  thinking Go is not the game of Go is not solvable. Because my understanding of AI systems
*  is ultimately this is fundamentally a search mechanism that is fundamentally going to be
*  brute force. There's no shortcuts. Sure. Like a like if it can't solve the traveling salesman
*  problem, it's not even going to be able to give you an approximation. So most interesting problems
*  are giant travel salesman problem. And then so of course, it's not going to be able to solve that.
*  And then you then the deep learning revolution made you realize, holy shit, these large neural
*  networks with a giant number of knobs is able to actually somehow estimate functions that can
*  do a pretty good job of understanding deep representation of a thing, whether that's a
*  game of Go, or whether it's the human natural language, or if it's images and video or audio,
*  and even actions and different video games and actions of robotics and so on.
*  And then the realize with diffusion models and different, different generative models,
*  you start to realize, holy shit, it can actually generate not just interesting
*  representations, or interesting manifestations of the representations of forms, but it's able
*  to do something that impresses humans in its creativity. It's beautiful in the way we think
*  of art is beautiful, like it surprises us and makes us chuckle and makes us sit back in awe
*  and all those kinds of things. And yet the thing that it seems to struggle with the most is the
*  physical world currently. So that's counterintuitive. We humans think that it's pretty trivial,
*  being able to pick up a cup, being able to like write with a pen, like in the physical space,
*  we think that's trivial. We give ourselves respect for being great artists and great
*  mathematicians and all that kind of stuff. And that seems to be much easier than the physical
*  space. Bodies are really cool. There was a, I don't know, it's probably Asimov or something.
*  There was some science fiction writer that had a short story and it was like an alien that had
*  landed on earth and it was describing our bodies from a totally alien perspective.
*  And when you think about all the things we can do, it's pretty cool. We can, you know, climb
*  through a whole multitude of environments. We can exist in a multitude of temperatures.
*  We can manipulate things just with our hands and how, you know, the way that we can interact
*  with things around us. And yeah, we're very capable on like a physical level, even though,
*  like you said, we think about ourselves like, oh, well human beings have really big brains and we
*  do, we're really intelligent as well. But yeah, our bodies are pretty cool too.
*  And it's a fascinating hierarchical biological system. Like we're made up of a bunch of different
*  like living organisms that all don't know about the big picture of our body. And it's all functioning
*  its own little local world and it's doing its thing. But together as of it forms a super
*  resilient system, all of that comes from a very compressed encoding of what makes a human. You
*  start with the DNA and it builds up from a single cell to a giant organism. I mean, and because of
*  the DNA through the evolution process, you can constantly create new humans and new living
*  organisms that adapt to the environment. Like that resilience to the physical world,
*  it seems like running the whole earth over again, the whole evolutionary process over again is,
*  might be the only way to do it. So to create a robot that actually adapts,
*  is as resilient to the dynamic world, might be a really difficult problem.
*  Possibly. Well, I was going to say like in a programming environment, you can do things
*  on time scales that are impossible in the real world, right? Like the benefit to AI and computers
*  is computationally, they can compute so much data so quickly. Whereas on human timetables,
*  when you talk about evolution, it's generation after generation after generation. Maybe in a
*  virtual environment, that could be simulated and then those changes could happen a lot quicker.
*  Well, that's not a human time scale, but you have to look at earth as a quantum mechanical system,
*  the computation is happening super fast. This is a giant computer doing a giant simulation.
*  So just because for us humans, it's slow, there's like trillions of organisms involved in you,
*  destiny being you. Sure. But the next iteration of like from human to human,
*  even if on the quantum level, there's a lot of stuff going on, you talk about like changes in
*  DNA, for instance, right? Like that's happening from a generation to generation time scale. Like
*  in a virtual environment, that could theoretically happen. Well, it already is, there's like protein
*  folding, like huge cloud computing, probably ML stuff that's like working on doing all that stuff.
*  And it'll run like trillions and trillions of simulations, you know, every second and stuff,
*  maybe not every second, but still slower than the actual protein folding much slower.
*  That's for the problem of solving protein folding to estimate the 3D structure,
*  but the actual body does the actual protein folding way faster. So like we're,
*  the question is, can we shortcut the simulation of human evolution, try to figure out how to build
*  up an organism without simulating all the details? Because we have to simulate all the details of
*  biology were screwed. We don't have, oh, sure. We'd have to put something in a pond and then
*  watch it for that might be the way to do it. Sure. That's what the universe most likely is,
*  is a kind of simulation created by a teenager in their basement to try to see what happens. It's a
*  computer game. That might be the most efficient way to create interesting organisms, but within
*  the system is perhaps possible to create other robots that will be of use and will entertain us
*  in the way that other humans entertain us. And that's a really interesting, of course, problem,
*  but it's surprising how difficult it has been to create systems that operate in the physical world
*  and operate in that physical world in a way that's safe to humans and interesting to humans.
*  Because there's also the human factor, the human robot interaction. To me, that's
*  like the most interesting problem to figure out how to do that well. And so Elon Musk and others,
*  Boston Dynamics have worked on legged robots. So I really care about legged robots. Those are super
*  interesting how to make them such that they're able to operate successfully in dynamic environment.
*  Super tricky. They're like the dumbest of dogs, speaking of which, there's a dog barking outside.
*  It's really tricky to create those kinds of organisms that live in the human world. Then
*  again, if more and more of us move into the digital world, so you stream a lot. Like part of who you
*  are exists in the digital space. The fact that you have a physical representation also,
*  maybe more and more will become not important. I hope that's the case because I bought a lot
*  of stock in Metta and man, it's down a lot. Metta the company. Is there some degree,
*  like can you look at yourself like Stephen, the physical vehicle, and then the destiny,
*  this digital space, like digital avatar. Do you sense that in a certain way, you're the digital
*  avatar? I've always tried to keep my on-stream personality as genuine as possible. So they're
*  one and the same to me. I don't really view them as two separate entities. But I mean, I always do
*  myself as Stephen, the real life person. My destiny is my online name. No, but because so many,
*  your social network is established in the digital space, like so many people know you through the
*  digital space. Can there be, can we swap out another person that looks like you
*  in like an AI system? And then that entity known as destiny will continue existing.
*  There must be some level of sophistication that could emulate a human brain, I would imagine,
*  right? Probably tech's not there yet, but. Well, the question is, what's the level of
*  sophistication of the audience that would recognize that something has changed?
*  Yeah. How hard is it to trick your audience, your large audience of fans that watch your streams,
*  that when you swap out an AI that emulates you, that nothing has changed? And the question is,
*  do you have to really simulate so much of the human brain for that? I don't think so.
*  Probably not. And so, I mean, like you said, a lot of political discourses, just walking down
*  the tree together. So you can probably emulate a lot of that discussion. Yeah, it would depend on
*  if you're doing old data sets and you're training on that and I'm having conversations about
*  abortion and you're creating vaccines, I imagine it could do it for quite a while. The only thing
*  that would be weird is when novel issues pop up, then you probably need a more sophisticated
*  resemblance of the inner brain, right? You have to keep training on the internet. So how the
*  language models, and that's the most incredible breakthrough is the language models. You just
*  have to keep retraining the system. And so, I mean, I think that's the biggest challenge.
*  Training the system on Reddit, which is actually what a lot of it is trained on, which is hilarious.
*  I do think it's really interesting that funny problems like the trolley problem that we can
*  work through our normative ethical systems on are now real questions. If you're driving a Tesla and
*  it's on autopilot and you're going to hit somebody but it can swerve and hit somebody else, what
*  ought the system do? We went very quickly from fun project and philosophy class to, we need to solve
*  this for insurance purposes as quickly as possible. It's kind of interesting to think about.
*  Actually, I'll bring up the trolley problem with you later. There's a fascinating version of it
*  that I find hilarious. Okay, let's return to your low point. Oh, yeah. You started playing
*  video games. That was a lucky break. You did text-based ones. That was a lucky break because
*  you've gotten to be pretty good at learning. And then you started thinking about going to
*  college and so on. What happened next? I mean, I went to like a prep school. So you kind of
*  have to go to college after. That's like the point, right? I was also a millennial. All of
*  us had to go to college. That's always what they told us. So my life was kind of, it's hard to
*  describe. I didn't really think much of the future. I was just kind of enjoying the day to day because
*  everything in my life was pretty weird. Both my parents had moved to Florida by the time I was 16,
*  17. I was living with my grandma. I was working. I had a girlfriend, moved out. We got a place,
*  did college. By the time I got into college, I had transitioned from working at McDonald's to,
*  I was working at a casino restaurant basically. I was really good at that job. So high level of
*  patience for drunk people, insane people. I was doing music in school because I've really grown
*  to love music. My thought process was I can do music as a hobby, I guess, unless I get really
*  good and maybe I can make money with that. But otherwise, I love music. I'm okay going to school
*  for music, getting good at it, and then just doing that on the side. And then my main job would kind
*  of be this career I was building at the casino. And basically, trying to balance personal life
*  plus graveyard shift, six day or weeks at a casino and then a full-time music degree was not possible
*  for me. And eventually I had to drop school after I think it was like three years. And after I dropped
*  school to maintain my casino job, after a few months, I got fired from my casino job. So I'd
*  essentially just thrown away the past three or four years of my life. Why did you get fired from the
*  casino job? I heard there's a story behind that. Yeah, there's a story. Basically, I was just really
*  dumb when it came to understanding corporate politics. And this is funny because the same
*  attitude kind of followed me into the streaming world. My thought process has kind of always been
*  that as long as I'm really good at what I do, I should be untouchable. If I'm really good,
*  you can't do anything to me. I don't have to play any dumb games or whatever. And at the casino,
*  I think I was the youngest, it was originally shift lead then supervisor position at the casino.
*  And when I started to get my own shifts, there were problems that I would run into on graveyard
*  shift because of carryover from the swing shift. Number one of these problems was underneath the
*  soda machine, they weren't cleaning it properly and fruit flies were showing up. And I might the
*  manager came in one morning and she was like, Hey, what's going on with the machine? And I was like,
*  Listen, I can't do I can't take everything from swing shift and do everything in grave shift. I
*  can't do this. They need to figure out their stuff better or I need more employees. It's not possible
*  for me. And she's like, What did you tell anybody else? Yeah, I complained to the supervisor,
*  on the swing shift all the time. And she told me, if you're not getting the answer that you like,
*  then it's your responsibility to email the next person up. And I was like, Okay, that's interesting.
*  And some months went on. And I ran into more problems because on graveyard, here's how I don't
*  know if it's everywhere. But morning shift is the easiest. And that's when you're the most overstaffed
*  because that's when all the VPs are in. And that's when all the managers are there and everybody blah,
*  blah, blah. Swing shift is the most challenging. That's where your highest flow of customers is.
*  You're also decently staffed there. But there's a lot of stuff going on. And graveyard, nobody
*  cares at all about you. They don't give you any employees, you might get swamped, you might not,
*  who cares? Make sure it's clean for day shift. That's the only thing that matters.
*  Quick question. First, sort of clarification. So this is 24 hour, 24 hour dinner, yeah,
*  casino. Yeah. So the dining in a casino. Oh, by the way, I had an amazing moment, a dining in a casino
*  recently. It's a special place. A dining in a casino is a place of magic. There's a lot of
*  I don't know if I'd say magic, but there's a lot of otherworldly stuff going on. There's characters,
*  there's, and the, I had an interaction with a waitress that was the sweetest waitress in the
*  world. And I was just like, I don't know, it made me feel less alone in this cruel world of ours.
*  So graveyard begins when? For me, my shift was 10pm to 6am. Or sometimes I get called in early,
*  so it'd be 8pm to 6am. That's no love for that shift. No, especially not trying to do school at
*  the same time. Absolutely not. But yeah, basically, long story short, I ran into a problem with my
*  where I didn't have enough employees on my shift. VPs were coming in in the morning, they're
*  something like, hey, the diner is kind of dirty. And I'm like, you've cut all my employees past
*  4am. Like on some nights, I'm literally cooking and doing front of house, like all on my own,
*  like I can't do this. And my manager Pam told me, well, you got to figure it out. And so I
*  remembered her advice. So I emailed the VP of food and beverage and I CC'd her and I said,
*  I'm not getting the help I need in my restaurant. Now, I didn't know at the time that I was basically
*  completely throwing her under the bus because of that email. But I retroactively when I look back
*  on things, or retrospectively, I see that was the moment that I got like marked for deletion.
*  And I didn't really understand it, even though I'd heard terminology for papering somebody out the
*  door. But after that point, I started to get written up for like a lot of little random things
*  like I'll come like I missed one day of work in my three years at the casino. And I started to get
*  written up for like showing up like one or two minutes late. That's kind of weird. That's
*  whatever, or written up for random ways about filing paperwork. And then eventually there came
*  a situation with another employee where they were, it's complicated, I still like call it so but
*  basically they wanted to come or they wanted to call out. And I told them if they called out,
*  they were gonna get fired because they were at like 10 points, they were at nine points and 10
*  points is firing blah, blah, blah. Pam told me, you can tell her that she's going to get a point,
*  but you can't tell her she's going to get fired. I don't know what that meant. And then I told her
*  that if you call out, you're going to get you know, you're fucked, you're going to get fired,
*  or you're going to be at 10 points. And then I got called in early like three days later. And Pam was
*  like, you inappropriately communicated with an employee because you said the f word in a text
*  message. And I'm like, really? There's no shot. And she's like, well, you also tried to fire the
*  employee. And it's like, no, I told her she was going to get 10 points. She's like, well, you use
*  the f word. This is insane. And I didn't just because I was such a high performing employees,
*  like there's no way I'm getting fired. And then I did. And I was like, yeah, cashed out my 401k
*  and moped for like three months, because I had thrown away school for this casino job. And then
*  I got fired from this job that like, yeah, nobody believed I got fired. It was just insane.
*  Yeah. So if you look back, if you were allowed to not just to look back to your own memory,
*  but actually watch yourself, like some of your quarter video that whole time,
*  do you think you would be surprised you would notice some things that potentially
*  of not having a self awareness, not having like social, like a civility and social etiquette
*  that's played in the human relations? Yeah, absolutely. So is that is that at the core of
*  it essentially? Yeah, I think so. I mean, it follows me even to this day, there's a lot of,
*  I don't know if you're recording or not. But when we spoke early about like meta conversations,
*  I have to think a lot sometimes about meta conversations, because the way that I want
*  to drive a conversation will sometimes be way different than what is like the best way to have
*  a conversation. Whereas I just want to like, go really hard on like some itty bitty, like
*  some idiosyncrasy, some factor figure, whatever. But that's not like the human conversation I need
*  to have, you know? So you got fired, slash left that job, and that took you to the job that would
*  be the lowest point? Yeah, there was a huge downgrade in pay. I went from getting like,
*  I think at the casino, because I worked so much overtime, I was in like 2250 an hour on all my
*  overtime fifth. And this was back in 2008 2009, as like a college student, like amazing pay.
*  The I had benefits, like everything was good. And then the carpet cleaning was like,
*  I was probably getting my paycheck, like every other week was maybe 1500 bucks or $1,000. And
*  I'm working like 13 day stretches, like I have every other Sunday off. And it's so many hours,
*  like I have to show up at the shop at like seven or six. And then I go home at like eight or nine,
*  depending on when my jobs are throughout the day, you doing businesses or residential? Or what are
*  you doing? Everything? Everything? Are you working for a company this company? Yeah. Okay, so like,
*  there's a schedule thing, you have to go to it and so on. Yeah, but so like, this is why the
*  schedule would suck is sometimes I'd show up at, I think we had to be in the shop at I think it was
*  seven am, we show up at the shop at seven am, first job might be at eight or nine. But that job might
*  be like a one hour job. So I might show up at seven am and have a job from 830 to 930. Then my next
*  job might not be from until like, say 11. So from 830 to 930, I'll do one job. And then I've got a
*  job from like 11 to 12 or something. Then I might have like a decent job from like five to eight.
*  But like my whole day is destroyed. And I'm doing like three smallest jobs. So I'm getting like 30
*  bucks maybe for being in the shop or, you know, my job for like 10 or 11 hours. And it's just like
*  horrible. So you're somebody that seems to be extremely good at thinking and conversation.
*  And so have a bit of an ego perhaps, in both the negative and the positive sense of that word.
*  Was there some aspect of working at McDonald's and then working at the casino and then working
*  for the as a carpet cleaner that was humbling? No, never. No. I had a... The ego burned bright
*  through it all. The well... Or no, you can push back on the ego. Yeah, no, I understand. I totally
*  get what you mean. I had a really close friend growing up whose name was Chris. And I think we
*  probably met when he was we were like four or five, I think he lived behind me. And I grew up with
*  him. And I'd always been kind of an outsider to the world that I was in once I got to high school,
*  for sure. Because all of those kids were incredibly wealthy, you know, Corvettes and Mustangs when
*  they turned 16. It was a prep school. And I was doing the they have like a work study program
*  there where you could stay after school from 230 to five every day to kind of like work to pay for
*  your tuition. So I've been working like throughout all of high school, I got another job at McDonald's
*  when I was 18 worked at the casino, like I'd always been doing that kind of work. I never really
*  viewed it as like beneath me or anything. It's not like I don't have like a family of doctors or
*  lawyers or anything. And then me and my other friend, Chris guy, we'd always make fun of
*  everybody else for being kind of like, you know, like preppy kids and everything. So
*  so there is a there's some pride to that sort of hard work. Yeah, I guess a little bit. Yeah,
*  because, you know, looking especially my dad, like the solution to every problem was just throw more
*  hours of work at it, basically. So that was always my go to. And I never was psychologically the low
*  point. I think psychologically, the low point was that as I'm doing this carpet cleaning job,
*  driving around my city, there's like this feeling of I guess for a lot of people is probably college,
*  but there's a feeling when you're in high school, that everything is like so exciting, and the whole
*  world is kind of in front of you. And there are a trillion trillion different branching paths of
*  possibilities. And you know, even through high school, you're thinking like, am I going to be a
*  doctor or a lawyer? Or can I join the NBA? Or can I do this or that? There's all these things in
*  front of you. And when I especially felt it when I was doing these carpet cleaning jobs, and I think
*  it was in the fall, I'd be outside some of these houses, and I just kind of look around. And I'd
*  recognize a lot of these neighborhoods that I drive around with friends in, or I'd, you know,
*  be walking through I did, I ran cross country, some of them might be running through these
*  neighborhoods. And it was just kind of like this feeling of looking around. And it was like,
*  when I was here in the past, this is like kind of like a transitionary phase of my life,
*  where I'm doing this, and it's so fun and exciting, and then I'm going to move on to
*  something else, and it's gonna be fun and exciting and awesome. And then like, you know, two years
*  later, my whole life has collapsed. Like I'm in a house that I can't afford anymore. My ex that I
*  hate is pregnant with my kid. And I have no money. I've got no upward mobility. I failed college.
*  My job is horrible. Like just every single like this is like my all of those, the wave function
*  had collapsed into one thing. And that one thing was the worst thing that could have possibly been
*  at the time for me. Yeah, like everything was gone and horrible. So yeah, that was the feeling I had
*  at the time. Do you ever contemplate suicide? I thought about thinking about it, but I've just
*  never been that kind of person. So I mean, basically as a way to escape from the hardship,
*  something that I'm so incredibly lucky, I don't know why or how I'm just going to chalk it up to
*  biology. I've always had really high mental baseline. I've like depression and all of that.
*  There have been a few short stints I've dealt with it past 30 because I did a lot of drugs.
*  But other than that, my mental baseline is just so high. And even in the carpet cleaning days,
*  like if you man the videos might still be there. I think on my old YouTube channel channel where
*  I'll be like playing Starcraft when I first started getting a streaming and I'll be calling
*  up customers like this is Steve from guaranteed clean. We had to move your job back one hour. Is
*  it okay if I show up instead of 230? And then I hang up. It's like, all right, guys, we got three
*  more games. And it's like, let's go like stuff like that. So my baseline has always been like
*  really high for mental function. So even in the low point, there's that you had strength. Is there
*  is there anything you can give by way of advice from people that for whom the wave function
*  collapses as it does for many of us? Like, holy fuck, the world is not full of opportunity. And
*  you're kind of a failure. And like, I've been there. Yeah, I don't know. It's rough because like,
*  I usually ask for compassion from people that have it better off. Because like, once you're down
*  there, like the only reason I say I got lucky, but it wasn't even really lucky, like, or it was
*  lucky, but it was more lucky. It wasn't just lucky that I got into streaming. It was lucky that I was
*  into computers at an early age. It was lucky that I played video games at an early age. It was lucky
*  that all the tech came up at exactly that right point in time. Like I was a pretty smart guy,
*  but it was definitely preparation meets opportunity. And that opportunity was like at the exact
*  precise moment of my life. If anything had gone differently than I would just be cleaning carpets
*  today. So in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, this is like one out of like,
*  there's many, many Stevens, they're just still carpet cleaning. And they're full of pain and
*  resentment. Yeah. The one piece of advice that I give, I hate that I have to push back against all
*  these crypto bros and everybody online for decently intelligent people that are successful. I've never
*  heard anybody give a contradiction to this. Maybe you will. You can tell me if you disagree.
*  I always look at kids in high school and I'm like, just try a little bit harder, like 30 minutes a
*  night. If you don't study, just do 30 minutes, just do a little bit more. It is, you are laying
*  the foundation for the rest of your life and you can't appreciate it in high school and college,
*  but oh my God, when you get out, everything in your life is so much easier. You have probably
*  more responsibility over the direction of your life when you're like 13, 14 years old than you
*  ever will once you're like 25 and older, because this is like when you're determining the foundations
*  that everything's going to be able to. Yeah, 100%. First of all, it does seem that
*  the liberating aspect of being young is like anything you learn. So working hard at learning
*  something will pay off in like nonlinear ways. Like you said with video games, I feel like,
*  so like people who are like, I hate school. All right, well, fine. But find something
*  where you're challenging yourself, you're growing, you're learning, you're learning a skill,
*  you're learning about a thing. Of course, you could push back and say, well, there's some
*  trajectories that might not be productive. Like if you spend the entirety of your teen years
*  playing, I don't know, League of Legends, a game you have love and hate relationship with.
*  No, just a hate and hate relationship. Okay, well, we'll talk about, I think you have a love
*  hate relationship with hate in general. We'll just talk about it in love. We'll try to
*  de-complexify that one. I think in general, just investing yourself fully with passion
*  really does pay off. But that said, also school, I feel like doesn't get enough credit, like high
*  school in particular, middle school and high school, because it's general education.
*  If I think if you're, especially if you're lucky to have good teachers, but honestly, I haven't
*  mostly, the textbooks themselves were good teachers. It's a one chance in life. You have to
*  really explore a subject. Fuck grades. Getting good grades is at tension, I would say, with
*  actual learning. That is true. But just get a biology textbook and to explore ideas in biology
*  and allowing yourself to be inspired by the beauty of it. Yeah, I don't know. I think that
*  really, really, really pays off and you never get a chance to do that again. And maybe not even
*  textbooks, like reading, straight up reading. I think if you read, this is one time in life,
*  you get a chance to read, really read, like read a book a day read. You can really invest,
*  you can really grow by reading. I'm gonna ask all those guys, talk about it. It's very, very rare
*  that you meet a dumb person who reads a lot. I don't know if that's ever happened in my life.
*  Dumb or not successful. And the cool thing is, it seems like the reading, it's like investment,
*  the reading you do early on in high school pays off way more than the reading you do later.
*  So like the really influential reading is during those high school years, because you're basically
*  learning from others, the mistakes they've made, the solutions to problems. You're basically
*  learning the shortcuts to life. Like whatever the hell you want to do. Music, read from the best
*  people that the music theory, like learn music theory, learn, read biographies about jazz
*  musicians, blues musicians. See their like, see all the mistakes, see what they did, see the shortcuts.
*  If you want to do podcasts and read about other podcasts, if you want to do streaming, read about
*  the streamers, physicists, and so on. I feel like you figure out all the mistakes and you get to
*  shortcut through life. Because most people show up to college without having done that.
*  And now you get a chance to shortcut your way past them. Yeah, 100%. But nobody really teaches
*  you that. They're like, go to school. From this time to that time, shut up. This is just what you
*  do. Eat your broccoli. I think it's like there's two huge problems. One is now that I'm older,
*  because you don't know anything as a kid. You can't really criticize as an adult as a kid,
*  because you're a kid. By the way, you're ageist, if I may say so. I am. I am super ageist. As I
*  get older, I get even more ageist. There are a lot of people where I argue with them like, man, dude,
*  you're really 22, aren't you? I can tell every word you say. There's a seaps of like 22 year
*  oldness, but that's okay. I love that for you. Yeah. No, I could just say, because you mentioned
*  this, your wife is a fellow streamer, Melina. You mentioned that this is a source of fights
*  for the two of you that, and I could just feel that. There is truth to what you're saying,
*  which is like, all right, you're saying that because you're 22. Just wait until you're 25,
*  and you won't be saying that anymore. Now, that is the most annoying thing for people to hear.
*  Yeah, you can't ever say that, of course. Because it's actually usually true,
*  because we do go through phases in life, and you can understand that most things are phases. So
*  just in general, you can say, just wait, just wait. You won't see this. You won't feel this way.
*  Again, I could say that to you. You could say that to yourself. Just wait. Whatever you're
*  feeling like, just wait. In five, 10 years, it'll be a different person, and you will laugh at the
*  things you take seriously now, that they're causing you pain now, all that kind of stuff.
*  But people hate hearing that. Anyway, absolutely. I think the joke that I always say is like,
*  if I could literally step into a time machine, and I could come back out and see myself as a 17 year
*  old, and I could say, hey, I am literally you from the future. You see the time machine, and I would
*  look at me and I would see the time machine, and I would give myself the best advice in the world,
*  to be the most successful person, I would ignore all of it. Even knowing it came from myself,
*  I'd be like, this guy sold out. This dude doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. Now I'll
*  figure it out better. He must have made some mistakes. That's what I would think is a 17.
*  Even though I knew it was myself from the future, I would just 100% never believe it. Knowing that
*  is very frustrating. But I keep that in mind when I deal with younger people. That's why I always
*  stay on stream when I'm talking to, there's been stuff with Sneak-O, there's another girl on my
*  stream called Lab. When I see the mistakes they're making, oftentimes, because I've made all of these
*  mistakes, sometimes in the most public and horrible fashion ever. But I'm never like a mentor. I'm
*  not going to sit there and tell you, oh, do this or that or that or that. Because I don't know if
*  you're going to listen to me, and I don't want to condescend to you. You figure stuff out,
*  I'll be here if you want to talk about it. But yeah. There was one of those stories, there was
*  a company that didn't work with me because I was very adamant on defending very radical notions
*  about language and racial slurs and everything when I was 22 or whatever. There was a company,
*  and they said, well, we don't want to work with this guy for an event. After they'd said that,
*  I had written an article on my website called, the company was Gigabyte, they make motherboards.
*  I said, fuck Gigabyte in the ass. That was the title to my article. And it was like, well,
*  they don't want to work with me, I'm going to blow them up and never do anything ever with them
*  again. And it was just like, looking back at it now, obviously, as an older person, like, hey,
*  you need to pump the brakes and chill. You're destroying yourself. But yeah, as a young person,
*  it's like, yeah, you're 22. Of course, you think that you can say whatever and do whatever. And as
*  long as you're good at what you're doing, you've got the whole world behind you. And yeah, geez.
*  Well, let's go there. You have a history of using offensive language, like the R word, the N word,
*  including the N word with a hard R, calling women bitches, talking about rape in a nonchalant way.
*  What part of that do you regret? And what part of that do you not?
*  Language is very complicated. When it comes to stuff relating to slurs,
*  there's been like a whole trajectory of feelings on everything related to language. So my-
*  For you personally, and for the internet as a whole?
*  Yeah, I don't care about the internet. For me personally, in my early 20s, I'll say like 22,
*  23, I think probably when I first started streaming, my feeling is that any word is just a word. And if
*  it hurts you, that's your fault. Take responsibility for yourself. This probably came from my background
*  of being like a really independent person. So that's just kind of like the mind that I had for
*  everything. And there were basically, there were like a collection of experiences that I had,
*  that as I grew, I started to realize like, okay, well, I feel differently about some of these words,
*  depending on the context, and I can see how they can affect other people depending on the context.
*  So as I've kind of like grown, I think I've developed a more sophisticated understanding of
*  how different words are used and how they affect people, whether they like it or not,
*  and more importantly, whether I like it or not. And that words can, even if I don't want it to be,
*  they can be a vehicle for emboldening certain types of ideas that I don't want to embolden.
*  And yeah, that's kind of been the whole like growth. I've been lucky that in the time that
*  I came up on the internet, I was able to learn these lessons. Because if I was trying to learn
*  those same lessons today, I would have been completely destroyed because I had insane
*  views on language like 10 years ago. We could talk about the past, we could talk about the
*  present. Let's talk about the past first. So how do you deal with the fact that there's videos of you
*  in the past saying the N word, including the N word with a hard R.
*  So generally-
*  And what's the context? Can you give me like, in your memory, what would be the context usually?
*  When I lay out this defense, it's not because I wouldn't have used the N word.
*  Generally, whenever I said the N word, it was usually in an example of like, this is something
*  that like a racist person would say. I don't think I've ever on the internet, I don't think
*  I've ever called anybody like the N word with a hard R. Not because I wouldn't have, but just
*  because it wasn't in my vocabulary. I played RTS, real time strategy, and we use the F slur for gay
*  people. That's the one. I use that one a ton. I've called people that a ton in the past.
*  So I should actually just as a small tangent-
*  Yeah, go for it.
*  And this is what I'd like to explore with you. There's a ruthlessness to the language
*  in the gaming world. And there's different communities, they have different flavors
*  of language- Of hate speech, yeah.
*  Of hate speech, essentially. And there's also a humor to it, which really bothers me in a dark
*  way that I haven't been able to really think through. Because humor seems to be a kind of
*  catalyst for hate. It seems to normalize hate. Like you say, basically it's like Louis C.K. says
*  a lot of edgy things. But you take something Louis C.K. says and do it in a non-funny way
*  and do it over and over and over and keep increasing the hatefulness of it, the vitriol.
*  And somehow you find yourself like Alice in Wonderland in a world full of hate, where there
*  is no good and evil. It's all the same. In fact, the good is to be mocked and the evil is to be
*  celebrated for the humor of it. Basically not taking the ideas of evil seriously.
*  It reveals something about human nature that you can let go. The moral relativism that
*  can happen when you do that kind of stuff. At the same time, I'm a fan of dark humor
*  when done well. Anyway, for people who are not familiar, I just wanted to mention that some of
*  the worst hate speech that ends in LOL happens in gaming communities. And that's where you come from
*  in certain parts. A lot of people don't remember this or don't know this because they're younger,
*  but way back in the day in the late 90s, early mid 2000s of the internet, the way that online
*  kind of like shit talk worked was you were just trying to ramp up to the most insanely edgy,
*  crazy stuff you could say to like provoke a reaction. Have you ever heard of something
*  called the aristocrats? That it's like a joke, the joke. Oh yeah, the joke. Yeah, there's a movie on
*  it. Yeah. Okay. Basically every single like shit talk back and forth on the internet was like that.
*  Like what is the most increasingly depraved and back then you didn't get banned for slurs or
*  anything on any of these chat rooms. So it was just like insane world to walk into. And I was
*  fully 100% a part of a product of and a contributor to that world. So that probably still goes on on
*  the internet in some way. And that probably still goes on the internet in a maybe more pacified way.
*  Only in darker parts of the internet. I'd say for the most part, most well compared to back then,
*  compared to 20 years ago, the internet is way cleaned up now. There are still going to be boards
*  you can go on or parts of the internet where you see that type of humor, but not nowhere near as
*  mainstream. Like back then you could open your mic on Xbox live and hear some insane stuff when
*  that first started nowhere near what you'd hear today. Although there are still elements of
*  escalation that happen. That just seems to be part of human nature on the internet.
*  Because we don't get the feedback of actually hurting people directly. So the trolling,
*  like for the lulz, you'll do like whatever, like you will still escalate within the bounds.
*  You're just saying that there's more bounds now on Reddit, there's more bounds and so on.
*  So there's moderators that kind of yell at you, that ban you and so on if you cross those bounds.
*  But overall that basic human instinct to escalate, especially under the veil of anonymity,
*  is still there. I don't know, it's dark. It's dark. Yeah, there's a lot of different ways to
*  look at it and there's different ways you can break that art. Like for instance, you mentioned
*  dark humor and you say that sometimes dark humor is funny and sometimes it's not. I think that it's
*  really important to dig into and figure out why certain things are funny. Can I give you an example?
*  Yeah, go. It's from your subreddit. Oh boy. No, that made me laugh and I felt wrong about it.
*  Oh no. So this is... I already know what this is, yeah. Yeah. So this is a trolley problem. To me,
*  it connects because I think about the... It keeps, because I worked on autonomous vehicles,
*  the trolley problem, the philosophical thought experiment keeps brought up a lot.
*  When AI is part of making the decision, do I kill three people here or five people here?
*  And AI makes that decision, how do you do that calculus? And this particular... There's a
*  there's a deep... So it's satire that reveals some kind of flaw in society. I feel like that's what
*  dark humor does. Successful dark humor does. And I don't know if this... It's a flaw. I feel like
*  there's a certain brand of dark humor and I think the reason someone is why it's good
*  or why it is good humor, I think it's because I don't think it necessarily reveals a flaw. Sometimes
*  I feel like it reveals a kind of virtue, I think. If you look at this particular thing... Can I
*  explain what we're just listening? The title of the reddit post is, you know what to pick.
*  And it says, five people are going to die either way, but if you flip the lever, the trolley will
*  do a sick fucking loop first. And also the top comment is a question saying, which I think is
*  also part of the dark humor that's successful. Can I get the gender and ethnic backgrounds of
*  the groups first? And the top answer is both groups are each comprised of five white orphaned
*  cis male heavy meth users who are consistently in and out of drug rehab, all who identify as
*  right-wing extremists. Humor is such a sophisticated thing that we engage in. Humor is really
*  complicated. But I would argue that hopefully the humor here shows the virtue of this is obviously
*  horrible, but that's kind of why it's funny. It's funny because it's such a horrible question to ask.
*  Like, do we kill five people in a boring way or in a really entertaining way? And it's like,
*  that's really... And then when you ask even more, like, what are the ethnic backgrounds? Like,
*  that's even worse to say that, you know? So I feel like that's like the type of... There's a way that
*  you can engage with dark humor where it's like, oof, like, it's funny because it's so wrong and
*  so taboo. And we all know that it's wrong and taboo, and that's kind of where the shared laugh comes from.
*  So for me, the question that asking the diversity question is a sophisticated way of revealing the
*  absurdity of asking about diversity when it's talking about human life. Oh, interesting.
*  Because the way that I took that was I think it reveals the absurdity of how people will weigh
*  different ethnic backgrounds so differently when it comes to value of human life. Like, I'm actually
*  thinking of that in terms of like an immigration-related question where people are really keen and quick to
*  dehumanize like black or brown people. So like the question is like, well, if five of them are
*  brown and five are white, well, I know which one I'm going to, you know, pull the lever for. That's
*  how I read that. But it's satirizing that aspect. Yeah, exactly. Yes, of course. Yeah. But that's
*  what I mean, that that's the flaw. To me, at least, it showed that humanity or social networks that
*  are easy to be outraged and love the outrage and the chaos that Twitter and social networks will
*  pull that lever. Like they would they would always try to maximize the fun. And there's like a
*  there's a sick aspect to all the atrocities, all the tragedies that happen in the world
*  that we kind of always lean towards the outrageous narrative weaved around it. The
*  yeah, the one that leads to sort of the most clicks to the most attention to the most outrage
*  to all that. All that kind of stuff. So that that's almost like a satire of society. When they are
*  faced with tragedy, they will maximize trying to think of a word that's not fun. But entertainment,
*  maximize the entertainment. Yeah, this is a big criticism I give especially to conservative crowds.
*  You know, left leaning people, everybody doesn't. I don't like when people blame the media for the
*  state of the media today. I very much believe that everything in society is a feedback loop
*  and that if you're really unhappy with the state of the media, I think that the media is a good
*  reflection for what people want to see. Because there is a room right now in the United States
*  where somebody could start a company where all they do is completely factual reporting, they don't
*  have a political slant, and they're not giving you these like sensationalist narratives or stories,
*  and that media company would fail in two weeks because people don't want to see that. Generally,
*  people really want to see the like show me the guy that really believes in what I say,
*  that calls the other guy an idiot, the guy that are screaming on TV or on the radio like this is
*  what I really want. And people will engage in that. And that feedback loop will continue for
*  generations. And then all of a sudden people are like, why is the media so biased? Why is the media
*  driving so many narratives? And I was like, well, what do you mean? This is exactly what you want to
*  see. And that's that's frustrating for me. That's one of my big kind of when I defend establishments,
*  or when I talk about like, the interplay between citizen and, and all these institutions we have,
*  that the institutions are very much a reflection of the population, at least in democratic societies.
*  And I think that people very much try to elude the personal responsibility or the country's
*  responsibility to why some of them look the way that they do. But that takes us back to the n
*  word with a hard r. Sure. Why? For the particular examples that I was giving for the particular
*  conversations that I was having, if you're going to have challenging conversations around certain
*  words, I think you should probably be able to say them. Otherwise, it feels really ridiculous to me.
*  That's like, do you still believe that? For common? Yes. And not like calling people those words,
*  but in having conversations about those words, I would say that I still believe that. Yeah.
*  But don't you think, as you said, that using those words
*  actually gives motivation and strength to people who have hate in their hearts?
*  I think depending on the context of what's going on, I think that that's going to be a big driver
*  in terms of how people are going to perceive or take it. So in a conversation about the n word,
*  I don't think I would normally say the n word, we would just talk about the word much the same way
*  that like, like, say, like in a movie, like in Django, they are people use the n word, should
*  that be censored in that movie? Or in the context of that movie? Is it being employed in a way where
*  these aren't good people, you're not supposed to like them. And that's what the audience walks away
*  with. Yeah, but that context is different than conversation. It feels like in conversation,
*  you using that word normalizes it. And that normalizing that word is going to make it easier
*  for people who use that word in a hateful way to use it. Same with the f word, the f slur. If you
*  use that casually and normalize it in a way that's not hateful, you use it in a way that's not hateful.
*  But the side effect is that normalizes it, then people who do use it in a hateful way
*  will be more likely to use it. Therefore, mathematically looking at the equation of the
*  number of times the n word or the f word is used throughout the world, it increases the number of
*  times it's used in a hateful way. Yeah, I think that human beings- And you're part of that problem,
*  Stephen. I don't agree. I understand the thought process, but I don't know if using certain words
*  within different contexts is going to necessarily normalize the hateful use of that word.
*  That is an argument that I've heard people use. Somebody will say like, okay, well hold on, that
*  should never be used ever. Because by virtue of you normalizing it, even in an inoffensive environment,
*  you increase the proclivity for people to use it in a potentially more offensive environment.
*  My argument is always like, no, I don't think that crossover exists. But if you did want to take that
*  argument, and maybe you do feel this way, I think that you get really problematic when you run into
*  communities that do use certain words that people would say, well, they should be allowed to do it.
*  So for instance, if you think that any utterance of the n word at all is highly problematic and
*  might increase hatred, then the entire rap industry has to dramatically change the way that they
*  engage with the n word. Obviously, a lot of people that criticize people's use of the n word aren't
*  going to turn to rappers and say, well, you guys can't say it either. No, it's who uses the n word.
*  So it's not just the word. It is context dependent. But I would say that you as a white person,
*  having conversations, the context there is the kind that would lead to an increase in hate.
*  Do you think the n word should be censored in the dictionary?
*  No. And I believe there's a Wikipedia page on it and it's not censored. Yeah, I think it should be
*  in the dictionary. I think the context of casual conversation, like I said, I just believe that on
*  the internet, having humor, having fun conversations as you have on your streams, that leads to the
*  normalization of the word without any educational value. I think I would agree with that.
*  Sorry. So there's a difference between f slur and n word and both, I think, should not be used in a
*  fun way. But the f word was used in a fun way for a long time. For sure. And I'll tell you something
*  that bothers me about your streams, your streams and basically every other stream, is the casual
*  use of the r word. Oh, the ableism. Yeah. I don't know if it's about the able. I don't even know.
*  No. Listen, it's complicated. I'm not like virtue signaling here. No, ableism isn't virtue
*  signal. I mean, it's a legitimate, yeah. Like I get emails from fans that say like, hey, like I deal
*  with this particular issue. Every time you use this word, it kind of feels like you're attacking
*  me. Like just like, so it's not, it's a valid concept. Yeah. It's just something cuts wrong for
*  me. Like for example, I'm not bothered by, I am bothered by the excessive use of the word f
*  okay. But not in the same way that moderate use of the word f. What is it? I'm curious. And when
*  somebody calls somebody an r word, what is it that, what is the feeling that you get that makes you
*  feel bad about it? It signals to me that you don't give a damn about people who are struggling
*  in ways that you are not struggling. Like that, that signals to me like about the experience of
*  others. Do you think that there are other words also that could convey like a similar feeling
*  to you or why? Cause it feels like you've drawn a pretty special circle around, cause like I imagine
*  I go, Oh, this guy's, you're an uneducated dumb fucker. You're a nitwicker. Like those words,
*  that circle keeps changing, which it can, which is fine. I think that's what the whole point with
*  the culture. So I'm trying to feel my feelings are kind of, you know, I'm a human being that
*  exists in a social context that we're all evolving that language together and just feels wrong. Like,
*  you know, the word bitch, for example, it really, but like I've heard on your streams and in general,
*  calling a woman a stupid bitch really bothers me, but it's not just the word bitch is context. Like,
*  for example, me personally, I'm speaking to me personally, like bad ass bitch
*  is different than stupid bitch. Bad bitch or something is different. Yeah, of course.
*  Way different. Sure. I think it speaks to a bigger sense of civility and respect for human beings
*  that are not like you. That's what that's, that's the feeling that I'm bothering. So I guess what
*  I'm trying to say here is just because people speak in this kind of way in the gaming world
*  and streams doesn't mean that you, like a lot of people look up to you. It doesn't mean young
*  people, especially doesn't mean that you don't have the responsibility to sort of stand alone
*  from the crowd is you're somebody that values the power of effective discourse and.
*  To be effective discourse, there is some level of civility, so you can be the sort of the beacon
*  of civility in that world versus giving into the derogatory words, because like you have to,
*  you have to lift people out of that world, out of the muck of.
*  What I would say is like drama in effective discourse is like, I think that's one of your
*  missions, right? It's like to inspire the world through conversation, through debate, through
*  effective discourse. So I guess I'm just calling you out that I think using our word for me
*  personally, as a fan that believes in your mission, it just makes you look ineffective and bad and
*  uninspiring to young people that look up to you. Because those young people are going to use those
*  words that you're using and they'll do it much less effectively.
*  The challenge is always just like finding the line. Like my vocabulary shifted dramatically from,
*  even from like two or three years ago, I think my vocabulary shifted quite a bit as we've like,
*  we've kind of gotten rid of some words and some things are kind of coming out. The R word is one
*  that has kind of gone out and come back and gone out and come back. That one we've definitely gone
*  back and forth on. I know there are different thoughts about it in different communities on
*  the internet. This is interesting. I mean, I'm just telling you, for me, I think that's the
*  This is interesting. I mean, I'm just telling you, for me, it cuts, and I'm not a social justice
*  warrior type. It cuts pretty hard. Like you're saying is I'm going to lose a subscriber if I'm
*  No, it's not. I'm just going to I know, I just I actually have to empathize harder because
*  I'm like, maybe this is not a very good person. That's what I feel. Like if you're so carelessly
*  using that word, then maybe you're not actually thinking deeply about the suffering in the world.
*  To be a student of human nature, you really have to think about other humans and other experiences
*  that are unlike your own. Yeah, of course. So that's the sense I get. But at the same time,
*  you're also like the grandpa, ages, who's trying to be cool with the young kids. A lot of the reason
*  young kids look up to you is like you're also know the language of the internet.
*  Yeah, but I mean, it doesn't that's not an excuse to use words that we think shouldn't be used.
*  I guess the question that I would have because it's always a struggle and to some extent,
*  it's kind of happened is let's say that like three years ago, I would have said I'm no longer
*  saying the artwork that's just I'm just going to get rid of that in my vocabulary. Like is there
*  a chance that today we would be having a conversation about like, why do you call people dumb fucks?
*  Is that really appropriate? Like this is attack at the core of like somebody's like level of
*  intelligence, education, opportunities in life? Like, is that where they you don't think so?
*  I think that's a as the kids say, cope. You really think so? I think because the words
*  have definitely moved in a way where it's like this was okay. Now it's not this.
*  So you're standing your ground by using listen, you could you could you could,
*  but I think it's better to use those words if you want to defend the ground word stand on
*  to use them rarely and deliberately versus how you currently use them, which is to express an
*  emotion like you I'm going to be honest, you use our word, not when you're at your best.
*  True. And so that's not that's generally that can be true for a lot of swearing to that. But yeah,
*  I know. No, but like, you know that our word is offensive, you know, and there's part of it is
*  like the you tell yourself that like, you're still kind of fighting political correctness by using
*  it a little bit when you say it. No, I don't think so. I think I'm trying to think in terms of like,
*  where is the virtue where like, there's a whole bunch of arguments for why some words are okay,
*  some words aren't okay, or whatever. And I try to like, think more along those lines rather than,
*  but like, there's going to be like a lot of phrases where like, if the our word has come out,
*  the conversation is over. I know that like things my brain is shut down the person I'm talking to.
*  But there's like, there's a lot of words also in terms of like, it like if you ever hear me say
*  like, fucking moron in a debate, it's like it's done like this conversation is over. There's no
*  way that anything productive is happening past that point. I think fucking moron is not, I think
*  ineffective. It's not civil, but it's not, it doesn't bother me in a way. It's basically when
*  you speak in a way that I know there's a group that's going to be hurt by that. Not only do I
*  think about the hurt that group experiences, I think of you as a lesser intellectual, like there's
*  a lesser person who's thinking about the world. What bothers me the most is just what kind of
*  mindset that inspires in young people. Especially when you're in a public figure
*  and a lot of people look up to you. So I definitely don't think sort of this idea,
*  the our word is not the battleground of expanding the Orton window of discourse.
*  Okay. Like I don't think it'll lead to dumb fuck being canceled two years later, unless that word
*  is hurting people's experience, which I don't foresee that happening. I think legitimately
*  our word and F slur and calling women bitches, it context matters here too. Like of course,
*  but just the way I've heard you use it, it is not, it's from emotion and it's from frustration
*  and it ultimately is rooted in disrespect. I don't, I think it's ineffective. And of course,
*  who gets to say, I don't know, but I'm saying somebody who would, like I admire effective
*  conversations and I admire great humor, dark humor, wit. To me, oftentimes the use of the R word
*  in the way you've used it in the way I see the community use it is none of those things. It
*  contributes not at all to the humor and so on. Now I could see it might contribute to the camaraderie
*  of that particular group, especially when they normalize the use of that word. You kind of take
*  some of the edge off, but you forget that there's a large number of other people that don't have the
*  chemistry, that don't hear the music of the friendship that you have, the relationship you
*  have. And instead they hear the normalization of a hateful word and it ultimately has an impact.
*  That's hateful. And then people like me who show up, you know, I haven't watched much of your stuff.
*  It turns me off from like a couple of times your content came before me and I listened to it a
*  little bit. It turned me off completely. I didn't understand how good your heart is. I didn't
*  understand how your mission of actually deradicalize people, help people, and increase the level of
*  good faith discourse in the world. I didn't understand any of that because like what I was
*  hearing is pretty rough, like the R-word type of stuff. And I just feel like the benefit cost
*  analysis is heavy on the cost. Gotcha. That's why I just have to sort of call this out.
*  And I straight up think it's wrong. But that's my own. Why do you think it's wrong?
*  Because it's hurting people without any benefit to you whatsoever. When you say hurting people,
*  do you mean the person I'm using it at or do you think there's like the affected third group?
*  The third group. It's good feedback, right? I always consider everything, especially I respect
*  you a lot. You're a really smart guy. Something that I always kind of like fight over in terms of
*  like language or like who to attack or what to attack or what to do is that it's very hard to
*  draw like what boxes are okay to insult people on versus what aren't. So for instance, if I call
*  somebody like a Nazi with a lot of vitriol, I am okay with every single Nazi being negatively
*  affected by that. Because that category intrinsically calls upon at some level of
*  moral condemnation for me, right? Whereas like if I'm out there, I try not to do like image related
*  jokes, right? I don't want to call you like, oh, you're a fat fucking loser. Because there's a lot
*  of people that are fat that are overweight, where I don't want them to feel bad. I don't want them.
*  I'm not trying to call you out or like insult you. So there's like a lot of you say cost benefit.
*  I like a lot of collateral damage from a word like that where there's no purpose in doing that.
*  So certain words are easy to get rid of, they're off the table, right? Epsler, N word, like these
*  are not words you call people because there's so much collateral, it's not worth it. We've got some
*  words where it's like, if you have some form of like mental thing, it is a bad thing, you're not
*  a bad person, but just using that word could feel like a collateral damage to those people.
*  And then there's other categories of words. So like, if I say that like, this person is like,
*  it's a stupid fucking Republican, right? There's probably some Republicans that
*  aren't dumb that I don't want to feel called out by that. Like, are those types of phrases that you
*  think should be completely removed as well? Or I'm kind of curious. So this completely removed,
*  just so we're clear. Yeah. I'm not referring to censorship. Oh, no, I'm not even talking about
*  this. I'm just just personally emotionally like removed is the wrong word, though. Like I care
*  about, like, I'm not trying to listen to people on the internet saying like, you shouldn't say that
*  word. That's not good. I mean, I'm trying to look to your mind and heart. The reason we're talking
*  today is you're betraying your gift. You're better than this. You think it's indicative of like a
*  more flippant thought process where it's like, the only way you can say that word is if you're
*  ignoring the hurt and suffering of those people. And if you're somebody that says, those people,
*  you're ignoring the state of language, because I think you're getting to the point because it's
*  not about a single word. It's about like, it's music. And I just feel like there is
*  all very strong note. It's a it's a strong note that ruins the melody. Gotcha. And I don't think
*  I can say, you know, you shouldn't use the R word or whatever. I'm just speaking to I'm just
*  listening to music and reviewing the final result. It's not necessarily because maybe one use of the
*  word, the R word strategically or part of an actual like, when you've built up a camaraderie,
*  that's sandwiched in in like, some love, but then you try to reveal their because you're talking
*  about a lot of there's a bunch of drama, you have a book you have friends with whom you're worrying
*  and stuff. And they're all a little bit beautifully insane. And you've said that you are becoming
*  more and more insane is beautiful to watch as the human condition laid before us. Wonderful. And
*  some of that is swearing and so on. So it's a tricky thing. But the whole skill of discourse
*  just like it is with dark humor is walking that line. I just feel like it's a overuse of the R
*  word. And I don't want to die in that ground because I don't think it's that that represent
*  like there's certain things like that. It feels like it ruins the music. And I don't, you know,
*  it's the same like a dumb Republican or dumb Democrat. I don't. Yeah, that ruins it too,
*  a little bit depends on how you use it. You can be lazy with that. You know, like even overuse of
*  the word I think bots is what's used for people who don't think or something. I don't actually
*  know the definition. I'm offended on behalf of robots. That might be a compliment soon.
*  Exactly. But I guess bot means you don't think. Yeah, you're like an NPC. You just copy. Again,
*  I'm offended on behalf of NPCs. I count myself as one. But there's a sense if you say bots too much
*  that you're just dismissing people like everything I say is right. And anyone that disagrees with me
*  is a bot. That's lazy too. Sometimes it's funny. Sometimes it's effective. Basically saying a lot
*  of people in the mainstream media or something like that are bots. Okay, that's a little bit
*  of that is effective. But too much it becomes ineffective. And I'm trying to speak to that.
*  Yeah, and I'm just the reason we're highlighting clear examples, like the n word.
*  Joe Rogan had to contend with that. I think it's ineffective. It makes you less effective at this
*  course. But like, like you've talked about many times, language is a tricky one. It's always hard
*  because you talk about like constructing a melody. There's not one melody that sounds good to everyone.
*  But there are probably certain notes that like if you got rid of them, everybody's still going to
*  like it about as much and you don't really lose anything. There's a whole other part of an audience
*  that might be more willing to listen. Yeah, of course. And it's not about losing the magic
*  of that melody. Like you don't want to be vanilla. I just feel like there's stuff that doesn't need to
*  be there. Yeah, for sure. It's fat. But then again, you're the other thing that people should understand
*  that might be listening to this. You're streaming many hours a day for many years. I don't know.
*  It's 11 or 12. I think. Yeah, started in 2010. And so one of the things that people can do is just clip
*  out anything. You're going through the full human experience of emotion, anger, fear,
*  frustration, all of it. So of course there's going to be moments when you're not the best version of
*  yourself. Anything else to say about the language? It's complicated. I'm still always trying to figure
*  it out. You know, there are opinions that I have that have changed throughout the years. It's
*  possible that the R word has always been the next one on the chopping block that we're all kind of
*  looking at, but people are always worried about that treadmill. But it's possible in a year or
*  two, I'll have a different view on it or all have changed away some of the words I use. And yeah,
*  it's definitely like a, it's always like a work in progress. There's always like different
*  communities that feel different ways about different words. Yeah. Yeah. But do you
*  acknowledge that there's people out there that are never going to talk to you? They're never going to
*  think of you as a good man because you use the N word with the hard R publicly. In the past? I
*  mean, yeah, those people exist, but I mean, there are some people that are beyond my reach,
*  which I'm okay with. Like there's going to be some people because of things that have been involved
*  or even ideas that I have now that might make them beyond my reach. Something you said earlier
*  is very true. I think the goal is to like identify what are the elements that you can cut out that
*  aren't integral to your message, but could be alienating to more people. And those are probably
*  the things that you identify. But I think that you can get lost in yourself or lost in the internet
*  or lost in the outside of yourself. If you're trying to appeal to every single person,
*  it's just never going to be the case. And for I actually, I like that I've had the journey that
*  I've had on the internet that you can find me saying and defending a lot of insane stuff 10
*  years ago, because I think it shows like a level of progress. And I think I do get a lot of respect
*  and buy into certain communities where it's like, I'm not just some random dude telling you that
*  like, oh, you shouldn't say the F word or the N word. Like I'm a guy that's been there, that's
*  done it, that's defended it. And you can see my whole past, my whole history is laid bare for you
*  to watch every of you know, thousands of hours of it. But I can show that like there's growth
*  and evolution and change that can happen in a person. So yeah, and you're honest about that
*  growth. It's tricky thing because people just call bring up stuff from your past. For sure.
*  I hope we figure out as a civilization, a mechanism to clearly say this was this was me
*  two years ago. This is me five years ago. This is a different person. And like,
*  because Twitter doesn't care about that. These social mechanisms that bring stuff up doesn't
*  care about that. It's like one stupid thing you say, it becomes like a scarlet letter.
*  And I don't know how to fight that. It's tricky to fight that. Have you ever seen men in black?
*  Yes. When KJ are on the bench and he says a person is smart, but people are stupid, dumb, finicky,
*  animal animals or whatever. There's something that changes for human dynamics when there is
*  a group of people that make it so hard to control. Like I think one on one, anybody can sit across
*  on somebody and admit to some horrible stuff. I used to be, you know, I abused my husband when I
*  was, you know, 20 and I'm 35 and I see what's wrong or I did this, I was addicted to whatever.
*  And you know, I made these mistakes. One on one, it's always easy. But in group environments that
*  in group out group tribalistic thing of like identifying one thing and then coming to destroy
*  a person's life is like, is such a huge like impulse we have. And I think probably when we
*  were like hunter gatherers in the forest, probably good because you really want to push weird people
*  out or anything like that. But now on the internet, when we can hunt for any dissenting opinion and
*  just with ruthless precision, destroy somebody's life over it is pretty scary dynamic. I think
*  one of the mechanisms that could fix it is make it super easy for each individual person to analyze
*  all the stupid shit they themselves have said in the past, like a full recording. Because I think
*  people are just honestly paint a very rosy picture to their own brain of, of who they have been in
*  the past. Yeah, of course. If we can have empathy for the fact that we've said stupid shit, or we're
*  drunk, the ridiculous things you say, the offensive things you might have said, the offensive things
*  you might have done. I just feel like that would give us the ammunition to have empathy for others
*  that are like, okay, yeah, this guy five years ago said this, maybe that doesn't represent them.
*  Doesn't represent who they are any more than stuff I said five years ago represents
*  who I am today. Yeah, I feel like technology can actually enable that. Maybe although you're talking
*  about more, more recording and more stuff which people are already wary of, but it's a double
*  edged sword. I think there's there is going to be more and more recording. We have to figure out how
*  to do that in the way that respects people privacy and gives them ownership of their data and so on.
*  I've looked at the search history I've done on Google, which for most people is available,
*  like your Google search history. It's fascinating to watch the evolution of a human being.
*  It doesn't seem like the same person. It's like a different person. For sure. It's weird. It's also
*  hard too with the internet today. I'm going to be agist again, but now all of the people are thrown
*  together. Whereas I don't want a 27 year old judging the language of a 15 or 16 year old.
*  Obviously he's in high school. There was that story that came out of the there was a kid that saved
*  a recording of I think it was some white girl. I think that she got her driver's license and she's
*  like I can drive now and words with the A or whatever. It was dumb. She shouldn't have said
*  it, but I think she was like 15 or 16 when she ticked talk this or whatever. And he held on to
*  that recording until she applied and got accepted to college three years later. And then he released
*  it to get her kicked out of college. And I'm like, damn, everything that I had ever said as like a
*  15 16 year old was like immortalized on the internet. My life wouldn't have even begun.
*  And those are insanely high standards to hold people to. Not that like obviously you shouldn't
*  be saying those. You shouldn't be saying certain words or whatever, but you have to be able to
*  make mistakes in adolescence like everybody does. We all did. Everybody did it growing up, you know.
*  Why do you think there is so much misogyny in the streaming community?
*  And how can you fight it? Because you've shown a lot of interest in fighting it,
*  trying to decrease or eliminate misogyny from your community.
*  I think it's really difficult. I think that eliminating racism is easier than eliminating
*  misogyny. On the internet you mean? On anywhere. Because I think fundamentally,
*  I don't think there's that much difference between like white people and black people and brown people
*  and Asian people or whatever. You know, we have different cultures and stuff, but at the end of
*  the day, we're all people. But I think there are differences between men and women, like throughout
*  all of history and time, and then even today in every culture. And when real differences do exist,
*  it's harder to account for them in a way that can we have conversations with each other without it
*  becoming very gendered in a negative way, right? Negative way of gendering something,
*  be it like a misogynistic way of doing it. Of course, it's unclear to me that it's so
*  difficult to avoid the negative gendering versus the positive, because there's a lot of positive to
*  the tension, the dance between the different genders and so on. Maybe in this particular
*  moment in history, it's not. But it's not trivial to me that racism is easier to eliminate. It's an
*  interesting hypothesis just because there's more biological difference between men and women. That
*  means it's harder to eliminate. But- I don't know if this is true. I hear this a lot. I feel like I
*  read this somewhere, but I need to get a better source for it. I've heard it like in the US
*  military, for instance, they've gotten exceedingly well, they do an exceedingly good job at getting
*  different people of different races to integrate. And it's like not a huge problem once you're
*  through basic training, all the training, everything. But for different sexes, it still
*  represents a significant problem that the military hasn't figured out. And I actually
*  looked at like, well, what's the military doing? Because if something was solvable,
*  can we sleep for four hours a night and be healthy? If we could, I bet the military would know. So I
*  kind of look sometimes to them to see their integration, but it might be that there are
*  other issues there that make it- Yeah, it feels like the military is a very particular kind of-
*  For sure. Yeah, it could be. The actual task at hand might bias the difficulty of the process.
*  Potentially, yeah. There's been a lot of interesting talk about like, women integrating
*  into male groups. And how do you do this in a way where everybody is happy with the outcome,
*  and there's not like issues? I think Jordan Peterson spoke about this a little bit. And then
*  workplace culture speaks about this a bit. Would you happen to remember, I want to say it was like
*  five or 10 years ago, there was a big tech conference, and there were two guys behind a
*  woman. And they made a joke about like a USB dongle, like dongle was a dick. And this woman
*  turned around, she tweeted pictures of them, spoke about like misogyny of it. And then that blew up
*  into a huge ordeal that like, yeah. There was this interesting phenomenon that in a less misogynistic
*  and more inclusive workplace environment, some women might end up feeling worse. Because in a more
*  misogynistic environment, you're thinking like, okay, that's a woman, she doesn't get our humor,
*  I'm going to treat her in a very indifferent, you know, very dispassionate, cold way, and whatever.
*  And then I'm gonna have my boys over here. And then you've got like these environments where
*  they're a little bit more warmer. And it's like, oh, cool, we're going to bring this woman into our
*  environment. And we're going to make all the same types of like crass jokes we did before.
*  And it's actually worse now another woman feels even more otherwise, because like, oh, my god,
*  why do you talk like this? I think that internet communities, especially online ones that do like
*  political debate and video games are very much like big boys clubs. So it's not enough to just
*  say you can't be misogynistic to get rid of misogyny, there's always going to be an othering
*  effect on women. There's a lot of like behaviors that are unintuitive that you have to account for
*  and you've got to try to like push that back. And that's just a very, very, very challenging
*  thing to do. So like, I like to deal with concrete examples more. So here's a concrete example.
*  And this is like a recent initiative in my community, because I'm trying to like be because
*  misogyny hasn't been fixed anywhere on the internet. I'm curious, well, there are ways that I can push
*  my community to do this. I don't think you should almost ever make a comment on a woman's appearance
*  ever if they're appearing in like some political or professional manner. Even if it's a positive
*  comment, I think it's equally bad to a negative comment. It's just never good to do. And that's
*  kind of an unintuitive thing because it's like, well, woman appears, wow, she's really cute. It
*  seems like a nice comment. You're being nice, you know, she looks good, but it's like, it's not at
*  all the point of why she's there. And just by saying that, you're kind of like otherizing her
*  as like a person to like think she looks good rather than listening to anything she has to say,
*  Well, there's a lot of stuff that you're saying and
*  that is a part of massaging. It's almost like obvious, like any woman will tell you that.
*  Woman will, yeah, but they're not in these spaces and a lot of the guys don't know.
*  I think what that requires is just empathy. You don't need, you don't need, you need to consider
*  the female experience. That's it. Like you have to either read about or talk with women. You learn
*  like the low hanging fruit is very easy to learn. It feels like just the level of social skill.
*  Oftentimes in internet communities is quite low. I disagree. I don't like to say here's the problem
*  with empathy is it's very hard to have empathy for experiences that are so outside of your own.
*  It, well, maybe some people, there might be some people that can do it. I can't. There's a lot of
*  stuff that I had to learn. Women are half the population, but they're women. They're totally
*  different. They're totally different. We'll talk about, we'll recto. They're not totally different.
*  Here's an example, okay? So especially for me, my archetype makes up a lot of the internet.
*  White man. There's never been a point- The name of a beautiful woman.
*  Who might be a dancer. What's the backstory? From New Orleans or from-
*  I haven't thought that through yet. It's ambiguous, okay?
*  Like an open world. Open world. I want you to project whatever,
*  wherever you want Destiny the dancer to be from. That's in your mind, okay?
*  All right. I'll save that for later tonight. Yeah. Okay. As a white guy, I don't know if
*  there's ever been a spot that I've been in where I've been made to feel like I don't belong there
*  just by virtue of who I am. I actually don't, it's impossible for me to empathize that because I
*  don't even have that experience. If you go back eight, nine years, one of the big issues that
*  came up was harassment and gaming against women. And I was one of the big debaters against that,
*  saying that like, sure, women might get harassment, but everybody gets harassment.
*  If you're a woman and you're in gaming and you get harassed, congratulations,
*  you're being treated like a man. What you're actually asking for is for us to actually treat
*  you differently. You don't want to be insulted. You don't want to be treated like a man. And that's
*  actually misogyny is women making that argument. Do you still stand by that? Is that a problem if
*  I do? No, I'm just kidding. Okay. Hold on. It's a little while after- I disagree with it. Sure.
*  Okay. That's good. You should. A little while later, I had a friend, Jessica, super cool girl,
*  we go to play games. She was between jobs. She's like, I've got like two months and we're going to
*  grind CSGO. And I'm like, okay, this is awesome. Let's do it. CSGO, Counter-Strike, Global Offensive,
*  shooter game, FPS, microphones. First day we start playing, okay. Hop into our first game.
*  Obviously she talks, everybody's making, is that a 12 year old boy? Why aren't you making sandwiches?
*  Blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Okay. Whatever. Play our first game, play our second game, same jokes,
*  third game, fourth game. By like the fourth or fifth game, I was actually starting to feel
*  triggered. Like every time the game started, I was like, can you just like talk so we can get
*  over like the stupid fucking jokes. It's so fucking stupid. And you hear the same fucking joke
*  every single time. And it took one day of that experience for me to realize it's not about being
*  insulted. It's like this othering feeling that you don't belong. And I've never felt that because
*  I'm a white guy. Like it's not to be like virtue singular, but like there's just, there's no places
*  where it's like, you're white, you don't belong here. You're a guy, you don't belong here.
*  Like I've never felt that non-inclusion. And playing with her, there's a different feeling
*  when it's the same types of jokes coming from a group of people to make you feel like you don't
*  belong there. Where I was like, damn, this actually feels really bad. And it feels bad in a different
*  way where it's like, if you call me like an F slur or any other type of swear word or insult,
*  like, yeah, you can call me that. But at the end of the day, like, we're all kind of the same. We're
*  all white dudes and we call each other names, but like, this is a woman and this is not her place and
*  she doesn't belong here. Kind of the analogy that I would make, because I, after getting these
*  experiences, I would learn this afterwards. If I tell you that there's another guy in a room and
*  you need to think of the worst insults ever for that person without ever knowing anything about
*  them or meeting them. If I tell you that it's like a white straight guy and you have to write insults,
*  you're fucked. Maybe you can do like school shooter, but there's not really much you can say
*  at the end of the day. But if I tell you it's a woman, we could, there are so many different
*  jokes you can write. If it's a black person, so many different racist things we can say.
*  Are you sure? I can come up with a lot of stuff for a white guy.
*  In terms of stuff that is just intrinsic to him being a white guy.
*  Yeah, like there's- Really?
*  Wait a minute. What are you talking about? There's a lot, the internet has sharpened that sword.
*  In terms of like jokes that are targeted at his sex or-
*  Incel, virgin, weak. Some of the incel, virgin, maybe. Yeah,
*  that's getting there. Sure. That's for sure. That's recent though. Sorry, I'm older on the internet.
*  We didn't have those words way back then. When I was making these analogies, that incel and virgin-
*  Back in my day, we didn't have generalitai- There were no incel back then. None of us had sex. We
*  just accepted it. We were all computer gamers. Nobody had sex and played video games back then.
*  People don't remember that. There wasn't the big bang theory. You were just a loser that was stuck-
*  You guys didn't even know sex existed. Exactly.
*  So you can use it as an incel. We had to download sexual
*  pictures and it was like two minutes and you didn't even know if you were going to get the
*  right thing by the time it finished loading. But what I'm saying is like, okay, I think you
*  agree that if somebody gives you a race, like a black person who's a woman, we can write very
*  cutting, scathing incel for that person that are very authorizing.
*  Words that would really hurt. Yeah, that are very cutting to the person. But like for a white guy,
*  it's kind of hard because that's like the default. There's not as much otherizing of those people.
*  Yeah. So the insults you have from white guy to white guy, the insults are much harsher.
*  So when you start to apply the same kind of harshness to other groups-
*  You can make them feel like they really don't belong. And that otherizing effect is something
*  that's very hard for me. I can't really empathize because I never felt it. So I have to intellectualize
*  it and then sympathize with it. It's like a whole process I have to go through. And then I try to
*  walk other people through that. Because if you're a white guy on the internet, which is a lot of the
*  internet, you really don't know what that feels like. You've never felt like that before.
*  So you're now in a leadership position, grandpa destiny. So that's a lot of people look up to you
*  for that, for that sort of pathway to empathy. Yeah. How not to otherize. I mean, you have felt
*  otherizing. You mentioned high school people like not being- Yeah, but those were always for
*  things that like, it's different to insult somebody for a non-immutable characteristic.
*  Like, okay, you think poorly about me because I'm like not enough money or I don't have money,
*  but I could get more money and I could change that. But it's different for somebody to really
*  attack you for like your gender or attack you for like your race. A lot of the attacks that hit the
*  hardest is not about gender. It's, it's, I do think that they're like the way women are attacked on
*  the internet, it's the same kind of attacks you would do towards other guys, but you go harsher.
*  I feel like they're fundamentally different. I feel like when we're attacking guys,
*  I'm not usually attacking you on like the virtue of you being a guy, but like if it's a woman and
*  she's typing something like, oh, did your boyfriend type that for you? Or like, what are you even doing
*  here? Like, don't you, shouldn't you be trying to find a husband or like, oh, you're like a stupid
*  kind of like go start an only fans or- No, but the stupidity, the intelligence aspect is what's
*  attacked. Yeah, but it's so much different. Like you can call a guy stupid, but that's because he's
*  a guy that's being stupid. But when you call a woman stupid, she's stupid because she's a woman.
*  Yeah, but I honestly think that women are called stupid more than men on the internet.
*  But I've got nothing to do like the attack is not gendered. It's the gender inspires an increased
*  level of attack. I feel like it is gendered. I wish we had data on this. Have you ever heard
*  of the XKCD comics? Yes. It's a really good comic where, and this is something that I've dealt with
*  a lot in my community. Okay. There's a guy at a board and he fucks up a math equation. And it's
*  like, wow, you suck at math. And then the next panelist, there's a girl that does it and she
*  fucks it up. And it's like, wow, women suck at math. And there's like that feeling that happens
*  where when I bring on, I won't use names, but they're like YouTube people that I've brought on
*  that have crazy opinions. And when they're men, that person is crazy. Oh my God. He said the crazy
*  stuff. He's so dumb. He's so crazy. So stupid. But when it's a woman, it's like, oh my God,
*  why do you always bring dumb women here? Why do so many women on the internet have crazy opinions?
*  There's a different like minority character that has to like stand it and like represent like
*  their whole group where like white men don't typically have to. Speaking of groups versus
*  individuals. Yes. But then what I feel happens is then another person from that group comes,
*  another woman comes and people before she says anything will already feel like they're ready
*  with that attack. For sure. But they're ready for the attack because she's a woman. They're going
*  to call her, she's stupid because she's a woman, not because she says something, just because she's
*  a woman. So like the group in their brain accumulates all the negative characteristics
*  of the individuals they've met, not the positive, the negative. And it becomes like this ball of
*  stickiness. And then that becomes the bias for their judgment of a new person that comes.
*  With white men, there's more of a blank slate in terms of bias of how they analyze the person.
*  With any of the minority group, they basically make a judgment based on the negative characteristics
*  of the individuals they've met in the past. That leads to a system where you're just harsher
*  towards minority groups and towards women. How do you solve that? The most important thing for
*  any problem ever is step one is to be aware of it. If you're not aware of it, then you're
*  hopelessly lost at sea. But yeah, the first thing I like to say is just like, be aware of it. Like
*  I've had, there's a girl that I've had on recently and she says a lot of, in my opinion, kind of
*  crazy things, but people will use her as like, this is why women shouldn't be here. This is like,
*  she's crazy and she's a woman and blah, blah, blah. But I can bring in a guy who says similarly
*  dumb things and he's evaluated on his own merits because it's a guy. There's never ever, ever been
*  a case where I brought a stupid guy on stream and everybody's like, this guy makes me hate men. This
*  guy makes me hate white people. That has never happened. But then there's like other women that
*  come on and it's like, now I know why insults exist or I totally understand where red pill ideology
*  comes from. And even if the statements are kind of true, when you're making these observations
*  over and over and over and over again, it damages your ability to individually perceive somebody.
*  And then two people that make the same statements, one can be perceived more harshly just because of
*  that like group bias. You've got built up. I think there's something about streaming that just brings
*  that out of people like, cause you have to talk for like seven hours. So you're like, all right,
*  well, whatever psychological issues and complexities I have, I'm going to explore that. Magnified,
*  magnified and then it's the Gerardi, as you talked about the mimetic, uh, uh,
*  theories or Gerardi and like whatever the things that are very similar in the, you're going to
*  magnify the conflicts that you have and you're going to explore the, all the different perspectives
*  on those different conflicts. And I mean, I don't, I don't know if it's just anecdotal, but
*  it's nice to have women on stream. I think the dynamic, uh, that you guys have is, is, is, is
*  wonderful. It's, it's really interesting. So it's just the female voice in general. I love having
*  women on the podcast. The female voice I feel like is under heard on the internet. For sure.
*  And I would love the internet to be a place where women feel safe to speak.
*  All right. Given that you're like, we talked about a progressive with nonstandard progressive
*  views. So you're very pro free speech, pro capitalism. So given that it's very interesting
*  that you're also pro establishment and pro institutions. Uh, so right now, if you look
*  at the world, there's a significant distrust of institutions, uh, at least in sort of public
*  intellectual discourse. Uh, what is the nature of your support for government and institutions? Can
*  you make the case for and against them? Broadly speaking, there is a synergistic effect when two
*  humans come together. If I can speak very broadly in terms of, we'll say utility. Okay. My happiness
*  with one person might be 10, the happiness with the other person might be 10, but when they come
*  together, it's like 50 between the two of them. There's like the synergistic effect when humans
*  work together that the sum is greater than all the individual parts or whatever. There's like
*  an emergent thing that happens there. There's a capacity. There's a possibility of that.
*  Yeah. Well, possibility. Sure. Things could go really wrong. There could be a cannibalistic
*  tribe that all eats each other. Sure. But for the purpose of this, there's other failure modes,
*  but yes. Okay, sure. Yeah. For the, for the, but well, I think broadly speaking you're,
*  are you going to be the well actually guy? Okay. If you want to, well, okay. Well, actually,
*  well, actually sometimes. Sometimes cannibalism is actually good for both.
*  True. Yeah. Sometimes things do go wrong, but I think broadly speaking, the fact that you're
*  sitting here in clothing that you didn't make and I'm sitting here on an airplane that I don't know
*  how to fly or build like, right. There's a lot of cool stuff that happens when people come together
*  and they make civilizations. And part of that civilization building is the fact that we can
*  specialize. And it's the fact that we can offload a bunch of trust onto third parties,
*  that we delegate the power to make important decisions about our lives. Right. I don't know
*  anything about how to like build like a combustion engine, but I know that when I push the button on
*  my car, it's going to drive around and the fumes aren't going to kill me and I can park it in
*  garages and the building's not going to collapse. And the only reason all of this works is because
*  I've offloaded a lot of trust under these third party things. And I would say that the pillars
*  of these third party things that society has built on are roughly speaking institutions.
*  So that might be the institution of peer review for scientific articles. It might be the institution
*  of voting for government, right. Or the ability for us to vote in that whole process. It might,
*  yeah, the FDA, like all of these institutions are things that they need to exist because we don't
*  have the time or the capability to individually sort through all of these things individually.
*  We have to rely on some third party to do it. Okay. So you believe at scale,
*  the when we're together, we're greater than the sum of our parts. That's the case for institutions.
*  Absolutely. What about the inefficiencies of bureaucracy? Is there some aspect when at scale,
*  different dynamics come into play than they do when there's two people together,
*  two people that love each other, the birds and the bees. Is there some aspect that leads more
*  to cannibalism at scale? So like corruption, inefficiencies that do to bureaucracy and so on.
*  Bureaucracy, which is not, I hate it when people try to say bureaucracy is government,
*  because bureaucracy exists a ton in private environments as well, right, in businesses
*  and everything. Bureaucracy introduces its own set of problems. But I mean, a bureaucracy is
*  necessary because it's coordinating all of the underlying things in order to create something
*  that's greater than the sum of its parts, right? Like all of the software developers in the world
*  are useless without being paired with good designers in order to make their products
*  usable by a person. And the coordination of those people and the coordination of increasingly more
*  and more things necessitates some level of bureaucracy. I think we always say bureaucracy
*  when it's like a bad, it's like a slur on us. Like you're a bureaucrat, you're bureaucratic.
*  The bureaucracy is slowing everything down. It's like, sure, the bureaucracy slows things down,
*  but bureaucracy also gives us things like safe medicine and safe water to drink for most of the
*  US or safe buildings to live in or safe cars to drive. So the managers in institution versus
*  the software developers and the designers, the managers is the bureaucracy. The reason
*  bureaucracy is used as a slur is that something about human nature leads to bureaucracy often
*  growing indefinitely and becoming less and less efficient. I mean, this is where capitalism can
*  come in, that capitalism puts a pressure on the bureaucracy not to grow too much because
*  you want the bureaucracy to be useful, but not large. Yeah. And to be a certain size,
*  yeah, of course. To be the minimum size to get the job done. And so capitalism provides that mechanism.
*  Government does not always. And so that's the criticism of government, of institutions,
*  where it can grow without a significant mechanism that says there's a cost to bureaucracy that's not
*  being accounted for here. We're just paying for the increasing size of government without the
*  benefit. Yeah. Government is a special institution because it doesn't have to show itself to be
*  financially viable. And we kind of live in a capitalist economy where that's generally the
*  case. So government gets its powers from votes from the people, which introduces a whole new set
*  of possible positives and possible negatives, right? Having something, for instance, that gives
*  food or shelter to homeless people, maybe you don't want that to have to run at a profit,
*  but giving an organization that can self-justify its budgets perpetually and indefinitely growing,
*  maybe that's not the best thing. Yeah. We always have to figure out how to do the constraints there.
*  What about the corrupting nature of power that comes with institutions as well?
*  Absolutely. So then you better pick your style of institution very carefully. I think that
*  the democratic institution we have in the United States today, I think works very well. But I mean,
*  there are other styles of government that have been tried in the past that I think lend themselves
*  more to corruption. Not to say that, by the way, there's not corruption in the United States. Of
*  course, there's going to be varying levels of corruption at all levels. But you run into this
*  interesting problem where authoritarian regimes can act with ruthless precision and swiftness
*  because they don't have to ask any questions. They just do, do, do, do, do, and that's it.
*  But the problem is it's an authoritarian regime. They're prone to missteps. They're slow to respond
*  to changing or evolving needs. There was an interesting study that was put out a while
*  ago that showed that every single famine that happened around the world, almost all, like 98%
*  of them happen under authoritarian regimes where freedom of speech is very limited. It's very rare
*  for a famine to happen under democracy because press and everything makes the government more
*  responsive to the needs of the people. Power can corrupt. There are levels of corruption,
*  but you have to have a system of checks and balances on all of those different levels to
*  make sure it doesn't run off the rails, I guess, and do a sick loop-de-loop and half the population
*  gets... Nice callback. There's a lot of people that will listen to you say that
*  the democracy in the United States is working pretty damn well and they will spit out the drink
*  if they're drinking a drink and be very upset. Can you make the case that they're right and you're
*  wrong? Can you steal men? They're right. Yeah. Well, the steel man for them is that people have a lot
*  of problems on the day to day. And when they look and they see what government is doing,
*  they might see potholes outside their house, homeless people all over their downtown, and the
*  United States just approved another X billion amount of dollars for Ukraine. Or they might be
*  living in a city where half the factories are shut down, a lot of their people out of work,
*  but the president is on the TV talking about how to find jobs for immigrants coming in from Mexico.
*  And for these people, they have problems that exist in their lives. Some of them are paying
*  taxes to alleviate these problems. And then when they listen to the government talk, it feels like
*  the government is not responding to the needs that they have. And then that's one problem.
*  Then on top of that, you've got all of these people working in alternative media that can show
*  you, well, look at this politician wasting this much money, or look at him double speaking here
*  or there. Look at Hillary Clinton saying she's got a private position and a public position.
*  Look at how all of these politicians have family members that are getting rich because of their
*  relationships with people in Congress. Look at the revolving door between capitalist companies
*  and the government. How can you look at all of that, take into account that the government's
*  not responding to your needs, and then really feel like it's a government by the people and
*  for the people. Yeah, this was a very good, good steel man and good question. How can you,
*  how can you, how can you tell that they're not just politicians that care more about
*  continuously winning the elections versus being running government effectively?
*  They should care about winning the elections. That's the first misconception. A lot of people
*  say this guy only cares about getting voted in. This guy, like he doesn't even believe about in
*  fracking or abortion. He just changed his opinion to get voted in. Anytime somebody says that,
*  you should say, that's really good. You want them to change their opinion so they get voted in.
*  That's the whole point of a democracy. You don't want them to remain obstinate. You don't want them
*  to say, I'm not changing my opinion no matter what the people want. You want them to evolve
*  and adopt new opinions based on what the population, their constituents are voting for.
*  Yeah, but the cynical take is that they're the, on the surface, they're changing their opinion,
*  but that there's a boys club or boys means the elite that under, in the smoke filled rooms,
*  in secret, they're actually have their own agenda and they're following that agenda. And they're
*  just saying anything publicly to placate the public based on whatever the new trends are.
*  So here's-
*  Cynical take a plot.
*  Yeah, I understand. Somebody asked me this question and it flipped, I 180'd completely.
*  I was a Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016 and my single issue voting thing was lobbying. I thought
*  that lobbying, the government was corrupt. They weren't responding to these people. It was
*  completely destroyed my faith in government and everything. And I had one question posed to me
*  by a conservative that used to come on my stream and shout at me. And he said, and then he asked me,
*  can you think of any, any popular opinion that the American public has that the government is
*  unresponsive to? Is there some big piece of legislation or policy or whatever that people
*  want that the government isn't doing? They asked me that. I couldn't think of a single good answer.
*  And I'm like, oh geez.
*  This is a good hint. There's-
*  Drugs.
*  There's not.
*  And that's the thing.
*  Legalization of drugs. Hold on.
*  I was like, all right.
*  Yeah, go for it.
*  All right.
*  Oh shoot. You're doing the Joe Rogan thing. You're pushing back because I brought up weed. Go ahead.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I have become meme.
*  I don't even, I don't want to interrupt your, your book because there's memes upon memes upon
*  memes. I can go with here, but no, uh, cause people bring up, okay, there's no issues.
*  There's no issues that the government is not representing of the public.
*  So here's the issue. So somebody will bring up like, well, what about the legalization of drugs?
*  Okay. The first issue people have is one, they look at national polling.
*  Very few things are decided on a national level. So that's the first huge mistake.
*  Arguably a lot of BLM made mistakes in this arena where they're saying like,
*  why isn't the government doing anything about policing? Federal government can't do anything
*  about policing. That's going to be your, sometimes any of your state government,
*  sometimes your local city government, the people that like elect, like your chief of police,
*  your police commissioner, that's coming from your mayor. Right? Um, so you've got people looking one
*  at the wrong parts of the government to even figure out the solutions to the problem. Two,
*  oftentimes for polling, the questions are vague enough that you can pull very high.
*  But when you get into the weeds on things, no pun intended, um, you start to realize like,
*  oh shoot, this is more complicated than I thought. I don't know the numbers in particular for
*  legalization of marijuana, but this is what I'm going to guess is the case. If you pull and you
*  say, should we legalize marijuana? That number might pull at like 65, 70%. But that's including
*  people that are in favor of medical marijuana. If you were to pull like, should we legalize,
*  should we decriminalize recreational use of marijuana? That number might drop to like
*  52%. And then if you pull like, should we completely legalize, not just decriminalize,
*  but completely legalize recreational use of marijuana? That number might drop to like 40%.
*  There's like all these different ways you can pull around issues where people are like, oh no,
*  we broadly agree on this topic. But when you really figure out, well, do you, do we really agree? Or
*  is it just like broad consensus around a thing that's never going to show up like in a piece
*  of legislation? A really good example, one example I do know is socialized healthcare. I think if
*  you pull, there was a time a few years ago where if you pull America, do you think every American
*  citizen should have access to like free healthcare? I think that answer, that pulled like 74% yes.
*  But when you asked, should the government be the sole provider of healthcare, it dropped to like 26%,
*  dropped 50 points. And you could see it was both asking questions about single payer,
*  but the way that it was asked was so different that even if you all, it looks like there's
*  consensus, there's not nearly as much consensus as people think around certain ideas. Yeah, go.
*  You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. That polls, the way you ask the polls really
*  matters. But when you ask, should the government be in charge of a thing, that also biases the
*  answer, right? Like, because there's such a negative experience with government creating a
*  .gov site that runs the thing. But sometimes, sometimes I think if you dig in, if you have a
*  one hour conversation with each individual citizen, I think you will understand that.
*  Yes, there is support for socialized medicine. Like it's not the argument has to be made though.
*  Yeah. What do you mean? Like if you just ask a conservative, like what about single payer,
*  they're going to tell you no, you might be able to build up to an argument for it, but you're going
*  to have to make the case for it. No, but I thought we're talking about the feeling deep inside your
*  mind and heart. Does the government represent that? Oh, so it's not like some shallow surface layer
*  public opinion. Does the government effectively represent what the people want? Not a shallow
*  survey, but deeply what they want. I'm not actually that familiar with the debates over
*  healthcare. Let's maybe look at an easier one. Maybe you'll say it's harder. War. War is a really
*  good example where the government was very responsive, I think, to the people. You think so.
*  So Iraq, Afghanistan, the government didn't manipulate public opinion. There's an argument
*  to be made that they did in terms of like WMD and everything, but after 9-11, were you in the
*  United States after 9-11? After 9-11. That seems accusatory. Like where were you in 9-11?
*  Just checking, okay. All right, cool. I have evidence and witnesses. Oh, sure.
*  No, okay. I'm very defensive right now. It's very strange. Look into it, Alex Jones.
*  I think after 9-11, we could have gone to war with any country in the world.
*  We were ready because all of America was like, oh my God, and they pointed to Iraq. The reasons
*  for the WMDs was kind of dumb, but I don't think we even needed WMDs to go to Iraq. We could have
*  just said, Saddam Hussein was giving medical aid to Taliban, Al-Qaeda, Iraq, let's go, and we would
*  have gone for it. But post-Iraq, Iraq was for a while popular and then became obviously deeply
*  unpopular, Iraq and Afghanistan. I think you could see that influence other foreign policy that the
*  United States had. For instance, we opted more towards drone warfare than troops on the ground
*  for places like Yemen. We opted more towards sending money and help instead of boots on the
*  ground for places like Syria. I think that a lot of that was in response to how unpopular the Iraq
*  stuff had became. When you looked at a lot of elections afterwards, even for Obama,
*  one of the defining characteristics of a lot of campaigns were like, I'm going to close Guantanamo
*  Bay. I'm going to get us out of foreign wars. Even up to Trump, I'm not going to stop doing all this
*  weird stuff in the Middle East. But they didn't still withdraw from Afghanistan. They didn't
*  withdraw, but they definitely tapered off and weren't as aggressively pushing those types of
*  conflicts because they knew it was unpopular. But I think if you also consider perfect information
*  or good information, if you ask a lot of people, are you okay spending this amount of money?
*  For this purpose, so military conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, I think almost from the very
*  beginning, they would say no. After 9-11, I feel like maybe like a few days after 9-11.
*  There's some memes and so on. Yes, but the nature of the public support for the war,
*  was there public support in 2003, which is when the invasion happened?
*  I feel like initially there was a lot. I remember seeing it on, but then I also lived in a Republican
*  household and I was not very like media savvy. I don't know if the nature of that public support
*  had to do with WMDs or with 9-11. It came about WMDs. But I wonder if you were to poll people,
*  and let's say hypothetically there was above 50% support for the war, what would be the nature of
*  that support? And to what degrees the government actually representing the will of the people versus
*  some complex mechanism like the military industrial complex is manipulating the
*  narrative that's controlling public opinion. And then there's the media that gets a lot of
*  attention by being divided and how they're shaping the narrative through the mechanism of division.
*  So what- There's a lot of complicated things out there. Yes. It's not just like the people and then
*  the government and that's, yeah, for sure I agree that there are going to be different elements at
*  play. And how much of those elements that lead us astray can be attributed to the largeness of
*  the different systems and the different institutions like the media institutions and government,
*  the institutions that have a monopoly on violence, let's put it this way, which is one way to define
*  government. Sure. It's complicated. There's definitely going to be different institutions at
*  play, but I think that like all I would say is like in reference to my original point,
*  when there becomes like broad consensus around a thing, I think the government will usually
*  follow. It's not going to fight. It's going to follow more often than not. But I think that
*  a lot of times I think Americans think that there's more consensus around certain issues
*  than there actually are. So like a really good example, we're on that war point too.
*  What caused like the lowest dip in Biden's approval rating? I'm pretty sure it was right
*  after we pulled out of Afghanistan, which I think if I would have asked people like a year before,
*  let's assume that we could pull out of Afghanistan. The government's probably going to collapse
*  after we leave because they just don't have the will to fight. They don't have the support. They
*  don't whatever. That's just not going to work. But like no Americans are going to die. It might be a
*  couple of other people, but like no Americans are going to die. We're going to get out of Afghanistan.
*  Would you support that? I think broadly speaking, I think more than 60 or 70% of Americans are like,
*  yeah, that would be fine. But then when it actually plays on TV, when we see the people
*  hanging onto the planes, when we see like helicopter embassies, some of the courts and politicians,
*  well now it's like, oh my God, this was horrible and it was so botched. And it was so like, it
*  could have gone so much better. It's like, well, could it have gone better? Like maybe, maybe not.
*  But I mean, it seems like you can have consensus around a certain opinion, but the way that things
*  play out and the way that people actually feel, it's actually way, way, way more complicated.
*  And there's not usually this broad consensus opinion. Yeah, go ahead.
*  I'd like to believe that. I mean, just to lay my cards on the table,
*  I have a faith in the power of effective government. I just have a lot of concern
*  about what happens as institutions grow in size. For sure. And I just have a lot of worry about
*  the natural corrupting influence on the individuals and on the system as a whole, like the boys club
*  nature of it. I don't know, there must be a better term, but basically they agree to the game and
*  they play the game and there's a generational aspect, momentum to the game. And they more and
*  more stop being responsive to the people that they represent. I just feel like there is that
*  mechanism. And I think the nice thing, democracy, elections are resistance to that natural human
*  mechanism. Also the balances of power is a resistance to that mechanism. In some ways,
*  the media that reveals the bullshit of politicians is also a resistance to that mechanism. It's hard
*  to be full of shit as a politician because people will try to catch you on it. So there's a honesty
*  method there that keeps you honest. It's to some degree, but it still feels like,
*  it still feels like politicians are going to politician.
*  Yeah, they definitely play their games. That is true. But there's probably always going to be that
*  meta narrative over governance that just develops as like, you have to form relationships and play
*  games to get legislation passed and everything. The only reason why I don't like it when people
*  attack institutions is because one, institutions are incredibly important, arguably paramount. No,
*  they are to keeping society running. And two, I think sometimes when we shift the blame onto
*  institutions too much, I think that we lose sight of what the real problems are. So for instance,
*  in the United States today, people might be very critical of the government not getting much done,
*  but then everybody turns their eyes to the government for being ineffective. But what I
*  would argue is I would say the government is actually incredibly effective and it's showcasing
*  the will of the American people really well right now, which is we are historically more divided than
*  we have ever been. And if I were to just look at the people and I were to say, we have a historic
*  divide that is getting like rapidly blown apart by things like the internet and the media, right?
*  If that exists, well, what would I expect that government to look like? I wouldn't expect that
*  government to be governing very effective. I would expect that government to show that legitimate
*  divide in people. Do you think that divide, we have a perception of a large divide between left and
*  right. Do you think that's a real divide that's in this country? Narrow the language. What do you
*  mean by real divide? Do you think there is that divide in ideology that there's a large number of
*  people that believe a certain set of policies and the different set of policies? I think it's just
*  the perception of the on Twitter. No, I think there is a large divide in terms of belief. I
*  don't think there's very much divide between any people in terms of like what they like on the most
*  fundamental levels want in terms of like human beings. But in terms of like Democrat versus
*  Republican right now, I think there is a huge divide in terms of the direction they want to
*  see the country go and what they believe really and what they even believe is reality, right?
*  Unfortunately, that's what we've gotten to. Can I just speak about the mechanism of the left and
*  right here? Maybe on the memetic rivalry aspect. Is there some aspect to the left on which you're
*  a part of that attacks their own for ideological impurity more than the right does? Is it the bigotry
*  of small differences? There's a concept where when you're near somebody who is very slightly
*  different than you, you want to destroy it. But when you're with somebody that's way different
*  than you, you don't. I think the left does it, but I think the right does it too. I didn't realize
*  until I started dipping more into conservative communities, but oh my God, the people from the
*  daily wire and the people from turning point and the America first, all these different groups of
*  people hate each other and they fight each other so much. They hire and fire sometimes employees.
*  They talk smack about each other. I think there's a lot of political division between both sides. I
*  think that the left just kind of gets highlighted more because it's like the internet and a lot of
*  the internet spaces have a lot of left-leaning people. So you see like the crazy communist and
*  the crazy progressives and the crazy center left liberals and the crazy blah, blah, blah. Whereas
*  a lot of the right-leaning people have kind of been pushed off of the main areas of the internet now.
*  Interesting. My sense was that it's hard to exist on the center left,
*  but maybe because I just don't have the full spectrum view of the political divide. It felt
*  like central left is a difficult position to occupy. Yeah, I would definitely say so. I don't
*  know if it's that difficult to be center right. It's very difficult to be center right. I think
*  actually maybe even more difficult because a center right person might be somebody who's like
*  conservative, but not a fan of Trump and you're like over like looking like Liz Cheney, right?
*  You've had politicians that are just like, they didn't back the Trump stuff and now they're gone.
*  Or you might be like center right, but like you don't think the election was stolen. And now you're
*  like half the Republican party is looking at you like you're crazy, you know? That's true. That's
*  true. I think this was a bench appear or how I'm talking with, I think he publicly spoke against
*  Trump, right? He did initially, but I felt like he softened his language upon him pretty significantly.
*  But so there's a significant pressure to kind of couch out to a certain kind of messaging,
*  which the whole Republican party is feeling right now. Geez, that two years from now,
*  that election is going to be insane. It's just hard. Okay. So to generalize, it's hard to be in
*  the center. It feels like for sure this center and then like do like a random walk among the
*  policies around that. I don't know what that mechanism is. I mean, it makes people like me
*  not feel good being in the center. It seems like people are just not nice to people in the center.
*  Like the public, the Twitter machine is not nice to the people who are open-minded in the center.
*  Is that, is there some truth to that? Two reasons for that. One is because I think a lot of people
*  that market themselves as center are legitimately spineless cowards and deserve to be called out.
*  I've never killed a man, but today might be my first. Oh no. There I'll take over. Like I told
*  you, I'll take over your stream. With the AI. Yeah, we'll see. Is that guy going to be streaming
*  in the background? Hey fellas. Yeah. Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Lots of gotchas. Okay.
*  Gotcha. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. And decrease the amount, which already is a pretty low level of
*  emotion. Just decrease it completely. When people are screaming at you and accusing stuff, just
*  remain calm. Absolutely. Emotionless. The gaslighter strategy. Yeah. Okay. So what we're
*  talking about. So I don't, uh, I don't even, I don't ever identify a center anything because
*  it's got such a bad reputation because so. Fuck that. I stand center with a spine. It's called
*  being open-minded and it's not center, left and right. Those are just labels. Here's a really good
*  quote. My mom said to me when I was really young, she said, Stevie, don't ever let your mind be so
*  open that your brain falls out. And that's what I find that a lot of center people do. That's not
*  what she told me last night. Why are you like this? Okay. I'm glad I can, glad I can bring that.
*  I'm glad you feel like this is a safe space. Like I said, people are not judgmental. If you want to
*  talk about fucking my mom, you know what? You're totally within your rights. I didn't say that.
*  You said that. I didn't say that. I support that. She's a beautiful woman. Her husband probably
*  wouldn't be too happy about it, but you know. I didn't say there's any sexual relations. It was
*  just that having a conversation with her, you projected that that says more by you than me.
*  Anyway, go ahead about spineless center center. There is some aspects to that, which is like
*  amorphous to me. Center means you, you think freely about each individual policy without being stuck
*  to some ideal. Yeah. But a lot of people don't do that. They'll call themselves centrist, but then
*  they just, they're anti-establishment essentially on everything. I don't know your position on like
*  the vaccines or anything. Um, but like, I met a lot of like free and open thinkers who are like,
*  you know what? I'm open to everything and it's an experimental vaccine and I'm going to eat
*  hydroxyclarquin and ivermectin because that's what the institutions are telling me not to take.
*  And I think Fauci got too much money from that company and these are, but I'm an open thinker
*  and I'm an, and they, what, what open thinker becomes. I'm at MIT. What do you think my position
*  of vaccines is exactly? I hear a lot of crazy things from a lot of people. Okay. You might be
*  from MIT, but I know you from the internet. Okay. And people from the internet are weird and crazy.
*  So, yeah, well, I, uh, who knows? I don't like arrogance and I have criticized scientists during
*  COVID a lot of people, but scientists included having arrogance. Which is fair. But, and that's,
*  and I think there's a lot of good criticism to be made of different, um, scientific and medical
*  establishments over a lot of stuff, but nobody can make those good criticisms because they're too
*  like obsessed over like just trying to have the anti-establishment answer. And that is what is
*  upsetting me the most. Like I think there are good conversations to be had about a lot of stuff
*  related to how we handle the coronavirus, you know, were lockdowns effective? Was there enough
*  data to support the huge measures we took? Um, you know, why didn't we have the option to show
*  I was infected a month ago? Why do I need to be vaccinated? Why did, why wasn't that option
*  everything in the United States? I don't think it was. Um, there are really good questions to be
*  asked there, but all the people asking the questions are also trying to tell you that
*  ivermectin and monoclonal antibodies are the way to go for everything. And the vaccine is evil.
*  And they're just going to turn you gay like the frogs. And it's like, Jesus, like you can't,
*  there's like no place to reasonably criticize from because all of the people that are criticizing
*  aren't doing it with an open mind or, you know, they're not reading studies or doing anything.
*  They're saying like, I do my own research, which means they listen to whatever the last guy on
*  Joe Rogan said. And now they're parroting that opinion. Easy now. The last guy on Joe Rogan,
*  not Joe Rogan. Okay. That Robert Malone guy on Joe Rogan got me real fired up. That's one guess.
*  People see him as like the father of mRNA technology. He published one paper. Okay.
*  What do you mean people? Which people think that- Joe Rogan fans, I get like, I run into these
*  people. I start arguing with people and they start citing me, well, what about- I'm a Joe Rogan fan
*  and I appreciate the vaccine. That's good. I'm glad you do. But there's definitely-
*  But you said there's a type, there's a type, what's the type? What's the type of Joe Rogan fan?
*  Anti-establishment. I think that's not Joe Rogan. That's a general public discourse. There's a
*  default anti-establishment on the right and the left. That's the default easy thing to go to.
*  I think Joe Rogan fans are definitely a certain type of anti-establishment though. Like I could
*  guess the Joe Rogan fan. Like if I were to do general population versus Joe Rogan fan,
*  who do you think is more likely to be anti-vaccine? Do you have data on this?
*  Are you just guessing? Just guessing. Yeah. I think you are actually judging.
*  I am. I think you're judging. Because I think you're also-
*  the beautiful thing about podcasting, this could be similar to streaming, is there's a large number
*  of people that just listen. Like what does it mean to be a Joe Rogan fan? I don't think you just
*  listen. I think people listen and absorb the information. I would say that the Joe Rogan
*  fan base is as divided in the vaccine as the general public. Gotcha. Man, I'm going to look
*  for polling data on that. I'm sure somebody's got to have done it out there, but-
*  No, but you're basically revealing the fact they have no data. You're using your own judgment.
*  For sure. Based on how he's had conversations about his experience with the coronavirus and
*  then based on the guests that have come on that have talked and echoed a lot of anti-vax talking
*  points and been completely unchallenged. And then based on statements he's made about myocarditis
*  and the vaccine and everything as well. Yeah. So it's the level of challenge or not that he's doing.
*  What his true positions are and then the types of guests he typically chooses to bring on to talk
*  about the vaccines. Yeah. Okay. But that represents somehow a deep anti-establishment feeling versus
*  just the vaccine. I mean, I've seen the vaccine and other things being a thing that broke people.
*  I think all the coronavirus, that whole one or two years broke a lot of people.
*  There's a lot of emotion and emotion quickly solidified into an opinion that almost had nothing
*  to do with thinking through and updating your knowledge and so on. You just made up your mind.
*  Yeah. But I think a lot of it comes from that anti-establishment place. The vaccine represents
*  the ultimate of establishment. It was a huge private company backed by a huge public government.
*  And there's Fauci and there's Biden and there's Pfizer and there's all these countries locking
*  us up in our homes, telling us to do a thing. The vaccine was the ultimate submission tool to show
*  you that the government owns you. Not only do you have to get injected once, it's a series.
*  And then you've got to get boosters and it's like they're trying to keep you under their thumb and
*  that's the control. I feel like that vaccine became the ultimate rallying cry between,
*  do you support, are you a sellout that is going to believe whatever the government tells the sheep
*  to take or are you going to be the guy that stands against the crowd and gets fired from his job
*  and pulls his kids from school because they're not going to let the evil Fauci medicine jab them in
*  the arm? And the funny thing is the crowd that stands against the institution is not larger than
*  the crowd of sheep. There's like one sheep standing there. Sure. Yeah. Or it feels that way sometimes.
*  One vaccinated sheep. Well, okay. What's the defense of institutions? How do you regain the
*  trust of institutions? First of all, do you think that there's ways in which WHO, CDC failed?
*  And do you think there's criticism towards Pfizer and the big pharma companies that deserve it?
*  Damn, the pharma companies, I'm not sure. For CDC and WHO, so here's a criticism that I have
*  of all of academia and I feel it stronger and stronger every day. I don't think it's enough
*  to be a researcher or to be correct about issues. Academia needs to increase its ability to
*  communicate. It is just an unbelievable, unmitigated failure that academics are unwilling to wade into
*  the complicated topics that exist today because other people are, you know. First you call me
*  spineless and then you call me a bad communicator. But no, look, you're here, you're doing it. So you
*  get props for me, okay? Good job. That motherfucker. But there are like so many, but I'm sure you've,
*  I'm sure that you must have heard another fellow academic, a fellow colleague express some amount
*  of frustration about like in their specific discipline. They know something to be true and
*  they know that like a lot of the messaging is like wrong or bad in the public about it, but they're
*  never going to step out and say anything because either one, they're very measured and careful with
*  their take, which they feel is incompatible with what people want to hear. Or two, they're really
*  worried that they might be incorrect. So they're going to be cautious while everybody else is going
*  out and like hard-court. And they also don't have the support of institutions for them to go out on
*  a limb. Yeah, that too. So like to take risks. For example, I've heard that with lab leak theory.
*  I've had a lot of biologists, virologists, friends that are like, yeah, it's obviously
*  leaked from a lab. Like early on. Oh, maybe, okay. We can fight over this one. Sorry, go ahead.
*  We can fight over this. Okay. I should sort of backstep and say like, that's like you talk about
*  shooting a shit you haven't really investigated, but it's your gut. Like this doesn't make any
*  sense. They would never say that publicly. Of course. Mostly because you're saying like
*  what they would all say is like, we want to see data. Yeah, which would be good, which is fine.
*  So they're going with like, like this is too many coincidences in the same place. That's the logic,
*  but they don't want to say anything because there's no data. You need to have evidence.
*  You need to have actual evidence to say one way or the other. There's that, but there's also just
*  like you said, I mean, effective, effective communication. You're a fan of Sean Carroll.
*  Oh, yes. He's like one of the only people in this whole planet that I like besides you. I love Sean
*  Carroll. Anytime Sean Carroll is brought up as evidenced, there's a smile that comes over your
*  face. I love it. Of like joy. Yeah. Of like a little kid thinking about Santa Claus. Okay. I love Sean
*  Carroll too. I love Sean Carroll because there, I hate this divide between like you're either STEM
*  or you're like philosophy, arts and all that other stuff. And the two worlds can never cross. And I
*  love that it was so good at physics, but like explores and pays attention to all of the like
*  sociological stuff too. It's so rare to find that quality in a person. He's legit. One of the really,
*  really, really specialized, but you don't have to be a Sean Carroll. You can be just a little
*  better at educating another person in the, in the medical and the health space is somebody named
*  Andrew Huberman, a friend of mine from Stanford. He's an incredible educator. There's the kind of
*  process in science. They usually call it review or survey papers where you basically summarize
*  all that's going on, integrate it and like draw wisdom from it and also project like,
*  where's the discipline headed? And Andrew does that basically on all these sub components of the
*  different stuff going on in, in neuroscience and biology, neurobiology, all that he's able to,
*  he does a podcast called Huberman lab where he just summarizes on and is able to explain like,
*  what does that actually mean for your, for your life in terms of protocols of how to make your
*  life better? I feel like people should be able to do that more and more, but with viral virology and
*  oh boy, that's a tricky one. That's a really tricky one. I wish that people could have honest
*  conversations. Like I attack a lot of people that do the lab leak theory stuff, but truly we should
*  be able to have that conversation publicly. It just, it always feels like the people that are
*  having the conversation don't ever really want to have the conversation. They're not being honest.
*  Like, like I'm a guy that like does his own research and it's so boring reading studies
*  and a lot of it, I can only do abstracts and like, like it's so much work, but I'll never ever say
*  that about myself. I'm a guy that does his own research because every time I hear somebody say
*  that they don't do any research. When they say they do their own research, what they mean is
*  they've seen one podcast and their opinion on this podcast is that definitely not mine. Cause it was
*  mine. I wouldn't be criticizing anything they say. But yeah, so like lab leak is another one
*  where it's like, well, how do you know it's lab leak? How do I know it's lab leak? Because
*  Fauci lied and Hunter Biden, a laptop and it's like, okay, come on, you haven't engaged with it at all.
*  There's really interesting research that shows there's a really strong study that shows that
*  there's like a high degree of certainty that it came from the wet markets. Very, very high degree
*  of certainty. And there was an article that came out recently where it's like Senate concludes that
*  virus actually came from the Wuhan virology lab or whatever. And that whole article, if you actually
*  read it, it never says that in the article. I don't know why they tweeted it with that headline.
*  But yeah, it's to back up, I'm sorry. I think we should have good-
*  You should be sorry.
*  Yeah. I'm not sorry, actually. I get to ramble here. Okay. I'm here for a long time. I rescind
*  my apology. Okay. I actually rescind my apology. We should be able to have challenging conversations
*  about things, but you gotta man, be well read on both sides. Not this like I do my own research,
*  though I don't believe anything that Fauci says like, come on, dude,
*  you can do better than that. Not you personally, but-
*  Gotcha. How does that feel?
*  So for people who don't know, that's the catchphrase. Gotcha. Through all tragedy and
*  triumph, through all the roller coaster of life, your response to it is gotcha. Yeah.
*  It's, well, actually, let me jump to that before I continue to, with political discourse.
*  So, Chris, psychologically, you are in a lot of heated debates, and you're usually super calm
*  under fire until you're not. Sometimes you lose your temper completely. Very rarely, but-
*  That's like your opinion, man. Let me ask you about your psychology. What are psychologically
*  your strengths and weaknesses that you're self-aware about? I think I'm very non-judgmental,
*  so I can entertain a lot of different thoughts without agreeing with them or condoning them.
*  I think that's a really big benefit to me. For whatever reason, I seem to be
*  pretty calm in dealing with annoying people. It's why I got promoted at the casino so fast.
*  I could deal with drunks or whatever. It just didn't affect me that much.
*  What percent of the population is annoying?
*  Depends on how you're engaging with them. Most people aren't really annoying, ever.
*  That's what I mean. If you're doing political debate,
*  what percentage is annoying? I guess it depends on who I'm debating and what the topic is.
*  I guess I'm trying to point out the fact that sometimes you can say that reveals something
*  about you if you think a large percent of people are annoying.
*  Well, I would say working graveyard shift when alcohol is involved, that percentage of people
*  goes very, very, very high. Or to be more fair, actually. It's not a high percentage, truly,
*  but if you're a server, one bad customer can ruin the rest of your shift. You only need one or two
*  people acting in that manner to just totally throw you off. You're able to, at least these days,
*  not allow that one customer to throw you off, quote unquote.
*  Yeah, I'm very much like a... I noticed this especially after having a son. There's something
*  about six-year-old kids or whatever where it's like, if they get mad, they're never going to
*  be mad for that long. They'll move on. That's my mentality. I'm a six-year-old kid. I might be mad
*  about something, but I'll get over it in 30 minutes or an hour. I'm pretty good about not
*  carrying that through. It's very rare that I'll hold a grudge against anybody or be angry about
*  something or really disaffected by something over the long term. That almost never happens to me.
*  What are your weaknesses psychologically, would you say?
*  I still have a problem with projecting. I think we all probably do, but my mind onto others is
*  like, if I understand this and I've said this, you should understand it. If you're not, you're dumb.
*  That's an issue that I... I still have that where I project too much.
*  What about holding grudges and stuff like that?
*  I never hold grudges. I'm the least grudgy person ever. It's a meme on my community because anybody
*  can always come back as long as they're acting different.
*  As long as they're acting different.
*  As long as they're acting different.
*  The reason why I say that is because... For instance, nobody likes this, but I have a strong
*  stance on apologies and that I hate them. I don't ever want to hear an apology. I don't care about
*  them ever. They don't mean anything to me. If you did something bad, as long as you've fixed the
*  behavior and you're not doing that thing, then we're generally chill. There's been a lot of
*  people that have been involved in weird stuff with me, but then they go off, they do their thing,
*  and they come back and it's like, okay, cool. As long as you don't do it again, we're fine. It's all
*  good. I'm sorry you feel that way. It's not your fault, Steven. It's not your fault.
*  Okay, gotcha.
*  You've said plenty of negative stuff, positive stuff, negative stuff about Hassan.
*  This is my podcast. I get to force you to say positive things. What do you love?
*  I'm all about love.
*  Let's go back to grilling me on the R-word stuff. You're going to make me compliment
*  Hassan? This is going to be a harder conversation than that.
*  We're going to get you to feel emotions.
*  For people who don't know, he's another popular political streamer. I think you had
*  as the kids call it, a bridge burning over Bernie Sanders. I don't know. My research is very limited
*  on this. What do you respect and love most about Hassan? He puts in a lot of work. When he was
*  growing his stream from 2,000 concurrent viewers to 15,000, he was streaming 12 hours a day,
*  every single day. That was Adam R. Wendley. He did a lot of work. He does seem to be pretty
*  good at networking and socializing and making the correct friends and connections to continue
*  to build his business. What about him as a political thinker? I know you don't think highly
*  of him in that regard, but I think that's unfair. I honestly want to push back on that because-
*  Okay. I have zero respect for him as a political thinker. There's not going to be almost anything.
*  So you can't- Oh, I will say I admire the fact that through no actual capability or ability of
*  his own, he manages to wind up at some of the correct answers just because he's toeing the
*  line. So that is- Good job for him on that. He's got a lot of correct opinions, just he has no
*  idea why. I think that's undeserved. I think that's too harsh, man. The reason I bring that up is I
*  feel like there is a deep grudge in there somehow. So you're the father now, since you're so old,
*  the grandfather of the political debate on livestream, political debater. So there could
*  be some grudge about that split that happened or not enough credit given or all that kind of stuff.
*  I just think he's somebody that has a left-leaning ideology that's different than yours. He was a
*  Bernie supporter, right? And I guess you were not. Can you explain to me what the division is?
*  He exemplifies everything that I absolutely hate about politics. Which is what? Which is
*  shallow engagement, heavily ideologically driven. And you're not ideologically different?
*  Absolutely not. That's what we're talking about, like the free thinker in the real meaning of that
*  word. Yeah, so the way- Let me qualify that. Issue by issue thinking. Let me qualify what I mean when
*  I say that. I spent a lot of time, unfortunate time, delving into the boring world of philosophy. I
*  spent a lot of time thinking about what are my ethical positions? How do I feel about myself,
*  the people around me, and how that relates to the world around me? And then from all of these
*  positions, I think you might have used the phrase first principles earlier. From these kind of first
*  principles, out of that is where all of my political positions are built out of, like full
*  stop. So if you ask me a question, like, how do you feel about the right to own a firearm? Or how
*  do you feel about social healthcare? We can walk through, well, this is how I feel about it as a
*  thing from the government. This is where the government gets its power. This is ethically
*  how groups of people are supposed to function. This is morally how we relate to each other. And
*  personally, this is how I feel. I'll be able to do every single political belief back there.
*  It's not like I'm telling you- If I were to ask Hassan, what do you feel about this political
*  topic? He's going to tell me what progressives are supposed to say. I don't know what he thinks
*  about it. Don't you think that's a cynical take? Why is he just because his views coincide with the
*  mainstream narrative, mainstream viewpoints of progressive thinkers? I mean, why does that mean
*  he's not thinking? Because his engagement with every subject is incredibly shallow, 100% predictable.
*  Like I could write like a, I could probably program a script to like give you every single
*  potential answer you could have to any single question you could give him. Again, I think that's
*  pretty cynical take. Okay. It could be the case that his brain perfectly aligns with every single
*  mainstream- No, but I don't know if you know it is perfectly aligned because I think you're just
*  taking a very select, just like streamers do of each other, a very select slice that represents
*  the perfect alignment as opposed to looking at a person struggling with ideas and thinking through
*  ideas and then giving them a pass. Like a lot of people, like I give you a pass on just the fact
*  that you say a lot of crazy shit on stream for drama. Like, which is- I don't say things for drama.
*  It might be dramatic, but- I mean, you've evolved as a fish evolves legs. You've evolved a mechanism
*  which creates controversy. Sure. You could say it's not intention, but it happens. I think- Okay, sure.
*  The extremists kind of learn that kind of thing. And so I'm sure Hassan does the same kind of stuff.
*  And so like underneath it, there's still thinking being that's contending with political ideas.
*  You don't think so? He does a really good job of hiding it. There are other political figures that
*  I really don't like that I wouldn't say the same thing about. So like, I don't know if you have Vosh
*  written in there. I'm like, okay, that's the person that he also split out of my community and grew
*  to something. And now he hates me and he's an anti-fan community and they all hate me. Okay, tell me
*  something you love about what machine- I can tell you a lot of things about Vosh. I think Vosh
*  legitimately thinks through a lot of his political positions. I admire or did admire that he has like
*  his own like positions. He would take someone's country to people further left than him. He's got
*  some positions that don't fit his ideology kind of at all. Like he's his own independent thinker.
*  Rhetorically, he's very effective. He was willing to sit down and do research for like his debates
*  and everything. He would spend a lot of time practicing like his rhetorical effectiveness
*  and navigating conversations. He intentionally and purposefully built like a community that
*  exemplified his values. Yeah, I've got a lot. I don't- we are completely split and hate each
*  other now. But like I have a lot of- Why? Why? Why hate? First of all, hate is a strong- why the hate?
*  Okay, I don't hate him, but he hates me because we had a couple of really big debates. What happened?
*  Well, one had to do with whether or not you should live your values. And can you give me the story
*  that's a charitable interpretation? I always give charitable interpretation. You don't. I do. I
*  absolutely do. You don't. Wait, Nate, what happened? Five minutes ago, you talking about Hasan.
*  Everything I said about Hasan is true. There is no steel man there. Okay. That's not charitable.
*  That's- I'm sorry. If you can- if you can prove me wrong, I would love for you to do it. Okay.
*  I'm using my gut instinct. Usually when somebody feels strongly about another person in that way,
*  it's not coming from a place of data and reason. It's coming from a place of emotion.
*  It's coming from a place of resentment and grudge and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, I understand.
*  There's emotions deep in there. So the gachis hiding- the gachis is a surface of an iceberg
*  and there's a deep ocean underneath that you yourself have not explored. I disagree,
*  but I understand why you think that. And lav is actually a doorway. The young
*  lav is a doorway for you to explore the depths of- Get into that ocean to find my fish,
*  my pre-evolved form. Yeah. I understand why you think the way you do and you should. You
*  shouldn't believe me and I understand that because if somebody told me the same thing, I'd think you
*  probably just really don't like this person for a reason or two. I understand why you think that way.
*  Okay. The reality is though, for any political person that I disagree with, I can give them
*  a fair shake. It's one of the few things I think I do exceedingly well on my stream. Even with Hasan,
*  there's been drama that he's been involved in and I've like very- when I'm involved in drama,
*  he'll always throw me under the bus. But when he's involved in stuff, I'll always say like,
*  oh, like I think Hasan was right here or I think that he meant this. There was a thing that came
*  up once we're on a live stream fail. He was getting roasted because he referred to somebody-
*  he used the expression shitskin to refer to somebody's like the way they looked. And I have
*  only ever heard that in the context of 4chan people talking about like Indians or like black people,
*  like it's a racial thing. But I could tell the context and everything that he was saying. He was
*  insulting some guy. I think it was kind of like incel virgin over- he was going for like acne skin.
*  I think that's what he meant when he said it. And there were a whole bunch of people that were
*  insulting. It's like, oh my God, did he just say racist term? And I was like, no, I don't think
*  he was racist. I think he was like, he was just reaching for words and that's what came out.
*  So like that's an example of me being charitable. Okay. But didn't you criticize him for something?
*  I was trying to like Google why the hell you guys split up because I thought your friends,
*  you should be like-
*  You split up over Kamala Harris video, but go ahead.
*  I feel like you criticized them over something. And I'm okay. This is very vague memory,
*  but you criticize them over something and I felt that criticism wasn't charitable.
*  Was it Pete Buttigieg stuff?
*  Yeah, Pete Buttigieg. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
*  Yeah. So I've said this a million times, but no amount of context or no amount of nuances
*  is ever acceptable to people. I don't think Hassan is homophobic, but I think the comments made about
*  Pete Buttigieg were really homophobic.
*  That's what he said.
*  Yeah. And there were a lot of people making a lot of comments that made me really uncomfortable
*  about Pete Buttigieg. That was insane to me.
*  Spurred by the comments of Hassan?
*  No, but it was an environment of progressives. All the progressives were attacking Pete. And I
*  felt like his gayness became like the subject of a lot of attacks.
*  Why throw Hassan under the bus for that?
*  Because he was jumping along with all of those types of like insults.
*  You don't think you've done the same kind of stuff?
*  If I do, call me out. I don't know. I shouldn't have done that.
*  That's what the R-word was about.
*  It's fine. That's a good call out.
*  Yeah.
*  No, but like your friend, like you should privately tell them, right? Like, hey.
*  Well, no, by then we were sworn enemies.
*  So that wasn't the reason you-
*  No, no, no. It was over a Kamala Harris video.
*  Sworn enemies.
*  He hates me. What am I supposed to- Listen, for all of these people, I will accept them back into
*  my life if they ever want to come back in at any point in time. But usually they're the ones-
*  If they correct themselves, right?
*  No, I'm not expecting anybody to- So here's the deal with Vash and Hassan. These are like the three-
*  We're the three guys online. None of us will talk to each other. Hassan, because he won't give
*  clout to anybody and Vash, because he thinks I'm bad faith. And then neither of them will talk to
*  me because they both hate me.
*  You guys should go on a camping trip together. It's like broke back Martin, but three way.
*  And just like rejoin, refine-
*  Yeah, that could be a thing.
*  Refine the appreciate for each other. Honestly, just from the internet perspective, for me,
*  just stepping into this world, there's some aspect to which you have a responsibility.
*  I hate that word. You have an opportunity. I wish you guys would kind of be the beacon of
*  forgiveness and friendship and camaraderie and that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah, I agree. And even if we disagree, it would be really good content for us to-
*  Shit talk, like friends shit talk versus not- The fact that you guys don't talk to each other.
*  I would love for you to shit talk publicly with the camaraderie always there. There's love in the
*  beginning, love in the end, but you beat the shit out of each other in the middle. And that's what
*  live streaming is for, the political discourse. That's great political discourse versus I think
*  what underlies it is some jealousy and so on. You get this many followers.
*  I just want to make sure you're clear to your audience.
*  Everybody has to your audience. I'm sure you have flaws and I'm just not in this dynamic.
*  Hard to find. Your only flaw is you're too modest. So why did you guys split up? Because
*  I would love it honestly. Let me just put that idea out there for you guys to make up.
*  It's out there. Of course, as everybody talks, me, Vash and Hasan, it's crazy that the three
*  largest political debate left leaning people online can't do any type of content or collaboration
*  at all. It's so stupid. What was the reason you guys split up? The Kamala Harris?
*  Hasan's entry into the Twitch political debate world was in 2018. I think he did a debate with
*  Charlie Kirk and he reached out to me to review that debate to go over it on stream. He came on,
*  we went over it and then we kind of friendship developed. We hung out in real life. I think when
*  I came to LA, I think I slept on his couch, we played with his dog. We were kind of friends.
*  As time went on, I think he was a little bit more, he was farther left than he led on. I was
*  a social Democrat, he was a social Democrat. But back in those days, like 2018, when people
*  said they were a social Democrat, they really meant socialist, but they just didn't want to say it.
*  He was farther left than me and we had a lot of deep divides in our approach to politics.
*  Whereas I was very much like a first principles, this is my whole political position. He was very
*  much kind of like a, this is the political ideology I'm involved in and this is the field that I
*  navigate in. There were a couple instances where these divides would be laid very bare.
*  One was when it was either him or the young Turks, I think it was him. There was a shooting in a
*  neighborhood where very young black child gets killed by a white shooter. And they did a video
*  about like hate crimes and how hate crimes are on the rise between races and white people are evil
*  and blah, blah, blah. Not that, but like white people committing hate crimes against black people.
*  And I remember saying to him, I was like, hey, we don't have all the data yet for this. It feels
*  really bad to make videos about this beforehand because it's the same type of shit that happens
*  at airports. Is there a thing going on? Was it a brown person? Are they Muslim? It's Islamic
*  extremism. We see this played out so many times in recent history, probably not a good idea to
*  jump to conclusions. And he's like, well, no, you don't understand. It's not that big a deal,
*  whatever. And obviously as the story goes, tale as old as time, the data comes out, it was just an
*  errant shot. There was like gang violence, shot goes out of nowhere, hits a kid in the car. It
*  wasn't like a hate crime. The guy was trying to kill a kid. But yeah, we basically, we bump up
*  against a few kind of political disagreements like this. And an annoying thing is happening in my
*  community where Hassan is like the serious political figure because he's from the Young
*  Turks. And I'm just kind of like, I do politics, but I also game. And anytime I criticize Hassan,
*  people like Destiny, you need to be more respectful. He does this full time. If you're
*  going to bring criticisms, you need to be like really well read and researched because he's got
*  a more serious, whatever, which I thought was ridiculous. So by the way, if people don't know,
*  he worked at the Young Turks, which is like the largest left leaning YouTube channel, probably,
*  or at least at the time. Yeah. So finally, he did a video on, skip ahead to some more minor
*  discriminates. He does a video on Kamala Harris. He calls it Kaatmala Harris. And it's like seven
*  or eight horrible things about Kamala Harris. And I'm like, okay, I know at least one or two
*  of these things are not fully accurate. So I'm going to do all the research. I'm going to have
*  all the sources and we're going to have a long conversation about it. So that now when I provide
*  criticism to him, it's not going to be like this horrible, like just me saying something flippantly
*  or whatever. It's going to be like substantial criticism. So I was on a plane ride, JFK to
*  Orlando, whatever, flying to Sweden, visit my wife and on the plane, I review all of the video,
*  all the data, do all the research and I write everything. I'm like, okay, I get to my wife's
*  dad's house and I'm at the table. We're having a conversation like, hey, we should talk about the
*  Kamala Harris stuff. And he's like, okay, well, let's do it. And we go over it and I'll leave
*  to the audience to watch the video. Enough people will say this. I feel pretty confident saying this.
*  I was pretty reasonable, pretty measured, pretty calm the whole time. And I think he started to get
*  increasingly irritated that I was levying like more and more serious criticisms at like the quality
*  of work that he did. Probably because he felt a little bit intimidated, I think by my willingness
*  to like dive through political stuff. There'd been a couple of awkward blowups where like on,
*  there's like a show called the Raj Royale where sometimes politics would come up and Hassan would
*  kind of try to explain something. And there was another person one time on the show that made the
*  joke. It was like, instead of Hassan taking 10 minutes to explain this, can Destiny just come
*  here and explain it in 30 seconds? And he like exploded. He got so fucking mad at that. So yeah,
*  I think that when I made that kind of call out or critique of him over the Kamala Harris stuff,
*  he's probably feeling like increasingly irritated, threatened, agitated. And then that's kind of what
*  began the huge split from ours. So you don't think you were a dick at all?
*  I don't think so in that conversation. Especially given that like, at that point,
*  because this is still 2018 or 20, this might be 2019. I'm still known at that point as being
*  very aggressive towards conservatives or all writers. Oh, gotcha. Yeah. So and with lefties,
*  is what I call them. I think I'm being like very gentle. Like my conversation with conservatives
*  is like, you're a fucking idiot. You're so dumb. Like that's how I'm like doing. So like with him,
*  I'm like, well, don't you think that like, this is like a little bit of like an inconsistent
*  presentation of how like, I feel like it'd be nice. But I always leave to the audience. They can go
*  and watch that Kamala video, Kamala Harris video, Destiny of the Sun, if they think that I was being
*  a dick. But a lot of people watching said I was being pretty gentle. Well, let me say, as a new
*  fan of this space, I hope you guys make up and I hope you guys fight it out in the space of discourse
*  and ideas. Me too. And also with empathy, understanding what the strength of the other person is,
*  what their buttons are. And, you know, there's like an unspoken rule that you don't press the buttons
*  that you need to, unless you're doing it mutually. And it's fun because you know, you just find the
*  piece of each other off. So yeah, that's kind of like what friends do. You don't cross a certain
*  line. But then other than that, you fight it out. Okay, let's step back. One other super interesting
*  aspect of your worldview is your big supporter of Biden. Can you explain what you love about Biden?
*  Do you love Biden more than Sean Carroll or less? Sean Carroll is just like in another world of
*  admiration. I feel like I'm culturally appropriating you by saying gotcha now.
*  But it's so convenient. It's an easy word. You just, I know we're on the same wavelength. Okay,
*  we're synchronizing. That's good. I mean, it is really interesting because even people that
*  support Biden usually don't say they love sort of they don't support it strongly, you know.
*  Ideologically, philosophically, the reason why I like Biden is because he's really committed
*  to this bringing the left and right together, which is something we so desperately need in the
*  country. And his, you know, statements over and over again, of like, I'm not the Democrat president
*  or the Republican president, I'm the president of the United States, his desire to bring Republicans
*  together to work on things like the infrastructure bill. That's so incredibly needed. And I have a
*  huge amount of respect and admiration for him for trying to push through on that message.
*  Do you think then it's unfortunate that he made that comment about MAGA?
*  MAGA Republicans? Yeah. I mean, I forget what the comment was, but MAGA Republicans are
*  not good people kind of thing. I watched the full video and he's right. There is this toxic aspect
*  and it's hard to call out because they're always going to spend like, oh, he hates our Republicans.
*  He's not. If you watch the quote, he's very specifically calling out like this group of
*  people that think that the election was fraudulent. Is it clear? That's what he meant by-
*  We can bring it up.
*  All right. This is- Oh, no. Uh-oh. But I remember watching our stream,
*  he was like, if he said it, yeah, that's bad. You probably like YouTube, MAGA Republicans, Biden.
*  But like, it feels like it's pretty clear he's talking about the people that are like,
*  election denying. Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal.
*  Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations
*  of our Republic. Now I want to be very clear. Let's end on this part.
*  Very clear up front. Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans are MAGA
*  Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know because I've been able
*  to work with these mainstream Republicans, but there's no question that the Republican
*  party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.
*  And that is a threat to this country.
*  I disagree with that, man. He didn't clearly say extremist ideology. He didn't say the
*  people that dialed the validity of the election.
*  I mean, that's Donald Trump.
*  No, but there's-
*  That's all the candidates that Donald Trump is supporting. How many, what is it, like 40, 50,
*  how many candidates right now that are MAGA candidates are election denied?
*  No, but there's 80 million or whatever people voted for Donald Trump. You could say that's
*  the MAGA Republicans. So to me, it sounded like he was referring to not even the majority. I mean,
*  that's one nice, helpful, clarifying statement. But it's basically there's the mainstream
*  Republicans and then there's those that voted for Donald Trump. That's the way I heard it.
*  Okay. Maybe you should have done a better job at clarifying, but I feel like there's a clear,
*  there is a huge problem with this group of Americans that think that the election is
*  stolen. I feel like that's what he's trying to call it.
*  No matter if that's what he meant, even flirting with that line is not a person who's bringing
*  people together.
*  I feel like extending a hand to the, like most, I've worked with Republicans in Congress,
*  not even a majority of Republicans are like this.
*  No, but why say not the majority of Republicans that like this say like, we're like one country.
*  We believe the same thing. So like focus on the uniting part versus saying-
*  He does before and after. That was 50 seconds. Okay.
*  But that you never, the point is you never say something like that. Listen, like that,
*  you've spoken about the Bosnia speech, which is your favorite of his. I went back to it and
*  listened to it.
*  Yeah. Before I moved to that, just on this, it's really hard for him to call out that group of
*  election deniers. I think without it always feeling like-
*  Well, why call them out?
*  Because it's arguably one of the most destructive forces that exist in this country today.
*  Did it destroy anything?
*  They were trying to.
*  Did it though? It didn't, did it?
*  So does that mean we don't call it out? We wait till next time?
*  No, because calling it out is giving fuel to the division. Like the people that doubted the
*  validity of the election, that's anger, that's frustration with the other side. You heal that
*  as opposed to saying all those people that believed that at any time are idiots. They're
*  un-American.
*  They don't think the election was real. I don't know if Biden has the ears of these people at
*  all. I don't know what he can do for-
*  There's people that believe the same thing in 2016 with the Russian hacking.
*  Right? There's this-
*  Hold on.
*  Yes.
*  That is a super not fair comparison.
*  Okay.
*  There are definitely the mainstream Democrat opinion was that Russian intrusion in terms of
*  social media and stuff happened, but there was never a claim that the election was stolen.
*  I don't know of any mainstream Democrat that supported that.
*  Donald Trump is not just saying there was interference.
*  Well, Donald Trump is literally saying the election was literally stolen, that
*  vote boxes were, ballot boxes were hidden, that vote tallies were manipulated. I think the claim
*  is there's a huge gulf of difference in the two.
*  You can attack Donald Trump for that.
*  Yeah.
*  I believe it's not the words of the United to attack people that believe that.
*  You could argue maybe it's okay, but especially not being super clear about that,
*  about who you're referring to when you say MAGA Republicans.
*  Because MAGA is a hat and a slogan that refers to whatever the number is,
*  70 million people, however, that voted for Donald Trump.
*  Of all the Republicans that consider themselves MAGA Republicans, what percentage of them do you
*  think believe the election was stolen? I feel like that number is, I don't have the pump,
*  I feel like the number is probably more than 70%.
*  What's a MAGA Republican? Maybe I'm not-
*  Like a Trump-supported Republican, a MAGA Republican, they're there for Trump.
*  What's the difference between somebody that voted for Trump and a-
*  MAGA Republican?
*  And a MAGA Republican.
*  So my mom is a MAGA Republican. If Trump ran independently and DeSantis ran under the Republican
*  ticket, my mom would vote for Trump. She'll follow him to the end of the earth. That's
*  like a MAGA Republican.
*  I think it's easy to mistake that distinction in these kinds of political speeches. To me,
*  anybody who voted for Trump can easily, in the context of the speech, be interpreted as a MAGA
*  Republican.
*  Gotcha.
*  I understand what you're saying. Maybe you could have been more clear, but I think in
*  listening to that, I think it's pretty obvious who he's talking about. But I guess if you have an
*  emotional response to it, I can understand the emotional response. But there's a lot of people-
*  I don't have an emotional response. I just don't like, I think I'm with, what is it,
*  Michelle Obama. They go low, we go high. Meaning to me, a uniter doesn't participate in derision.
*  Sure, a uniter might not, but a leader has to be able to accurately assess the situation before
*  him and make people aware of what's going on.
*  You mean all the impeachment trials, all the censoring from social media, all of that didn't
*  do the job?
*  That's not his job. I don't know about censoring any of that.
*  That mechanism, his job is to inspire a nation to unite a nation.
*  How can he do that when half the people don't believe that he was even legitimately elected?
*  I think he's done a good job at working on legislation and doing stuff that hopefully
*  benefits all Americans. But I think it's important to recognize that there is a contingent of
*  Americans that don't even believe that this is really crazy.
*  There are plenty of people that recognize that and are fighting that and are constantly screaming
*  that from the rooftops. His job is to be the inspiring figure that makes the majority of
*  Americans be proud for him to be a president of the nation they love. And that's what the uniting
*  aspect is. You remind people that we are one and we love this country, we love the ideas
*  that it represents.
*  Tricky does that in other parts of that speech. It's like a 20 minute speech, isn't it?
*  But that's a fuck up. You just don't participate in that division. Anyway, I understand.
*  I just wanted to push back on the saying. One of his strengths is that he's uniting. But yes,
*  that is an ideal, that is a goal, is a great one. And he is one that espouse that goal
*  for a long time. What else? So from a policy perspective and so on.
*  I thought the way he's handled Ukraine and everything thus far has been almost perfect.
*  I think he did a really good job at the political maneuvering and bringing other countries into the
*  fold at establishing clearly what our mission was in relation to Ukraine. I thought he did a
*  good job there. I admire him for pulling out of Afghanistan. Even it was a little bit rough
*  around the edges. We got out and we're gone. No American lives are lost. The domestic policies
*  passed more major legislation than I think anybody thought possible. The green energy stuff with the
*  last bill, the infrastructure bill, a lot of the coronavirus relief I thought was really good,
*  especially expansion of the child tax credit. So from a policy perspective, foreign and domestic
*  he's been successful. Rhetorically, I think he's generally been above board in terms of not
*  attacking people and being too divisive. He's trying to bring people together and work on them.
*  What do you think about the popular in the media criticism of his mental decline?
*  Do you think he's experiencing mental decline? He's an old guy.
*  But do you think... Yeah, maybe a little bit, but he's still doing a good job.
*  Not from a speech perspective, you mean from a policy perspective?
*  Yeah, I'm analyzing it as a job. From a speech perspective, maybe not the greatest,
*  but yeah, I mean, he's definitely, what is he like 80, 81? How old is he?
*  I lose track after so many years. But you did say that he's probably going to run in 2024 and he's
*  probably going to win. Did I say that? That he's probably going to win? No way did I say that.
*  He's probably going to run. Who knows who will win? But I think I feel like the incumbent advantage
*  is so strong. You really going to throw that away? Like things like one or two times in history in
*  the US, right? Where like the non-incumbent, the parties put somebody else up.
*  Yeah, I mean, the concern is like the just the age and the mental decline, just the wear and tear
*  of the campaign, all of that kind of stuff, all of the speech you have to make, the debates and
*  all that kind of stuff. Yeah, I guess we'll see what happens.
*  What? The least excited...
*  I mean, two years from now is a long time. And his current mental state, he could run and do it. He
*  could do a possible job. In two years, man, I don't know, I've seen videos of Bill Clinton recently,
*  he's looking pretty rough. You know, if Biden is looking a lot more rough,
*  worse for wear in two years, then maybe they actually do have to dig out another person
*  for running on us. What do you think about Trump when he won in 2016? I think is when you
*  came to fruition, politically speaking. So what do you think his winning the 2016 election represents?
*  So for me, Trump, the reason why I got into politics was Trump was like this new epistemic
*  force in American politics that like, you kind of have to like flirt with facts before, even if
*  you wanted to be non-factual, he super didn't care. Lying was like a first language to him,
*  just like in speaking in terms of like, the way that he used language to just say to you what he
*  felt like you needed to hear to support him and not care at all about what is going on about.
*  Yeah, that's what Trump represented to me in terms of like, things that I cared about. He also
*  represents a lot more obviously that there was this undercurrent of American opinion that a lot
*  of people didn't know still existed, and it did, he got elected. That the Overton window was
*  misidentified by even a large amount of the Republican Party, that populism was a lot more
*  popular than a lot of people figured, you know. Yeah, there's a lot that I guess he represented.
*  Do you think Trump should have been banned from Twitter?
*  Can you make the case for and against it? So you're a big supporter of free speech.
*  Yeah, so the case in favor of it.
*  Do you think he should be brought back?
*  Yeah, because if he gets brought back, there's a higher chance that I'll be brought back, so
*  I'm supporting that all the way. Thank you, Elon, unban my account.
*  So because you called me weak spine, I'm going to have to message Elon.
*  Okay, at Omnidestiny, it was a verified Twitter account.
*  Omnidestiny.
*  Why'd you get banned from Twitter, Destiny?
*  I don't know.
*  I'll add that to Elon. I saw that there was a screenshot of you referring to the rape of
*  somebody.
*  Okay, that was on an older Twitter account, and that was a bad tweet.
*  You have multiple Twitter accounts, so you're trying to go around the bans that you keep getting.
*  Okay, hold on. You're slandering me a lot right now.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's get the facts straight, okay? I don't even remember why my first account got banned,
*  but it was a wild account. I tweeted some wildly inappropriate things.
*  You regret?
*  I don't like that word. I'm going to give the answer that most people get, but it's like,
*  I don't regret it because I learned a lot, so I'm glad I had the bad experiences that I did.
*  Why don't you like the word regret?
*  I think if we look at where we are, how do you feel about determinism?
*  I believe in the hardest of determinism. That's who I am, okay?
*  Sure.
*  Who I am today is the culmination of everything that's occurred in the past.
*  I believe you speaking about regret is a nice way to communicate that in this deterministic world,
*  you've analyzed the acts of the past, and you're no longer that person.
*  Yeah, of course. For sure.
*  That's what regret usually means.
*  Okay. Thanks for giving me the human explanation. Okay, true.
*  In that sense, there's a lot of things I've done that I regret.
*  What are you? You're not human? You're a bot?
*  NPC is my preferred term.
*  Okay, all right.
*  Those are your pro-nots.
*  I wish I would have been smart enough at the time to not have to have made those mistakes.
*  There you go.
*  Good job.
*  But yeah, obviously, really dumb, really crazy, off-the-wall tweets.
*  That account got banned, but then I made another account
*  called Omnidestiny.
*  I can't believe I'm giving you a history-made Twitter account.
*  I made another account called Omnidestiny.
*  It's an honor.
*  I got verified. I was cool. They let me have that account because originally they banned it,
*  and I said, appeal, and I was like, oh, let me have one more.
*  Back then, Twitter was cool, and they're like, okay, go for it.
*  That account lasted for a long time, and I don't actually know 100% why that account got banned.
*  I believe that the tweet that showed up in the final, I got banned for hate speech,
*  and it was because there was a picture that I tweeted with three different alt-righters
*  that are kind of like neo-Nazi people, and they were all mixed-race people.
*  I said the new alt-right looks like a Disney Channel original movie
*  in terms of racial composition, and somehow they got flagged for
*  instigating violence against minorities, I think.
*  I think that's the tweet that got me banned,
*  because I think that's what showed up in the final report, but I don't know.
*  Maybe there were other reasons because nobody ever communicates,
*  but ever since that account went under, it's just been ban evading ever since.
*  Oh, ban evading ever since.
*  So all my new accounts I'm going to ban just get banned because they finally figure out it's me,
*  and then they ban evade. There's like one dude at Twitter HQ who's like
*  constantly looking for my new accounts, and they get me.
*  Anyway, yeah.
*  So post-Trump world.
*  Do you think, okay, I mean this...
*  Oh, should he be banned? Oh, you asked me to make both cases.
*  Should he be banned? I mean, damn, dude, when you're tweeting out shit
*  that's arguably leading to stuff like January 6th, I can understand why,
*  because it's like, what else is this wild dude going to tweet out?
*  Like, is he going to start instigating other violent events?
*  So I'm sympathetic towards the like, okay, well, he can't just be here saying stuff like this.
*  That's insane. We're going to ban him.
*  Because it's an instigating actual physical violence in the face.
*  Yeah, you're instigating.
*  Physical violence in the physical world.
*  Yeah, like if I were to tweet stuff like that, I would get banned, probably.
*  On the flip side, this is the President of the United States.
*  It seems like he's like doing presidential decree by social media sometimes.
*  Like, is it really right that one public or private, I should say,
*  one private company can like erase the President of the United States words
*  from the eyes of a lot of Americans that are using these social media feeds?
*  And one big one, which I for sure am against, is the permanent ban.
*  Yeah, I don't like that. I hate that.
*  Even in my community, if somebody comes back over like a year, like, I mean...
*  Did you just compare yourself to the President of the United States?
*  No, I compare myself to Twitter banning the President of the United States.
*  Let me put it this way. If I banned Donald Trump in my chat room, I'd unban him in a year.
*  A year?
*  Yeah.
*  What's the process for unbanning Donald Trump? What would he have to do?
*  Usually people send me an email and they're like, listen, I did this stuff.
*  I'm sorry I was dumb. I'll give him another chance.
*  But a year, what if they send an email a month later?
*  Usually I'll unban him. That's usually my problem.
*  I ban pretty quickly in my community, but if you ever ask...
*  You're a big softie.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, I usually unban him. Yeah.
*  Well, because I used to be the worst type of internet person.
*  And I think I'm a little bit better than I used to be.
*  So...
*  Now that you're older.
*  Yeah, now that I've matured. Yeah, of course.
*  Age bestows a wisdom that just can't be gotten any other way.
*  What's your sense in general? Is there something interesting you could say about your view on free
*  speech? It seems like one of those terms that's also overused to mean a lot of different things.
*  What does it mean to you?
*  If you have a democratic style of governance, you are entrusting people with one of the most
*  awesome and radical of responsibilities. And that's saying that you're going to pick the
*  people that are going to make some of the hardest decisions in all of human history.
*  If you're going to trust people to vote correctly, you have to be able to trust them to have open
*  and honest dialogue with each other. Whether that's Nazis or KKK people or whoever talking,
*  you have to believe that your people are going to be able to rise above and make
*  the correct determinations when they hear these types of speeches.
*  And if you're so worried that somebody is going to hear a certain political figure and they're
*  going to be completely radicalized instantly, then what that tells me is that you don't have
*  enough faith in humans for democracy to be a viable institution, which is fine.
*  You can be anti-democratic, but I don't think you can be pro-democracy and anti-free speech.
*  Within reason. So what's the within reason?
*  You can't post like child porn or something on Twitter where people try to get you on that
*  stuff or like direct calls to violence or probably not. You shouldn't be tweeting it like,
*  we're going to meet up tomorrow and go bomb, blah, blah, blah.
*  Do you think it's okay to allow racism and anti-Semitism and hate speech?
*  Hate speech, yes, because that can be very broadly defined. I can understand there being
*  some basic rules of like no slurs on like a platform that gets into like acceptable forms
*  of moderation or like excessive harassment and bullying. I can understand. But past that,
*  when the moderation becomes ideological, I get a little bit nervous because, you know,
*  there's a whole other host. Yeah, of course it's all a gray area, but
*  when it feels like ideology has seeped into the censorship. Not good. Yeah. Which it's so fascinating
*  to think, especially now that Elon bought Twitter, how do you engineer a system that
*  prevents ideology from seeping in and nevertheless is able to create a platform that has healthy
*  conversations? Because if you have one guy who's just screaming nonsense nonstop, it
*  has this effect where the quiet voices at the back of the room are silenced. Yeah. So like,
*  that's what you usually don't talk about. Like if you let one annoying loud person in,
*  that's actually censoring the voice of a lot of people that would like to speak,
*  but they don't get a chance. That's one of the things, especially around like trans discourse,
*  I have to constantly do that like reminder from my audience. So like when I'm dealing with these
*  types of people on the internet, a lot of them might seem really crazy. A lot of these types
*  of people might seem insane, but like in the real world, outside of like the crazy Twitter activist
*  world, like the vast majority of people you're meeting from LGBT communities are like the
*  coolest, normalist people. All they want is to like write, to live their life the way they want to
*  and to be like unobstructed and like, yeah, but people will get this impression of like an online
*  activist, like a vegan or LGBT person or whatever. And then they think that every single person in
*  real life is like that. And it's a really negative stereotype. And then even the other people in that
*  group. Oh, is Malina coming over? Oh yeah. I see. I don't know if that's her. Okay. Malina just
*  joined us. What were we talking about? Was it interesting? You were saying that you were going
*  to talk to Elon about getting at Omni Destiny, the verified Twitter account unbanned. I said,
*  that's so- That sounds like a lot. That's so gracious of you. I can't even believe you would
*  do that for me. And then you admitted that you tried to evade the ban multiple times,
*  which I'm sure would be very looked upon. You know, I heard that in Norway in their prison system,
*  they don't actually punish you for trying to escape jail because that's like the natural human
*  thing to do. They hug you? What do they- I don't know if they, but they don't punish you because of
*  course you're trying to be free. That's all I'm trying to be on Twitter. I'm just trying to be
*  free. Oh, that's the natural humanistic- Yeah, that's the natural human, of course. It's the
*  banning ban. You're not a destructive force. You're just- No, I'm a positive, I'm a force for good.
*  That's why all my accounts only get banned for banning banning. I don't get banned for doing
*  bad things. And I'm a progressive show. I'm like far left. I love like progressive causes.
*  I thought this is what you criticized Sassan for being.
*  I show them from a place of first principles, not from a mindless AI echoing kind of thing,
*  you know? Okay. So you're a free thinking bot. Yeah, exactly. All right, cool. Well,
*  I'm sure we'll return to some politics. That was beautiful.
*  Can you tell us about yourself? You're also a fellow streamer. What's your story? Yes, I stream
*  and I started streaming because I met him basically, kind of, but I don't do the politics.
*  I do like travels or talk about relationships, talk to my audience basically. You're from that
*  part of the world, right? Sweden. Yeah, exactly. So did you escape from prison and they didn't?
*  That was Norway. That's different. I've actually really, I've been to Sweden a bunch of times.
*  There's a tech sector there that's really like flourishing. Where did you go? Which city? I went
*  to Stockholm. I think I gave a few lectures there. There's a vibrant tech sector. It was cool. And
*  people are super nice. Yeah, we're friendly. We're not like very deep. Like we don't really have much
*  deep conversations. It's like a meta. Oh, there's not many intellectuals that come from Sweden.
*  We don't really speak very highly of ourselves. We kind of like just chill all the time. We don't
*  make a scene. We don't, we're just like, you know. Do you know what the name for that is? There's a
*  specific name for it. It's a... Jantelagen. Yeah, Jantelagen. Yeah. Oh, there's a philosophy behind
*  it. When you're part of like Sweden or Norway, you like, you don't talk too highly of yourself
*  because it's seen as kind of like rude. Like think of like America except the exact opposite.
*  You don't even really want to like, you don't want to make yourself into a victim too much. You don't
*  want to be too much of anything. You're just like sticking to the group. Don't make big scene about
*  yourself. But that said, you came here and you were, you put yourself in front of a camera and
*  became a streamer. Yes. Do you understand how weird that is for my friends in Sweden?
*  Do you have anxiety? I just didn't talk about myself and just like make a big deal about myself
*  for hours every day. Was that like terrifying? Did you have anxiety about that? No, because I don't
*  see them. But then I come back and I'm like, ooh. Also, what do you feel like when you're actually
*  streaming? You feel like you're just alone in a room? One-on-one type of thing? No, I see, I see
*  chat and I'm thinking, oh, they're like little fairies. They're not really real. They're just
*  like out there. I don't know what they look like. I just see little names and they're just cute and
*  colors. You're talking to little fairies inside your head. Is that how you feel about chat?
*  They're demons for me. They're demons? Okay. My aunt of fairies.
*  So is chat a source of stress or happiness? Like, is there a-
*  No, for me, it's a source of happiness. I've been very intentional with like the construction of my
*  community. So I'm really happy with where it's at. How are you able to actually have deep political
*  discourse while playing a video game at the same time? I have a really good chat room in terms of
*  like the way that people engage in conversations. Like I was one of the earliest people to
*  embrace the philosophy of like, I am in total control of what people watch me think. That like
*  I have a high level of responsibility for how they conduct themselves. And then if I conduct
*  myself in a certain way, I can expect a certain level of conduct from them. And for the most
*  part, it's like worked pretty well for the past, you know, nine or 10 years. Yeah.
*  What about the actual playing of the game? Like you're able to parallelize the brain. Like-
*  Oh. Like it seems like,
*  Factorio seems like a super complex game. Yeah. I don't actually think that's possible. I don't
*  think multitasking for a human brain is possible. If you see me playing a game, usually what's
*  happening is the conversation is like, I've had it a million times, so I'm not thinking about it.
*  I've automated that. Or if the conversation is very challenging, then if you really watch what's
*  happening, I'm probably just running around in circles because I have to think about the
*  conversation. Okay. Because with Factorio, it looks like a lot of stuff is going on.
*  Sometimes, yeah. So I guess it's hard for a person who hasn't played the game to detect that you're
*  not actually- Does that come off as like you're super intelligent and multitask or does it come
*  off as like he's not interested in this conversation at all? Yeah.
*  There's a coolness to it. Like when you're not paying attention, like if you're looking elsewhere,
*  like you're checking your phone, you're too cool for this conversation. There's a sense like that.
*  Yeah. The reality is though, is if you watch- It was easier to see in Minecraft because in Minecraft,
*  when there was a challenging conversation, if you watch me play, I'm literally just running around
*  and jumping in circles because I have to think about the conversation 100%. I can't do a
*  complicated task and think about the conversation. Or like the people always joke in my chat, like,
*  oh no, the notepad came out. If it's a really challenging conversation, I'll get rid of the
*  game and I'll bring out a notepad and I'll start writing stuff down to keep track of what's going
*  on. Yeah. So what kind of stuff do you stream? So advice? You talk about-
*  Yeah, like either I talk to chat or I travel around basically. Like we have a conversation,
*  so we like go to countries. I've been to like Italy. I was in Italy for like one and a half
*  months just like traveling around alone, going to cities, like having like my camera with me
*  and like streaming for hours. Where's the coolest place you've been to? Ever. It's probably New
*  Zealand. New Zealand? I think so. After it's probably going to be Italy, I think. Because I
*  like history and- Oh, so both history because New Zealand is also beautiful. So it's both natural
*  beauty and historical beauty. Yeah, for sure. I think I just really like the Polynesian sort
*  of culture. I think it's very interesting, like the ocean people and it's just really beautiful.
*  People are very relaxed, chill. They're very far away, which is interesting as well because
*  whenever they talk about politics or they talk about just like the world, it feels really far away.
*  So where's home for you? Is Austin home? It's home for me. So a human being is home? Yeah.
*  We've lived in a lot of different places and traveled around a lot. So that's why you think of home as like
*  human. I think so. Yeah. I mean, if they're going to be a place, it's probably going to be like my
*  childhood places probably. Like my old country house or something like that. We don't have it
*  anymore, but that's home for me, I guess. So how'd you guys meet each other? You're currently married.
*  Yes. To each other, yeah. To each other. Yeah. Just making sure we're on the same page.
*  All right, cool. How'd you guys meet? I was watching his YouTube stuff, like 2018, I think,
*  because it was the Swedish election around that time and I was interested in politics.
*  And then I think he said in one of his videos that he had an Instagram and that he needed people to
*  stop DMing him. That wasn't cutie pies. And then I messaged him and said, am I a cutie pie? And then
*  you're pie in like two minutes. And then that's when I was in New Zealand. And I guess you wanted
*  to escape America or like LA for a little bit and include New Zealand. Where were you mentally there?
*  Because we've talked through this timeline. Where's 2018? Was it 18, 19? Where was the low point?
*  Or that was way earlier? Low point, carburetor cleaning. That was like 2010. Oh, okay. 2018 was
*  probably your peak. Every day. Now is my peak. What do you mean? That was my peak. Why would you say
*  that? No, nobody ever admits being past their prime. Just so you know. Well, I mean, my prime is
*  still coming up. Okay, it was probably around the time where you were getting a lot of lefties to
*  your community and you were really thinking about that they would go too far. Maybe. I think that
*  was still when Hassan and Vashj were both in my community. Exactly. So I would say it feels like
*  there was not really much issues when it come to your stuff or your work stuff back then. Oh,
*  something we didn't talk about is that there were no politics on Twitch. I exclusively inhabited that
*  place for like two years because nobody else did it. Because it was a really toxic environment for
*  politics. So for a couple of years as it grew, I kind of grew the whole space because nobody was
*  doing it yet. What did that look like? You're having like political debates, political discourse.
*  Yeah, mainly like going into YouTube people to try to argue with them or just doing politics on
*  stream like reading stories, researching stuff, talking about stuff. But there's not like other
*  people on Twitch to debate about politics because there was no politics. It was, yeah. Was there a
*  debate in the space of communism, socialism, social democrats, kind of like this? Are you trying to
*  outline your own position during that time? I think it was mainly me fighting against conservatives
*  because it was like Trump stuff. And then it was coming off the back of like, there was this movement
*  called Gamergate and there was all this anti SJW stuff on the internet. And I was like the SJW,
*  like the progressive that was fighting on the progressive side of things. So I think that's
*  what I was known for. But I was fighting with people off of Twitch because on Twitch there
*  weren't very many political discussions happening. So you were holding the SJW flag. Yeah. To what
*  degree do you still hold it? Like what's the best, what's the steel man case for SJW? I mean,
*  I'm still very much that SJW from 2018, 2019, but the positions have moved so much farther left that
*  some people might not call me that anymore. I'm not sure. It depends on who I'm talking to.
*  So it's basically, what is social justice? Were you like being sensitive to the experience of others?
*  Yeah. Being sensitive and empathetic towards the experience of others. And then trying to build
*  a better world that like suits as many different types of people as possible while being like aware
*  of like their needs. Okay. So you guys met, what's your, from your perspective, is that, does she,
*  is she telling lies? Is it accurate? No, it's pretty accurate. Okay. When'd you guys actually meet?
*  I flew out in 2019. Yeah. Basically there was like weird stuff happening in LA. I just come off of
*  kind of a weird, not kind of sort of relationship and I just wanted to like go away for a while.
*  Another company reached out to me and they had like a fun streaming device and they said they'd
*  sponsor a trip if I went somewhere. And I was like, oh, well, I know this person. I know a couple
*  people in New Zealand and Malina is one of them. It's like, I'll go to New Zealand. It'll be fun.
*  And yeah, I did that for two weeks. Do you guys believe in love?
*  I feel like you're, you lack the gotcha got us into this. I'm not sure to the degree to
*  which you have human emotions. I have quite a few. Okay. From your perspective, when did you,
*  when did you fall in love with Malina? When did you fall in love with Melly Mel?
*  The minute I saw her. I don't know. We, our first two weeks together were a lot of fun. We had a
*  lot of chemistry in person. I was kind of shocked that I wasn't thinking about it because it was
*  like, we spent like a week together and you said, I really want to tell you something. And you were
*  like, you were like stalling that for the longest time. I think she was, oh, she said that like,
*  I love you. No, he basically just said like, I really like you and it never really happens.
*  That's what he said. And I was like, no, and I thought, Hey, I thought.
*  So let's still ran a, we said Trump getting banned from Twitter. Is that what we were talking about
*  before? Oh yeah. Hey, you agreed to me coming on here. Of course I'm going to be doing this.
*  So how long did that take? Two weeks? You said that too, like a week. No, I don't know. I think it was
*  just like, the thing is my mind processes, like information so quickly, two weeks to somebody like
*  you is actually like years for me. So, oh, like me. Yeah. So there was like a lot of like factorial
*  type of strategic thinking. Yeah. Going on. I was seeing like all the events, like Dr. Strange or
*  whatever. And the Avengers, when he's like seeing into all the futures, you just saw the future.
*  Yeah. I was looking at all of them. Yeah. You're doing like some game theoretic simulation of all
*  the possible outcomes. Exactly. Okay. But no, yeah, it was probably pretty soon. I realized that we
*  had a lot of chemistry. I think before I left after my two weeks there, I was like, we need to
*  make sure you got like a ticket to come visit me in the United States because it'll be fun and
*  everything. And then I kind of decided that last minute too. It was like really like five hours
*  before you fly back. We kind of realized because it was kind of like men is just like a one type
*  thing. And then that was it. But we were like, Oh no, this is a lot of fun. We should probably hang
*  out again. Oh, so you realized you would miss each other. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This one time thing.
*  The melancholy side of love. Okay. What did you fall in love with? I thought he like hated me. I
*  don't know. I thought not hated me. She still thinks I hate her. No, I remember like what he said that
*  he really liked me. I was kind of a little shocked about that because I, I don't know, there was a
*  lot of like random things happening in New Zealand. It was a lot of fun, but it was definitely like
*  very interesting, like things that happen. Because I was like around a lot of other people as well.
*  So I thought he might've had like a really bad time. But when he said that I was thinking about
*  it more. And then we spent like more time together, like a week after that. And then it felt like
*  that was more like real. And I think when he was about to leave, I kind of realized like, no,
*  I really like him. Do you guys ever say love to each other? Like I love you. Yeah, of course. Yeah.
*  Okay. All right. I wasn't sure. Why would you ask that? What has he said before? Because I haven't,
*  I haven't sure. I don't think I've heard you speak. The only time I've heard you talk about
*  love is when you're like criticizing the, the red pill community saying they don't ever talk
*  about love in relationships. Almost all the time I'm giving criticism to people. Like I said,
*  I'm kind of stepping in. I'm very disconnected from my own emotional experience because I'm
*  trying to talk with them there. So it's pretty rare that I'll talk about what is your own emotional
*  experience. Exactly. Highly blunted, I guess. There's a lot. Okay. What does that mean?
*  I mean, what's the, what's deep in there? Are you, is this just who you are genetically or are you
*  running from something? I think I have a pretty good understanding of myself. A lot of people
*  make that accusation to me, but I don't think I am. Okay. This is just who you are. It's just who
*  I am. Yeah. Okay. There's not childhood stuff like trauma. It's all sorted and done. You figured it
*  all out? Yeah. In your old age? As I grow every year, I figure out more and more. He did mention,
*  I think I heard this somewhere that this is a source of fights for the two of you, the age thing.
*  I felt the ageism throughout this whole conversation. He's basically, he's saying that
*  he gambles like with time. He's just like, I think she will be good later. And then just like,
*  it's like an investment. Yeah. That's like what he's doing. When this treasury bond matures,
*  I'm going to be able to cash out for a good. What do you think so far? Is the stocks going up or?
*  It's tumultuous. What's that mean? It's like Bitcoin. Yeah, like Bitcoin. Crypto mill.
*  All right. If you guys don't mind, one interesting aspect of your relationship is you're in an open
*  relationship. What's that like from a game theoretic simulation perspective? What went into that
*  calculation and like, how does that? Like how that started or? Yeah. How did that start? Sure.
*  The only relationships I've ever done has been open relationships since I was like in high school
*  because I didn't really understand like why wouldn't you be able to like do other things
*  with other people, but then just like have your main partner basically. So what is an open
*  relationship generally speaking? That means you have one main partner. Not a monogamous relationship.
*  Like you're somehow allowed like in different ways. You can see other people sexually.
*  Sexually, but like there's one main.
*  It doesn't have to be there for some people, but like I think it's probably easier and we
*  probably don't really have time or the energy for like more than like one person to like really.
*  What about like emotional? It's really complicated. There's a lot of complicated
*  stuff going on under the hood there. Yeah. I think broadly speaking, you've got like
*  polyamorous relationships and you've got like open relationships where polyamorous is like,
*  oh, I've got like three different girlfriends and we all hang out or sometimes even live together
*  or three boyfriends or whatever. And then you've got like open relationships, which is like, oh,
*  you know, like you can basically hook up with other people and then you've got like your main
*  relationship and that's it. I think ours is probably somewhere in the middle of that to where
*  like we've got like long-term friends. Some of them we hook up with and that's kind of how we,
*  yeah, it's a delicate dance that explodes every six months on itself. So it does explode. You guys
*  fight over it? We fight over some things. Yeah. I think it's mostly because a lot of people can
*  handle it and they agree to something and then they realize that we're way too cool and then they
*  get really obsessed and they think that they can like get in there and then it gets really dramatic.
*  Have you figured it out? Like, it seems like a complicated dance. I feel like we figure out things more and
*  more like when it comes to like what's a good person for us to hang out and what's not a good
*  person for us to hang out with or like I probably have more opinions on like who he hangs out with
*  because he likes the fucking psychos. Yeah, so you like to surround? He likes the not like the crazy ones
*  like the baby trap sort of women. That's the ones and I don't like that because that affects me.
*  That affects your game theory. Right. You like to surround yourself like in general you've talked
*  about with crazy people. I say crazy and I really shouldn't. It's humorous. It's like yeah, it's very
*  unstable. Very, can be unstable but people that are very unique like when I meet this person
*  not boring. Yeah, not boring. And you said that you're progressively becoming
*  not boring yourself. No, I think I'm pretty stable. I don't let them affect me much but.
*  So you don't think they affect your? No, if I've said that I said a joke. I think I've like I've
*  got my stuff like really well figured out. It's what allows me to engage with people like this so
*  easily because I can engage. I can make them feel seen and heard and then if it gets insane I can
*  cut off and I can be chill. Like very few things affect me in the long term. Do you guys experience
*  jealousy? Usually like whenever I feel like he's not spending the like the amount of time that I'm
*  asking for and he spends it on his video games or his stream or like he sees someone else like more
*  than he sees me or something like that. That would like not be good because then it affects like our
*  relationship. Do you have a good sense of like is it literally time or is it the energy put into the?
*  It's probably like if like if he's with me that like the attention in the time like when he hangs
*  out with me and then there's also probably the time. So if I feel like something else is distracting
*  too much like it could be work or it could be a friend or it could be anything. Like if I feel
*  like it starts to take away from like me then I'm having an issue with it. I don't think he really
*  cares much. I guess the only jealousy you experience is probably when you feel like
*  like if I get upset about him seeing someone too much and then I go see someone more and then he's
*  like why can I go see my friend more like as much as you. So like that's the sort of like thing that
*  we're trying to navigate on I guess. I think we are like diametrically opposed sometimes in terms
*  of how we view like engagement with people or engagement with the world sometimes. So like on
*  her end of the spectrum like a perfect week for her might be like being in a cabin watching like
*  fireflies at night, going hiking every morning, going swimming at the beach because it's like
*  you're taking in like the grandeur of nature. You're like connected with yourself. You're like very
*  at peace. Everything is like chill and cool. There's the wind, the feeling of nature, everything.
*  That's like her peak living experiences. I like being present. Yeah and like my peak experiences
*  are like people trying to destroy my life, like the challenge of like navigating really complicated
*  discussion, like you know several different dramatic events unfolding that might end my
*  career. Like these things are like very I like the stress and the action and the entertainment
*  and everything's like very cool for me. So when we're together she generally wants me to be like
*  more chill but if I don't feel like I'm being like stimulated a lot then it's easy for like my mind
*  to wander. To wander somewhere else. That's kind of the issue. We have a very different way of like
*  engaging with the world. So how can you find happiness and stillness? I feel like if we're
*  just like aware of it and we're trying our best like whenever we like we're supposed to do this
*  one thing. So let's say that we want to go to New York and I'm like we should just like go out and
*  do this one specific thing. We try to find something that he enjoys doing like now that we're in Texas
*  we can go shooting or do something fun that he enjoys then we can do it. And then I think like
*  just like for me also to be aware that like when he spends a lot of time on crazy people it's not
*  because he like loves them or wants to be with them it's just because he likes being like having
*  having his life destroyed like you said which I don't really do it's a completely different
*  thing. So like for me to like understand more like how he's thinking because it's so different
*  from mine and for him to understand how I'm thinking about things and like what I prioritize
*  in my life I think that's like how we navigate. But I think it's good I think the differences can
*  be good like when we're finding a way. Well I think you're relatable.
*  I'm more of a humorous yearning AI.
*  No I'm definitely very difficult to get along with. Like I always tell people that like if
*  you're dating me for like more than a few years like you get like an award for that.
*  It's like a war zone that you've survived. Absolutely. You're like a veteran you get
*  medals and stuff. And it's always like I think there's probably been like six different I don't
*  think she says it anymore but there are like six different times in our relationship where she's
*  like is it always like this? Is this actually right? And like every next year it's like.
*  You were lying about that. You were like no it's just like right now I'm having
*  a huge argument online about saying the n-word in private it's just going to be like this and
*  I'm going to be streaming 24 hours a day. And I'm like when are you going to go to bed? It's been a week.
*  I did playing League come into this. A little bit but I'm clean. I'm clean of League like six months
*  right now. What do you hate about League of Legends? The humans. Well speaking of which I
*  my participation in League involved on the robot side. Good. Because that's an improvement.
*  Because both with Starcraft 2 and League of Legends because OpenAI and DeepMind both
*  participate in creating bots in those. I was a professional Starcraft 2 player so I remember
*  when the AI started to play it's interesting the types of restrictions that you would have to put
*  on like a gaming robot to make it like functional and not totally unfair to the other side. Yeah to
*  make it human like. Yeah was that interesting to you to see AI be able to play those video games?
*  I think in some ways people think things are more complicated than they actually are and I think
*  video games is one of those things where we're like oh my god there's like a million possibilities
*  at every second and who knows and it's like no there's like three or four things going at
*  any point in time and I'm willing to bet that like an AI could probably solve some of these games like
*  pretty easily especially if there are no constraints on how they can learn. Can I talk to you about
*  relationships? Yeah we already have so. Yeah I know but more generally speaking we didn't get a
*  chance to talk about the the Red Pill community. Oh sure. Well first of all what is the Red Pill
*  community the Manosphere in general? I'd love to get both of your opinions on this. Sure. I know
*  I know you're probably not as opinionated on that. I'd say do you think I am that? Like probably not as you
*  like as much as you but I do have opinions. You do? Okay. I usually don't like speak out too much
*  on it because I feel like there's like a language barrier. That's why I don't really do politics
*  because this is my second language. Yeah that's right you have to know the a little bit like you
*  know how to use have to use derogatory terms every other sentence so they understand you right?
*  Exactly. I don't know anything about that. You need like a good like you need to be able to like
*  speak really well for people to take you seriously I think and like that's a thing like if I if I
*  don't have like the words and I don't have the like I can't pronounce things correctly. Yeah.
*  And a yes-all person searching for words looks stupid essentially so that's how people view it.
*  Tell me about it I have a podcast that a bunch of people listen to and I mumble and they yeah
*  wait is here what's your first language? Russian. Oh okay. But I speak both languages horribly. I'm
*  just not I'm not like there is definitely a big disconnect between my brain and my mouth module
*  like I'm not able to generate the thoughts efficiently like the things you're able to do
*  like the like speak like that I'm not it's very very tough plus there's a huge amount of anxiety
*  and social interaction that I have which makes speaking even harder. Gotcha. Yeah yeah yeah it's
*  tough. I understand. Gotcha. Make sense. Yeah the the gotcha is both a symbol of compassion
*  and derision at once. I'm just letting you know I understand what you say I'm just gonna sit there
*  and stare at you and say it. No you can just say like yeah I get it like yeah I get it gotcha.
*  No it's so it's so short it's like say say say it's longer sentence but that means the same thing.
*  I understand you. Yeah that's good that's like not chills you know you get chills so you understand
*  me. Yeah it feels good. Yeah. I hear you. I hear you. And like if you just like hold the other
*  person's hand that's even better. You gotta put in some emotion there okay show that you have some.
*  What do you think about gotcha what do you think about Red Pill? What what uh sorry what what is
*  it first of all for people I don't know. Yeah the Red Pill community obviously it's the Matrix
*  reference. The Red Pill that you take is when you realize what dating standards and norms really
*  are in the world that men are providers and have to become some great thing to hunt and attract
*  you know the woman who are just kind of there floating around looking for people to give them
*  the most resources and it's like coming to a realization of what the world of dating really
*  is broken away from the Hollywood standards and the romantic stuff that they try to sell you and
*  you know stories. So there was kind of maybe you can kind of educate me on this but Red Pill used
*  to be associated with just um maybe anti-establishment views I don't know maybe
*  maybe Republican conservative viewpoints. Yeah they use Red Pill a lot in like different
*  communities like when you say the Red Pill community. Yeah that usually means dating.
*  The dating thing but a lot of people say oh Trump voters they're Red Pilled are you Red Pilled on
*  like politics whatever people say stuff like that yeah. Okay cool and then there's like the
*  Manosphere that's all the similar type of stuff and Andrew Tate is somebody that represents kind of
*  the figurehead of the Manosphere of like the Red Pill stuff yeah I would say so I'm pretty sure.
*  Okay all right cool so what are some ideas that they represent and what do you think about them?
*  I think they do a good job at speaking to disaffected young men who feel like the rest of
*  the world has kind of left them behind or isn't willing to speak to them and they do identify some
*  true and real problems. It feels like on the left we have a really hard time doing like self-improvement
*  or telling people how to better themselves we focus too much on like structural or systemic issues
*  rather than what can an individual do to uplift or empower themselves and it also feels like they
*  do a good job at speaking to some of the positive aspects of masculinity that it's okay to be like
*  strong and brave and a soldier and a warrior and provide for your family and blah blah blah.
*  So I would say like those are like positive messages like self-improvement and everything
*  that come from the Red Pill community. What's the negative? I think the analysis on how men and
*  women interact is a way too transactional all of like the romanticism and love and chemistry is
*  totally sucked out of it. Everything is very like sex-based like how do you basically have sex with
*  the most amount of women possible and that's going to make you happy and then I think people's
*  motivation sometimes are just spoken about in such a shallow derogatory way that I don't think is
*  always reflective of reality like a woman only wants you because you make six figures and you're
*  tall and a guy only wants you because he wants to have sex with you and blah like it feels like
*  there's a lot of that going on a lot. Yeah and that misses some fundamental aspect about relationships
*  about meaningful relationships and so on. I don't think I've never heard Red Pill people ever
*  ever talk about like meaningful relationships it's always just how to get in one or how to
*  have sex really. Mel what bothers you about some of that philosophy? I feel like the people that
*  are like the Red Pill people I feel like their solution is something that doesn't actually work
*  out. Like it works out for some people people that makes a lot of money is like really successful in
*  that sort of way but it's not going to help most men out there so I feel like it's just like a
*  pointless like speech to give to these like really lost guys and they really do believe that they
*  can like they can become successful they can get money and like and when they get all these things
*  they can get girls but most of them is not going to achieve that ever. To get the money part or
*  become successful. Just become a billionaire you know like and you'll get all the girls and which
*  is true but not everyone can do that so I feel like when these guys are speaking to these men
*  and there's like we just care about these men out there you know they need to hear this it doesn't
*  really help a lot of them. And it doesn't inspire them to develop compassion towards the opposite
*  sex which is probably something required to have a meaningful relationship. And also like they they
*  seem to complain a lot about women like only wanting men that have money and that's tall and
*  that's muscular whatever you know all those things. But they they complain about that but that's like
*  also kind of what they're trying to make the men try to do for themselves so they kind of like
*  fall into the same sort of behavior and it seems like they're kind of unaware of that as well.
*  They're just playing a part of the game instead of trying to find a woman that doesn't look for
*  those things and that are looking for not those things. Yeah I actually would love to have like
*  straight up data on people in that world versus not in that world how often they get laid.
*  Yeah. Like literally so I think for sure people in that world have fewer meaningful long-term
*  relationships that are fulfilling that actually help them succeed in life that help them be happy
*  and content and all that kind of stuff. But just even the straight up the the shallow goal of
*  getting laid I wonder because it's very possible that like just the the roughness with which they
*  uh treat intellectually women that might lead to lower success not higher success. It's very
*  adversarial which I think is always disappointing anything that talks about men and women I think
*  it's good to acknowledge differences but when it becomes like adversarial especially when you talk
*  about sex sex is something that men are getting and it's something that women are giving and that
*  type of like trade-off and the way they talk about it is like yeah it sets people against each other
*  in a really toxic way I think. How do you talk to people from that world from the red pill world
*  like would you ever talk to like somebody like Andrew Tate? Oh yeah if I had the chance to I've
*  been on the Fresh and Fit podcast three times and then I've got a friend Sneako who's like very
*  red pill that stuff. If I'm trying to talk to them usually the it's kind of like approaching it like
*  a scared cat the first thing you have to do is like be very gentle and say like I understand
*  your issues I understand your complaints I know that you're I'm scary because you think I'm going
*  to say like toxic masculinity and feminism and all these scary words at you. So the first thing is
*  always to recognize it like a lot of what they talk about there are like true aspects to what
*  they're talking about that people on the left won't recognize so I think it's good to acknowledge
*  those things that like men and women are kind of different we do look for different things in
*  general when it comes to relationships it's okay to say that it's not there's nothing bad there
*  and then it'll usually be like once I've got your trust and I'm in your bubble like let's talk about
*  the things that you want and maybe some of the strategies that you're employing aren't necessarily
*  going to get you some of the things that you want so for instance if you're really worried about like
*  shallow girls like ruining your life like Melina said it's probably not best to build your entire
*  worldview around trying to get shallow girls that are going to ruin your life like if your way of
*  attracting a girl is to go to the gym get a whole bunch of money and try to like flaunt your wealth
*  as much as possible you're going to be attracting the very same type of women that you're here like
*  decrying on your stream. I think we talked about that on the podcast like you probably want to
*  have a woman that's going to be there if you lose your job it's still there like that cares about
*  the things that's not just your job yeah it's more stable and also I don't help you become
*  a great man or great like grow like I feel like a great friendship and a partnership
*  like it helps you make you a better person some of the most successful people I know I mean they
*  have families and there's clearly a dynamic there that's like that makes them they wouldn't be that
*  without they're not an island young yeah and the kids actually a big part of that too like for
*  most people if you're like a good parent they make you step up somehow in life you have to take
*  responsibility for getting your shit together and excelling in ways that I guess the philosophy of
*  the red pole does not quite get to that's always an interesting I think I've asked that a couple
*  times where it's like would you let your daughter date Andrew Tate and it's always funny to watch
*  them kind of like squirm around those answers sometimes but see if they if they don't have a
*  daughter like I you know I don't have a daughter I think your whole philosophy changes once you have
*  a daughter sure like you can feel that like they can they know that what they're answering they
*  feel a little bit weird about it it's funny to watch them like they even they know it's like
*  yeah well they they might say like I want my daughter to date like a high value male
*  to the degree that he's a high value male yes but like I don't think you'll feel that way
*  the definition of high value changes completely certainly the stereotypical measures of value
*  contribute to the calculation but it's so much more than that I think the chemistry of the whole
*  thing is bigger you've also mentioned about body count you guys both have a high body count
*  does body count matter or depends like like you said it's low in some people's eyes it's high in
*  other people's eyes does body count matter in relationships does the past matter well the past
*  matters I don't think body count not to me I don't really care not just as it is no yeah I mean I
*  can't be yeah well the past is who you are right like somebody tells me like they have a 200 body
*  count and they're 16 something's probably going on there that's not good I was thinking about that
*  too like because it could be like really young people that are having some sort of like mental
*  yeah there could be going on or somebody's like 45 and they've like never had sex before there's
*  probably something going on right so it could be indicative but if somebody's like in their 20s
*  and they've had sex with you know 100 people or 50 people whatever it's you know whatever
*  it's more experience which can be good sure okay so that just represents your like sexually open
*  and so it doesn't really necessarily mean any kind of not necessarily it could though the number
*  alone doesn't mean anything yeah okay well you could meet a guy that's like I just really really
*  like when I fuck a lot of people because it makes me so cool like you're gonna be someone like that
*  we're just like so the body count doesn't matter but like where it comes from yeah like why why
*  have you slept with the people you slept with yes does it hurt like the romantic aspect of
*  relationship knowing that there's a lot of people in the past I don't know for us no is it part of
*  relationship fundamentally romantic for us yeah okay what you come off as such a cold person
*  no I was just in my head thinking I wanted to just say gotcha right there
*  it's so judgmental I think when it comes to the sex thing there's always like the way that I
*  explained it is and I understand like um I have to say this because I don't advocate for what I do
*  for everybody or what she does for everybody because obviously there's a whole bunch of
*  natural feelings of jealousy that pop up for a lot of people um but when people ask me you know it's
*  always like oh like isn't this like horrible that you guys are doing this and you don't love
*  each other um from my perspective I can have sex with like any person and it can be sex like
*  that's not like a special thing between two people in my eyes it's like anybody can have sex but
*  there are like certain activities and ways you can spend time with each other where you're like
*  carving out these like precious little moments in time with a certain person that can do things
*  that are special to that person and those are the kind of like events that I remember more
*  than anything else so like the idea of like like oh wow I had sex with a person that was so special
*  doesn't mean as much as like you know us traveling to like New Zealand or sharing some special moment
*  doing like some really fun activity or event or whatever that's usually how I like it I am
*  so a shared intimate moment yeah I kind of agree but I can definitely connect the romance with sex
*  boring I'm curious why you can't see that's where the red pill's right that's exactly we've also
*  talked about misogyny which is you're clearly the embodiment of that what were you saying
*  so there's some there's a connection between romance and yeah I think it is because I think
*  sex could be a lot of things right it's it's some sort of bonding I'd say in some way they say that
*  you really like BDSM you kind of like you become submissive to someone or you take control over
*  someone it's like in a very bonding like intimate moment I'd say and that's romantic the intimacy is
*  romantic I think it is if you can show yourself as really submissive or like weak or you have like
*  absolutely no control over yourself and you let someone else do it or you are the one being that
*  like you are the dominant for someone I think that's a really like intimate thing because
*  you show like the weakest part of yourself kind of I just feel like I personally
*  to me some component romantic but to me this is not judging to others to me
*  maybe this call was brought up the romance increases if the number of intimate
*  interactions are limited to one person like for me for some reason spreading it out
*  decreases like exponentially the the feeling of romance you feel but I don't know what that
*  that could be just like sort of having grown up in the Soviet Union there's a kind of there's
*  the fairy tale stories and you're kind of maybe living through them yeah I mean I think what you're
*  saying is like really normal like most people probably feel that way yeah but but because you
*  guys are able to successfully not do that I just want to question my own understanding of it you
*  know like like why is that why is that like am I being very jealous for no reason like maybe
*  you can maximize the number of intimate experiences if you just open up and let go of the jealousy
*  essentially I think I feel like in Sweden like in Scandinavia we're extremely just sexually open
*  like in general we're not like super religious either we're very like relaxed we don't like we
*  don't feel bad about ourselves like it's just like a different sort of thing and I would say like
*  it's we're more progressive when it comes to feminism and stuff so it's more common they will
*  meet women with a higher body count than like when I meet like American girls all of them I have like
*  vaginism like super suppressed like sexually and they have like what did you just use they have like
*  issues to like they can't relax during sex or just hurts for them vaginism is not what it's
*  called yeah so like I meet so many girls that are having like a lot of issues with sex and they have
*  like a very low body count because they just can't relax or they yeah and it's probably usually they
*  come from like a very religious background so they have just been told like you cannot worry that you
*  cannot be like that you can't like you know and like where I grew up it was not like that at all
*  but you see it as more like a casual thing so then you can just maximize the awesomeness of the
*  experience yeah I guess I don't have trouble exactly I think the important thing I think for
*  everybody to realize is there's always pros and cons to everything like my lifestyle like obviously
*  I get to have a lot of fun experiences that's like a huge pro and that's super cool and if you're
*  like a more monogamy brain person you're not going to get those experiences but if you're a monogamy
*  brain person like when you're sharing that special moment in time with somebody else like that moment
*  can be really really really special because now it's the thing that you're showing yourself and
*  open yourself up to another person and they're only trusting you to do that and that's like a
*  really special thing that only the two of you are sharing with each other so I mean like there's
*  always like pros and cons to everything like I think we both would say like like doing an open
*  relationship is probably not like we would not recommend it yeah I recently fasted for three
*  days and I ate a chicken breast at the end of that and it was like the most delicious
*  food I've ever eaten so like there's some aspect of fasting and scarcity and so on that like and
*  you have to figure out what for your own psyche what works the best it's good to be a little
*  bored or like not do something or like work because you can just enjoy the time when you're
*  doing something really fun it's more fun otherwise you're just gonna get numb in general with
*  everything yeah yeah I personally just never get bored like I guess the boring thing is exciting
*  to me the just like you're like me because everything I like is boring I gotta ask you we
*  talked about massaging in the he's trying to battle it out on the internet what's your what's your
*  sense as a woman about the level of massaging and the internet and the streaming community and how
*  to fight it for me because I guess I guess I get it every single day somehow like because I haven't
*  online like I have a chat that goes that's live right and um but I have like mods moderating that
*  all the time so I don't really need to see much of it I think it's just pretty annoying because
*  you get to like see it all the time um and it's become like background noise yeah a little bit
*  it's like the same comments over and over again but it's usually for me I don't personally care
*  that much I understand that other people do especially when it comes into like when there's
*  like a lot of sexism and stuff and um when there's a lot of like men not taking women seriously like
*  I definitely get that and I used to get that even more like a few years ago uh with my accent and
*  everything and like I used to be blonde as well like a few months ago because I feel like people
*  wouldn't take me seriously because of that uh that's a bit annoying but I feel like it's pretty easy
*  to like see through when someone acts that way and for me personally I don't really care but um
*  it's a bit annoying like being online and like getting stuff every single day uh I would say
*  like the probably the worst thing is when you feel like you put in a lot of effort into some sort of
*  work everyone is just going to say you just got that because you're a woman and you're attractive
*  and that's that's probably like the worst thing is there a way to fight that you think yeah I don't
*  think you can I think it just comes up all the time it's just like it is what it is I guess you
*  just gotta keep doing whatever you do and like not let it like emotionally control you somehow
*  I think having more women in those spaces is always good it's probably good yeah like a lot
*  of the guys you can tell online that they don't ever bring on the worst ones then see she's being
*  with see you see she just did it she did the misogyny thing by having some bad women on she's
*  saying all women see well you you know it's true right see but I disagree with you and I'm older
*  than both of you and therefore wiser right so well combined we're older than you I think
*  wonderful where one only matronomy yeah we've got combined age where it could be it could be
*  the same thing it was like also the age thing and like the woman thing a lot of people think that
*  I'm just copying every single thing that he says which I think is a bit annoying as well so I can
*  never really like a sonic user of that one yeah which is a bit annoying you know it was about the
*  defending police like my dad is a cop friendship camaraderie and love and respect which you
*  uh both have had for a time and have lost it and I would like you to regain it
*  let's try to increase not decrease the amount of love in the space what do you think about
*  some of the harshness of this of his language which we talked about uh our word in the past
*  when he used n-word all of that kind of stuff what are you used to do I mean no like what do
*  you think about it like do you give him advice to not speak a certain way no like a little more
*  civility I'm just trying to get a second opinion on this second opinion about army people not
*  people are way more extreme than yeah yeah no that's not true okay so okay so here's
*  something for me okay I was not online until three years ago at all like I would watch youtube that's
*  pretty much all I would do I wouldn't do anything else really I didn't grew up playing video games
*  or anything so I'm like extremely new to everything um so when I came into this world and I started
*  seeing clips from him in the past I don't think I really had much of an opinion because it just
*  sounded like it was just a different like words that we're using but it didn't mean anything that's
*  what it feels it was just like if you're saying the r-word it's because you just want to call
*  someone stupid but you want to like do it a little bit more like but it's not like it didn't feel
*  like it was like a it's not like racist more like you know it's not agreement on this side
*  so like if he was saying the f-word because it was just like a word to like insult someone and he was
*  like I don't think he was ever I don't think you were ever homophobic back in the day or anything
*  like that but I think it was just like a way to express yourself maybe back then I don't know I
*  didn't do it there's no videos of me or anything because I wasn't even online back then but yeah
*  so my case was I definitely don't think Steven is homophobic or racist or any of those obviously so
*  the there's a good heart there and a good mind I was just saying he just likes being mean I think
*  well there's some you lose yourself and forget the bigger picture that he's pushing for more
*  effective discourse on the internet he's like an inspiration to a lot of people especially now
*  of like how you can use effective conversation to make for a better world to do
*  radicalize people and so on and then you lose some of that power by losing yourself in
*  in like the language just more language of emotion versus effective communication I would say but
*  it's a gray area I would say like something that is probably recently done in that case
*  because it's been joking about women a lot like it's women's fault they're bad like it's just
*  it's been like a lot of jokes when it comes to misogyny I guess in your community and I think
*  it's actually turned people a little bit that way that's why we've done the recent yes so that I
*  guess that's actually true because I don't think it was pretty I don't think it was clear enough I
*  don't think it actually was I think you did that mistake but I think back then I was even saying
*  like hey you should probably not like you probably you probably should not do that because it actually
*  is pretty hard for me because whenever I come into his community like his chat people are just going
*  to spam it's like a woman moment it's a woman moment whenever I say something and it's kind of
*  like yeah it's getting pretty annoying as I said it's just annoying when you see it every single day
*  yeah there you go uh wisdom from somebody younger than you wisdom can come from all kinds of people
*  yeah of course just sometimes it's very limited quantities depends on the age and learn something
*  from anybody what advice would you give to uh young people the both of you that you have both
*  audiences or young people look up to you in general if you were to give advice to somebody
*  in high school like how to create a life that can be proud of what would you say
*  the most important thing that I've learned is to view people as different and not better or worse
*  and when you view people as different instead of better or worse you learn that there's almost
*  something that you can learn from anybody uh like being open and empathetic towards other people's
*  experiences nobody does anything by random choice like there's always reasons why people act the way
*  they do and as long as you're willing to kind of like be open and receptive to the lived experiences
*  of other people you're going to be able to gather information and create like a more cohesive and
*  better view of the world than any of your peers will do you have any kind of advice you can give
*  to young folks I feel like something that I see especially in America a lot is that a lot of people
*  kind of get told what to do early on like in high school they're supposed to become this thing
*  like education wise like they're supposed to like become a doctor or this thing or whatever and then
*  they kind of just like give up on things that they're actually passionate about so I think a
*  lot of teenagers get really confused they get an education and then they get that job and they hate
*  everything and they think that when they're when they're reaching the job when they're reaching
*  like the journey they're going to get happy that's like where the happiness is going to be but then
*  when they get to there they just hate everything and then they become really depressed and I've
*  seen this so much like I've seen this all the time and it's it's pretty sad to me to see so many
*  people that are just wasting time and then they just get really confused and I don't know it's
*  the same thing with relationships too no one really knows what they want anymore I feel like
*  everyone is just kind of doing whatever like society is saying or their parents are saying
*  or their friends are saying um they're never really doing anything that's super meaningful
*  anymore and like they don't so what I would say is like try to find something that that's
*  that is important to you it could be anything really like some sort of passion maybe like your
*  friends maybe like like what matters to you like figuring those things out I think is really
*  important and that comes from being able to listen to like some inner voice so it's not
*  yeah I guess it's really hard because you're living the life and like there's things happening
*  around you people tell you what to do and what not to do and you know no one really has like
*  their own opinions everyone is just kind of like listening to the the cooler thing or you know
*  except Steven he seems to stand on his own trail yeah I guess yeah I'd say so and like hashtag
*  like something I realized too like because we just went to twitchcon and we were talking to a lot of
*  streamers uh it was interesting I thought it was interesting because the the few people that I feel
*  like I that seemed really cool and that I look up to like in the streaming world all of them wants
*  to quit streaming all them wants to do it no one wants like no one likes it and they're so successful
*  like they are around successful people they they're working every single day they're working hard
*  they're making so much money and everyone is just complaining and like they're complaining about
*  like not being able to see their partner or you know because they need to live somewhere else
*  because I see these things and they seem extremely unhappy and but it's so hard for them to just
*  cut all this successful stuff off because that's like what you you know learn to do and that's
*  like supposed to be like your happiness but it isn't everyone is really unhappy yeah there's
*  something about maybe streaming is different but YouTube folks too have interacted with a few and
*  even in podcasting space people become obsessed about the views and numbers and subscribers and
*  stuff like that so I turn I never talk about that I don't pay attention to that I feel like
*  that's a drug that destroys your mind your your mind is an artist ability to create truly unique
*  things also your mind in terms of the anxiety the ups and downs of the attention mechanism
*  and then also being just if it's something that you make is not popular but it meant a lot to you
*  you will think of it less yes because it's not popular yeah that's a really dangerous thing and
*  because everyone around you is reinforcing like I'll get messages like wow this thing got this
*  many views or something great job it's like no you don't get it like that's not that's not
*  everyone is enforcing this like this language of views and likes and so on and it's it's correlated
*  of course because truly impactful things will get a lot of attention often but it's not on the
*  individual local scale like temporarily is it's it can really fuck with your mind and I see that
*  in the creators they become addicts to the algorithm lost in chasing views like we know
*  friends that we know cool people and they start streaming and eventually they go they're like
*  chasing the dragon of like and they change like they're yeah it's like they are completely and
*  there's like this is something I've always said that like one of the biggest blessings and biggest
*  curses of humanity is we are very good at acclimating like you can become paralyzed you
*  can have all sorts of horrible things happen to you and you'll get used to it and you'll be okay
*  you're gonna have like a good baseline but it works the other way too and that you can get more
*  and more and more and more and you acclimate to it almost immediately there's like this is a phenomenon
*  that I bet it happens in the youtube world but I know what happens in the streaming world where
*  you're streaming 1 000 viewers every day huge event happens and you blow up and you got like
*  15 000 viewers for a day or two and then it starts to go down and down and down and down and down and
*  then after all the drama stayed off you're at like 3 000 concurrent viewers now in the macro you went
*  from 1 000 to 3 000 that feels awesome but you actually feel like shit the whole time because
*  you're remembering when you had 10 or 15 000 and now everything feels horrible and you'll see people
*  climb over time like fuck like but whatever that one huge stream I had like I've never like been
*  able to and it's like dude you're doing great what's yeah that happens a lot there's so many
*  people that we know that we find super super cool they're passionate about things they have so much
*  interest and then they just get like so addicted to these numbers and like all the everything is
*  just ruined like all the cool things about them is ruined because they stop doing the things that
*  they actually like to do something else that gives them more viewers and more money and it's really
*  sad to see yeah that that temporary sacrifice that seems temporary is that it it actually
*  destroys you like for one time making a choice because I come across those choices often like
*  I can do this you can kind of know what's going to be popular and not and you have to ask yourself
*  the question like is this going to sacrifice because if people are sacrificing like intimate
*  relationships they're sacrificing time with their family they're like sacrificing time with things
*  that they feel good about and that they like and that's something I kind of realized last year
*  because I was working so much and I was just grinding grinding grinding busy because it was
*  kind of new for me and then new years came by and I was like wait what did I even do like the entire
*  year like I traveled to a bunch of places but nothing actually really meant anything to me
*  because I felt like I was just working the entire time I felt like I was just numb through the
*  through the entire year and I was really scary um like I rented a like a super pretty house like
*  for a week with my dad and my sister because I wanted to spend time with them but the entire
*  time I was just streaming and I actually didn't ever like calm down and just like chill with them
*  and I like that's like time I'll never get back I don't I don't give a shit about the money that
*  I made that week but I lost the time and like that is really important to me and I yeah and
*  a lot of people are doing that um and I feel like you as you said like you can definitely see that
*  in like artists for sure I feel like if you look at like artists like back in the 60s or 70s I feel
*  like things were just so much better back then and it feels like they were actually making music
*  that meant something to them they were actually making art and I feel like today everything is
*  just kind of like whatever is cool whatever sells whatever you know sounds in a certain way
*  everything is kind of the same thing and everything that is very artistic and very cool
*  is actually not that popular at all and uh that's kind of sad I think yeah of course there's now
*  bigger mechanisms and platforms to spread stuff music so as long as you can be content with not
*  being popular I think you can still create art yeah but not like when people get a little popular
*  they get addicted that so fast yeah it's weird yeah you have been somewhat good at least from my
*  outside of perspective because I think you I can at least imagine you making choices that could
*  make you more popular and you don't seem to make those choices like having your career like playing
*  but it is very intentional like you said like and I made that choice at every single stage of my life
*  one is because from the perspective of being a carpet cleaner my life is way better than that
*  was or ever would have been so I'm already doing way better than I ever thought somebody like me
*  ever could be but then two I super love my job every time I wake up every time I fly to a place
*  to a podcast every time I get to talk to really cool people like every single part of my job
*  I super like if there's something I don't like I just cut it off because I don't care because I'm
*  already making plenty of money doing what I do and why would I ever wake up and not like what I'm
*  doing when I can like what I'm doing how do you guys find through that given that you love it
*  and sometimes maybe lose yourself in the drug of it how do you find like work life balance together
*  inside a relationship like time for each other I don't at all so I'm not a good person to ask
*  what do you love more uh Mel or fact or fact or is a really good game that's like not a fair
*  comparison okay you're talking about one of the best cleanest games best support ever made cleanest
*  code base yeah this is yeah it's more factorial time for me starting to understand where the
*  massaging comes from by the way is is the uh is factor legit a really good game yeah of course
*  okay if you're like uh do you enjoy programming of course that's all I do that's all that's okay
*  if you've got like uh programming is is the game in itself that I enjoy probably more than anything
*  else but yeah it's very much a game like that like if you're into stuff like that like you can lose
*  hundreds of hours like very quickly too like you have a problem and then you think of a solution
*  and then you iterate on that over and over and over again in larger larger schemes sometimes
*  you got to redesign stuff sometimes you get like it's a very much like that kind of game so you're
*  essentially building a factory like what on a foreign planet or something like that it's
*  basically it's like a bunch of you're trying to automate different problems so that you can
*  build bigger things so that you can automate bigger problems so you can build bigger things
*  and automate bigger problems so it's more complicated than like a city building game
*  like some city type of thing I wouldn't say it's more complicated it's more like it's like
*  factories like a game of like logic like strictly like logic like it's almost like a building a
*  circuit or something yes yeah there's like their circuitry and you've got your an or exorga to you
*  like there's stuff like that it's very much like that like what are the enemies in the game like
*  they're like so they try to bite you and you can get guns and shoot and kill them but it's like
*  I saw there's like shooting going on yeah but that's like a minor just like another problem
*  to solve in the game basically yeah okay all right see see what we do there we just started
*  talking about the game as we're trying oh my god that's like a game okay that's horrible anyway
*  is there is that basically the struggle not a lot of struggle how to get human like intimate human
*  time I feel like it was like that a little bit more in the past I feel like it's been better
*  lately but I think it's because when we started dating I wasn't streaming and I kind of just like
*  gave up like my trip in New Zealand I give up like like I left Sweden so I was just like in LA which
*  I hate I hate LA I don't like LA at all it's hard to make friends that are like real that are into
*  the same stuff as you it's it was just really hard for me to connect with anyone especially also like
*  being a European and like being around Americans was very strange so the only thing I had when I
*  came here was him and I um and I didn't expect because because yeah because we had we had like
*  two weeks of hanging out and like he would be in his computer sometimes and like do emails and
*  stuff but I wasn't thinking that he would stream like 12 hours a day and it was pretty like it was
*  pretty intense like in the beginning of it as well and I realized it was really hard to like get
*  attention or get time because his like love meter would be like full if I was just in the house and
*  that's just kind of like the way he is and for me back then when I didn't have anything else to do
*  um was kind of like a it was kind of crazy uh for me I feel like right now because I do work as well
*  and I have things going from for me and I have other friends uh now that I made I feel like it's
*  a lot easier because and and I can definitely like enjoy just like being in separate rooms and just
*  like hear him in the background is really nice I can like I can sit and paint and like in my room
*  and I will do that for hours while I'm just like hearing a scream in the background it's kind of
*  like comforting that he's he's just there it feels nice I like it because to you that's the sound of
*  happiness yes because I know he's right there yeah it's nice and they'll come in and check on me
*  sometimes and it's it's kind of like it's actually very comforting it's very nice I like it yeah I
*  think that's kind of what a relationship is like you do fun things together you know you share
*  moments together but also just like having someone like around you is really really nice
*  uh and I think that's probably maybe it's me growing up maybe that's what it is and like I
*  start liking like the kind of I feel like we're like an old couple like we're like 80 we're just
*  like around we don't really have to talk much it's it's nice to just do that that fills your love
*  meter um I like this terminology love I need both I mean okay you're making it sound like that I'm
*  like craving like I haven't said anything I'm not saying anything I haven't said a single thing at
*  all I know exactly what you're thinking so much judging going on there's no judgment no but like
*  we I think I think whenever we do plan something out like if we if we go on a trip like every other
*  month or once a month uh I feel like usually like that's enough as long as he's not playing
*  Victoria the entire time like if he if I feel like he's going on these trips with me and he's not
*  like doing things with me or he's done he's not interested in like spending time or like being
*  present with me then I'll feel like I just feel like I'm just wasting time right now and then I
*  get kind of disappointed but otherwise I think this like this is fun I think this is like spending
*  time together because we're like doing something together yeah it's fun yeah my my love meter is
*  it's my social life otherwise we like to we like to think about it that way that like I need like
*  a little bit more of like this one thing like quality time and he needs like almost zero quality
*  time but like let's say that I we took away like physical touch you would probably not be very
*  happy um so you need physical touch so it's not just back to me huh no I'm a very cuddly person
*  yeah like cuddly and then you're like I guess like acts of service like if I do something for you
*  you get really happy like hot chocolate yeah like if I give him hot chocolate in the morning he gets
*  really happy so the actual it's not the hot chocolate it's the giving of the hot chocolate
*  no it's just the hot chocolate but if she gives it to me it's I didn't have to get it myself so
*  physical touch that's really nice all right well if you have to choose between factorial and the
*  drama or political discourse which probably political discourse probably my calling but
*  I am a good factorial player like what role exactly does factorial play in your streaming life
*  oh well right now it's just usually there are like these games that I play in the background as I
*  have conversations because it's hard for me to just sit on the computer just talk and not like
*  be playing a game at the same time so just something to keep me kind of like occupied
*  you know I was able to buy like those little like widget things I guess yeah that's what
*  yeah basically yeah it's like Minecraft or factorial for me all right well my love meter
*  is full from this well thank you so much for joining us this is really fun I'm you guys are
*  fascinating human beings thank you for existing I'm glad to live in a world where you exist
*  I can't wait to see what kind of beautiful thing you create next and the crazy kind of art that
*  you create through the different people you interact with Destiny Steven you're an amazing
*  human thank you so much for talking to me it's an honor hope to talk with you again talking to Ben
