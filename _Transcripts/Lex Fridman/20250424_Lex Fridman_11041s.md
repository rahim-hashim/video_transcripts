# Jeffrey Wasserstrom: China, Xi Jinping, Trade War, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mao | Lex Fridman Podcast #466
**Lex Fridman:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q)
*  The following is a conversation with Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a historian of modern China. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Lex Freedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6.4s)]
*  And now, dear friends, here's Jeffrey Wasserstrom. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=11.84s)]
*  You've compared Xi Jinping and Mao Zedong in the past. What are the parallels between the two [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=16.88s)]
*  leaders and where do they differ? Xi Jinping, of course, is the current leader of China for the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=22.32s)]
*  past 12 years, and Mao Zedong was the communist leader of China from 1949 to 1976. So what are [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=27.68s)]
*  the commonalities? What are the differences? So the biggest commonality of them is that they're [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=35.28s)]
*  both the subject of personality cults and that Mao was the center of a very intensely felt one [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=40.96s)]
*  from 1949 to 1976. And when he died, there was tremendous outpouring of grief, even among people [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=48.4s)]
*  who had objectively suffered enormously because of his policies. Xi Jinping is the first leader [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=55.12s)]
*  in China since him who has had a sustained personality cult of the kind where if you walk [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  into a bookstore in China, the first thing you see are books by him, collections of speeches. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=69.28s)]
*  And when Mao was alive, you might have thought that's sort of what happened with communist party [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=75.28s)]
*  leaders in China. But after Mao's death, there was such an effort to not have that kind of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  personality cult that there was a tendency to not publish the speeches of a leader until they were [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=84.4s)]
*  done being in power. I was first in China in 1986, and you could go for days without being [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=91.04s)]
*  intensely aware of who was in charge of the party. You would know, but his face wasn't everywhere. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  The newspaper wasn't dominated with stories about him and quotations from his words and things like [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=105.2s)]
*  that. So with Xi Jinping, you've had a throwback to that period in communist party rule, which [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=111.76s)]
*  seemed as though it might be a part of the past. So that's a key commonality. And a key difference [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  is that Mao really reveled in chaos in turning things upside down in a sense that, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  he talked about class struggle, which came out of Marxism, but he also really his favorite [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=132.8s)]
*  work of Chinese popular fiction was the Monkey King about this legendary figure, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=138.55999999999997s)]
*  this Monkey King who could turn the heavens upside down. So he reveled in disorder and thought [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=144.72s)]
*  disorder was a way to improve things. Xi Jinping is very orderly, is very concerned with stability [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  and predictability. So you can see them as very, very different that way. And Mao also liked to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  stir things up like that, people on the streets clamoring. So Xi Jinping, even though he has a [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=163.36s)]
*  personality cult, it's not manifesting itself. He doesn't like the idea of people on the streets [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=168.56s)]
*  in anything that can't be controlled. So there are a lot of ways that they're similar, a lot of ways [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  they're different. They're also different and this fits with this orderliness that Xi Jinping [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  talks positively about Confucius and Confucian traditions in China. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=187.28s)]
*  And Confucian traditions are based on kind of stable hierarchies for the most part and sort of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=193.28s)]
*  clear categories of superior and inferior. Whereas Mao liked things to be turned upside down. He [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=199.76s)]
*  thought of Confucianism as a feudal way of thought that had held China back. So you can come up with [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=205.76s)]
*  things that they're similar and you can come up with things where they're really opposites, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  but they both clearly did want to see China under rule by the Communist Party. And that's been a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=215.28s)]
*  continuity and that connects them to the leaders in between them too as well. So there's some degree, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=221.84s)]
*  as you said, that Xi Jinping espouses the ideas of communism and the ideas of Confucianism. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=226.64s)]
*  So let's go all the way back. You wrote that in order to understand the China of today, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=234.08s)]
*  we have to study its past. So the China of today celebrates ideas of Confucius, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=238.16s)]
*  a Chinese philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago. Can you tell me about the ideas of Confucius? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=244.96s)]
*  05.01.01 [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=250.88s)]
*  First of all, we don't know that much about the historic Confucius. He's around the same time [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=251.44s)]
*  as figures like Socrates. And like with Socrates, we get a lot of what we know about him or think [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=257.6s)]
*  we know about him from what his followers said and things that were attributed to him and dialogues [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=264.8s)]
*  that were written afterwards. So you can have a lot of fun with these sort of axial age thinkers [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=271.36s)]
*  and what they had in common. Another thing that connects these axial age thinkers is they were [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  trying to kind of make a case for why they should be able to educate the next generation of the elite [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=284.0s)]
*  and sort of had a way of promising that they had philosophical ideas that helped decide how you [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=290.96s)]
*  should run a polity. Confucius lived in a time when there were these warring kingdoms in a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  territory that later became China. But what he said was that there had been this period of great [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=304.08s)]
*  order in the past, that the lines between inferior and superior were clear and there was a kind of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  synergy between superior and inferior that kept everything ticking along really nicely. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=316.56s)]
*  He thought that hierarchical relationships were a good thing and that the trick was that both sides [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=321.92s)]
*  in a hierarchical relationship owed something to the other. So the father and son relationship [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=328.32s)]
*  was a key one. The father deserved respect from the son but owed the son care and benevolence. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=335.92s)]
*  Things would be fine as long as both sides in a relationship held up their end. He had a whole [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=344.48s)]
*  series of these relationships. The husband to the wife was again an unequal one of the husband [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=350.24s)]
*  being superior to the wife but him owing the wife care and her owing him deference. He had the same [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=357.44s)]
*  notion that then the emperor to the ministers, these were all parallels and there were no [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  egalitarian relationships in Confucianism. Even something that in the West we often think of as [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  a quintessentially egalitarian relationship between brothers. In the Chinese tradition of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=378.56s)]
*  Confucianism, there was only older brother and younger brother. Brotherhood was not [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  an egalitarian relationship. It was one where the older brother took care of the younger brother and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=392.64s)]
*  the younger brother showed respect for the older brother. So stable hierarchy was at the core of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=397.76s)]
*  everything in society. It permeated everything including politics. Yeah and there was even a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=402.96s)]
*  sense that it connected the natural world to the supernatural world. So the emperor was to heaven, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=408.32s)]
*  this kind of non-personified deity like the emperor was to the minister. So all of this [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=416.08s)]
*  had these relationships. So the emperor was the son of heaven. And for Confucius, he said, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=424.0s)]
*  so we should study the texts, we should study how the sages of old behaved, that society was becoming [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=431.2s)]
*  corrupted and was going away from that sort of purity of the sages when the relationships were [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=440.0s)]
*  all in order. So Confucianism was a kind of conservative or even backward looking thing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=446.48s)]
*  It wasn't arguing for progress, it was arguing for reclaiming a pure golden age in the past. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=454.8s)]
*  So it was also a kind of conservative. So in all kinds of ways, it's irreconcilable to many [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  things about Marxism and communism, which is all about struggle and all about actually [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  a progressive view of history moving from one stage to the next. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=472.0s)]
*  So that's the interesting thing about Xi Jinping and the China of today is there is that tension [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=474.96s)]
*  of Confucianism and communism where communism, Marxism is supposed to let go of history [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=479.52s)]
*  and Confucianism. There's a real veneration of history that's happening in China of today. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  So they're able to wear both hats and balance it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You could say that in many points in the 20th century, there was a kind of [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  struggle between different competing political groups over which part of the Chinese past [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=502.48s)]
*  to connect with. Was it to the Confucian tradition or to the rebellious Monkey King tradition, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=508.88s)]
*  which was what Mao connected to. Xi Jinping, and before him, to some extent, Hu Jintao, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=515.04s)]
*  we saw this a little bit at the Olympics, there was more of this kind of mix it all together view. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=522.08s)]
*  Anything that suggested greatness in the past could be something that could be fused together. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  So Xi Jinping says that Mao is one of his heroes or one of the people he looks to as a model, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=534.0s)]
*  but so is Confucius. They had so little in common, but they both in his mind and the minds of others [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  suggest a kind of power and greatness of the Chinese past. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=550.64s)]
*  Yeah. So this platonic notion of greatness and that you could say connects, there's a thread [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=555.04s)]
*  that connects for Xi Jinping, the great history, multi-thousand year history of China. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=561.84s)]
*  Yeah. And it involves smoothing out all kinds of internal contradictions. You had [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  the first emperor of China jumping forward a bit in 221 BC. He is anti-scholars. He burns books [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=575.84s)]
*  and he doesn't venerate these kind of rituals and things. So he was very much against the things [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=584.32s)]
*  that Confucius stood for. Mao, in a sense of having to choose between Confucius and the first [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=592.4000000000001s)]
*  emperor, he said, well, maybe the first emperor had the right idea. Scholars can be a pain. So [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=598.72s)]
*  he said if you have to choose between Confucianism and that. But Xi Jinping, I think, continually [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=606.32s)]
*  is kind of not choosing. And if he wants to say, well, look at the Great Wall, look at this [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=612.48s)]
*  wonderful, in fact, that was a symbol of kind of strength and domination related to the first [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=616.88s)]
*  emperor, who by the way, didn't build anything like the Great Wall you see today. He built walls and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  they were fine. They were good, but the Great Wall itself didn't come into being until many [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=628.4s)]
*  centuries later. But still this idea of anything that suggests a kind of greatness is something [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=634.0s)]
*  that has in many ways a nationalist above all else. Xi Jinping is a supporter of the party and [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=640.24s)]
*  single party rule. That's something he clearly believes in. And he's a nationalist. He wants [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=647.84s)]
*  to see China be great and acknowledge this great on the world stage. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=655.04s)]
*  Boy, so many contradictions always with Stalin. He was a communist, but also a nationalist. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=660.24s)]
*  Right. That contradiction is, is, is also permeates through through Mao and all the way to Xi Jinping. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=666.88s)]
*  But if we can linger on Confucius for a little bit, you write that one of the most famous statements [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=674.16s)]
*  of Confucianism is the belief that, quote, people are pretty much alike at birth, but become [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=679.28s)]
*  differentiated via learning. So this sets the tradition that China places a high value on [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=684.72s)]
*  education and on meritocracy. Can you speak to this Confucius' idea of education and how much does [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=690.0s)]
*  it permeate to the China of today? Sure. So there's an optimism to this. There's an optimism in the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  sense of a ability that people can be good. And when exposed to exemplary figures from the past, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=708.32s)]
*  they'll want to be like those exemplary figures. So it's a form of education through kind of [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=717.5200000000001s)]
*  emulation of models and study of past figures and past texts that were exemplary. And it, and it was, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=723.0400000000001s)]
*  it did have this, this idea, a relatively positive view of human nature and the sort of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=731.52s)]
*  changeability of humans through, through education. And I think that, that shows through in all kinds [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=738.24s)]
*  of things, even the fact that while there were lots of killings by the Chinese Communist Party [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=744.48s)]
*  and other groups, there was often an idea that, that people could be, could be remolded potentially. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=749.52s)]
*  China was one of the few places where they didn't kill the last emperor. The last emperor, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=758.8s)]
*  the idea was that he could become, anybody could be kind of turned into a citizen of this or a [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=765.92s)]
*  subject of this, a good member of this polity through the kind of education. Often it was a [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=773.92s)]
*  very kind of forceful form of education. But I think that's a carryover from the Confucian times. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=782.4s)]
*  And over time, this Confucian idea led to the creation of one of the early great civil service [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=789.28s)]
*  exams, an idea that bureaucracy should be run not by people who were born into the right families, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  but ones who had shown their ability to master these really intensive kind of exams. And the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=804.8s)]
*  exams were things that could make or break your career a bit like at some points in the American [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=811.5200000000001s)]
*  past, passing a bar exam, a really intensive thing could set you on the road to a good career. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=816.8000000000001s)]
*  In China, you had the civil service exam tradition. So I think this kind of emphasis on education [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=823.36s)]
*  and on valuing of scholarly pursuits, but then Chinese leaders throughout history, including up [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=830.48s)]
*  to Mao and Xi Jinping, have also found scholars to be tremendously difficult to control. So there's [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=840.08s)]
*  now been a lens to it or contradiction again there. But to which degree this idea of meritocracy [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=847.6800000000001s)]
*  that's inherent to the notion that we all start at the same line, there's a meritocratic view [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=854.1600000000001s)]
*  of human nature there, or if you work hard and you learn things, you will succeed. And so the [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=863.76s)]
*  reverse, if you haven't succeeded, that means you didn't work hard enough or do not deserve the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=871.76s)]
*  spoils of the success. Does that carry over to the China today? There's such a challenge in all these [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=876.4000000000001s)]
*  forms of meritocracy because you had the civil service exams, but the question was if you had a [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=884.1600000000001s)]
*  really good tutor, if you could afford a really good tutor, you had a better chance of passing [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=890.96s)]
*  the exams. One thing that happened there was families would pool together resources to try to [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=894.5600000000001s)]
*  help the brightest in their group to be able to become part of the officialdom. And this kind of [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=902.64s)]
*  pooling together resources to help as a family was an important part of that structure. But there [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=911.12s)]
*  was always a tension of that. So what if you don't succeed? Some of the leaders of rebellions [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=917.5200000000001s)]
*  against emperors were failed examination candidates. You had this issue and then it [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  became something, well, the system was out of whack and it needed a new leader. And also there was [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  something built in that was not so much Confucius himself, but one of his main interpreters, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=945.44s)]
*  early interpreters, Mencius had this idea which can be seen as a crude justification for rebellion [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=952.6400000000001s)]
*  or for a kind of democracy to say that even though the emperor rules at the will of heaven, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=960.24s)]
*  if he doesn't act like a true emperor, if he's not morally upstanding, then heaven will remove [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=968.4s)]
*  its mandate to him. And then there's no obligation to show deference for a ruler [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=978.88s)]
*  who's not behaving like a true ruler. And there it sort of justifies rebellion. And the idea is that [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=984.96s)]
*  if the rebellion isn't justified, then heaven will stop the ruler from being killed. But if [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=992.08s)]
*  heaven has removed his support, then the rebellion will succeed and then a new [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=999.2800000000001s)]
*  ruler will be justified in taking power. So it's an interesting sense that the universe [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1005.5200000000001s)]
*  in this Confucian view has a kind of moral dimension to it, but it's when things actually [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1012.24s)]
*  happen that you see where the side of morality is. Okay, so it's meritocracy with an asterisk. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1020.72s)]
*  It does seem to be the case, maybe you can speak to that, that in the Chinese education system, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1026.88s)]
*  there seems to be a high value for excellence. Hopefully I'm not generalizing too much, but from [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1030.8s)]
*  the things I've seen, there are certain cultures, certain peoples that, you know, it's just part of [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1037.1200000000001s)]
*  the value system of the culture that you need to be a really good student. Is that the case [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1043.92s)]
*  with the China of today? There's been a lot of emphasis on education and sort of working [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1050.5600000000002s)]
*  really hard and excelling at some subjects and having, you know, there isn't the civil service [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1056.5600000000002s)]
*  exam, but there is the gaokao, an exam that really can determine where you get what kind of [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1063.68s)]
*  institution to get into. And I think, you know, getting back to this idea of meritocracy, which [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1071.6000000000001s)]
*  is strong in a lot of tradition, it also a kind of, what it opens you up to is when there is a [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1080.64s)]
*  sense of unfairness in who's getting ahead and how the spoils are being divided, this leads to a kind [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  of outrage. And some of the biggest protests in China have been about this sense of nepotism, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1096.32s)]
*  which really seems to subvert this whole idea of kind of meritocracy. And the 1989 protests [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1105.04s)]
*  at Tiananmen, even though kind of in the Western press, in particular, was discussed as a movement [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1114.32s)]
*  for democracy. But a lot of the first posters that went up that got students really angry [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1120.1599999999999s)]
*  were criticisms of corruption within the Communist Party and nepotism. And the sense that people, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1125.04s)]
*  despite all the talk, I mean, despite the fact that most people seem to be having to study really [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1131.6s)]
*  hard to pass these exams to get good positions in universities, that some of them were being handed [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1136.56s)]
*  out via the kind of back door. And that led to a kind of outrage. I mean, that's true in many places, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1141.92s)]
*  but I think it gives a special anger against nepotism because of that, the way in which so [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1148.88s)]
*  much emphasis is put on kind of the standard exam way of getting ahead. I hope it's okay if we jump [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1156.72s)]
*  around through history a bit and find the threads that connect everything. Since you mentioned [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1162.8000000000002s)]
*  Tiananmen Square, you have studied a lot of student protests throughout Chinese history, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1167.6000000000001s)]
*  throughout history in general. What happened in Tiananmen Square? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1173.28s)]
*  So in 1989, this massive movement took place. The story of it's largely suppressed within China and [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1178.0s)]
*  largely misunderstood in other places, in part because it happened around the same time that [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1185.52s)]
*  communism was unraveling and ending in the former Soviet bloc. So I think it's often conflated with [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1191.92s)]
*  what was going on there. And so I think one of the key things to know about the protests in 1989 was [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1198.56s)]
*  they were an effort to get the Communist Party in China to do a better job of living up to its own [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1205.84s)]
*  stated ideals and to try to support the trend within the party toward a kind of liberalizing, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1213.2s)]
*  liberalizing and opening up form that had taken shape after Mao's death. And in a sense, the [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1222.32s)]
*  student generation of 89, and I was there in 86 when there were some sort of warmup protests, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1231.9199999999998s)]
*  there was a kind of frustration with what they felt was a half-assed version of what they were [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1238.08s)]
*  talking about. The government was saying, the party was saying, we believe in reform, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1245.1999999999998s)]
*  we believe in reforming and opening up, we need to liberalize, we need to give people more control [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1250.8s)]
*  of their fate. And the students felt that this was being done more effectively in the economic realm [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1258.48s)]
*  than in the political realm. And that there were a lot of sort of partial gestures that suggested [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1266.32s)]
*  the party needed to be pressed to really, really move in that direction. And it'll seem like a very [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1274.08s)]
*  simple thing, but I found it fascinating in 86 when I was there in Shanghai in late 86, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1279.28s)]
*  and students protested. And this was the first time that students had been really on the streets [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1286.72s)]
*  in significant numbers since the Cultural Revolution, or at least since 76. And the [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1292.48s)]
*  students were inspired by calls for democracy and discussions of democracy by this physicist, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1297.92s)]
*  Fang Li Zhe, who was a kind of often thought of a Chinese Sakharov. He was a liberalizing intellectual. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1305.28s)]
*  But one of the things that students in Shanghai, which were some of the most intense protests of [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1313.28s)]
*  that year took place, were frustrated about was a rock concert of all things that Jan and Dean, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1318.96s)]
*  the American surf rock band, which was kind of like the Beach Boys, only not as big. And they were [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1325.92s)]
*  touring China. It was the first time in Shanghai that there'd been a rock concert. And the students [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1331.92s)]
*  were really excited about this because this fit in with what they thought the Communist Party was [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1336.56s)]
*  moving toward was letting them be more part of the world. And for them, that meant being more in step [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1341.8400000000001s)]
*  with pop culture around the world. And at the concert, some students got up to dance because [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1347.52s)]
*  that's what they knew you were supposed to do at a rock concert. And the security guards made them [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1352.72s)]
*  sit down. And for the students in Shanghai, this symbolized what was a faint toward openness that [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1357.12s)]
*  really didn't have follow through. We're going to give you rock concerts, but not let you dance. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1364.3999999999999s)]
*  And so the protests went on for a little while in 86. And posters went up. The officials at [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1369.36s)]
*  university said, no, this is out of hand. We had chaos on the streets during the Cultural [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1378.2399999999998s)]
*  Revolution. We can't go back to that. And nobody wanted to go back to that. So there were posters [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1382.8s)]
*  I saw that said, this is new Red Guardism. And the students didn't want to be associated with that. So [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1389.44s)]
*  it wound down pretty quickly. And they thought, we're not like the Red Guards. We don't want to [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1394.96s)]
*  make chaos. We also are not fervent loyalists of anybody in power. The Red Guards had been [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1401.36s)]
*  passionate about Mao. The analogy partly sort of scared them. And also it meant that the government [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1407.04s)]
*  was really serious about dealing with them. So then in 1989, the protests restart. And there are [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1413.44s)]
*  a variety of reasons why they can restart. The space for them, students are thinking about [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1421.28s)]
*  doing something. In 1989, it's a very resonant year, 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1428.32s)]
*  People are thinking about that. But more importantly, it's the 70th anniversary of [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1434.8s)]
*  the biggest student movement in Chinese history, the May 4th movement of 1919. And the May 4th [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1438.48s)]
*  movement had helped lay the groundwork for the Chinese Communist Party. Some member leading [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1445.36s)]
*  founders of it had been student activists then. It was an anti-imperialist movement, but it was also [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1450.16s)]
*  a movement against bad government. And so the students thought the anniversary of that [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1456.72s)]
*  movement was always marked, commemorated in China, and people took the history seriously. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1463.6s)]
*  People were reminded of what students did in the past. And so there were a lot of reasons why people [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1469.76s)]
*  were itching to do something. And then a leader, Hu Yaobang, who was associated with the more [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1476.8s)]
*  reformist, more liberalizing group within the Chinese Communist Party, he had been stripped of [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1486.3200000000002s)]
*  a very high office, demoted after partly taking a fairly light stance toward the 86, 87 protests. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1493.52s)]
*  And so he was still a member of the government, but he was not as high up in power. He had been [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1502.0s)]
*  very high up. He had been sort of Deng Xiaoping's potential successor. And he dies unexpectedly. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1506.88s)]
*  And there has to be a funeral for him because he dies still as an official. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1513.76s)]
*  And the students take advantage of the opening of their having to be [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1518.0800000000002s)]
*  commemorations of his death. And they put up posters that basically say the wrong people are dying. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1524.24s)]
*  Hu Yaobang was younger than some of the more conservative members. They said, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1529.8400000000001s)]
*  so some people are dying too young. Some people don't seem like they're ever going to die. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1533.8400000000001s)]
*  And so they begin these sorts of protests. This is in April of 89. And the government tries to [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1540.08s)]
*  sort of get the protests to stop quickly. And they use the sort of same technique of they issue an [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1546.9599999999998s)]
*  editorial in People's Daily that says this is creating chaos, which is a code term for taking [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1552.7199999999998s)]
*  us back to the Cultural Revolution. And this time the students say, no, we're just trying to show [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1558.9599999999998s)]
*  our patriotism. We believe that there's too much corruption and nepotism. There's not enough support [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1563.44s)]
*  for the more liberalizing wing within the party. And so they keep up the protests. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1571.8400000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of frustration at this point. There are also economic frustrations at this point. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1578.64s)]
*  The economy is improving because of the reforms, but it seems that people with [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1584.3200000000002s)]
*  good government connections are getting rich too easily. And so there's sort of a sense of unfairness. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1589.36s)]
*  The students are also really frustrated by the kind of macro managing of their private lives on [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1596.6399999999999s)]
*  campuses. So the protests at Tiananmen Square and in plazas all around the country and other cities [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1601.76s)]
*  as well become this mix of things. It's an anti-corruption movement. It's a call for more [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1608.4799999999998s)]
*  democracy movement. It's a call for more freedom of speech movement. But it's also a kind of [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1613.76s)]
*  has some counterculture elements that are like there are rock concerts on the square. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1619.52s)]
*  The most popular rock musician, Tzwe Jien, comes to the square and is celebrated when he's there. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1624.7199999999998s)]
*  There's a sense of kind of a variety of things rolled into one. And I brought up how it sort [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1631.6799999999998s)]
*  of gets conflated with the movements to overthrow communism and the Eastern Bloc. It was actually [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1639.04s)]
*  in many ways, I think, more like something that happened in Eastern Bloc 20 years earlier. It was [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1644.64s)]
*  more like Prague Spring and other 1968 protests in the communist Bloc, which was about moving toward [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1649.76s)]
*  socialism with a human face, more like trying to get the parties empowered to reform rather [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1657.76s)]
*  than necessarily doing away with them. So there was a kind of disjuncture. It happened at the same [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1664.48s)]
*  time as moves to end communism. But of course, I've said there was a possibility when all the [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1669.52s)]
*  protesters were on the square. It seemed that for a time that this might be seen as an acceptable [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1676.24s)]
*  kind of movement to just have a kind of course correction. But then there's also an internal [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1682.32s)]
*  struggle within the communist party leadership. And clearly the people who are more political [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1688.48s)]
*  conservatives, even if they believe in economic reform, are clearly getting the upper hand and [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1694.08s)]
*  this is not going to be tolerated. And the students stay on the square when signals are given to try [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1700.72s)]
*  to get them out. Students from around the country are pouring into Beijing to join this movement. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1707.6799999999998s)]
*  They don't want to end the movement when they've just arrived. So it's actually one thing that [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1714.08s)]
*  keeps it going is new participants are coming from the provinces. And even if some moderates [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1717.6s)]
*  want to leave the square, people want to stay. And then workers start joining in the movement as well [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1724.3999999999999s)]
*  and form an independent labor union. And that really, the Chinese Communist Party, to a certain [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1730.9599999999998s)]
*  extent, they might put up with student protesters, but they know from past experience that sometimes [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1738.24s)]
*  student protests lead to members of other social classes joining them because they look up to [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1744.32s)]
*  students as sort of potential intellectual leaders of the country and admiration for scholars [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1750.32s)]
*  is part of this that turns people turn out when students protest. Something very different from [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1756.56s)]
*  the American case where there's a kind of often suspicious of student activists being necessarily [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1761.6799999999998s)]
*  on the same side as everybody else. But in China, there had been from the history of the 20th [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1768.96s)]
*  century, a sense of students as potentially a vanguard. So once there are labor activists [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1775.1200000000001s)]
*  joining the movement, then troops are called in and there's a massacre near Tiananmen Square [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1782.72s)]
*  on the middle of the night of June 3rd and early on June 4th. And the army just moves in [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1789.68s)]
*  and begins behaving very much like an army of occupation, which is something that people's [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1798.4s)]
*  liberation of armies is supposed to be the one that saves China from foreign aggression. And [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1804.0800000000002s)]
*  they're acting like an invading force. So this is where famously the tanks roll in. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1809.2s)]
*  The tanks roll in. And I think also you have that famous image of the man standing in front of the [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1814.48s)]
*  tank that's a banned image within China. And I really think the reason why it's so considered [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1820.16s)]
*  so toxic by the regime is because it just shows the People's Liberation Army looking like [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1826.32s)]
*  an invading force, not like a stabilizing force. Can we talk about that? Who's now called the tank [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1832.3999999999999s)]
*  man, the man that stood in front of the row of tanks. This was on June 5th in Tiananmen Square. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1839.52s)]
*  What do we know about him? What do you think about him? The symbolism? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1846.96s)]
*  It's an amazing symbol. He's on this boulevard near the square with this long line of tanks. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1851.12s)]
*  And it's unquestionably this act of incredible bravery. And there's some interesting things [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1858.4799999999998s)]
*  about it, some that are forgotten. One is that in the end, he climbs up on the tank. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1863.76s)]
*  And the tank swerves, it doesn't run him over. And the Chinese Communist Party initially showed [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1869.1999999999998s)]
*  video of this and said, look, the Western press is talking about how vicious we were, but look at [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1874.8799999999999s)]
*  the restraint. Look at this. He wasn't mowed down. And they tried this whole story with Tiananmen [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1880.0s)]
*  initially of saying, look, the students were out of control. Everybody should remember what happened [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1886.0s)]
*  during the Cultural Revolution. And the army showed restraint. And there were a small number [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1890.96s)]
*  of soldiers who were actually burned alive in their tanks. Once the massacre began, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1898.16s)]
*  people got outraged and they attacked the soldiers. But by selective use of footage, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1905.04s)]
*  the Communist Party could say, look, actually look at this, the heroes, the martyrs were these [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1912.24s)]
*  soldiers. And they try for the first months after it to try to get this narrative to stick. They [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1916.8799999999999s)]
*  talk about Tiananmen a lot. They talk about these things. They show him as just a tank man. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1924.8s)]
*  The problem with it is that lots and lots of people around Beijing had seen what happened [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1929.3600000000001s)]
*  and knew that in fact, there had first been the firing on unarmed civilians with automatic weapons [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1933.92s)]
*  and there had been many, many people, some students, but a lot of ordinary Beijing residents [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1941.2s)]
*  and workers who were just mowed down. So lots of people knew somebody who had been killed. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1947.92s)]
*  So that story just didn't work. And then I think the claim had to be made to try to suppress [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1952.8s)]
*  discussion of the event and particularly to repress that visual imagery that was that image [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1962.3999999999999s)]
*  of the man in front of the line of tanks. Whatever the tanks did to him or not, the main takeaway [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1970.1599999999999s)]
*  from it would be this idea that there were lines of tanks in a city that was, that the image was [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1976.4s)]
*  of the government as having lost the mandate to rule. And they really didn't want to have that [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1985.1200000000001s)]
*  image out there in the world. Yeah. We're watching the video now. He's got what, like grocery bags [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1990.48s)]
*  in his hands. It's such a symbolic, I've had enough, like that kind of statement. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2000.48s)]
*  Yeah. And it's probably not a student. It's often described as a student, but he probably was [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2008.0s)]
*  a worker and it is a powerful, powerful image of bravery. And I brought up the 1968 parallel [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2013.68s)]
*  for Eastern and Central Europe. There was actually a very powerful photograph of a man bearing his [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2022.24s)]
*  chest in front of a tank in Bratislava during what we think of as Prague Spring. That was a [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2027.92s)]
*  famous image of bravery against tanks. And in 1968 in Czechoslovakia, then still Czechoslovakia, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2034.64s)]
*  the tanks that rolled in were Soviet tanks sent down there. And so not that people would know, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2044.48s)]
*  but that was an image, what was so powerful in that was saying, we're not going to put up with [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2051.6800000000003s)]
*  this invasion. Again, I think you have the People's Liberation Army looking like an invading force. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2056.96s)]
*  And that's what the Chinese Communist Party in a sense can't deal with now. Even though [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2063.36s)]
*  sometimes they could tell a story about 1989, and they do tell a version of this and some people [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2071.76s)]
*  believe this, I think, is that in 1989, China went one route of not having the Communist Party [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2078.08s)]
*  dramatically change or relinquish control. And the Soviet Union and the former Soviet states [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2087.44s)]
*  went another. And you could say, well, look, and after 1989, the Chinese economy boomed, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2092.8s)]
*  life got better for people in China, life got really terrible for a lot of people in the [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2099.12s)]
*  former Soviet blocs. Maybe this was the right way to go. And you can make that kind of argument, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2103.84s)]
*  but if you show the tanks and the man in front of the tanks, you just have a different kind of [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2110.6400000000003s)]
*  image of heroism. It's one of my favorite photographs or snapshots ever taken, videos [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2115.68s)]
*  ever taken. So I apologize if we linger on it. Sometimes you don't understand the symbolic power [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2122.08s)]
*  of an image until afterwards. And perhaps that's what the Chinese government didn't quite understand. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2129.2799999999997s)]
*  They lost information war, they mean war. So I have to ask, what do you think was going through [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2136.72s)]
*  that man's head? Was it a heroic statement? Was it a purely primal guttural, like I've had enough? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2141.68s)]
*  Michael S. Lauer It's so interesting to just speculate on. We just don't know, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2149.9199999999996s)]
*  because he was never able to be interviewed afterwards. But I think your emphasis on [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2153.44s)]
*  patriotism is really important, because one of the students' main demands was, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2157.3599999999997s)]
*  then I think it might have been the thing that would have gotten them to leave the square, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2162.72s)]
*  would have been to say, we want this to be acknowledged as a patriotic, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2166.24s)]
*  that our goals are patriotic. We're not here to take China back into the Cultural Revolution. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2170.4s)]
*  We're here to express our love for the country if it goes in the right way. So will you admit that? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2175.76s)]
*  And you mentioned about the power of the image. And I do think the Chinese Communist Party learned [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2183.6000000000004s)]
*  something, has taken to heart the power of the image after that. Because we saw this in, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2188.88s)]
*  but when there were protests in Hong Kong, the government on the mainland really wanted to tell [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2195.6000000000004s)]
*  a story there of crowds out of control. And initially there were in 2014, and again, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2201.92s)]
*  initially in 2019, there were very orderly crowds, and it had trouble with that story. So they tried [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2208.4s)]
*  very hard to ban images of peaceful protests until there were some incidents, as there almost always [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2216.4s)]
*  are, of violence by crowds. And then they would show those images over and over again. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2222.56s)]
*  They also worked very hard when Hong Kong protests began in the 2010s to try very hard to avoid [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2229.2799999999997s)]
*  any use of soldiers to repress them. It was all the police. And they tried very hard and managed [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2237.2s)]
*  to success because the Western press was often saying, will this be another Tiananmen? Will [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2244.0s)]
*  there be a massacre? Will there be soldiers on the streets? The movements in Hong Kong were [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2248.96s)]
*  suppressed without the use of shooting to kill on the streets. There were shooting to wound. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2254.64s)]
*  There was beanbag shot. There were rubber bullets. There was enormous amounts of tear gas. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2263.52s)]
*  There was even tear gas left let fly inside subway stations in 2019. And all these things are really [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2268.64s)]
*  brutalizing, but they don't make the kind of images that sear in the mind the way something [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2276.56s)]
*  like the Tiananmen Tank Man image or the image of a Vietnamese woman being burned by napalm, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2283.92s)]
*  young woman that became another of the iconic images during Vietnam War. Those images really [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2291.7599999999998s)]
*  can have an extraordinary power. And I think the Chinese Communist Party is now aware of that. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2297.52s)]
*  There are very few photographs allowed of the Xinjiang extra-legal detention camps. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2304.0s)]
*  There is an awareness of how much power a photograph of a certain type can have. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2316.72s)]
*  RG So nobody knows what happened to the Tank Man? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2321.7599999999998s)]
*  BT No. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2325.28s)]
*  RG What do you think happened to the Tank Man? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2326.48s)]
*  BT I assume he was killed. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2328.16s)]
*  RG Killed? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2329.36s)]
*  BT I assume. He just disappeared. It's interesting because very often figures are made an example of [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2330.72s)]
*  in one way or another. I mean, Liu Xiaobo was imprisoned and not allowed to get enough [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2338.0s)]
*  medical care. So you can talk about him having died earlier than he should have. But there [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2346.16s)]
*  has been relatively few for political crimes recently, sentencing to death and things like [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2353.2799999999997s)]
*  that. It's much more just remove them, imprison them. But the Tank Man, there was never a trial. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2359.36s)]
*  Even a trial that was one that you knew what the result would be, which there was for Liu Xiaobo [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2368.0s)]
*  and others. Not even a hidden trial, but simply disappeared. And there's been somebody who's like [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2375.44s)]
*  another figure like this who's disappeared. A couple of years ago in Beijing, there was a [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2382.96s)]
*  lone man who put up a banner on a bridge, a sitong bridge in Beijing. And it was extraordinary. It [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2389.6s)]
*  had denunciations of the direction Xi Jinping was taking the country. It was denunciation of COVID [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2397.2s)]
*  policies, but also a dictatorial rule. And the banner somehow he managed to have it up and get [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2402.96s)]
*  it long enough to be filmed and to draw attention and the film to circulate. Again, another image of [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2410.16s)]
*  the power of images. And he's disappeared. And there hasn't been a show trial or even a secret [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2416.3999999999996s)]
*  trial. And again, we don't know if he's still alive, but these are cases where I think the [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2423.3599999999997s)]
*  Chinese Communist Party really doesn't want a competing story out there. They don't want [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2429.44s)]
*  somebody to be able to answer what he was thinking. How much censorship is there in modern-day [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2434.56s)]
*  China by the Chinese government? So, you know, there's a lot of censorship. My favorite book [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2439.92s)]
*  about one of my favorite books about Chinese censorship, Margaret Roberts, where she talks [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2445.84s)]
*  about there are three different ways that the government can control the stories. And she says [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2450.08s)]
*  there's fear, which is this kind of direct censorship thing of like banning things. But there's also [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2457.04s)]
*  friction, which she says she has three apps, fear, friction and flooding. And she says they're all [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2462.96s)]
*  important. And I think this is true, not just of China, but in other settings too. So what [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2468.56s)]
*  friction means is you just make it harder for people to get answers or get information that [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2473.44s)]
*  you don't want them to get. Even though you know that some people will get it, you just make it [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2479.36s)]
*  that the easiest way, the first answer you'll get through a search. So a lot of, you know, tech savvy [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2484.56s)]
*  or globally minded tapped in Chinese people will use a VPN to jump over the firewall. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2492.32s)]
*  But it's work. The internet moves slower. You have to keep updating your VPN. So you just create [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2501.28s)]
*  friction so that, okay, some people will find this out. And then flooding, you just fill the airwaves [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2507.6000000000004s)]
*  and the media with versions of the stories that you want the people to believe. So all those kind [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2513.84s)]
*  of exist and in operation. And I think the fear is the easiest side to say what's blah. So I'm [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2519.84s)]
*  always interested in things that you would expect to be censored that aren't censored. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2526.96s)]
*  You can read all sorts of things in China about totalitarian. You can read Hannah Arendt's [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2534.8s)]
*  book on totalitarianism, which would be the kind of thing you just, you know, you're not supposed [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2542.6400000000003s)]
*  to be able to read that in a somewhat totalitarian state or a dictatorial state of anything. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2546.48s)]
*  But it's not specifically about China. And so censorship is most restrictive when it's things [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2553.2s)]
*  that are actually about China, things about leaders or the Chinese Communist Party, there's [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2562.16s)]
*  intense kind of censorship of that and certain events in that way. But a sort of like something [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2566.64s)]
*  through allegory, something through imagining a place that looks a lot like a Communist Party [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2575.12s)]
*  ruled state so that people are going to read it. There were things that were banned throughout, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2583.12s)]
*  up until like the very last period of Gorbachev's rule, bad things banned in the Soviet Union [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2588.48s)]
*  that are available in Chinese bookstores. You can buy 1984 in a Chinese bookstore. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2593.6s)]
*  You've been able to since 1985. You can buy, again, it's not about China. And actually, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2598.3199999999997s)]
*  for some people within China in the mid 1980s, where they focused on the part of 1984 that's [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2605.3599999999997s)]
*  like the two minutes of hate, these rituals of denunciation of people, for some people in China, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2611.8399999999997s)]
*  it seemed like it was about their past, not about their present. And then by the 90s, 1984 is a very [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2616.64s)]
*  bleak culture of scarcity, a place where people just aren't having fun. And people said like, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2623.2s)]
*  you could read, some people would read 1984 and say, look, this is the world we're living in. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2629.9199999999996s)]
*  It's a big brother state. But others said, well, that has some similarities to us, but [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2634.3999999999996s)]
*  he wasn't talking about a country like ours. Look, we've got supermarkets, we've got McDonald's. I [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2640.48s)]
*  mean, this is not, we've got fast trains, we've got things, we're living so much better in some [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2645.8399999999997s)]
*  ways than our grandparents did. And this isn't like that bleak world he was imagining. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2651.68s)]
*  Yeah, you've actually spoken about and described China as more akin to the dystopian world, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2657.6s)]
*  the brave new world than 1984. Which is really interesting to think about. I think about that a [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2661.68s)]
*  lot. I've recently reread, over the past couple of years, we read Brave New World a couple of times, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2668.3999999999996s)]
*  and also 1984. It does seem that the 21st century might be more defined to a degree, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2673.68s)]
*  it is dystopian, any of the nations are, by Brave New World and by 1984. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2682.48s)]
*  There are mixed elements. I think there are moments when it can seem more one than the other. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2688.72s)]
*  And there can be parts of the same country that seem more one than the other. I think, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2694.64s)]
*  and if we just think about control through distraction and playing to your sense of pleasure. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2699.8399999999997s)]
*  And one thing that people forget sometimes or don't know is that Aldous Huxley, who wrote Brave New [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2708.7999999999997s)]
*  World, taught Eric Blair, who became George Orwell, when he was a student at Eden. And they were sort [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2713.68s)]
*  of rivals. And in fact, in 1949, Orwell sent his former teacher a copy in 1984 and said, you know, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2719.9199999999996s)]
*  look, I've written this. Basically, it's kind of almost a little Oedipal, like I've written this [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2728.32s)]
*  book that displaces yours. He didn't say that. He just said, I want you to have this. But he [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2733.36s)]
*  criticized Brave New World in reviews as like not having imagined a world of capitalism run wild, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2738.1600000000003s)]
*  like before realizing the kind of totalitarian threats of the middle of the 20th century. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2747.28s)]
*  But Huxley wrote Orwell a letter in October of 1949, same month the Communist Party took control [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2752.96s)]
*  in China, not that he mentions China. And he just said, you know, it's a great book and everything, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2759.12s)]
*  but I think the dictators of the future will find less arduous ways to keep control over the [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2764.0s)]
*  population. Basically saying more like what was in my book than in yours. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2770.0s)]
*  I have to say, I think Huxley might be really onto something there, truly a visionary. Although [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2774.8s)]
*  to give points to Orwell, I do think as far as just a philosophical work of fiction, 1984 is a [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2782.1600000000003s)]
*  better book. Because Brave New World does not quite construct the philosophical message thoroughly. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2792.4s)]
*  Because 1984 contains many very clearly, very poetically defined elements of a totalitarian [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2799.8399999999997s)]
*  regime. Oh, and the dissection of language is just so amazing. No, I think you've got a point there, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2807.6s)]
*  and I went back and reread Brave New World and it's fascinating, but it's very messy. I think [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2812.72s)]
*  there's a clarity to Orwell's 1984. There's a clarity to Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2820.08s)]
*  Similarly, the construction of the elements. And she was a big fan of both 1984 and Brave New World. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2827.44s)]
*  So there's a way they go forward. But you know, there was a kind of, it's not exactly a sequel, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2837.04s)]
*  but Huxley did write something called Brave New World Revisited. Yes, he did. In the 50s. And he [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2843.1200000000003s)]
*  kind of said, actually it seems, and he mentions China there. He says that in Mao's China, they're [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2848.88s)]
*  kind of combining the two things of this. And I'm really fascinated by that because they published [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2855.36s)]
*  in China, on the Chinese mainland. It was published in Taiwan and Hong Kong too. It's called the [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2862.0800000000004s)]
*  Dystopian Trilogy. And it's a box set where you have Zemiaten's We, who then inspired both Orwell [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2869.52s)]
*  and Huxley to some extent. That's one book. And then there's Animal Farm in 1984, it's a second [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2877.6800000000003s)]
*  book. And then the third volume is Huxley's Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2884.4s)]
*  And it was published in Complex Characters. You could buy it in Hong Kong. But I compared it to [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2890.88s)]
*  the book you can buy on the mainland. And it's all the same, except the parts in Brave New World [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2898.08s)]
*  Revisited that refer to China are scalpled out. And this I think shows the subtlety of the [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2905.2000000000003s)]
*  censorship system. You can buy these books and you can read about them, but the parts that [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2911.36s)]
*  really show you how to connect the dots, that's taken out. And I do think the Brave New World [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2917.76s)]
*  side of things, I think with China, I was feeling it was definitely moving more toward Brave New [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2924.56s)]
*  World, except Tibet and Xinjiang being more the crude boot on the face, 1984 style of control. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2931.04s)]
*  But then during the COVID lockdowns, when people were being so intensely monitored and controlled, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2939.92s)]
*  even places like Shanghai that had seen much more of the Brave New World kind of style [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2945.92s)]
*  had their Orwellian moment. So you have it now, I think it's, you know, there are more 1984, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2950.7200000000003s)]
*  more Brave New World parts of the country, and there are also more Brave New World, more 1984 [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2957.92s)]
*  moments. I see why it could give a sense after you've thoroughly internalized the fear [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2962.32s)]
*  that you have complete freedom of speech. Just don't mention the government. So you could talk [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2969.84s)]
*  about totalitarianism, you could talk about the darkest aspects of human nature, just don't. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2975.2000000000003s)]
*  You can even talk about the government in a sort of metaphorical, like poetic [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2981.84s)]
*  way that's not directly linkable. But the moment you mention the government, it's like a dumb [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2986.48s)]
*  keyword search. Yeah, it's and I think it's like one of these really good examples of how, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2994.4s)]
*  you know, China's distinctive, but it's not unique. You have other settings where you have these [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3001.28s)]
*  like no-go zones that you learn. And one example is in Singapore, you know, there was this, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3006.72s)]
*  so National University of Singapore has a world-class history department, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3012.08s)]
*  but no Singapore historian in it, nobody who focuses on the history of Singapore. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3017.7599999999998s)]
*  Because, you know, it's incredibly wide ranging what you can do, analyze. But when you're actually [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3022.72s)]
*  talking about the family that's been most powerful in Singapore, then it gets to be touchy. In [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3029.92s)]
*  Thailand, which I've been working on recently, you have this Lais-majeste laws that make it very, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3037.28s)]
*  very dangerous to say certain kinds of things about the king. And so you in all of these [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3046.48s)]
*  settings, you have to figure out ways to work around it. There's a way in which you can, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3052.32s)]
*  say at the international, the foreign correspondence clubs in different parts of Asia, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3059.84s)]
*  you can have an event that's about the country won over, that you can say basically anything [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3064.72s)]
*  you want. But when it gets to the things in the place where you are, you're, it's touchy. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3070.96s)]
*  I should give credit for that insight. Shivani Matani, who's written, co-wrote a very good book [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3077.2s)]
*  on Hong Kong among the braves. She was talking about that, that in Singapore, at the foreign [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3083.6s)]
*  correspondence club, you could have an event on Hong Kong that could say all kinds of things that [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3089.36s)]
*  you couldn't say at the Hong Kong foreign correspondence club. But at the same time, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3093.92s)]
*  when I saw her in Singapore, she said there was a Singapore refugee, a political refugee in Hong [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3097.6s)]
*  Kong who was giving a talk at the Hong Kong foreign correspondence club, saying kinds of things that [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3103.92s)]
*  he couldn't say in Singapore. And in Thailand, I gave a talk at the foreign correspondence club. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3108.8s)]
*  And then I went to hear a talk there because I was just curious about like what the culture [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3114.96s)]
*  in this foreign correspondence club. And there was somebody talking about human rights abuses in [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3120.16s)]
*  different parts of Southeast Asia, saying things very directly and then said, and there are things [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3124.96s)]
*  going on in Thailand that we're not going to talk about. And there was this kind of, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3130.72s)]
*  yeah, self-censorship can be a very powerful thing. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3136.56s)]
*  One of the things I learned about all of this, which is interesting, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3139.36s)]
*  I want to learn more is about the human psychology, the ability of the individual mind to compartmentalize [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3144.64s)]
*  things. It does seem like you could not live in a state of fear as long as you don't mention a [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3151.2799999999997s)]
*  particular topic. My intuition would be about the human mind. If there's anything you're afraid of [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3156.8799999999997s)]
*  talking about, that fear will permeate through everything else. You would not be able to do [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3164.0s)]
*  great science, great exploration, great technology. And that idea, I think, underpins [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3168.88s)]
*  the whole idea of freedom of speech. Why you don't want in the United States, you don't want to [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3173.92s)]
*  censor any even dangerous speech because that will permeate everything else. You won't be able [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3179.28s)]
*  to have great scientists. You won't be able to have great journalists. You won't be able to have, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3185.52s)]
*  I don't know. I'm obviously biased towards America and I think you do need to have that [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3188.96s)]
*  full-on freedom of speech, but this is an interesting case study. And that's actually [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3193.6800000000003s)]
*  something that you speak about that Mao, if he were alive today and visited China, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3198.48s)]
*  would be quite surprised. You give the Nanjing Bookstore as an example. Can you just speak to [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3203.68s)]
*  this? If Mao visited China, let's go with that thought experiment. What would he recognize? What [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3210.4s)]
*  would he be surprised by? So I wrote about imagining a revivified Mao going to town, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3216.8s)]
*  wandering in this really cool Nanjing Bookstore in the early 2000s and just being amazed at [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3224.16s)]
*  what you could read there and what books were for sale. And I thought about how he'd be like, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3232.16s)]
*  what's going on? Is the Communist Party not in control? I mean, he talked about how art and [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3238.72s)]
*  politics needed to, in some ways, go together and you've got all these kind of things. He'd also be, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3245.2799999999997s)]
*  he also would have been shocked by all these books about how to start your own [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3250.16s)]
*  cafe and bar and sort of celebrating entrepreneurship, how to get into Harvard. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3254.16s)]
*  It's like, you know, all of these things just wouldn't compute from his time. Although I said [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3258.8799999999997s)]
*  it would actually maybe make him nostalgia for the time of his youth in the 1910s. He was a [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3263.92s)]
*  participant in the May 4th movement, which was a time of reading all over the world, looking for [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3268.8799999999997s)]
*  the best ideas circulating. So he might say, well, the teenage me would have really, really loved this. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3273.8399999999997s)]
*  So some of the coolest bookstores, the things that I just was amazed could exist in the early 2000s. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3281.92s)]
*  So you can still read, you can still buy copies in 1984 and you can still get [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3289.0400000000004s)]
*  some of these other things. But that was a time when more and more of those things were being [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3293.92s)]
*  translated fresh. I'm not sure you get permission to translate some of those things now. There's [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3298.0800000000004s)]
*  more of a sense of caution. And when some of those bookstores would also then hold events that would [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3303.92s)]
*  talk about the kinds of ideas that then take them to the next level and talk about the applicability [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3311.3599999999997s)]
*  to the situation in China, some of those bookstores have closed or have had to become [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3319.4399999999996s)]
*  kind of really shadows of what they were. And one of the best ones, not the one I wrote about in [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3325.04s)]
*  Nanjing, but a similar one, a Shanghai one, which was literally an underground bookstore, it was in a [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3330.96s)]
*  metro station. And it had really freewheeling discussions of liberal ideas in the early 2000s [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3336.8s)]
*  and early 2010s. But then it just got less and less space to operate under Xi Jinping when [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3344.48s)]
*  things started narrowing. And it then had to close in Shanghai. And it's just been reopened in [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3351.36s)]
*  DC as JF Books. And it's become in this really interesting cultural hub. And I'm really delighted [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3358.5600000000004s)]
*  it's where I'm going to hold the launch for my next book when it comes out in June, this book on [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3365.84s)]
*  the Milk Tea Alliance about struggles for change across East and Southeast Asia, including in [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3372.08s)]
*  places that are worried about the kind of rising influence of Beijing. And it seems just perfect [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3379.6800000000003s)]
*  to be holding it in the kind of place that can't exist in Shanghai. So places like that, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3386.2400000000002s)]
*  they stopped being able to exist on the mainland, then they could still exist in Hong Kong. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3392.4s)]
*  But now in Hong Kong, one of the coolest bookstores has had to close up. It just didn't [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3396.56s)]
*  feel like it could continue operating and tightening control there. And it's reopened [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3402.48s)]
*  in upstate New York. So you have this phenomenon of bookstores. There's also a few bookstores [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3406.08s)]
*  called the Nowhere Bookstores that opened in Chiang Mai and Taipei and The Hague. And I heard one is [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3413.12s)]
*  maybe is going to open in or is open in Japan to my sometime collaborator, Amy Hawkins, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3420.32s)]
*  who covers China for The Guardian, wrote a great piece late last year about this [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3427.44s)]
*  overseas bookstore phenomenon, sort of carrying on the conversations that people thought they [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3432.32s)]
*  might be able to have in China and then couldn't and imagine someday being able to hold in China, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3438.8s)]
*  but maybe can't. So first of all, boy, do I love America. And second of all, it makes me really sad [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3444.4s)]
*  because there's a very large number of incredible people in China, incredible minds. And maybe I'm [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3452.64s)]
*  romantic about this, but books is a catalyst for brilliant minds to flourish. And without that, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3460.1600000000003s)]
*  so I guess maybe this is a good time to mention something that I do think about. And sometimes [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3467.92s)]
*  people will think because of censorship and that there's an idea of sort of brainwashing within [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3473.04s)]
*  China population control. And I periodically will get students from the mainland. And I have a lot [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3478.32s)]
*  of students from the mainland in my classes. I teach Chinese history and I feel like, okay, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3487.04s)]
*  now I'm contradicting the version of the past that's been drumbeat into them. But I'll still [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3491.36s)]
*  get students who are incredible free thinkers who have come through that system and it just [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3497.76s)]
*  doesn't hold or there are limits to it. And this is kind of, I mean, some of them are people who [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3504.0s)]
*  just got curious by something and it is a porous system. It's more porous than in North Korea, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3511.6800000000003s)]
*  things like that. So there are, even if there's that like fear, friction and flooding, which [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3520.0s)]
*  Robert talks about that ends up keeping lots of people on the same page as the government. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3525.36s)]
*  There's still people who take the time to go over the firewall or get intrigued or they see [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3531.84s)]
*  an image sent by a friend of theirs on social media, will share them something on WeChat [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3538.08s)]
*  that it doesn't get picked up by the censors, but they look at it carefully and they say, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3551.2s)]
*  oh, well, wait a minute, that contradicts what the government's official line is. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3558.7999999999997s)]
*  So there's still ways in which that creativity and freedom of thinking persists. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3564.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's really beautiful to hear. I mean, fundamentally, the human spirit [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3570.8s)]
*  is curious and wants to understand. And then some, especially the young people, as we mentioned, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3577.76s)]
*  are suspicious of authority in the best kind of way. And so they're always asking kinds of [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3584.08s)]
*  questions, but we always have the child, the young person inside us always asking like, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3588.4s)]
*  maybe I'm being lied to in all these kinds of ways. But still it's sad because there [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3595.36s)]
*  is, if you're not deliberately doing that, or if there's not a spark of possibility that comes [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3600.3999999999996s)]
*  before you as just a regular citizen of China, you might never really ask maybe a whole, there's a [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3606.64s)]
*  whole different perspective on history, on world history. To be fair, I think United States is [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3612.0s)]
*  often guilty of this very United States centric view of history. I mean, similar with Europe, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3619.2799999999997s)]
*  Europe has a very Europe sense of history. I often enjoy talking to people from different [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3625.12s)]
*  backgrounds, from different parts of the world, talking to them about World War II, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3631.68s)]
*  because it's like, it's clear that the emphasis, you've read certain chapters of the story, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3635.92s)]
*  a lot of times, and not the other chapters of the story, the Western front in Europe and the [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3642.88s)]
*  Eastern front in Europe, and then Japan and China's role in World War II and the history around that [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3648.3199999999997s)]
*  before and after World War II of China is not often talked about in the United States. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3654.8s)]
*  And I'm sure if I could venture a guess that the opposite is true in China. I certainly know the [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3659.92s)]
*  opposite was true in the Soviet Union and even in Europe that directly experienced France, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3665.52s)]
*  Great Britain, Germany, Italy, they all have very different ways of speaking and thinking and reading [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3671.84s)]
*  about World War II. And the same goes across all of history and all of culture. So yes, it's always [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3679.36s)]
*  good to sort of question the mainstream narrative in your country. And looking outside, it's just [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3686.6400000000003s)]
*  harder to do in China based on technological, based on all the reasons you mentioned. And if I [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3691.52s)]
*  can, I just want to give a shout out. Thank you. I'll look at her work, Margaret Roberts, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3697.04s)]
*  the fear, the friction and the flooding, her ideas. I can already tell there's a lot of [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3702.1600000000003s)]
*  brilliance here. Fear, this is the most traditional form involving overt threats and punishments for [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3706.96s)]
*  accessing and sharing such sensitive information. However, Roberts finds that fear-based censorship [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3713.6s)]
*  is used selectively, mainly targeting high profile individuals such as journalists or activists. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3720.2400000000002s)]
*  For the average citizen, the risk of punishment is relatively low, and fear alone is not the main [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3725.44s)]
*  deterrent. She goes on to describe the friction and the flooding. The friction is attacks on [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3730.64s)]
*  information access. And flooding is less visible than fear or friction, but is a powerful tool for [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3737.7599999999998s)]
*  shaping the information environment. Flooding one scares me more and more. Flooding one is the brave [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3745.12s)]
*  new world. Yeah, it is. And I think it's the whole kind of the world of short attention spans and [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3751.44s)]
*  social media and how this all works. Chinese Communist Party leaders, I brought up Singapore, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3759.04s)]
*  and Deng Xiaoping and some of the leaders were looking at that. And they're looking at, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3765.04s)]
*  there are all kinds of things that both going to Singapore can sometimes make you feel like [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3769.44s)]
*  you're in this futuristic setting in terms of a lot of things that eventually came to other parts [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3778.96s)]
*  of the world would be tried out there. And I think the seductiveness is that some of these things [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3785.52s)]
*  they both add to convenience at the same time they strip away. They're collecting information about [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3792.72s)]
*  you, which can be also something that can make your life easier at the same time that's stripping [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3800.24s)]
*  you away. I mean, we talk about the siloing of information and targeting of ads and targeting [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3807.36s)]
*  of news. And so two things come to mind to mention. One is Christina Larson, a very bright [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3813.84s)]
*  journalist, a friend of mine who's now working on other things, but was working on China. And she [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3822.0s)]
*  wrote about this in MIT technology review. She said, you need to think about China's having the [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3826.7200000000003s)]
*  best as well as the worst internet experience in the world. And you think about it with, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3831.84s)]
*  you think of the worst as easy, the great firewall, you try to search for what happened, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3838.08s)]
*  search for the Tank Man, you won't get it. You search for information about Dalai Lama, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3843.52s)]
*  and you get all these lies about him, search for things about Xinjiang, and it makes it seem like [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3848.48s)]
*  it's a place where people are happy rather than massive extra-legal detention camps and where [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3853.44s)]
*  your life can be ruined by things you have no control over. But she said, on other ways, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3859.1200000000003s)]
*  when it comes to consumer playing to your pleasures and things, it was really advanced. A [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3865.1200000000003s)]
*  lot of things that then come out of place are tried out there and in massive numbers. And I [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3872.4s)]
*  remember around the time that I had read that, I was in Shanghai and somebody was explaining it to [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3877.44s)]
*  me. They were talking about going out to eat. I said, oh, we've got such and such. And I said, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3883.04s)]
*  oh, that's like Yelp. I said, well, yeah, but Yelp just tells you the overall rating for a restaurant [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3887.44s)]
*  over time. We've got one that can tell you which part of the restaurant you want to sit in because [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3894.1600000000003s)]
*  there's a waiter that's in a really bad mood and people have posted enough information [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3900.32s)]
*  to do this. Or what the best dish there is in the last week. Forget about these slow things. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3904.88s)]
*  And you had a lot of things that were like, okay, you're a smart city and controlled. You can learn [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3911.92s)]
*  things about ease of movement. And Singapore had some of these things tested too. You had way before [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3919.2000000000003s)]
*  you go into an underground parking lot now in the US and you find out whether there are any [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3926.08s)]
*  empty spaces on a floor. That was something that was years before in Singapore. And you used money [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3932.48s)]
*  less often there because you had a transponder that would automatically pay for your parking [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3943.12s)]
*  and things. And it was something that can be very seductive. So the other line, besides best and [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3948.24s)]
*  worst internet I always like is William Gibson, who wrote one of the other important dystopian [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3953.52s)]
*  novels of the present Neuromancer. He wrote a rare, for him, non-fiction piece about Singapore, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3959.68s)]
*  where he referred to it as Disneyland with the death penalty. And there are times when- [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3965.6s)]
*  CB I shouldn't laugh. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3971.84s)]
*  LS But it is. It's a powerful- [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3973.12s)]
*  CB Yeah. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3975.7599999999998s)]
*  LS He's not welcomed in Singapore, let's just say. But he talked about how when he wanted to try to [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3976.56s)]
*  he went to Japan a lot in the 1980s at a time when Japan was a place where you got a sense of what [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3983.84s)]
*  the future might hold. So the dark side of this, the surveillance state at its worst, which we see [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3990.24s)]
*  in Xinjiang and places. And there, again, it may seem like I'm just obsessed with science fiction [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3998.48s)]
*  and there it really is minority report. It's this kind of like you do certain kinds of behaviors and [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4005.04s)]
*  we're seeing this other places too. We're seeing versions of it in the US as well, where it's like, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4011.28s)]
*  oh, we can tell from a pattern that you're the kind of person who might do X. And so in Xinjiang, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4016.8s)]
*  when they were starting to round people up, there's this great book by a Uyghur poet. He [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4024.7200000000003s)]
*  talks about how people were just starting to disappear off the streets and they were being [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4030.96s)]
*  accused of being radicalized and being potential terrorists. And the cues could be something like [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4035.36s)]
*  somebody giving up smoking or not drinking alcohol because that was seen as something [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4044.56s)]
*  that sometimes went along with becoming more devoted to Islam and more devoted to something, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4050.1600000000003s)]
*  a particular version of it. So he talked about how a group of the poets, when they would get [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4057.84s)]
*  writers, when they get together, whether or not any of them drank, they would make sure there was [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4062.16s)]
*  a bottle of alcohol on their table because it was simply a way of trying to stay ahead of this system [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4066.8799999999997s)]
*  of looking for these kind of clues. So you really have this dark side of Xinjiang is this example [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4073.2799999999997s)]
*  and Tibet also with incredible tight control. And there's more of that kind of push on personal life [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4080.56s)]
*  in other parts of China as well. But I think the question of whether we give up too much and who [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4089.84s)]
*  can abuse what we do give up is something that is being asked in the United States now about big tech [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4097.84s)]
*  companies as well as it's asked about governments, but it's also asked about big tech and what you [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4103.6s)]
*  have as a trade-off. But I hadn't thought about it till this conversation, which I can tell is why [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4109.52s)]
*  people find it stimulating to have these extended conversations because you have sat lines, but then [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4114.56s)]
*  you kind of, the conversation goes and you think in a different way. So what I used to always say [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4123.52s)]
*  about China after 1989 was the Chinese Communist Party wanted to stay in power [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4129.04s)]
*  and they realized that the Soviet Union, Soviet bloc was falling apart. They knew that one reason [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4136.4800000000005s)]
*  why people, and this is like the simple way of one way I think you have to understand why [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4143.04s)]
*  communism fell in Eastern Europe was partly about ideals and thirst for freedom and that. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4149.6s)]
*  But also people knew that people, East Germans knew that West Germans were having more fun and [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4155.68s)]
*  getting better stuff. And when some East Berliners got over the wall, one of the first places they [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4161.5199999999995s)]
*  went to was this department store to see if the images of better food and more choices [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4167.6s)]
*  were available there. And it was true. And I think this is a human, as human as the [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4173.52s)]
*  desire for more freedom. So one of the things that the Chinese Communist Party, they never [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4177.84s)]
*  articulated it this way, but how can we try to get to a stage where we don't have things like Tiananmen [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4182.08s)]
*  again? Well, what if we tried to make a deal with people? We'll give them more choices [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4187.92s)]
*  in their daily life. We'll give them better stuff. We'll give them more choices at the store. We'll [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4191.52s)]
*  give them more choices about what to read to, because we'll give them more choices in consumer [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4198.0s)]
*  goods and intellectuals, consumer goods they want are to watch the movies and read the books that [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4203.4400000000005s)]
*  other people like them around the world are reading. So we'll give them more choices. We won't open the [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4208.64s)]
*  floodgates completely, but we'll give them more choices, but not give them more choices at the [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4213.280000000001s)]
*  ballot box or in politics. And this was the new social compact. Allow us to keep ruling and we'll [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4218.08s)]
*  make sure that you're living better than the last generation in terms of choices and in terms of [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4226.24s)]
*  material goods. Now, one of the things that's happening now is the Chinese Communist Party, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4234.8s)]
*  the economy isn't booming the way it was before. The sort of sense of clearly we're living better [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4242.160000000001s)]
*  materially than the generation before. It's not as easy an argument to make when you have slower [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4249.120000000001s)]
*  growth rates and things like that. But the Communist Party makes different kinds of arguments now about [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4255.200000000001s)]
*  the rest of the world is in chaos and we're more stable. But the thing that I now am going to think [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4261.84s)]
*  about differently is the argument was we'll give you more choices and you'll have more of a private [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4268.64s)]
*  life, more of this. But now in the period we are globally, now there's a new kind of suspicion about [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4275.360000000001s)]
*  the degree of any kind of private choices. I mean, there was an idea that the post Tiananmen [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4284.96s)]
*  generation was promised to have a little bit more space away from the prying eyes of the state. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4290.4800000000005s)]
*  And now globally, we worry about the prying eyes of whether it's the state or whether it's [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4298.72s)]
*  tech companies. It's a different moment. What does it mean to say you have more choices? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4304.08s)]
*  It's almost like you have two knobs. One is 1984, one is the Brave New World. At first, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4309.360000000001s)]
*  they turned up the Brave New World, more choices. And now they're turning up the 1984, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4313.360000000001s)]
*  keeping the choices, but turning up the 1984 with more surveillance. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4318.96s)]
*  So the choices you make have to be more public. Do you have a sense that [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4323.2s)]
*  the thing we've been talking about, the increase in censorship, does that predate Xi Jinping? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4329.36s)]
*  Is Xi Jinping a part of that increase in censorship? What is that dynamic? What role [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4336.5599999999995s)]
*  does Xi Jinping play in what China has gone through over the past, let's say, a decade and a half? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4341.28s)]
*  That's a really great question. I was actually just writing a review of two books. One is called [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4348.32s)]
*  The Xi Jinping Effect, which was just a bunch of scholars and academic volume looking at, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4354.4s)]
*  take this topic and that topic, how much is Xi Jinping as a person really affected it? And [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4360.88s)]
*  they come up with all kinds of answers. But there's a book I really like, Emily Fang of NPR has a new [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4367.44s)]
*  book out called Let Only Red Flowers Bloom. And what she talks about, the changes in China as she [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4373.84s)]
*  was covering it from the mid 2010s on was, and I think this really is Xi Jinping's, one of his [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4382.72s)]
*  imprimaturers on the country, is there's a narrowing of spaces available for variations of ways of [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4390.88s)]
*  being Chinese within the country. And this goes against the grain of a pattern in the post Tiananmen [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4398.72s)]
*  period of allowing more space for civil society, but also allowing way Muslims felt that they [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4407.52s)]
*  didn't have to choose between their Muslim identity and their Chinese identity. But there's more and [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4416.4800000000005s)]
*  more of a kind of, we see this in Xi Jinping becoming impatient with Hong Kong, where there [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4422.0s)]
*  was a way of which, okay, this is a city that's part of the PRC, but it really operates very [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4429.12s)]
*  differently. He seems to be uncomfortable with difference, I guess, and he's not alone in strong [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4434.16s)]
*  man this way of sort of wanting to impose a kind of singular vision of what Chinese identity means, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4440.88s)]
*  what loyalty to the status quo means. And so there's been a kind of tightening of controls [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4449.36s)]
*  over all the borders. And even things, one thing Xi reported on was Mongolia and Inner Mongolia. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4456.88s)]
*  It had been seen as an unproblematic kind of frontier area and who cares if there was some [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4464.799999999999s)]
*  revival of Mongolian language, but under Xi, there's been a less patience with those kinds [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4470.5599999999995s)]
*  of difference. There's been more of a resurgence of patriarchy. All kinds of things have happened [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4477.68s)]
*  under him. But how much is it just him or how much is it also a kind of mood or group within the party? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4485.200000000001s)]
*  Some of these trends, I think, began before he took power in late 2012. I think really [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4495.200000000001s)]
*  my own feeling going to China fairly often from the mid 1990s till about 2018 was that until 2008, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4502.24s)]
*  the year of the Olympics, each trip it would feel like, oh, there's just more space. There's [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4513.44s)]
*  more breathing room for, it's not becoming a liberal democracy, but I would notice things [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4520.0s)]
*  that felt like, I'm surprised that that happens. People felt less worried about what they were [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4526.88s)]
*  saying and what they were doing, that kind of trend line up till about 2008. But from the Olympics [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4533.68s)]
*  and then the financial crisis after that, the Chinese Communist Party felt, I guess, more, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4543.28s)]
*  it's still insecure, but it felt cockier in some ways. And you had like, okay, maybe we can [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4550.64s)]
*  start asserting more control over things. So I think that's been stronger under Xi Jinping's [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4557.76s)]
*  time and power. And he was already the designated successor by 2008. He was in charge of security [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4563.360000000001s)]
*  for the Olympics. And the Olympics was supposed to be a moment, possibly, of more opening up because [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4573.12s)]
*  when Seoul hosted the Olympics, South Korea became a less tightly controlled right-wing [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4580.32s)]
*  dictatorship and moved toward democracy. And some people were hoping the Olympics [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4586.639999999999s)]
*  might move China that way. And it went quite the opposite. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4590.799999999999s)]
*  You mentioned that we don't know the degree to which this change has to do with Xi Jinping or [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4593.84s)]
*  the party apparatus. And that question, going back to Confucius of hierarchy and how does the power [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4600.4s)]
*  within this very strict one-party state work? What can we say? What do we know about the structure [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4608.24s)]
*  of this Communist Party apparatus? How much internal power struggle is there? How much [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4616.719999999999s)]
*  power does Xi Jinping actually have? Is there any insight we have into the system? [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4621.76s)]
*  So James Palmer, who worked in Beijing as a journalist and now is an editor at Foreign [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4627.76s)]
*  Policy, wrote an important piece a few years ago about just we should really be straight about what [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4633.28s)]
*  a black box the Chinese elite politics are and really not try to pretend we know more than we do. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4639.12s)]
*  We did used to have more of a sense of these kind of ideological factions, but also partly [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4647.92s)]
*  about different views of how much tinkering there should be with the economy and things like that. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4654.4s)]
*  And they were also partly based on personalities and personal ties. But we did have a sense. You [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4660.48s)]
*  could sort of map out these kinds of rival power bases and things. And we just have much less of [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4667.36s)]
*  a sense of that under Xi Jinping. It's very hard to know other than this sort of small group [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4674.719999999999s)]
*  around him, how it works. We don't have a major defector who says, yeah, this is how Xi Jinping. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4680.0s)]
*  We have Xi Jinping's self-presentation and a lot of things that are then said about him. There were [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4687.2s)]
*  some false expectations about him that some people thought, oh, he's going to be a reformer because [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4693.92s)]
*  his father was a liberalizing figure. That doesn't work that way. He does seem to care [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4699.44s)]
*  about orderliness. He does seem to care about certain things. He wants to present himself as a [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4704.96s)]
*  kind of scholarly figure in touch with China's deep past. We know he's a strong nationalist [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4710.48s)]
*  and a kind of cultural nationalist as well as political nationalist. But beyond that, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4716.88s)]
*  we don't have that much of a sense of what makes him tick. We get little hints. There was a secret [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4722.24s)]
*  speech that leaked out that he talked about how the Soviet Union had collapsed because [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4730.16s)]
*  the leadership didn't pay enough attention to ideology. And he also said that none of them [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4738.08s)]
*  were manly enough to keep control. So I imagine if he and Putin ever have a kind of heart to heart [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4743.68s)]
*  conversation, one thing they'd find to agree on is this sort of distaste for Gorbachev, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4752.4800000000005s)]
*  this feeling that Gorbachev was, that was the wrong way to do things. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4758.16s)]
*  Not manly enough? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4761.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, to not strong enough about really keeping control. And for Putin, it would be [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4762.72s)]
*  that it led to the Soviet Union, to the loss of an empire. But for Xi Jinping, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4769.52s)]
*  there is a bit of being haunted by what happened to the Soviet Union. And I'm not going to be the [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4774.240000000001s)]
*  leader who sees the diminishment of this landmass that was in a sense rebuilt over time for Mao [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4780.400000000001s)]
*  and then Deng Xiaoping. You have the story, a very powerful story about the Chinese past [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4792.240000000001s)]
*  that the Chinese Communist Party makes a lot out of. But the Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist Party [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4798.16s)]
*  was Mao's great rival, also made a lot out of. And it has a partial basis in fact, was that [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4804.48s)]
*  from the middle of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4810.16s)]
*  China, which had been this strong force in the world, got bullied and nibbled away at by foreign [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4814.639999999999s)]
*  powers. And it's important to realize there are elements of that story that are very true. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4819.68s)]
*  And the answer they had is that under my watch, that's not going to happen. And the reason why [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4825.6s)]
*  my party deserves to rule is because it can reassert China's place in the world. And both [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4831.6s)]
*  the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party predicated themselves on this kind of nationalistic [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4837.280000000001s)]
*  story of being in a position to prevent that from happening again. This is a bit of a tricky question, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4844.16s)]
*  but is it safe for journalists, for folks who write excellent books about the topic to travel [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4851.12s)]
*  to China? I think there are all kinds of different things about safety or not. I think until recently, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4861.5199999999995s)]
*  at least, the people who were most vulnerable were people of Chinese descent, people originally from [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4866.88s)]
*  China who had gone abroad and coming back, or even people who were Chinese Americans who went [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4875.6s)]
*  there. There was a higher sort of expectation that they should be on board. So you had early cases, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4881.84s)]
*  my friend Melissa Chan was an early person, kicked out when she was working for Al Jazeera [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4890.08s)]
*  and reporting on Xinjiang. So that's one kind of person who was vulnerable because of this expectation [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4895.76s)]
*  that they should be somehow more loyal. Another kind of person who was vulnerable, or in this case, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4902.32s)]
*  more likely to be blocked from China, the Communist Party is particularly concerned about people [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4908.5599999999995s)]
*  from outside of China who are amplifying the voices of people within China or exiles from China [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4916.88s)]
*  who the government would like to silence. So the Dalai Lama, you had scholars who worked on Tibet [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4923.599999999999s)]
*  and had connections to the Dalai Lama were early people to have trouble going to the PRC. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4929.84s)]
*  Then scholars who worked on Xinjiang and were connected to Uyghurs. But there also were people [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4935.4400000000005s)]
*  who were sort of personally connected to dissidents or exiles who would amplify their voices or [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4942.400000000001s)]
*  translate their work would promote them. That then it wasn't about necessarily danger if you got in [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4950.56s)]
*  China, but you were more likely to be denied a visa if you were the kind of person who was doing [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4957.76s)]
*  that. So I wrote critical op-eds about the Chinese Communist Party. I published them in some high [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4962.64s)]
*  profile places. I've written a lot about Tiananmen, wrote about human rights issues, all that. And I [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4970.56s)]
*  kept getting visas to go to China. I testified to a congressional executive joint committee on China [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4976.24s)]
*  about the Tiananmen protests on the 25th anniversary of it. And some people said, oh, that's the [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4982.4800000000005s)]
*  kind of thing that would lead to you not getting a visa. I got a visa right after that. Now I think [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4987.68s)]
*  it might be different. Now some of these expectations have been changed. There have been people who've [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4993.280000000001s)]
*  been very surprisingly gotten in trouble. These two Canadians who were clearly it was a kind of [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4998.56s)]
*  tit for tat partly because of Tech Maven's relative being held in Canada. So it was kind of there. It [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5006.240000000001s)]
*  was also not picking a fight with Americans, but there were certain kinds of things that you could [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5012.56s)]
*  map out what was the riskiest thing to do. And so I went in the 2010s having written forcefully [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5017.92s)]
*  about Tiananmen and I didn't feel dangerous. I mean, I felt there was an awareness in some cases [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5025.52s)]
*  of what if I was giving a public talk, there was awareness of what it was. There was sometimes [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5031.280000000001s)]
*  you didn't want to get your host who had brought you to a university in trouble by [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5036.96s)]
*  saying something that would get them in trouble. I think it was often that [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5043.2s)]
*  you were more vulnerable if you were within China or you were connected China in different ways. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5047.599999999999s)]
*  For me, it's been confusing these last few years. I wrote one piece about this about I'm not going [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5052.96s)]
*  to any part of the PRC for the time being, but I always thought that Hong Kong was a place that [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5058.48s)]
*  I'd be free to go even if things got difficult. I didn't get a visa for the mainland. You didn't [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5064.32s)]
*  need a visa for Hong Kong. But with Hong Kong, with the mainland, I had kept a kind of distance [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5068.639999999999s)]
*  from the dissidents that I was writing about. With Hong Kong, I felt that these rules kind of [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5077.2s)]
*  didn't apply and I was more connected to them, more friends with some of them. And then with this [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5082.88s)]
*  crackdown that's come on Hong Kong and their exiles from Hong Kong who have bounties on their [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5092.16s)]
*  heads. And so now I feel that it's not necessarily that anything would happen to me if I went to Hong [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5097.2s)]
*  Kong, but I feel I would be very closely watched. And so I wouldn't want to meet with some of my [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5102.72s)]
*  friends there who aren't the side profile. So I don't want to go to a place where [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5107.92s)]
*  I would feel that I was toxic in some way. Right. One, you're walking on eggshells and two, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5114.08s)]
*  you can get others in trouble. That kind of dynamic is complicated. So it's fascinating [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5119.92s)]
*  that Hong Kong is now part of that calculus. So I've gotten the chance to speak to a bunch [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5124.8s)]
*  of world leaders. Do you think it's possible that I would be able to do an interview with Xi Jinping? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5130.16s)]
*  If you do, I would be very pleased because I could watch that interview and get some insights about [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5136.96s)]
*  Xi, which have been very hard to get. I mean, they're really difficult. There have been very few [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5144.8s)]
*  discussions. He doesn't meet with, he doesn't give press conferences. There's a variety of things. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5154.16s)]
*  And this is different from some of his predecessors. Jiang Zemin famously was interviewed [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5157.76s)]
*  by Barbara Walters and asked about Tiananmen. And he tried to make out that it wasn't a big deal. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5165.6s)]
*  There are a variety of things, but he had relatively spontaneous conversation. I was going to say, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5171.92s)]
*  he's the only Chinese leader I've met, but I met him before he was a major, major leader. He was the [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5178.08s)]
*  party secretary or mayor of Shanghai. It matters because the party secretary is the more important [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5185.04s)]
*  role. But anyway, he just met with a group of foreign scholars who were going over to [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5190.4s)]
*  Shanghai in 88 for a conference on Shanghai history. And just to show you the limits of [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5195.84s)]
*  anybody who thinks they can predict what's going on in Chinese politics, or I mean, predictability [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5201.12s)]
*  is just very hard in general in the world. But I think the consensus among us, and these were some [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5206.16s)]
*  of the most knowledgeable foreign scholars on China, was this was somebody who really had probably [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5212.16s)]
*  topped out because he was meeting with us. He must not be heading anywhere up. And then after [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5218.24s)]
*  Tiananmen, he becomes the top leader in China. But he had a kind of, you could pick things out [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5224.8s)]
*  from being in a room. He liked to kind of show off his kind of cosmopolitanism. Xi Jinping talks, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5232.0s)]
*  gives these speeches about all the foreign authors he likes and has read, but it's all very [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5239.52s)]
*  kind of scripted, at least in his own head too. It's very carefully done to present a certain [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5244.88s)]
*  image of himself. And we really don't get many senses of what he's like in unguarded moments [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5252.32s)]
*  or has them. And sometimes we get the illusion of them. There was an image of him and Obama [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5258.639999999999s)]
*  in their shirt sleeves at a Sunnylands meeting. And the photo would show them [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5266.48s)]
*  walking and talking, but there's no translator in the image. And so you're like, how are they [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5272.96s)]
*  talking? What language are they using? How is this? Or is it just a kind of, I mean, there are, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5278.08s)]
*  of course, there are exchanges with top leaders and Trump will say they're friends or [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5284.48s)]
*  these kinds of things, or there's a language of Xi Jinping can talk about somebody or some country [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5289.6s)]
*  being friend, but we don't have a sense of these kinds of the, what makes him tick as a person. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5295.28s)]
*  So maybe you should ask him about Ernest Hemingway and see if he really gets excited about him. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5301.68s)]
*  Because in the kind of generic things, he talks about all these. You can feel him sort of ticking [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5307.2s)]
*  things off about, oh yes, I'm glad to be in England, the country of Shakespeare and this, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5312.88s)]
*  and he goes off these set things. But Hemingway, there's some sense that he had some special [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5318.0s)]
*  feeling, which fits in with some of the macho side that would be interesting. He doesn't mention [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5325.28s)]
*  Orwell as one of his favorite British authors as much. He says he likes Victor Hugo a lot. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5331.28s)]
*  And that became a little tricky because Do You Hear the People Sing from Les Miserables became [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5337.28s)]
*  one of the really, one of the protest songs in Hong Kong. And how do you get in this position [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5342.719999999999s)]
*  where you, and actually, Victor Hugo is a rare Western author who's had a pretty steadily positive [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5348.72s)]
*  image in China, even under periods of criticism of all Western authors problematic. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5360.64s)]
*  Because Victor Hugo famously wrote a statement denouncing the European destruction of the Old [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5368.240000000001s)]
*  Summer Palace in Beijing in 1860, the end of the Second Opium War. He said, how can we claim to be [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5377.04s)]
*  civilized when we've destroyed one of the great creations of civilization? So that kind of made [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5383.92s)]
*  him a kind of long-term friend to the Chinese nation. Mark Twain has had a pretty good reputation [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5390.0s)]
*  because he was a critic of American imperialism. But anyway, I think if you do get to talk to Xi [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5396.08s)]
*  Jinping, talk to him about Ernest Hemingway and Victor Hugo, and I'll be curious to see if those [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5403.04s)]
*  were the ones who really resonated. One of the things, and it's a strange thing that I've become [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5409.5199999999995s)]
*  aware of, having spoken with world leaders, I'm distinctly aware that there's a real possibility [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5414.4s)]
*  that the black box we mentioned, that the Communist Party of China will [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5421.84s)]
*  listen to the words I'm saying now. And so I have to wonder how much that affects [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5428.16s)]
*  my possible tourist-like trip to China. Because there's a difference between sort of an influencer [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5437.68s)]
*  that does fun things, plays video games, and goes over to China. And somebody that actually covers [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5444.4s)]
*  China to some degree, whether critical or supportive or nuanced or any kind of way, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5449.84s)]
*  in the full spectrum of ideas you can have about China, including Chinese history, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5456.160000000001s)]
*  whether that's going to be seen carefully, analyzed carefully, and have repercussions [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5460.240000000001s)]
*  when you travel. And because of the black box nature, and because it's for me personally, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5470.4800000000005s)]
*  just a culture that's very different than anything I'm familiar with, it makes me a bit nervous. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5476.64s)]
*  It's certainly gotten harder for journalists to operate in China. There was a way in which now [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5483.6s)]
*  journalists will look back to the early 2000s, and it was really quite extraordinary what they could [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5493.44s)]
*  do. Well, you have a lot of listeners. I mean, I think there isn't that tight a watching of what [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5500.08s)]
*  an academic writes about the Chinese Communist Party. But there are certain things that clearly [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5508.72s)]
*  are kind of tightly policed. And one is discussions of the private life of Chinese leaders and their [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5515.2s)]
*  families, and issues of kind of really following money trails for corruption and things like that. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5522.88s)]
*  So there was the case of the Hong Kong booksellers who were kidnapped. And one of them is still in a [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5530.56s)]
*  Chinese prison. He would be a good example of this, Gui-Min Hai, the kind of person who was [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5537.44s)]
*  vulnerable. He was born in China. He is a Swedish citizen, and he was spirited out of Thailand into [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5542.24s)]
*  the mainland. And the reason why he was on the radar of the Communist Party was because [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5550.32s)]
*  the publishing house in Hong Kong that he was connected to was publishing works about the top [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5558.16s)]
*  tier of the Chinese Communist Party and contradicting the kind of vision of them as a [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5564.24s)]
*  certain kind of moral exemplars. And that's different from writing things about China has [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5570.32s)]
*  a bad human rights record or something like that in ways like I did. These were books that were [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5576.8s)]
*  expos√©s, or some of them kind of gossipy and lightly sourced, some of them much more serious. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5583.76s)]
*  But they were about something that the Communist Party leadership wants to make a no-go zone. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5590.72s)]
*  And I thought sometimes that Xi Jinping seems to have Lei's majesty envy. I don't think it's kind [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5596.48s)]
*  of general criticisms of the Chinese Communist Party as an authoritarian structure or place that [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5602.88s)]
*  doesn't deserve to rule in kind of very general terms. I don't think that's something that [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5614.8s)]
*  they then pick you up at the border and say, no, we can't let that person in because people are [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5619.360000000001s)]
*  let in. And it's not rational. It's not a rational process. There are people who've been denied [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5625.280000000001s)]
*  visas. It seems pretty inexplicable. There are things that now I think the rules are changing [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5631.92s)]
*  very quickly all over the world for kinds of what's safe to say and do. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5638.320000000001s)]
*  Well, either way, I do know that the Communist Party and likely Xi Jinping himself watched [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5646.08s)]
*  my conversation with Prime Minister Modi. They responded to it. And I do hope and I will [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5652.5599999999995s)]
*  definitely go to China. And I hope to talk to Xi Jinping. It's a fascinating, historic, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5659.92s)]
*  ancient culture and is the major player on the world stage in the 21st century. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5666.24s)]
*  And it would be fascinating to understand the mind of the leader of that great superpower. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5673.6s)]
*  Speaking of leaders, what do we understand about the relationship between Xi Jinping [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5681.92s)]
*  and our current president of the United States, Donald Trump? Is there really a human connection, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5687.2s)]
*  something approximating a friendship as they've spoken about? Or is it just purely [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5692.4800000000005s)]
*  a reality, a reality of politics maneuvering world leaders playing a game of chess? Or is it a bit [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5698.4s)]
*  of both? There's a degree to which I think there's some confusion about a couple things. I mean, one [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5704.799999999999s)]
*  is when there's a sense that Trump is sort of uniquely tough on the Chinese Communist Party, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5709.599999999999s)]
*  he has periodically said things about praising Xi Jinping as a leader, even sort of having [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5720.96s)]
*  praising Xi Jinping's strength and things. So I think for some ways, for the personality cult of [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5728.0s)]
*  Xi Jinping, some of this is kind of useful because the story that the Chinese Communist Party, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5733.679999999999s)]
*  they need to tell a story about why they deserve to keep ruling. And one of their stories is that [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5743.12s)]
*  because the world is a dangerous place and there's not enough respect for China, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5747.84s)]
*  so when there's very tough talk about China coming out of the White House, that's useful. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5753.360000000001s)]
*  And then the other part is about Xi Jinping being just the right person to have at the helm. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5759.92s)]
*  And when there are discussions, when there's praise for him and his showing toughness, that [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5766.16s)]
*  also works well. So I think the argument among at least some China specialists is to say the [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5772.160000000001s)]
*  Chinese Communist Party likes predictability and Xi Jinping seems to like predictability in particular. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5780.56s)]
*  And Donald Trump clearly isn't a predictable figure. So there might be a way in which [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5787.120000000001s)]
*  this is unsettling. But I think the other part of it is the Chinese Communist Party wants [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5795.04s)]
*  under Xi Jinping. Xi Jinping wants to gain more allies around the world, to be seen with more [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5801.84s)]
*  respect around the world, and at the moment is in a position where he can present himself as an [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5809.76s)]
*  orderly, thoughtful, gradualist figure. In some ways, I think, as much as there's tension between [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5819.120000000001s)]
*  between the two capitals, there's a way that things are going in a way that benefits Xi [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5829.76s)]
*  Jinping and can see good. That doesn't explain what their personal relationship is and how they [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5836.08s)]
*  actually see each other when they're in the room together. And whether that matters or it's a part [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5842.08s)]
*  of the calculus at all, because after all, they are leaders of superpowers. I think for Trump, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5846.96s)]
*  it matters. Personal relationships matter. But of course, we see a lot. We know a lot about Donald [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5853.28s)]
*  Trump. We know a lot about the White House. And for actually, let me just say as a tangent, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5860.4s)]
*  for whatever you think about this particular White House, one of the things I really like [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5866.799999999999s)]
*  is that every single member of the cabinet is willing to talk for many hours [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5873.5199999999995s)]
*  every single week, talk about what they think, how they see the world, explain Donald Trump's [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5878.48s)]
*  approach. It doesn't matter if you disagree with what they're saying. Maybe you say they're [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5886.959999999999s)]
*  dishonest, maybe you're misrepresenting, but there's a lot of information. That's something [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5891.839999999999s)]
*  we don't have with China. And as a fan of history, for me, and as a fan of sort of [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5896.639999999999s)]
*  deep political analysis of the world, it makes me sad because it's a very asymmetrical amount of [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5903.04s)]
*  information. But anyway, let me, if I can, lay out this particular complexity wherein now this trade [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5910.4800000000005s)]
*  war between US and China. Now, you're not an economist. In fact, so you think deeply about [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5919.68s)]
*  history of peoples and history of China. You think about culture, you think about protests and the [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5927.36s)]
*  movements and so on. And there's some degree to which this trade war is less about the economics. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5931.839999999999s)]
*  Now that layer is also very important that we could discuss it. But there's also [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5939.5199999999995s)]
*  a deeply cultural standoff almost happening here, which would be interesting. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5946.4s)]
*  So in April, as people know, Trump escalated a trade war with Chinese in tariffs, raising them [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5954.4800000000005s)]
*  on Chinese imports to 145%. Xi Jinping then responded by raising tariffs on US goods [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5960.240000000001s)]
*  to 125% and suspending exports on certain rare earth minerals and magnets to the US. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5967.92s)]
*  The Chinese government also indicated it would limit the import of Hollywood food to the US. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5976.64s)]
*  It would limit the import of Hollywood films and restricted certain American companies from [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5982.24s)]
*  operating in China. Now, after that, Xi Jinping broke silence on April 11th and again on April 14th [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5986.0s)]
*  and since basically saying that China is not backing down and positioned himself in China as [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5994.4s)]
*  the quote responsible superpower that promotes, as you were saying, the promoter of the reasonable [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6001.12s)]
*  multilateral global trading framework and a stable global supply chain. He said, quote, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6008.08s)]
*  for over 70 years, China's progress has been built on self-reliance and hard work, [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6013.84s)]
*  never on handoffs from others, and it remains unafraid of any unjust oppression. Also, he said, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6020.16s)]
*  there are no winners in a trade war and going against the world will only lead to self-isolation. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6027.76s)]
*  This was all said as part of a tour of Southeast Asia and he was calling on China and the European [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6034.16s)]
*  Union to defend international rules opposing, quote, unilateral bullying. At the same time, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6040.639999999999s)]
*  I saw that China is escalating internal propaganda, including, interestingly, it would be [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6048.08s)]
*  nice to talk to you about it, the use of the Mao Zedong 1953 speech during the Korean War, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6054.08s)]
*  where he says, we will never yield. My question is, with this standoff, [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6059.84s)]
*  who do you think will blink first? Where does this go? [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6066.16s)]
*  There's a lot to unpack there of a historian too. I think that the reference to being bullied by a [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6071.92s)]
*  foreign power is something that comes up periodically and plays to this notion of [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6082.72s)]
*  the 100 years of national humiliation that's been talked about by generations now of Chinese leaders. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6089.92s)]
*  To talk about that period from the 1840s to the 1940s, there were a group of foreign powers who [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6096.08s)]
*  were involved in bullying China in one way or another and you can selectively pick one or [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6102.64s)]
*  another. There is a way in which this can be and if Xi Jinping gives that kind of speech in [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6107.12s)]
*  Southeast Asia, he's speaking to a place where there is knowledge of times of the past [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6114.48s)]
*  when the United States was an aggressive force there. It's also a part of the world where there [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6122.08s)]
*  have been times when China has been that. There is a way of positioning vis-a-vis other parts of the [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6128.32s)]
*  world that is crucial part of this. I'm circling around it, but there's a tendency in discussions [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6136.56s)]
*  of US-China relations to think about it in terms of a bilateral discussion or dispute, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6144.080000000001s)]
*  even though time and again we realize that places other than the United States are key variables [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6152.400000000001s)]
*  in these things. The US and China being at odds in the Mao era, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6160.8s)]
*  what changed things dramatically for that wasn't so much even a change in, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6169.68s)]
*  I mean, yes, Nixon was the one who went to China, but what made it possible for Nixon to go to China [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6176.56s)]
*  was that the Sino-Soviet split happened, that actually it was tensions between China and the [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6182.08s)]
*  Soviet Union that altered equations for the United States and China. I happened to be in China [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6187.52s)]
*  in 1999 when NATO bombs hit the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and three Chinese citizens died, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6195.84s)]
*  and there was tremendous discontent about that, anger about that within China. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6202.56s)]
*  There were some rare protests that the government allowed to happen, but students were worked up [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6208.240000000001s)]
*  about it and there were protests outside the American embassy and the British embassy. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6213.76s)]
*  That happened and then in 2001 there was a spy plane incident that happened. There was a lot [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6219.92s)]
*  of discussion that the next decade was going to see US-China tensions being the major force in the [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6225.52s)]
*  world. 9-11 happened. It was a dramatic reset for the trajectory that the US and China were on, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6233.360000000001s)]
*  which is these are two totally different things, the Sino-Soviet split and 9-11, [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6242.32s)]
*  but in both cases, no matter how careful you were at parsing what was likely to be the next five [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6246.32s)]
*  years for US-China relations, get dramatically changed by something that happened that wasn't [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6254.5599999999995s)]
*  the US and China. In the current situation, the trade war, I know that it will be very important [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6260.4s)]
*  that China can try to increase sales of consumer products to Europe. This is something that [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6268.96s)]
*  Europe's view about the United States is changing right now. These are all kinds of variables that [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6277.36s)]
*  are outside of simply Washington and Beijing as being the two actors. Sometimes Beijing can't [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6282.4s)]
*  control what's happening outside and sometimes Washington can't. I guess this is simply saying [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6289.2s)]
*  that when you're watching and you're trying to keep the eye on the ball, it matters a lot [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6296.8s)]
*  what India's relationship to China and the United States is. All of these are happening there. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6301.76s)]
*  I think that's it, that it's both tremendously important what's going on between China and the [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6309.92s)]
*  United States, but it's important to remember that they're not the only players in this dynamic. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6316.0s)]
*  Also, on top of this, how much cultural will is there to not surrender to bullying? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6323.5199999999995s)]
*  How much of that is there? Like you said, the century of humiliation, both for Xi Jinping and [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6332.8s)]
*  the Chinese populace, like willingness to go through some short-term pain to not be humiliated. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6339.28s)]
*  The story that's been intensively told about the past is something that provides the possibility [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6346.4s)]
*  for this to matter a lot. It's so much a part of the legitimating story of the Chinese Communist [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6355.36s)]
*  Party. Then you have to look at are there things that are happening that aid the Chinese Communist [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6366.5599999999995s)]
*  Party story. The rise of what can seem like or is anti-Chinese sentiment within the United States [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6373.2s)]
*  can feed that propaganda story. Certainly, during COVID, there was a way that [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6385.44s)]
*  if you're the Chinese Communist Party and you're saying, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6396.8s)]
*  we get a disproportionate amount of blame for whatever happens in the world, then [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6399.28s)]
*  if there were things you could point to in the foreign media or from foreign governments, [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6403.44s)]
*  then that helps you. I think there is a setup here where certainly for Xi Jinping, I think the [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6408.48s)]
*  desire to not be seen weak is crucial. Sometimes I wonder how much of these leaders [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6416.96s)]
*  operate on pure ego because politically and on a human level, they don't want to come off as losers [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6423.36s)]
*  in a standoff versus coming to an economic win-win for both nations. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6431.599999999999s)]
*  And I worry that there is a real pride here that the center of humiliation has deeply saturated [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6439.52s)]
*  the populace, the Communist Party, this idea where they're just not going to back down. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6455.280000000001s)]
*  And that I think will cause tremendous pain in the short term for the United States, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6463.28s)]
*  I think for China and the world because it completely transforms the supply chain of [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6470.879999999999s)]
*  everything. There is a global nature. There is a multilateral nature of all the economic [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6477.919999999999s)]
*  partnerships that are formed throughout the 21st century. And this protectionist, nationalistic [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6483.679999999999s)]
*  ideology goes in the face of all of that. And it's going to create a huge amount of pain for [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6491.200000000001s)]
*  regular Americans. But also I worry that this increase is not decreases the chance of a global [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6498.8s)]
*  war or conflict of different kinds. Do you see a hopeful possibility for resolution, for de-escalation [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6506.64s)]
*  here? It's a hard time to figure out what you can to sort of hopeful angles. I mean, I guess [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6515.52s)]
*  what's hard to even balance these things out. So one of the things that I've thought about when [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6529.040000000001s)]
*  you talk about rising chances of war that often Taiwan comes to mind with China. And one of the [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6533.040000000001s)]
*  things that I've thought of is that for Xi Jinping that military action against Taiwan [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6540.32s)]
*  would be increased by a sense of desperation, a sense of losing popularity or a sense of [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6549.759999999999s)]
*  not having a good story to tell about why he and the party deserves to lead. So then there's a kind [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6558.96s)]
*  of way of playing to the nationalist sentiments of some part of the population. So then in a sense [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6565.52s)]
*  it's hopeful that I think in some ways right now Xi Jinping is not looking desperate in the eyes [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6573.68s)]
*  of the world. If he can focus on potentially being seen more positively in other parts of the world [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6581.040000000001s)]
*  by seeming like a kind of force for stability, seen as somebody who's supporting rather than [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6591.04s)]
*  challenging some elements of the global order, that might lessen the chances of a rash action [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6598.72s)]
*  toward Taiwan that would be a kind of desperation move. The complicated thing here is that if he [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6608.48s)]
*  gives in, he can come off as the responsible person who cares about the world or he can come [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6615.76s)]
*  off weak. If he doesn't give in and even escalates the tariffs, although I think he said no more [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6623.68s)]
*  escalation on the China front, then he comes off strong but also the equally unreasonable person [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6629.76s)]
*  who doesn't care about the world, who only cares about his own ego and maybe some aspect of the [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6639.36s)]
*  Communist Party maintaining power. Because just like with Tiananmen Square and the Tank Man, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6647.839999999999s)]
*  you don't know once you make the decision how the world will read that decision, what kind of things [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6652.639999999999s)]
*  will become viral memes about the telling of that story. And of course in part I think Donald Trump's [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6661.04s)]
*  reach is much wider because he's constantly out there and I think there's a more reserved less [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6669.12s)]
*  messaging out of Beijing. So it's a really chaotic environment in which to make strong decisions. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6675.599999999999s)]
*  But since you brought it up, we'll talk about Hong Kong but let's talk about Taiwan and maybe [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6683.599999999999s)]
*  there's some parallels there. Given Xi Jinping's emphasis on the great rejuvenation of the Chinese [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6690.08s)]
*  nation and the unification with Taiwan being a crucial part of his vision for China, [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6696.16s)]
*  what do you think are the chances and how willing is he to use force to [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6705.04s)]
*  annex to forceably gain control over Taiwan in the coming years? [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6711.2s)]
*  I'll frame it in a way that I think does lead into talking about Hong Kong because I think these are [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6715.5199999999995s)]
*  connected issues. In 1984, when the year, not the book this time, that's when a deal was struck [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6720.56s)]
*  basically between London and Beijing over what would happen to Hong Kong. So Hong Kong Island [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6728.64s)]
*  became a British colony at the end of the first Opium War, the 1840s and then Kowloon Peninsula [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6738.160000000001s)]
*  near there became a British colony in 1860 after the second Opium War. But then there was a large [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6744.56s)]
*  amount of territory of what we now think of as Hong Kong called the New Territories that became [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6751.76s)]
*  under British control in 1898 but was not a colony. It was a 99-year lease. So 1997 was this kind of [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6756.400000000001s)]
*  expiration date for the lease of this large amount of territory of what we now think of as Hong Kong. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6766.96s)]
*  It's a large amount of territory that the rest of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6773.2s)]
*  depend on for energy, water, and food. So it would have been very hard to just give back, [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6778.24s)]
*  give those parts, transfer those parts to the People's Republic of China. So a deal needed to [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6784.96s)]
*  be struck of what would happen in 1997. And the deal was about transferring sovereignty of all of [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6790.0s)]
*  Hong Kong, all these parts to the People's Republic of China. And I carefully say transfer [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6798.32s)]
*  sovereignty, not give it back to the People's Republic of China because it never belonged to [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6804.719999999999s)]
*  People's Republic of China. It was part of the Qing Empire, which was a different country, [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6808.32s)]
*  a different state than then. Anyway, but this needed to be transferred. And the deal that was [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6814.0s)]
*  struck was that the London side wanted to do something to protect what was going to happen to [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6821.12s)]
*  the people there. And remember, this is not what usually happens to colonies. Colonies usually go [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6828.88s)]
*  from being part of an empire to being some degree of self-governed. And because of that, the Chinese [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6835.04s)]
*  representative at the UN insisted that Hong Kong was not a colony and Macau was not a colony [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6841.5199999999995s)]
*  because then they would have to be decolonized and go to independent. But so anyway, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6846.56s)]
*  there was an understanding that something would have to happen in 1997 and London wanted some [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6851.360000000001s)]
*  protection for the people in Hong Kong who they knew were living in a very different way than [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6856.400000000001s)]
*  people lived under Communist Party rule. There was a different kind of rule of law. There wasn't [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6864.8s)]
*  democracy, but there was some degree of input in governance. The colonial authority and the [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6870.8s)]
*  power, most powerful person in Hong Kong was appointed by London. After 1997, the most powerful [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6878.4800000000005s)]
*  person would probably have to be somebody who could work with Beijing. But in this negotiation, [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6886.08s)]
*  something was come up with called One Country, Two Systems. And Hong Kong would become part of [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6892.400000000001s)]
*  the People's Republic of China in diplomatic terms. It wouldn't have its own military, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6897.6s)]
*  but it would have its own system for 50 years was the idea from 1997 until 2047. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6902.96s)]
*  There was a tension from the beginning over what that other system, what was going to be the part [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6911.200000000001s)]
*  that was going to be separate. And clearly everybody agreed it would need to have a different [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6916.72s)]
*  economic system. It had capitalism. So people agreed on that, but there was tension from the [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6920.64s)]
*  start of, well, what about legal? What about cultural and other things? And things were [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6926.8s)]
*  written into this deal, which would be over time, Hong Kong people would govern Hong Kong. But Beijing [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6932.08s)]
*  thought they would govern Hong Kong, but it would be a Hong Kong person who Beijing played a role [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6938.400000000001s)]
*  in choosing. But the reason why Taiwan is relevant to all this is in 1984, as they were discussing [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6944.88s)]
*  this, the Chinese Communist Party said, and we'll come up with this arrangement and people in Taiwan [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6952.0s)]
*  should pay attention to it because it could provide a model for what could happen with them [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6957.36s)]
*  being absorbed into the People's Republic of China. So the idea was Beijing said, hey, people in [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6962.64s)]
*  Taiwan, watch what happens to Hong Kong after 1997 and think about it as a model for what could [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6970.0s)]
*  happen for you saying like, watch how smoothly it will go. Over time, people in Hong Kong, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6976.08s)]
*  people in Hong Kong started saying, well, wait, Beijing keeps sort of nibbling away at chipping [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6984.24s)]
*  away at these things that make us separate. And especially after 2008, especially I mean, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6989.36s)]
*  there were reasons why Beijing went especially light on Hong Kong early, after 1997. They wanted [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=6995.36s)]
*  to join Beijing, wanted to join WTO, they wanted to host the Olympics, a big move against Hong Kong [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7003.36s)]
*  then could have endangered those things. Also at that point, the PRC was dependent, heavily dependent [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7008.5599999999995s)]
*  on economics in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong economy. Also just something because I'm a university [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7015.92s)]
*  person, in 1997, when Hong Kong became part of the People's Republic of China, then Hong Kong [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7022.5599999999995s)]
*  universities were the only universities in the PRC that were considered totally world-class. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7029.36s)]
*  Hong Kong University and Chinese University of Hong Kong were highly rated institutions. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7034.639999999999s)]
*  And at that point, Peking University, Beijing, Beida and Tsinghua were not yet considered [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7039.44s)]
*  world-class institutions because they didn't have the kind of economic freedom [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7045.5199999999995s)]
*  and humanities that was at that point needed to be higher ratings. Over time, that difference [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7049.759999999999s)]
*  started to go away because global ratings of universities stopped caring as much about [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7057.52s)]
*  academic freedom and things like that. And Beijing universities surpassed Hong Kong ones. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7063.280000000001s)]
*  So by the 2010s, when you started to have these protests in Hong Kong, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7068.080000000001s)]
*  pushing back against what was called mainlandization and sort of clamping down, [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7072.88s)]
*  Hong Kong protesters in 2014 put up a banner at the time when Beijing was holding the line against [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7078.4800000000005s)]
*  Hong Kong people wanting to have real elections to choose the chief executive rather than a kind of [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7086.24s)]
*  one where there were elections, but only people who Beijing approved of basically could run. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7093.2s)]
*  Hong Kong activists put up a banner saying, hey, Taiwan, look at Hong Kong. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7099.599999999999s)]
*  Taiwan, beware. Hong Kong's today could be Taiwan's tomorrow. So basically spinning the [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7103.759999999999s)]
*  one country, two systems argument and saying, yeah, Taiwan, you should watch what happens here. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7110.48s)]
*  One way to think of Chinese leaders since Mao is that Mao and those after him wanted to [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7118.799999999999s)]
*  make China bigger territorially than it had been to try to reclaim land. Under Mao, [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7126.639999999999s)]
*  the Tibet which had been not part of China became part of the People's Republic of China. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7132.959999999999s)]
*  Mao offered something a little bit like one country, two systems to it. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7141.599999999999s)]
*  Isabel Hilton, who writes wonderfully about Tibet, has talked about the parallels with the [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7146.719999999999s)]
*  Hong Kong system. And some Hong Kong activists saw parallels as well. Tibet was supposed to go its [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7150.799999999999s)]
*  own way as part of the People's Republic of China in the 1950s. And then by 1959, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7156.88s)]
*  the center got restless, tried to interfere more, local people pushed back against it. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7163.2s)]
*  And a workable, what seemed like it might work out somehow against all odds, explodes. The Dalai Lama [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7169.76s)]
*  goes into exile. The Dalai Lama who before that had thought maybe he and Mao could work [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7177.52s)]
*  together, that didn't work. Hong Kong, a new version of the experiment happens. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7182.32s)]
*  It becomes clear in the 2010s that it's not really workable, that the center is less patient, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7188.48s)]
*  needs Hong Kong less. The Hong Kong people feel it's more of a sort of now or never period to [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7194.96s)]
*  push back. You could say that Deng Xiaoping oversaw the deal that got Hong Kong and Macau [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7201.2s)]
*  to become part of the People's Republic of China. He could point to that, even though he died right [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7207.76s)]
*  before 1990s and during 1997. But he had achieved that kind of deal. Xi Jinping could argue, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7213.68s)]
*  you could argue he finished the deal of making Hong Kong fully a part of the People's Republic [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7223.76s)]
*  of China, doing away with this degree of difference. And you could say that that then is a stepping [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7229.360000000001s)]
*  stone toward Taiwan. Or you could say that that in the South China Sea islands build up [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7235.76s)]
*  might be enough for him to put his stamp on having been the kind of leader who expanded [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7243.4400000000005s)]
*  Beijing's reach. He probably wants both. I mean, he probably to the extent he would like Taiwan [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7249.360000000001s)]
*  to become part of the People's Republic of China, which it has never been. But the hope was it could [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7255.4400000000005s)]
*  happen through a kind of more gradual absorption and people in Taiwan being willing to think of [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7262.48s)]
*  that. And yet, in part because of what's happened to places like Hong Kong, there's a fiercer, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7268.719999999999s)]
*  a stronger sense of Taiwan identity now than there was at an earlier point. And less parties that are [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7274.799999999999s)]
*  more willing to try to negotiate some kind of tighter connection to the PRC are often doing [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7281.839999999999s)]
*  badly and elections there because of this of this mood. 2047 is 50 years from the 1997 [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7290.8s)]
*  handover that you were talking about with Hong Kong. On top of that, 2049 is 100 years [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7300.320000000001s)]
*  from Mao taking power. It feels like at that moment, China could take Taiwan, because it does [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7307.12s)]
*  seem that there's a kind of value for history in China and they take these days very seriously. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7312.88s)]
*  On the other hand, as you have studied, there is some tensions and displeasure and protests, [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7319.92s)]
*  some of the biggest in human history in Hong Kong. And so like put all that together, and so many [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7327.2s)]
*  possible trajectories of human history could happen here. Yeah, I mean, I'm particularly [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7334.32s)]
*  interested in youth movements. And one of the things about I think generation is such an important [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7338.8s)]
*  factor. And people know that generation is important, but somehow sometimes people think [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7345.76s)]
*  that if you divide people up into economic groups, you divide people up into racial or ethnic [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7352.88s)]
*  class, that that somehow is more tangible. But I think with things like the Hong Kong protests, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7357.360000000001s)]
*  that there was a process of what was seen as mainlitization of Beijing just moving to [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7363.2s)]
*  make the things that were really distinctive about Hong Kong less distinctive and minimizing [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7372.48s)]
*  the differences. And this process sped up dramatically after the 2019 protests. And there [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7377.76s)]
*  was just partly with the distraction of COVID and the distraction of the world, there was this [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7385.36s)]
*  imposition of this national security law that basically did away with the differences. And you [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7390.4s)]
*  had some people in the city of an older generation saying like, why couldn't they have just been more [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7396.32s)]
*  patient? Why did these protests force the hand of the people in power? But I think that [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7404.32s)]
*  age has a lot to do with it, that if there was this kind of gradual erosion or there was going [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7413.92s)]
*  to be this process of doing away with the things that made Hong Kong really special, and that people [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7418.24s)]
*  loved passionately about it, including this sort of freer, I mean, freer press or just freer [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7424.16s)]
*  associational life and things like that. If you were 17 in 2019, and people were saying by [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7430.08s)]
*  2047, it will all be gone, or maybe it'll even be gone in 10 years, then you're talking about [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7440.24s)]
*  living most of your life in a Hong Kong that isn't the Hong Kong you really love. Whereas if you were [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7446.48s)]
*  80, you were like, why can't they be patient? And people in between had all kinds of other things. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7452.88s)]
*  This is one thing that leads to often kind of logically, there's a rationality toward younger [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7458.56s)]
*  people being more militant about certain kinds of things. I think we see the same thing with [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7465.76s)]
*  climate change, with climate activism. You're talking about whatever projection is of when [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7470.56s)]
*  things are going to get worse further down, the younger you are, the more of your life is going [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7476.16s)]
*  to live in that scenario. And there's a logic for more of that kind of impatience. There's also a [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7481.12s)]
*  sense of frustration with an older generation not having done enough to sort of resolve issues. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7489.12s)]
*  These are things with Hong Kong, with climate change, with Thailand, the place that I've been [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7496.0s)]
*  working on lately. One of the slogans in 2020 when there was a push for democracy was, let it end [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7502.08s)]
*  with this generation, which again expressed this kind of sense of gradual solutions are fine, but [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7508.56s)]
*  we're carrying more of a burden of what we're going to live with there than that. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7517.84s)]
*  So in 2019, also the protests, I mean, some of the things that were being chipped away at by Beijing [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7521.84s)]
*  in 2012, there was an effort to impose mainland style patriotic education. It seemed like, well, [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7529.120000000001s)]
*  who cares how civics is taught? But actually that has a lot to do with the larger kind of [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7535.12s)]
*  political story. And the protesters that year, young people stood up and actually got the [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7540.72s)]
*  government to blink, the local authorities back down on that bringing in mainland style education. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7545.84s)]
*  2014, the protest was to try to get full voting rights for the chief executive. The government [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7551.5199999999995s)]
*  didn't blink on that. That was something where they held the line. It was a big, colorful, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7559.28s)]
*  exciting protest, but in the end it hit a dead end. 2019, there are even bigger protests. And at [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7564.88s)]
*  first it seems like surprising what the issue was. The issue was an extradition law that would have [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7571.84s)]
*  people potentially who committed crimes in Hong Kong being tried for them if the mainland wanted [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7580.16s)]
*  them on the mainland. Now the difference, the really different court systems, Hong Kong never [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7586.56s)]
*  had a democracy under the British, but it did have a stronger rule of law and more independent [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7591.92s)]
*  courts, courts that sometimes decided things that went the other way than what the government wanted. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7598.160000000001s)]
*  And the mainland doesn't have that kind of court system, 98, 99% conviction rate. In Hong Kong, [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7605.84s)]
*  if you're arrested even before 2020, if you were arrested even under a politically related charge, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7614.56s)]
*  you were out on bail and giving interviews with the press on the mainland. That didn't happen. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7621.200000000001s)]
*  So I think in 2019, even having lost the battle over voting, this idea that, okay, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7626.96s)]
*  we've really got to take a last stand to defend the rule of law and a degree of separation of [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7635.68s)]
*  powers, that doesn't sound like a clearly obvious thing for slogans, but it is something that I [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7640.72s)]
*  think we've realized in this country and in other countries as well is something that can really be [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7647.2s)]
*  definitive about where things are going politically. Well, I should also say, I mean, it's more [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7654.08s)]
*  dramatic than it sounds with extradition because it gives power to mainland China to imprison [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7660.400000000001s)]
*  political activists and then try them in a very different way. So it's not just even a different [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7670.32s)]
*  system. It gives another lever and a powerful one to punish people that speak against China. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7675.2s)]
*  And I mentioned the Hong Kong booksellers who were spirited over the border and one of them was still [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7682.32s)]
*  in prison for having published things in Hong Kong, but it was supposed to be okay to publish [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7688.48s)]
*  in Hong Kong, but not on the mainland and yet they ended up being charged. So yeah, there was a clear [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7693.44s)]
*  sense that if they didn't protest then would they be able to protest later. So this was one of maybe [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7699.04s)]
*  the biggest protests in history? Percentage-wise, you know, because the reason why I kind of make [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7708.32s)]
*  that claim because there were a million to two million people in the biggest protests and this [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7715.36s)]
*  is a 7.5 million people. So if you think about what that means, it's just enormous. I mean, [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7720.4s)]
*  yeah, there were some very daring protests around that period, the Hong Kong ones. And the year after [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7728.32s)]
*  that, there were protests in other places, but protests in Belarus where again, there was a very, [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7734.24s)]
*  you know, taking big risks and people, but if people have a feeling that it's a kind of [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7740.48s)]
*  last moment. So yeah, these were giant and the protests kept growing. And I think they kept [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7746.08s)]
*  growing in part, and this happens why protests grow. It's always hard to figure out, but in [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7753.6s)]
*  the case of Tiananmen and the case of Hong Kong 2019, if people feel that the sort of protesters [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7759.76s)]
*  have the moral high ground in one way or another, and what tipped it that way in Hong Kong, I think, [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7768.320000000001s)]
*  was really that the police were using really strong arm methods and the government was never [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7773.200000000001s)]
*  apologizing or never saying we need to investigate that. And I think what really [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7779.84s)]
*  kept the protests going was they became a referendum on the right to protest itself. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7785.04s)]
*  And what I think the government hoped and what Beijing certainly hoped was that some of the [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7792.64s)]
*  protesters would start doing militant actions, violent actions that would alienate the populace [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7798.24s)]
*  from the protests. And the protesters did do some of those things, but they tended to attack, [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7805.44s)]
*  violence was often against property. And when there were occasionally violence against people, [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7812.48s)]
*  people within the movement would apologize or try to distance themselves from that. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7818.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, the government was never apologizing or distancing itself from the police. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7822.24s)]
*  And that created a dynamic where they had these enormous numbers of people who were previously [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7827.599999999999s)]
*  on the fence about things turning up for these protests and leading to them being giant. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7833.84s)]
*  And this was a city that sometimes had the reputation, misunderstood reputation as being [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7840.56s)]
*  one where people didn't care that much about politics. They just focused on living a good life. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7846.16s)]
*  But there was a sense that they wouldn't have that possibility if you had a police. And the police [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7851.12s)]
*  used to be really highly respected in Hong Kong, but it lost that. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7857.04s)]
*  RG Maybe you can speak to some of the dynamics of this. First of all, you were there in the early [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7860.72s)]
*  days, as I understand. How does the protest of this scale explode as it did? It starts with small [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7866.96s)]
*  groups of students, the youth. Maybe you can speak to in general from all the studying of youth protests. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7877.44s)]
*  How does maybe anger, maybe [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7884.4800000000005s)]
*  ideological optimism, maybe the desire for revolution for better times [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7892.4800000000005s)]
*  amongst a small group of students, how does that become a movement? And how does that become a [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7899.6s)]
*  gigantic protest? [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7904.320000000001s)]
*  CB So protests were one of the things that some of the most impressive books I've been reading [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7906.400000000001s)]
*  and about other places have been emphasizing is that protests are often preceded by other protests [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7914.32s)]
*  that may seem like dead ends, but actually provide people with the kind of skills and scripts and [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7922.64s)]
*  repertoires to then carry out things on a larger scale after that. So you often get, we get [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7929.6s)]
*  captivated by a moment that seems to come out of nowhere, but it often doesn't. The ground has been [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7937.68s)]
*  laid by, it can be by an earlier generation that passes on the stories about it, or it can be just [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7943.6s)]
*  a few years before. And sometimes a new generation will say, look at what they did, that was exciting, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7949.68s)]
*  but we want to put our mark on things by the generation. So there were these 1986 protests [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7956.4s)]
*  that sort of fizzled out that helped lay the groundwork for the 1989 ones. In Hong Kong, [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7963.28s)]
*  there were the 2012 and 2014 ones that laid the groundwork for 2019. Some of them at times it was [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7969.839999999999s)]
*  the same activists out on the streets again, but sometimes it was a younger generation said, yeah, [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7976.799999999999s)]
*  okay, but that failed, so what can we do differently? And we see this in cases in the US, [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7981.68s)]
*  and we see it around the world of this kind of the percolating of things that happen, [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7988.56s)]
*  sometimes in conversations that continue that happen. And sometimes failures can seem like [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=7994.0s)]
*  dead ends, but over a long period of time, we see them as succeeding. And it can seem irrational [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8003.44s)]
*  to try to do something after the last three times people have tried to do it have failed. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8014.719999999999s)]
*  But then occasionally, history shows that the third time or the fifth time or the 20th time [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8020.4s)]
*  actually does succeed. There's enough countervailing. In Eastern Europe, you would say in 1956, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8027.52s)]
*  there was a rising, it was crushed. In 1968, there were rising, it was crushed. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8034.4800000000005s)]
*  Poland, 1981, it's martial law imposed. In 1989, what were East German protesters thinking when [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8038.64s)]
*  they poured out onto the streets? And then it happened, but this time it wasn't. So I think [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8046.320000000001s)]
*  there's a way in which social movements are fundamentally unpredictable. And there are just [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8053.68s)]
*  times when against all seeming odds, something that seemed like it would be there forever just [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8061.12s)]
*  no longer is. And that's the case you make for when the odds seem impossible. It's still worthwhile. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8067.280000000001s)]
*  CB It doesn't mean that it will work. It doesn't mean that it will work, [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8076.08s)]
*  but I think history has enough examples of things that you thought. It explains why certain figures [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8082.96s)]
*  are so inspirational for generations of activists that people read. There's a reason why people [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8092.48s)]
*  talk about Vaclav Havel. Whereas if Vaclav Havel had died in 1988, people would have said, [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8099.2s)]
*  oh, maybe he was a great writer, but his political project he didn't live to see come. But then he [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8106.8s)]
*  lives to 89 and becomes against all expectations. So Rebecca Solnit, she's got a new book, No Straight [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8115.44s)]
*  Road Takes You There, Essays for Uneven Terrain. And she's talking about taking a longer view [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8123.52s)]
*  of some struggles that achieve things after the point when people might have imagined that they [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8131.68s)]
*  had run into dead ends. And she's talking about keeping your eye on the gains that happen, [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8140.88s)]
*  even incrementally, and the ways in which the need to take a longer-term perspective on some [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8147.280000000001s)]
*  of these things. And I think it's a strange thing because there's also often an impatience [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8154.56s)]
*  in movements of people wanting immediate results. But as a historian looking at [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8160.8s)]
*  situations, I've mentioned Eastern Europe and Central Europe, but [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8167.84s)]
*  Taiwan was a right-wing dictatorship under a version of martial law for decades. And at each [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8171.679999999999s)]
*  stage, it would seem that people struggling to change it were on a quixotic, impossible kind of [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8180.32s)]
*  mission. South Korea was in a similar situation. And then in the late 1980s, you start to have [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8189.5199999999995s)]
*  those things unravel. And it's partly because of a kind of steady resistance. It's partly [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8196.64s)]
*  because something in the world changes, but there's often a combination of those things. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8203.6s)]
*  So I'm interested in that whole... We know that what happened in Hong Kong in the short run [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8209.44s)]
*  didn't work. And I don't see a way in which the national security law is reversed or anything [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8218.4s)]
*  like that. But that doesn't mean that it was a completely impossible effort, even though we know [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8222.32s)]
*  the result in that case was to have this failure. So the protests are generally worthwhile. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8233.84s)]
*  I mean, they do give, as I look at the description of the migratory routes ideas take, [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8241.6s)]
*  they do seed ideas in the minds of people. And then they live with those ideas and they [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8248.88s)]
*  share those ideas. They deliberate through those ideas. They might travel to different places of [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8254.56s)]
*  the world. And then those ideas return and rise up again and again and again. There's two parts of [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8260.08s)]
*  the world that I think are fascinating and unpredictable. So one is Iran, which the [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8266.8s)]
*  trajectory that place takes might have a completely transformative effect on the Middle East. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8275.76s)]
*  Then the other one is China, where the protests, whether it's in Taiwan or Hong Kong, or maybe [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8282.48s)]
*  other influential parts of China, those ideas percolating up and up again might have a [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8289.68s)]
*  completely transformative effect on the world. So maybe this is another case where the Chinese [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8297.6s)]
*  Communist Party, leaders in the Chinese Communist Party, they do know about history and they care [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8304.16s)]
*  about history. And one history they know is the Chinese Communist Party was almost destroyed [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8310.32s)]
*  in 1927. I mean, if you were taking odds on what are the chances that this ragtag group that's [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8316.08s)]
*  being pursued by Chiang Kai-shek to try to determine it, and yet over time, they somehow [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8324.32s)]
*  manage to ride it out and eventually come to power. There's an awareness of the ways in which [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8331.6s)]
*  the seemingly impossible can happen. It doesn't mean it will. I mean, this is why I think, [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8340.08s)]
*  and one of the really kind of tragic or heartrending things is you can have situations in which [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8346.0s)]
*  movements that seem to be pursuing an impossible end result, they achieve that result. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8352.24s)]
*  And then after another period, the country goes into another really difficult period, or it seems [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8363.52s)]
*  that the successes are being rolled back. And my new Milk Tea Alliance book that I've just written, [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8370.88s)]
*  dedicated to two people who've lived through a variety of these things. One is a Burmese [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8378.96s)]
*  activist who was involved in a failed uprising in 1988. He then was in exile who didn't know [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8384.72s)]
*  whether he could ever see his brothers who he loves back in Burma. And then something magical [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8392.08s)]
*  kind of changed. And in the 2010s, it seemed that there was a kind of democratization [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8398.8s)]
*  that turned out to be a false dawn. He was able to go back. And now he's again, when there's been a [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8404.4s)]
*  coup and a crackdown, he's now again cut off. And at one point I was asking him about how he feels [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8411.119999999999s)]
*  about this when he's still trying to sort of raise awareness globally about what's happening. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8418.8s)]
*  And Meemarni said, I feel helpless, but not hopeless. I think how does somebody maintain hope [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8423.76s)]
*  in that? And the other person I dedicated to, Miklas Rosti, is a Hungarian friend of mine, [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8430.64s)]
*  who was an activist before 89 and saw this amazing thing happen with a Communist Party [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8437.119999999999s)]
*  rule ending. He was part of the process that came and he was friends with Havel and Havel's there, [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8445.84s)]
*  Poland's changing and all of this exhilarating moment, but ends up being a critic of Orban [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8452.16s)]
*  and following a tightening of controlling, of rolling back of many of the things [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8458.88s)]
*  that were victorious then. But this kind of the no straight road, that actually there's something [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8465.039999999999s)]
*  about it can be disquieting when these unexpected things are blows to where you thought his [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8473.839999999998s)]
*  direction, history was going. But history just shows you that history doesn't have a direction. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8483.359999999999s)]
*  That's not, there isn't a straight road. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8489.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And there's, you know, the idealism of youth can lead to things like the Russian [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8492.0s)]
*  Revolution and then you get Stalin with Baltimore and the purges and all of that entailed. So [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8498.4s)]
*  a successful protest and a successful revolution might have unintended consequences that [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8505.519999999999s)]
*  far overshadow whatever ideals and dreams you had fighting for the working class, whatever it was [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8514.64s)]
*  in that particular case, they can cause immeasurable suffering. So it's, there is no [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8520.08s)]
*  direction to history. There's just some lessons we pick up along the way. We try to hopefully [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8526.48s)]
*  try to help humanity flourish and we barely know what we're doing. And now we have nuclear weapons. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8532.96s)]
*  And some of it is also though people, sometimes the people who I find really admirable, [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8540.32s)]
*  it's not about trying to create totalistic change, but they focus on trying to do what they can [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8547.44s)]
*  for the things they believe in within constrained circumstances. And in Thailand, they've sort of hit [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8554.880000000001s)]
*  a roadblock now again, over kind of trying to bring about electoral change, a party that did [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8561.76s)]
*  really well was then disqualified. And the activists I know are focusing on [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8567.92s)]
*  local efforts to improve the neighborhood, to keep a neighborhood from suffering from a kind [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8574.56s)]
*  of unthinking gentrification. They're thinking small. They're thinking sometimes about just [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8579.2s)]
*  what can we do to improve the life of people within certain, how can we build, how can we [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8585.04s)]
*  contribute to the kinds of social groups that might make some kind of incremental improvement [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8591.76s)]
*  to being the kind of world that we want to live in. People do that in all kinds of ways. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8600.4s)]
*  CB What kind of parallels can we draw between Taiwan and Hong Kong? What do you think the [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8607.84s)]
*  people of Taiwan are thinking looking at Hong Kong? [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8613.04s)]
*  RG Well, I think the way that things developed in Hong Kong have undermined the kind of trust in any [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8617.36s)]
*  kind of story coming out of Beijing, that there's a place within sort of Xi Jinping's version, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8626.640000000001s)]
*  at least the People's Republic of China, for a place where people live very different kinds [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8634.96s)]
*  of lives. And I think a lot of people in Taiwan think of them, feel they're living a very different [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8640.0s)]
*  kind of life than on the mainland. So in that way, I think Hong Kong was an important [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8645.039999999999s)]
*  example that way. And there were connections between, there was a Taiwan protest in 2014 [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8653.439999999999s)]
*  before the big protests in Hong Kong by people who were young people who felt the government [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8660.0s)]
*  then was moving toward too much toward working together with Beijing. So there's, [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8666.88s)]
*  they've been interconnected stories. And I think we sometimes miss how people within a region [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8672.72s)]
*  are looking at what other people in the region are doing and are taking clues from it about sort of [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8679.92s)]
*  how to agitate for the things they care about, what the risks are, what the dangers are. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8686.48s)]
*  Autocrats within different parts of a region are looking at each other too, as well as globally. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8694.32s)]
*  RG In part because there's a great dependence in the United States on TSMC and in that way on Taiwan [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8698.48s)]
*  for different supply chains, for electronics, for semiconductors, for a lot of our economy. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8705.119999999999s)]
*  CB There's been a lot of nervousness about Taiwan. What are the chances that there's some [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8710.48s)]
*  brewing military conflict over this question of Taiwan in the coming decades and how can we avoid [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8717.6s)]
*  it? RG It's one of these really worrisome issues that there isn't an easy, I think experts who [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8723.76s)]
*  tell you they know what X, Y and Z about this is are deluding themselves probably. There's so many [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8734.24s)]
*  variables. CB Maybe you could just elaborate the possible clues we have. RG So with talking to [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8744.32s)]
*  people in Taiwan and from Taiwan, there are a couple things that are clear. One is that [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8752.4s)]
*  daily life in Taiwan is not people waking up each morning, living their life based on the fact that [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8759.92s)]
*  there's in such a perilous predicament. Life goes on and a lot of people feel very fortunate [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8767.84s)]
*  to be in Taiwan. There are many reasons why it seems like a great place to live in many ways. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8779.92s)]
*  So even though this is hanging, but at the same time, there is an awareness of things that [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8787.92s)]
*  increase precariousness. There was a lot of concern with the invasion of Ukraine and watching how [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8795.84s)]
*  the response to that was. There was a sense of it being analogous. There was a sense that [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8808.720000000001s)]
*  Xi Jinping would be watching the response to Putin and seeing what he would do then. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8816.24s)]
*  Then there was a sense of relief, I think, when there was as unified a Western NATO, [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8822.640000000001s)]
*  including the United States response. Then there's a concern about [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8833.76s)]
*  the Trump presidency because of Ukraine. At the same time, there are mixed signals. I'm sure there [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8840.0s)]
*  are people there who are both saying Trump is going to be tough toward the Chinese Communist Party [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8850.56s)]
*  and others are going to say, but if he's not as supportive of Ukraine, what does that say for [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8857.52s)]
*  the defense of... So they're not the same situations, but all people have in a sense, [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8865.279999999999s)]
*  sometimes with unknowable situations, is to look at things that have any degree of parallel [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8873.519999999999s)]
*  connections in other places. Do you think Xi Jinping knows what he's going to do in the next [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8880.16s)]
*  five, 10 years with Taiwan? Or is it really... There's a loose historical notion that Taiwan [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8886.48s)]
*  should be part of China with Xi Jinping and the Communist Party, believe that? [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8897.36s)]
*  Michael S. Lutzer That loose idea was accepted. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8902.48s)]
*  Shanghai Shek and Mao both thought that these two places were part of somehow destined to be the [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8904.960000000001s)]
*  same. It was just under that period, Shanghai Shek thought, how long until I take over the mainland [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8911.84s)]
*  and it all becomes the Republic of China? This is not now something that any leader in Taiwan [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8918.4s)]
*  is believing. There is a degree to which that remains a sense within the Chinese Communist [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8924.4s)]
*  Party leadership as eventuality. I don't think there's a set plan [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8933.44s)]
*  in part because I think it is also dependent on what the costs in various realms would be of [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8942.08s)]
*  doing that. I think it still does. I think it's still... One scenario would be possibly [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8951.04s)]
*  a sense of becoming strong enough to not have to worry about consequences. I think another, [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8963.12s)]
*  I still think to some extent more would be a sense of weakness or precarity of [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8969.04s)]
*  maintaining power domestically and needing to do something to distract. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8974.960000000001s)]
*  Michael S. Lutzer Another complexity about this is it's not always so clear [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8980.080000000002s)]
*  the line between no conflict and conflict. There's a lot of gray zone tactics of nonviolent [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8986.480000000001s)]
*  pressure that China could exude. It could do non-military violence. It could then escalate [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=8994.72s)]
*  that to nonviolent military intimidation. All of this has consequences for the United States [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9003.279999999999s)]
*  because there's a messaging thing going on here. Then of course that could then go to a full on [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9011.119999999999s)]
*  do as you're told actions that come at a high risk of a hot military conflict. Basically, [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9016.96s)]
*  it's just don't do military violence but just full on pressure ordering Taiwan to do things. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9021.44s)]
*  The only way to respond is with violence. You're completely trapped. You're saying no. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9034.400000000001s)]
*  You have to say no with a military force behind it. Then what do you do? Every step [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9039.04s)]
*  in this, it's such an unstable nonlinear dynamical system where anything could just [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9046.32s)]
*  unintended consequences can happen and it could just escalate in a matter of days, if not hours. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9053.52s)]
*  Like this is where I think it's really important to find mechanisms and tactics and strategies [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9060.72s)]
*  for de-escalation. It's just why this trade war that's happening, one of the nice things [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9071.279999999999s)]
*  of being so connected by trade is it creates a disincentive for any of this kind of posturing [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9078.48s)]
*  because I do agree with you. I think it will start as these things often do as a kind of [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9087.519999999999s)]
*  military early steps posturing in order to maintain power internally. China will just [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9095.6s)]
*  create military conflict, conflict of different kinds in order to distract. But then how does [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9107.28s)]
*  that escalate? As if all that wasn't complicated enough, Taiwan isn't just one place or one island. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9113.04s)]
*  There are also islands that are closer to mainland Chinmen and their degrees of integration. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9119.439999999999s)]
*  Your comment about integration of trade and being a check on kind of... There's a Chinese writer, [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9129.759999999998s)]
*  who fascinating guy Han Han, who was a race car driver and a filmmaker and a bad boy novelist. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9144.16s)]
*  Anyway, in his heyday, he was an interesting kind of blogger who was testing the edges of things. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9152.640000000001s)]
*  And he had this blog post where he was talking about this was in the early 2000s. He was talking [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9158.24s)]
*  about how China was building the massive Three Gorges Dam project. He said, some people are saying [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9166.56s)]
*  building these dams, it could be so easy for the Americans to just bomb them and destroy our [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9177.92s)]
*  country because it would be a massive flood. And he said, but that's really silly. That's a really [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9186.08s)]
*  silly argument because Americans know that down river from there, what will be flooded out was [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9192.72s)]
*  the place where their iPhones are built. And they want their iPhones. So this kind of notion, [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9198.08s)]
*  he's making through a humorous point, the way in which interconnectedness can be a check. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9205.279999999999s)]
*  And interconnectedness can be in all kinds of ways, the flows of people between places and [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9214.08s)]
*  having people from one place living in another, traveling to another, studying in another, [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9219.92s)]
*  that can actually be something that helps to stabilize the world. I think that's an important [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9226.08s)]
*  thing to keep in mind. Since you mentioned the Long March and the unlikely coming to power with [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9232.64s)]
*  the Communist Party, let's go back. We began comparing Xi Jinping and Mao. Let's go back to Mao. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9241.12s)]
*  How did Mao come to power? The road to Mao coming to power, we need to first say that [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9247.52s)]
*  China was under rule by emperors until 1911 overthrown by an upheaval that was partly [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9255.68s)]
*  by people who wanted to change China into a republic, but also some people who wanted to get [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9264.880000000001s)]
*  rid of the last dynasty was a group of Manchu ruling families. So they saw them as ethnic [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9271.2s)]
*  outsiders. So it was a strange combination of kind of ethnic nationalists who wanted China back under [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9277.44s)]
*  the control of Han Chinese, other people who thought the time for rule by emperors was over [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9284.08s)]
*  and wanted to establish a republic. And Sun Yat-sen became a first provisional president of this [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9289.84s)]
*  newly formed Republic of China, but then he got nudged out of power by a military strongman. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9299.04s)]
*  And then there was a period where the country was really divided. Republic of China didn't have a [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9305.68s)]
*  strong government, but there were then two groups. One rallied around Sun Yat-sen, had founded [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9312.640000000001s)]
*  something that became known as the Nationalist Party. And then there was a small group of people [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9321.28s)]
*  who formed a communist party. Mao was one of them. These were intellectuals who were part of the May [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9326.96s)]
*  4th movement of 1919. They were inspired by Marxist ideas, but they were also just inspired by the [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9333.519999999999s)]
*  Russian revolution. Russia was nearby. It seemed good to think with. It had a largely rural [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9338.88s)]
*  population and somehow it seemed to be getting strong in the world. And there was this interest [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9346.0s)]
*  in how China could do that. And the newly formed Soviet Union did something very important. There [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9353.6s)]
*  were a group of foreign powers, including Tsarist Russia, that had gained big concessions out of [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9361.6s)]
*  China when in 1900, the Boxer uprising had taken place and then been crushed by a consortium of [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9369.12s)]
*  foreign powers who had gotten privileges and indemnities out of that. And the newly formed [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9377.12s)]
*  Soviet Union renounced those, said that was the old order, that was imperialism. And so [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9385.2s)]
*  Marx's ideas were attractive to some Chinese thinkers, but Lenin was very attractive because [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9394.720000000001s)]
*  of his combination of anti-imperialism and his notion of a vanguard party leading a country forward. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9402.64s)]
*  So there was a small communist party, a bigger nationalist party. They were involved in these [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9411.519999999999s)]
*  protests against warlords and against imperialists. And while Sun Yat-sen was alive, Sun Yat-sen [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9416.72s)]
*  got the two parties to work together because Sun Yat-sen wasn't a Marxist. He didn't believe [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9424.4s)]
*  in class struggle, but he admired Lenin and Leninism. And so he said that actually the [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9428.88s)]
*  communist party and the nationalist party may have had different views of the path forward for China, [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9436.24s)]
*  but they agreed on who the enemies were. And the enemies were the warlords who were keeping China [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9441.759999999998s)]
*  weak and too willing to compromise with Japan and foreign imperialism. So China needed to get [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9447.519999999999s)]
*  rid of the warlords and become a stronger country. And then they could sort it out of [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9454.24s)]
*  what road to take. Sun Yat-sen dies in 1925 and his successor, Shanghai Shek, [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9460.64s)]
*  is initially keeps the alliance going with the communist party. But in 1927, he turns against [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9468.56s)]
*  the communists and tries to carry out a purge against the communist party members. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9475.36s)]
*  He's the head of the nationalists. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9479.36s)]
*  He's the head of the nationalists. And he has some very different, he's a kind of culturally [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9480.88s)]
*  more conservative figure. But what's important in part about this is there are some members of the [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9486.64s)]
*  Chinese Communist Party who accept the basic ideas of Marxism, of revolution comes from the cities. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9493.92s)]
*  But Mao has this idea that actually he's partly, he loves this idea of peasant rebellions in China, [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9501.679999999998s)]
*  his past is driving history forward. And he starts writing about how, well, maybe in China's case, [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9510.64s)]
*  actually the peasantry farmers can be a radical force. And so the communist party is on the run, [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9517.279999999999s)]
*  it's being pushed around, but the nationalists are trying to exterminate them. But eventually, [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9524.8s)]
*  the nationalists and the communists ally again. After Japan invades China in the 1930s, they form [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9532.8s)]
*  what's called the Second United Front. But during this period, Mao is emerging as taking [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9538.88s)]
*  leadership in the Chinese Communist Party and his idea of a different kind of vision of [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9546.08s)]
*  communist revolution that has the revolutionary vanguard somehow being the peasantry. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9551.439999999999s)]
*  After World War II, after the two parties have brokered a truce and worked together against Japan, [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9561.76s)]
*  there's a civil war between the nationalists and the communists. And against all odds, [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9568.88s)]
*  the communist party wins. The communist party gets support from the Soviet Union, [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9574.0s)]
*  the nationalists get support from the United States, even though neither of them are quite [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9579.039999999999s)]
*  doing things the way that their backer would like them to. But there also is a way in which the, [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9585.439999999999s)]
*  and this is something I think the communist party leaders remember, there's a feeling that the [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9592.0s)]
*  nationalist party doesn't really believe its own rhetoric that in fact all it cares about is having [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9596.96s)]
*  power and that it's internally corrupt. Chiang Kai-shek himself isn't viewed as sort of [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9602.96s)]
*  personally corrupt, but family members and there's an idea that there's just a small [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9609.439999999999s)]
*  band of people that are benefiting. And there's a kind of disgust with the leader, with the [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9616.0s)]
*  nationalists. The nationalists end up in retreat in Taiwan. That's why Taiwan then becomes [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9623.199999999999s)]
*  the Republic of China. There's an uprising there that Chiang Kai-shek's people, the nationalists, [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9629.92s)]
*  repress and there starts being from the late 1940s on this long period of martial law on [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9637.199999999999s)]
*  Taiwan. And there becomes then this period where the mainland's under the control of a [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9643.519999999999s)]
*  Leninist party, believes in one party rule and believes that it was a very bad period in Chinese [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9649.839999999998s)]
*  history when China was unable to stand up to imperialists. Taiwan's controlled by a Leninist [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9657.759999999998s)]
*  party that believes in one party rule, limits on participation, believes that it was a bad time [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9668.24s)]
*  when China was being bullied by imperialists. What distinguishes Chiang Kai-shek has a [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9675.28s)]
*  personality called Mao has a personality called, they have a lot in common, but one clear thing [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9680.800000000001s)]
*  that makes them different is Chiang Kai-shek says that what's wrong with the Communist Party is [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9686.960000000001s)]
*  they've abandoned Chinese traditional values of Confucianism. And Mao says that on the nationalists, [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9691.52s)]
*  what's really bad is they are still wedded to these traditional Chinese values of Confucianism. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9700.96s)]
*  So cycling back to where we began with Mao and Xi, you could actually say Xi Jinping in some ways [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9707.28s)]
*  is like living out the dream that Chiang Kai-shek had of one party rule and also kind of celebrating [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9715.36s)]
*  Confucianism. Yeah, there's elements. You've spoken about the elements of Chiang Kai-shek and Mao [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9724.64s)]
*  that Xi Jinping kind of combines. You've also mentioned an interesting, if we had 100 hours [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9731.28s)]
*  to talk about, there's another interesting side effect similarity that you talk about where Xi [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9738.48s)]
*  Jinping's wife is out there, a known entity, a part of his public image. And same was the case with [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9744.8s)]
*  Chiang Kai-shek. Yes. And both of them, right, they had high profile wives who were [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9754.0s)]
*  celebrity figures and made a good impression globally and were more like kind of first [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9761.36s)]
*  ladies. But both Chiang Kai-shek and Xi Jinping oversaw a period of emphasizing more traditional [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9770.0s)]
*  patriarchal values in China. And one of the things I didn't mention before, Xi Jinping has been very [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9779.2s)]
*  in this idea of trying to do away with difference within PRC. He's been pushing against feminists of [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9786.640000000001s)]
*  any kinds of feminist movements. So going back to Confucius. Yeah. Yeah, in some ways. I mean, [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9794.960000000001s)]
*  there are people who will argue for a less patriarchal Confucius, but it fits with that mode. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9801.2s)]
*  So now that gets us close to Mao consolidating power. Then the story after 1949 with Mao is [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9807.44s)]
*  there were divisions within the Communist Party over Mao was impatient. He wanted to [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9815.76s)]
*  transform the country quickly. He had a utopian streak. He thought just as the peasantry could, [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9828.08s)]
*  you didn't have to stick to the traditional pattern of moving slowly to socialism and then [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9834.96s)]
*  to communism. He tried to the Great Leap Forward was this disastrous policy of his that imagined [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9840.48s)]
*  China outdoing the West in a kind of quick industrialization and move like this. And [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9847.119999999999s)]
*  it just didn't work and all kinds of things were wrong. And that would be a whole, [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9856.08s)]
*  there'd be a, we'd need a whole other session to do the Great Leap Forward and the culture of [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9859.84s)]
*  Lucia. But one of the simple ways to think about it is Mao made these kind of disastrous moves [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9864.800000000001s)]
*  and then was partially sidelined and then wanted to get back to power. And there was this struggle [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9871.6s)]
*  between people who are more gradualists, more let's try to work more kind of rationally and [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9878.560000000001s)]
*  the more utopian side with Mao and both the Great Leap Forward and then later the Cultural [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9884.88s)]
*  Revolution were Mao's efforts to do things dramatically even at the risk of chaos, even [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9891.039999999999s)]
*  at the risk of undoing a lot of the kind of slow building of state building going on. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9900.4s)]
*  And then there were other figures who were more concerned with kind of incremental moves. And then [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9908.96s)]
*  after Mao's death, one of those figures, Deng Xiaoping ends up being the next long-term [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9916.72s)]
*  paramount leader. He led to decades of economic progress, his economic reforms led to record [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9924.88s)]
*  breaking growth for China and so on. But I got to linger on the Great Leap Forward a bit, enough to [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9931.039999999999s)]
*  understand modern-day China. So as people know, as I'll talk about in other episodes, [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9937.84s)]
*  the Great Leap Forward, this agricultural collectivization and rapid attempt to [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9946.8s)]
*  industrialize has killed 30 to 45 million people. It's one of the greatest atrocities in human [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9952.880000000001s)]
*  history. How could Mao be so catastrophically wrong on the policy of collectivization [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9961.36s)]
*  and be so unwilling to see the atrocity and the suffering he's causing, enough to change course? [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9970.16s)]
*  HOFFMAN So with the Great Leap Forward, [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9978.400000000001s)]
*  we have caused this incredible famine, the just incredible devastation. One of the things that [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9980.560000000001s)]
*  happened was getting very bad information. There was a sense that there was people, [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9988.72s)]
*  officials were afraid that if they gave bad news, if they admitted that they were failing to meet [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=9994.72s)]
*  these giant targets that were being set, that would be seen as a political mistake. So it got [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10002.0s)]
*  to be a survival mechanism to pass on unrealistic reports on what was going. So some of it was [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10009.439999999999s)]
*  a culture of fear around a great leader that led to not getting accurate information. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10017.519999999999s)]
*  So that was one part of the dynamic. Ego was a big part of it. There were all kinds of things that [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10026.32s)]
*  were unmoored. When early in the Chinese Communist Party history and power, there was the connection [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10032.24s)]
*  to the Soviet Union and Mao and Stalin had a connection. After Stalin's death, Mao was haunted [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10041.12s)]
*  by the move toward de-Stalinization and the moves by Khrushchev and thus laid the groundwork for the [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10048.800000000001s)]
*  Sino-Soviet split. But there was also this kind of obsession with doing things differently [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10056.400000000001s)]
*  that Mao had in that case as well. And you have factional struggles. You have all kinds of things [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10064.880000000001s)]
*  that are happening simultaneously. There's something I learned about called Gray's Law, [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10070.4s)]
*  which states any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10077.68s)]
*  So I would say when 30 to 45 million people die, it doesn't really matter what the explanation is. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10083.359999999999s)]
*  That's a longer discussion. But the interesting discussion that connects to everything we've [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10091.199999999999s)]
*  been talking about is how is Mao seen in modern-day China? What has Xi Jinping said about Mao? [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10096.4s)]
*  So before Xi Jinping, there was this kind of assessment of Mao as having been early in the [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10107.52s)]
*  early 80s of being 70% right, 30% wrong. I guess Mao's own analysis of Stalin [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10116.96s)]
*  was that Stalin was 70% right and 30% wrong. So they apply the same kind of [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10124.16s)]
*  Michael S. Lutzer Yeah, yeah. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10130.480000000001s)]
*  Adam Lutzer ... logic there, yeah. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10131.52s)]
*  Michael S. Lutzer ... mathematical analysis to Mao. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10131.92s)]
*  Adam Lutzer Yeah. But Xi Jinping has had a different way of talking about this. And he's [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10133.76s)]
*  talked about the first 30 years of the People's Republic of China and the second 30 years and says [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10139.68s)]
*  that we should not use the successes of one to criticize the other, that we need to see [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10144.960000000001s)]
*  where we are today as benefiting from both those first 30 years and those second 30 years, [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10151.919999999998s)]
*  which implicitly, or he sometimes talks about a new era, suggests that in many ways he sees [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10159.599999999999s)]
*  China's now in a post-reform era. We can think about a third stage and there are people who [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10166.08s)]
*  write about it in that way. There's always been a way of trying to separate out a kind of Mao of [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10173.28s)]
*  the periods when things were not going horribly. And I think Xi Jinping would think that Mao [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10184.240000000002s)]
*  having managed to fight the Korean War to a standstill, which is how the history of that [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10192.400000000001s)]
*  period is described in the PRC, and said, look, you had so many different forces of the more [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10200.8s)]
*  developed world fighting on one side and that war did not end in a defeat for North Korea and for [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10207.199999999999s)]
*  the Chinese side. So yeah, Xi Jinping, I think, wants to be seen as an inheritor of Mao, a [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10215.359999999999s)]
*  continuo of one side of the Mao legacy, but clearly circling back to where we began, not [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10224.64s)]
*  the Mao who liked to stir things up, not the Mao who believed in mobilizing youth on the streets, [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10232.56s)]
*  not the Mao who let things get out of control, but the Mao who was responsible for strengthening [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10240.0s)]
*  the nation. Can I ask you about the 1953 speech? Let me just watch it real quick. This particular [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10245.92s)]
*  speech is about in 1953, at the end of the Korean War, saying China will not surrender. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10252.64s)]
*  Well, let's actually just listen to it. The speech reads, as to how long this war will last, [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10261.039999999999s)]
*  we're not the ones who can decide. It used to depend on President Truman. It will depend on [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10267.519999999999s)]
*  President Eisenhower or whoever will become the next US president. It's up to them. But no matter [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10273.68s)]
*  how long this war is going to last, we will never yield. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10279.84s)]
*  We'll fight until we completely triumph. Yeah, so this is the version of Mao that you're speaking to [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10293.04s)]
*  that is still celebrated today. And from the Chinese perspective, I guess they could tell [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10302.48s)]
*  the story about that particular proxy war that they triumphed. What do you think about that [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10309.36s)]
*  speech about these performances? I don't know how much you've listened to Mao's speeches. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10315.6s)]
*  Well, he had a really difficult accent to make sense of. Native speakers of Chinese can have [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10323.84s)]
*  trouble with his speech. That one was less hard to follow than some of them. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10332.08s)]
*  What explains the accent? Well, he's just from Hunan and he had a heavy accent. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10341.2s)]
*  This is another complicated side of Mao. He was both anti-intellectual and very intellectual. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10349.28s)]
*  He liked to write poetry and to fashion himself as that, but he also liked to be seen as incredibly [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10357.36s)]
*  earthy and critical of intellectuals. And if he had an animus toward wanting to, even though he [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10364.16s)]
*  was intellectually, he had that anti-intellectualism. But no, I think what's interesting about that [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10375.44s)]
*  speech in part is how, and even the depiction of the Korean War as being the war against America [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10380.64s)]
*  and resist America and support Korea. I think it fit with his idea that it wasn't just about China, [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10390.96s)]
*  it wasn't about China working in self-interest, but siding with the underdog countries against [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10400.48s)]
*  the hegemonic ones. And that was another part of Mao's desire to see China as representing [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10410.88s)]
*  the kind of a third world and the countries that had felt the brunt of imperialism, [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10419.76s)]
*  of Western imperialism and Japanese imperialism, and trying to find one or another [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10431.76s)]
*  country's imperialism to focus on. And at that point, he was focusing on America, [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10441.199999999999s)]
*  which is something that can have particular resonances now. Mao could alternate at certain [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10445.039999999999s)]
*  points he thought there should be an alliance with, where he said that China should be able to work [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10452.88s)]
*  with Japan. At one point, he said, well, without Japanese imperialism, the Communist Party wouldn't [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10458.32s)]
*  have risen because we wouldn't have had this ability to unite the people. We have seen in [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10466.32s)]
*  the post-Mao period some leaders playing on sort of anti-Japanese sentiment because of the history [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10475.039999999999s)]
*  of Japanese aggression, or there can be anti-American sentiment because of [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10481.36s)]
*  the history of American roles in imperialism. Or it can be played in a different way. The [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10488.16s)]
*  United States certainly tried that the United States didn't have formal colonies in Asia the [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10493.52s)]
*  way that Britain and France did and tried to present itself differently. But these things are [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10500.720000000001s)]
*  also kind of in flux. And now we're in this very unusual influx period. At the beginning of the [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10507.6s)]
*  imposition of tariffs, there were leaders of China, Japan, and South Korea all together [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10515.12s)]
*  in photo ops, which was not something that, I mean, being on the same side. So I think this is [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10523.279999999999s)]
*  also just a kind of broader lesson to not assume that configurations will always stay. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10529.92s)]
*  If you look out into the 21st century, what are some of the best possible things that could happen [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10536.96s)]
*  in the region and globally with China at the center of the world stage? What are the possible [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10543.439999999999s)]
*  trajectories you could see culturally, economically, politically, in terms of [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10550.88s)]
*  partnerships and all this kind of stuff? It's such a hard moment to be imagining these things. I mean, [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10557.839999999998s)]
*  I've long wanted to see a return of China to this path toward a more kind of, [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10567.839999999998s)]
*  yeah, I wasn't one of the people who imagined that there would be this convergence of, [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10575.92s)]
*  or China's emergence into evolution into a liberal capitalist kind of country. But [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10584.960000000001s)]
*  I'd love to see a return to that more kind of tolerance of diversity within China, [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10592.08s)]
*  variations within China, more space for civil society. And it's a hard time to even imagine [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10598.24s)]
*  that because Hong Kong kind of represented that place that was somehow within. It was an amazing [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10605.6s)]
*  thing, I think, looking backward, sorry, rather than forward. I think it's really extraordinary [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10613.2s)]
*  how much leeway was given to Hong Kong for a period there. That was really special. No Communist [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10618.800000000001s)]
*  Party-run country had ever had a city within it that had as free oppressed as Hong Kong had then, [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10625.44s)]
*  as much tolerance for protests. And I hope it can be seen by some, at least within Beijing, [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10632.16s)]
*  as a miscalculation too. The People's Republic of China wanted soft power and Hong Kong films [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10643.68s)]
*  were admired around the world, this industry. There was a way in which creativity flurried. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10650.24s)]
*  So I guess it would be just the hope for more spaces where that kind of [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10656.64s)]
*  creativity and openness debate where things can flourish. I'd love to think that there actually [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10664.8s)]
*  are a variety of things in Taiwan that if those could become broader norms. Not that Taiwan's [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10671.04s)]
*  perfect. It has its own internal problems, but there are many really attractive things about it [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10680.16s)]
*  right now, different kinds of things that flourish. So maybe a setting in which Taiwan in its post [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10687.039999999999s)]
*  martial law, post-Leninist incarnation would be something that we could think of more. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10699.52s)]
*  Yeah, and you're right. Taiwan and especially Hong Kong are these truly special place. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10708.64s)]
*  It's a case study. It doesn't make sense that that would happen, but it happened. Hopefully [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10716.0s)]
*  history is full of wonderful things like this. And I guess, can you clarify, you think the protests [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10720.56s)]
*  of 2019, like the protests in 2020, they're mostly a failure? Is there still a possibility that [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10726.48s)]
*  Hong Kong rises and its way of life, its way of being, the democratic ideals, [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10735.2s)]
*  not necessarily full on democracy or this kind of thing, but would actually, in a sense, [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10744.800000000001s)]
*  permeate China, not the other way around? So that was a hope early on, and there were ways in which [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10753.2s)]
*  parts of Hong Kong style even permeated across the border. I think it's hard to see it now with how [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10759.519999999999s)]
*  Hong Kong has changed, but I hesitate to. I mean, an awareness of the unpredictability of things, [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10767.679999999998s)]
*  there's no way to know what kind of thing there would be for Hong Kong later. I do think there [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10775.359999999999s)]
*  things about Hong Kong that even in the failure of the movement have had repercussions that are not [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10779.76s)]
*  all negative. I think the Hong Kong spirit, which is being kept alive in diaspora communities [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10790.880000000001s)]
*  around the world is really interesting. There are things that are [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10798.24s)]
*  spreading. I think Hong Kong represented a vision of a different way of being Chinese, [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10802.0s)]
*  a different notion of Chineseness. I think that is something that exists. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10809.36s)]
*  There have been protesters in a lot of other parts of the world, Belarus to, [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10816.08s)]
*  I used to say from Minneapolis to Minsk, because in 2020, there were protests in the US and in [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10820.960000000001s)]
*  Belarus where there were activists who were talking about the Hong Kong idea of trying to [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10827.76s)]
*  focus on be water, more flexible protest tactics, something. Clearly in Thailand, there were people [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10834.48s)]
*  who looked at things to learn from Hong Kong, even in defeat. There's a New Zealand-based [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10842.32s)]
*  China specialist, Jeremy Barm√©, who talks about the other China, which can exist within China, [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10849.44s)]
*  physical China or elsewhere, which is this equally attached to Chinese traditions. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10855.52s)]
*  But thinking of those traditions as including not just Confucianism, but Taoism, not just hierarchy, [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10862.720000000001s)]
*  but also openness to cosmopolitanism, not just nationalism, but cosmopolitanism. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10869.68s)]
*  I think there are some elements of that that even in failure, the Hong Kong protests of the 2020s [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10875.52s)]
*  were a last flourishing of that. We can see some elements of that. We can think of Taiwan, [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10884.96s)]
*  elements of that as another China as well. I think recovering, not allowing the particular [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10893.119999999999s)]
*  version of Chineseness that the Chinese Communist Party under Xi Jinping wants to make people think [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10901.839999999998s)]
*  of as the essence of Chinese. China has multiple cultural strands, multiple traditions that people [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10908.48s)]
*  can tap into. It's something richer and more admirable, I think, than this narrowed down version. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10917.52s)]
*  I hope for a future where both Hong Kong and Beijing have bookstores that carry 1984 Brave [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10927.279999999999s)]
*  New World and all of your books. I can't wait to visit them and enjoy the intellectual flourishing [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10935.68s)]
*  of incredible people. What a beautiful world to live in. The Chinese people, all the people I've [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10945.359999999999s)]
*  met, it's just so great to interact with a totally different culture. You can feel the roots run deep [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10951.12s)]
*  through ancient history that are very different. It's amazing. It's amazing that Earth produced [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10960.880000000001s)]
*  Chinese people, Indian people, the Slavic people. There's just all kinds of variants. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10968.880000000001s)]
*  We all have our own weirdnesses and quirks and so on. Everybody has brilliant people. We all start [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10976.24s)]
*  sharing with each other every once in a while. I hope now that we have nuclear weapons and I hope [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10982.56s)]
*  now that we have technology that connects us, we'll actually collaborate more than we fight [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10987.76s)]
*  each other. Thank you for being one of the people that shows off the beauty of this particular [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=10995.76s)]

*  consequences. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=11026.64s)]
