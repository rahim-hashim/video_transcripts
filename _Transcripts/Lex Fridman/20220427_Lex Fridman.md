# Cristiano Amon: Qualcomm CEO | Lex Fridman Podcast #280
**Lex Fridman:** [April 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMgPxVnKLSk)
*  talking about exciting thing for an engineer. The same Snapdragon that goes to a phone and it can
*  go to a galaxy phone, for example, Samsung, the same, not a special one, went all the way to Mars.
*  You expect to have a full day of battery life, but then you want it to not be sending data into
*  10 or 100 megabits. You want gigabits. You want it to be able to have eight core processors. You
*  want to have a GPU with ray tracing. You want to have all of those things that you can only get
*  into sometimes a desktop PC. To do all of that in your phone is an incredible thing.
*  Some people raise concerns about there not being enough studies about the effects of 5G on the
*  human body. Is 5G safe? The following is a conversation with Cristiano Amon, the CEO of
*  Qualcomm, the company that's one of the leaders in the world in the space of mobile communication
*  and computation. That's 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G that connects billions of phones and the Snapdragon
*  processor and system on a chip that is the brain of most of the premium Android phones in the world.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Cristiano Amon.
*  You are originally from Brazil. Let me ask the most important question, the most profound question,
*  the biggest question. Who's the greatest soccer player of all time?
*  Look, everybody's going to say Pelé. Actually, I was born during the game of Brazil and Italy.
*  I was born in Italy. My dad tells me that the doctor had a TV on at the delivery room.
*  So everybody will say Pelé, but I really like Ronaldo. The first Ronaldo. I really like him.
*  That's my favorite player. By the way, not everybody would say Pelé,
*  but we should leave that on the table and agree to disagree.
*  Brazilians will say Pelé. Yes. There's other countries around that region that may disagree.
*  Qualcomm is largely responsible for 5G and some of the greatest processors in our smartphones
*  ever built. So we've got communication and computation tech that impacts probably billions
*  of people. So if you zoom out, you as a human, we look at humans on earth in general,
*  does it blow your mind that we have these billions of smartphones communicating
*  and each of them have the computational power? You know, you talk about 10 billion transistors.
*  That's a million times more than 50 years ago in the best computers in the world.
*  Like if you just zoom out as a human, does that blow your mind? Absolutely. Look, one of the
*  reasons I think I love this company is we know that the technology we develop can change the
*  world. And I'll tell you one more thing. Beyond the amount of processing power that you have now in
*  the palm of your hands and being every one of the world is connected with broadband technology,
*  the smartphone is also mankind's largest development platform. There's nothing like it.
*  So you respect both the hardware and the software?
*  Both.
*  Both. If aliens were observing earth over the past 50 to 70 years, how do you think they would
*  describe this particular turmoil, fun things going on on the surface of this particular little
*  planet? We live in interesting times. In one time we see incredible development of technology
*  for mankind just what happened in the last century. You know, from 1900 to 2000, it was
*  incredible development. Just look, 2000 was 22 years ago, how far we're coming and where we
*  go in with technology. It's incredible. What do you think they would notice? So there's road
*  networks, there's all kinds of networks. There's lights that keep popping up, cities springing up,
*  from an alien perspective, you're observing. Well, what I'm going to tell you is you have this
*  contrast of incredible development of technology, but then you see some of the things that are
*  happening right now, which is probably you would not expect them to happen on the 21st century,
*  just what happened in Ukraine. So I think that will be a more puzzling question for the aliens,
*  I would imagine. The new technology is kind of impressive. Actually, that might not be so
*  puzzling because that's just human nature revealing itself as it has throughout human history.
*  That's correct.
*  Right. Let's talk about wireless communication. So Qualcomm was instrumental in developing 5G.
*  Now you were with Qualcomm since the early days, the good old 90s with the 2G. But what is 5G,
*  including sub-six gigahertz 5G and millimeter wave 5G? How does it work? And maybe the most
*  important question is how will it change the world in the coming years?
*  When we set ourselves to develop 5G, and we look at this, every generation of technology had a
*  problem to be solved. So you mentioned 2G challenge. The challenge of CDMA was can we
*  give every person on earth a cell phone? That was, can you get to a technology that you can
*  basically allow everyone to have a mobile phone? 3G was about the ability to connect that to the
*  internet. I think 4G was broadband and with 4G was about the ability for you to have a computer
*  in the palm of your hand. We'll just talk about that. 5G, the challenge was a little bit different.
*  It's how do we build a technology for a society that is going to be 100% connected to the cloud?
*  How do we provide a technology that is going to be the last mile connectivity for everything?
*  So 5G has basically been designed to eliminate all issues with data congestion, whether you are
*  in a stadium, we talk about soccer, you're in a stadium and everyone should have the ability
*  to have access to broadband. So deal with congestion. Deal with the fact that not only people,
*  but billions of things need to be connected. Create a technology that for the first time in
*  wireless, you could deliver mission critical services. Wireless used to up to 4G is its best
*  effort. In 5G, it can guarantee that you are connected with the cloud. And then the last point
*  of that is provide this fabric that will allow us as a society to look at things that are not
*  connected and say, that's the exception. That's why we made a comparison in the early days of 5G,
*  that that's going to be like electricity. Right now you don't have a discussion about what are
*  the use cases for electricity. You don't talk about that anymore. You just assume it's there.
*  And that's how we think about everything connected to the cloud. That's what 5G is and that's the
*  role of 5G. So first of all, everything connected to the cloud is interesting because the space of
*  everything is constantly increasing. That is correct. I don't think the refrigerator over there,
*  it looks kind of smart, but I don't think it's connected yet to the cloud. So this includes
*  Internet of Things. What is the full space of everything? The full space of everything is
*  it's maybe going back to where you start defining Qualcomm. Qualcomm is about communications and
*  advanced computers for low powered devices. And can we make everything smart? It can range from
*  the robot you have right now on the floor, to your refrigerator, to a camera, to
*  machines and manufacturing, to retail, etc. I can give you some examples. When we think of something
*  as simple as going to the grocery shop, we see technology now with something, the stuff we've
*  been working with companies like Walmart, electronic shelf labels, the ability for you to
*  have smart cameras that can look at shelves and the camera is smart enough to say some product
*  needs to be replenished. It's about really providing processor connectivity, artificial
*  intelligence to everything. And I think that's one of the largest addressable markets we have
*  for technology because you can't really define everything. Right, exactly. It's a nice market
*  because it keeps growing potentially exponentially in speed. What about coverage? So how are we doing
*  on the everything part? So there is, like I mentioned, sub 6 GHz 5G and there's a millimeter
*  wave 5G. So not all 5G is made the same. So there's a speed, there's a bandwidth thing.
*  And then there's coverage. How many people get to enjoy today and how does the progress in the next
*  5, 10, 20, 30, 50 years you think looks like in terms of coverage? Great topic of conversation.
*  So let's talk about this. When I meet with regulators across the globe, I tell them
*  resistance is futile. Allocate every spectrum to wireless. Every spectrum needs to be allocated
*  to wireless. The reality is when we start moving from CDMA to OFDMA, we knew that this industry
*  has done a lot to get more bits per hertz. But the reality is the massive amount of improvements
*  that is required in capacity and in speed, you need more spectrum. There's not so much we can rely
*  on more bits per hertz. You just need more spectrum. And if you look, for example, what carriers
*  since the 2G era, they participate in different license and auctions and every spectrum they
*  accumulated from 2G or 3G or 4G. All of that, you may be able to get one or two channels max of
*  subsix, which is a channel is about 100 megahertz or 200 megahertz. And that's it. So we need more
*  spectrum. So 5G has been designed to work across every spectrum from the low frequency bands,
*  that's what we call the sub six, but you needed more. You needed to go to the millimeter wave.
*  So that's why 5G is a technology that you can deploy from 450 megahertz as an example, or 600
*  or 700, all the way to in the 42 gigahertz. And that's where millimeter wave comes into the
*  picture. Now, let's now connect this to your question about coverage of 5G. The easiest thing
*  to do is to deploy 5G in the new spectrum you can get, which is in the sub six, you see bands
*  being auctioned across the globe and the 3.5 gigahertz. There's nothing special about the
*  band is it's the only one that was available because everything else being useful for 4G.
*  And you can deploy on that going to existing cell towers and just put a new equipment without
*  having to build new towers. But when we go to technologies, just millimeter wave,
*  then you'll have to build more dense networks, you need to build more stations,
*  because a deployment in that case look like a Wi-Fi deployment, it's almost like Wi-Fi access
*  points. When you need to build more stations, you need permits, you need to build fiber,
*  so it takes more time to densify. So what you see happening is coverage has been built fast
*  with sub six across the globe. Now the United States also have the sub six.
*  So that gets you to coverage very fast. But millimeter wave, it's moving. And if you always
*  say, for example, Verizon, United States has had a leadership in building millimeter wave,
*  it takes time. I'll say cities like Chicago, Manhattan, starting to get coverage. It will be
*  a process over a number of years as you build those different access points type networks,
*  but is inevitable. There's not enough spectrum. So every 5G operators just a matter of time,
*  will have millimeter wave as well. Resistance is futile. Okay, so for millimeter wave,
*  we need density of access points. And what's the biggest resistance for Qualcomm,
*  for human civilization? Is it politicians, regulators, federal regulators? Is it
*  individual humans? Is it not enough money from the consumer perspective? Who is the biggest
*  pain in the butt? From a Qualcomm standpoint, but answering the question about what it takes
*  to build all this technology. I think regulators across the board understood the importance of 5G.
*  I have not met a regulator that said, it's really important to be late on 5G. I don't think anybody
*  wants to be late on 5G. And as a result, we've seen enormous amount of progress in getting
*  spectrum allocated to 5G. I think the real issue is the time that it takes to build infrastructure.
*  Investment in 5G infrastructure, especially millimeter wave, is like building roads and
*  ports. It's critical infrastructure. And those things take time. Like one of the number one
*  obstacle you're going to hear from operators is site permit. Sometimes they have to negotiate
*  municipality by municipality about permits to get new cell sites. But the networks will be
*  densified and you're going to need all of that capacity for the promise of the fully immersive
*  augmented reality that will replace phones and everything being connected 100% of the time.
*  This would not be a conversation with the CEO if I did not ask questions that make you nervous.
*  Some people raise concerns about there not being enough studies about the effects of 5G on the
*  human body. Is 5G safe? Look, I have a very simple answer to this question. As we built
*  new capabilities such as 5G, power is going down. Especially when you think about reducing
*  the number of base stations, the network's becoming more dense. So as you do that,
*  the power becomes lower. Power radiated from the phone and from the tower. As you get closer to
*  the tower, you don't need that much power to reach the tower. So as we move from 4G to 5G,
*  I think we see a reduction in the amount of power is required to close the radio link.
*  Now, I also have a number of organizations. The FCC, for example, has rigorous programs,
*  which they do a lot of tests to validate the safety of those devices. I think we have
*  been a model for other countries to adopt the same things.
*  Cellular has been around for a number of decades now. I think smartphones are our most beloved
*  device today. I would argue how it's difficult to answer those questions. I would argue that the
*  data to date, as we've seen in 3G and 4G, has shown that a lot of the initial concerns
*  were not valid. We look at 5G, even though it's new, it's just less power. So we look at it from
*  a physics standpoint. From a physics, from a biology perspective, there's a lot of evidence,
*  there's studies that show that it's not dangerous, that it is in fact safe. However,
*  the concern that people have is when you scale technology exponentially,
*  how will that change human civilization? I mean, that doesn't apply to 5G, that applies to every
*  technology. You said smartphone is the most beloved device, but love sometimes hurts.
*  The impact on society, we don't know. And there's a little bit of fear, there's both excitement and
*  fear. It's a great topic of conversation, actually. So let me give you my perspective on
*  this. And you started to see some things actually happening right now. So let me step back,
*  and let's talk about the fact that we are in a fully interconnected society. When you look
*  of the situations today, we talk about smartphones, largest development platform,
*  so much now of our life, we are connected to the smartphone, and we are all connected,
*  and we're connected. And then we're building digital twins of everything. So when you look
*  at that picture, this connected society, you started to have the following thoughts, which I
*  think are very healthy, which means in the same way that in the physical world, you're entitled
*  to some rights, you have obligations, and there's a lot of things that protect your integrity.
*  I think as a rule, we're going to see the society evolving so those things extend to your digital
*  being of people and things. And I think it's just natural. It's just a natural path. And you started
*  to see things like that. For example, the Europeans has done a lot in this area. I'll say the
*  Europeans probably ahead in the United States, thinking about privacy laws, digital privacy law,
*  most recently the DMA, the Digital Markets Act, which I think is a great thing. I think we believe
*  there's incredible thought into enable ability to regulate the digital markets so that there's
*  innovation and competition. Not a single company can control all the data and then decide how
*  things are going to be work on the digital realm. And even if we think about the potential things
*  like the metaverse as we're connecting physical and digital spaces. So I think it's a natural
*  evolution. Of course, regulation and laws always follow technology. But the fact that we're moving
*  to an interconnected society, there's no going back. We are a fully interconnected society.
*  But there is opportunity to think about how the digital twin should people and governments
*  should think about it so that we get the best of a technology without any downside.
*  Yeah. So when you say digital twin, that's one of the other things you're excited about,
*  which is the metaverse are basically building worlds in the digital space. And you have to
*  start to think about all the basic human rights that transfer from our physical meat vehicles
*  out to the digital copies of ourselves, representations of ourselves. It's really
*  important to think about. The thing you mentioned about regulators that has been,
*  this is me speaking, frustrating, is like you said, they follow technology. So sometimes they
*  don't get the technology at all. So they're very clumsy in writing laws that censor that technology
*  in interesting ways. They mean good, but they can do a lot of unintended damage. Now, both,
*  it's a dance. It's a beautiful dance, but I just wish governments were better dance partners. I
*  just see what they're kind of writing now about regulating social media and platforms like YouTube.
*  And it's just really, really clumsy. They don't understand how machine learning works. I recommend
*  their systems work. And I just wish they kind of caught up a little more because it's really
*  important to be great at regulation, but also it's important to let companies flourish and
*  embrace this new wave of technology. That weird dance, I'm more and more learning looking at public
*  policy, how much positive government can do and how much clumsy negative it can do,
*  unintentionally, just out of sheer incompetence or lack of curiosity about tech.
*  That's my rant about regulators.
*  I think it's a valid point. As I said before, I think the Europeans probably have a very good
*  framework, but the way I'll think about it, we depend on having the ability to innovate. We
*  depend on the free markets. We depend on the ability to create technology that will be disruptive.
*  But at the same time, I think the tech companies probably should spend time helping governments
*  understand, helping understand ahead of time so that they can be better prepared.
*  Let's talk about one of my favorite topics, Snapdragon.
*  Snapdragon is a system on a chip. This processor has probably powered billions of smartphones
*  over its pretty long history now, a decade and a half maybe. It's constantly iterating. There's
*  constantly just like a turmoil of beautiful innovations happening. Last year was Snapdragon
*  888 was the main one with a five nanometer and this year it's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It's a new
*  naming scheme. Okay. What's the sexiest, most beautiful idea or concept to you about Snapdragon?
*  Start there. The way I would describe it, and I think the reason we have been
*  successful with it, is to really understand how to build a platform, a single chip, like a single
*  chip, that will have every single capability if you want to make this smartphone in the palm of
*  your hand something that has all of your computing needs. It was the ability to get, from an
*  engineering standpoint, the ability to get into a single chip of not only all possible connectivity
*  technology from cellular to Wi-Fi to Bluetooth to every single constellation of satellites for
*  position location, but at the same time, a very power efficient single-threaded, multi-threaded
*  CPU. A GPU for all of your graphic demands, gaming, fastest growing segment for gaming
*  is mobile gaming. An artificial intelligence processor, which we call the neural processor unit,
*  and then a video engine, a multimedia engine for every single application, audio, everything.
*  It's a single chip that has every single computing technology you need in the phone.
*  What's exciting about it is what we already knew. For example, when you think about camera or
*  computer vision, you see that the advancements in this technology now happens in the smartphone
*  first versus additional cameras. The beauty about the Snapdragon is we always have this thing
*  within Qualcomm. The phone, it's small, you have to be able to hold it. You're going to touch your
*  face so you cannot be hot. You have to manage thermals. You expect to have a full day of battery
*  life. But then you want it to not be sending data into 10 or 100 megabits. You want gigabits.
*  You want it to be able to have eight core processors. You want to have a GPU with ray tracing.
*  You want to have all of those things that you can only get into sometimes a desktop PC.
*  To do all of that in your phone and be able to be in the leadership position generation after
*  generation is an incredible thing. We're very proud of that at Qualcomm.
*  You have to do the Wi-Fi, 5G, all the... You have to be good to everyone of those
*  technologies. Pack it all in. There's also pressure to make the thing faster and faster and faster.
*  There's more and more applications you're supposed to be effortlessly
*  using. You mentioned the NPU, GPU, CPU. They have to also dance together somehow. They have to
*  communicate well, share memory or not, depending on what the application is.
*  Your battery has to last all day. Think about that. From a company like Qualcomm,
*  we have to be good in each and every one of those technologies. We can't just say,
*  oh, we're a CPU company or a GPU company or we're AI company. We have to do everything.
*  What does it take to design a great processor? Design this system on a chip that you mentioned.
*  Is there some insight you can provide in this chaos of engineers, designers, leaders,
*  the people that think about how much this is all going to cost, the whole mess of it?
*  Of course, very partial about it. I've been in this company for probably more than 26 years.
*  I'll argue that there are a couple of things that are ingredients for success. We talk about the
*  fact that they have all those different technologies. They evolve at their own pace, and you have to be
*  good in each one of them, and you need them to make them working together. You need to have an
*  engineering organization with an incredible collaboration culture because everybody has to
*  be working. The train is going to leave the station. Every car needs to be there. When it
*  leaves the station, it needs to leave on time, especially in the phone business. You can't change
*  Christmas. You cannot change Black Friday. You cannot change all of the selling seasons. The
*  phones are going to launch on time, and every technology needs to be there. The engineer needs
*  to work as one, and we do have that at Qualcomm. The other thing, you have to have incredible
*  discipline because those are very complex systems. In one way, you have to design with quality
*  because in many cases, we're going to be ramping production even before we have the silicon back,
*  and you have to rely on our simulation models, and you have to rely on the fact that you design
*  for commercial applications. That takes a while to build, and it's probably been the
*  history of a semiconductor business at Qualcomm. You mean the framework of how many people can use
*  simulation software and all that kind of stuff to build the thing with a hard deadline that you
*  might not even get back from manufacture? You're not allowed to have any mistakes.
*  No wonder our name is Quality Communications.
*  Oh, I never even thought about the qual part. Quality. There's a bar that's high,
*  and you're not allowed to mess up. To me, as an engineer, that's exciting. Hard deadlines,
*  no room for mistakes. I love it. Super stressful, but I love it.
*  There are a couple of other small companies called Google and Apple. Google is now using
*  its own chips for the Pixel 6. Apple is using its own. How does Qualcomm outcompete
*  Google and Apple? How does it beat them?
*  We don't have to outcompete Google. Actually, if you look at our mobile strategy today,
*  and one thing I was very clear when I became CEO, I think there's a lot of confusion in the market.
*  Our mobile strategy is very clear. We are focused on making Snapdragon synonymous with
*  premium Android experience. That's what Snapdragon is.
*  Android. The phone of the people.
*  Yes. I just have a love for Android. I'm constantly talking trash to iPhone people. Sorry.
*  Go ahead.
*  Premium Android experiences. We do produce Snapdragon in multiple tier for every price point,
*  but every year you mentioned the HN1, and every year we provide the flagship product,
*  and then the other series that is trying to get the best of every possible technology at that time.
*  It's really focused on enabling the Android ecosystem. I'll give an example. You asked me
*  the question how to compete with Google. It's not about competing with Google. We're the number one
*  enabler of the Google Android ecosystem. The largest, the number one customer there
*  is Accolade Samsung. If you look what happened to Samsung, Samsung, I always had,
*  since I began my relationship with them, they always had their own chip.
*  They always had their own chip. If you'll just look at what happened right now with the Galaxy
*  S22 that just launched, they used to balance their business about 50% Qualcomm. They will get the
*  most advanced markets like the United States and China and Japan and Korea, they will assign a
*  Qualcomm. Then they'll have their own chip for the markets that they would be like more emerging
*  markets, open markets, markets that they have a control on the channel because they sell a lot of
*  appliances and other things. If you look what happened right now, GS22, 75% is Qualcomm.
*  Then the next large OEMs in the Android system are the Chinese ones. Companies like Xiaomi,
*  one of the fastest growing. It was number one in Europe at some point last year, then followed by
*  Oppo and OnePlus and Vivo. Those are some of the largest Qualcomm customers. They actually drive
*  the Android ecosystem. That's our mobile strategy and fully aligned with Google.
*  It's working. I'm not to get into a lot of the investor conversation, but we're also happy we
*  became a beneficiary of the shifts that we saw in the marketplace. As Huawei became a smaller OEM
*  as a result of the sanctions, we saw the rise of a lot of the other OEMs from China, especially for
*  China domestic market, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo. They moved to the premium category and they're all
*  doing that with Qualcomm. We're actually very fortunate and happy with the position we are
*  in mobile business. We do have an Apple relationship. We provide modem technology to
*  Apple. It's a multi-year relationship. Apple has been very public that they are
*  investing to develop their own modem, but the Qualcomm strategy has been clear. We're really
*  focused on Snapdragon. Our mobile strategy is not defined by providing a cellular modem to Apple.
*  Mobile strategy is this that we just talked about. It's about the unique thing of Snapdragon that
*  has every single technology integrated into a single SoC. It provides a premium experience.
*  That's what we're doing and focusing on the Android ecosystem.
*  I don't know if I can ask you this kind of question. It's like picking your children
*  or something like this, but what smartphone with a Snapdragon? You mentioned Samsung Galaxy S22,
*  OnePlus. Those are phones I personally really enjoy. What phone do you currently use? Do you
*  have multiple phones? I do have multiple phones, but I do use Galaxy S22. That's your favorite one?
*  All right. Well, you heard it here first, folks. Okay. Excellent. Can Qualcomm also, let's take a
*  brief step away from mobile. Can it take on Intel and Apple and other such companies in the laptop
*  and desktop space? The nature of what a computer is seems to be changing. It's like smartphones
*  merging. It's all being a smartphone just with the biggest screen or something like this. What
*  does the future of that look like? Before I answer that question, let me just step back a little bit
*  because I'm sure we can talk more about those things. The reality is Qualcomm is changing a lot.
*  I know we spend a lot of time talking about 5G and smartphone and Snapdragon. I think that has
*  been what had defined Qualcomm for many years, but the reality is even consistent with that
*  5G conversation, which is a technology to connect everything, Qualcomm is also changing.
*  Our technology that was in many cases designed for phones, and we said it in the beginning,
*  connectivity and processing is going to virtually every industry. As a result, Qualcomm
*  is really changing with it and expanding to a number of different addressable markets.
*  Some of those markets is the PC, as you talk about it, the conversions of mobile and PC.
*  The reason I'm excited about this because you see a lot of things happening that
*  bring this right front and center when you think about the future technology.
*  So what we learn with the pandemic is that the number one use case of personal computers
*  is communications. It is interesting when you think about that. That's the number one use case
*  on a PC today is communications. It's actually funny because in the cellular industry, actually
*  I'll say, let me step back. In the telecom industry, we've been chasing this killer application of
*  video telephony for decades. I remember back then in the wireline, even before the internet and IP,
*  ISDN, you remember those AT&T desk phones with a little screen and they said,
*  you can do video telephony. We don't watch that in Back to the Future 2.
*  Then when we started developing 3G, people said, what's the application for having data to a cell
*  video telephony? Then we started doing 4G. In the beginning, people said, well, why do you need all
*  this broadband, all video telephony? But it took a pandemic to make video telephony the killer
*  application. That's now the number one use case on a PC. Now think about that for a second.
*  Personal computers now, there are technologies that people, when they're going to buy a PC,
*  they didn't care much about it. Now they do. Camera. Camera. How good is the camera?
*  The audio. Is that connected? How good is the connectivity? Do you have the latest and greatest
*  Wi-Fi and cellular? What's the battery life? Because you're going to be working from anywhere.
*  Sometimes you know that, sometimes you're not. So all those things, what's the portability like?
*  So those things started to change how we should think about the PC. But I won't stop there.
*  Let me talk about another trend. So, and it all come as a result of what we saw in the pandemic.
*  Let's say that you are, you're an engineer, you do computer aided design. You have an advanced
*  desktop computer or workstation in your office, but you want to work from home someday. So you're
*  not going to move that to your home. So what do you need to do? You're going to have to rely on that.
*  You're going to run that on the cloud and you're going to run it on the cloud. You need high
*  bandwidth because you almost want the cloud to be the same as your computer for that use case.
*  That's the 5G on demand computing use case. The use 5G is almost a link between two computers.
*  But then, you know, CIOs are saying, well, my workforce is going home for some days. I want
*  all the data to be in the cloud. You look at, for example, Microsoft OneDrive or the ability to
*  collaborate, you need the bandwidth. So when you put all of those things together, you start thinking
*  about what's the next generation PC? And that's the opportunity for Qualcomm. I'll just give an
*  example. Back in Mobile World Congress recently, Lenovo, they have a line of enterprise laptops
*  called the ThinkPad. I'm sure you're familiar with it. So they announced the ThinkPad based on
*  Snapdragon. With 5G on, 28 hours of battery life. So that's next generation. So just a nice screen
*  with extremely high, nice screen and keyboard and extremely high connectivity to maybe an even more
*  like a more powerful machine in the cloud. Something more the data connecting to the data
*  can take to compute all that kind of stuff. You have the camera capabilities. And let me go
*  one step more. Microsoft talking about some of the features they're doing now using on Windows 11,
*  using Snapdragon. Remember, we talked about a Snapdragon has an AI processor inside there. So
*  one of the cool features Microsoft's talking about it is you can be on a Teams call and you
*  can make sure your eyes are looking at the camera 100% of the time. Well, that's an interesting,
*  so they can be talking about that. And you do that with AI. Yes. That's really tricky to pull off.
*  For example, the reason I'm a huge stickler for doing these in person, these conversations in
*  person, it's really tough to get right, but it's a worthy challenge. So that's where the metaverse
*  hopes to adjust. Because you said the importance of this telephony of humans connecting,
*  teleporting themselves, getting that right is really difficult. There's a lot of people hate
*  Zoom meetings, but that doesn't mean you can't improve that experience and get rid of the hate.
*  A lot of people hate talking to their car too, because the voice, the natural language processing
*  is terrible. But when it's not, it's a beautiful thing. So getting that right is-
*  This is an opportunity. This is an opportunity. Think about it. It starts with the PC making
*  the PC giving you a better experience for Teams, but then it goes right back into this trend of
*  connecting physical and digital spaces and all the work we're doing with the metaverse and virtual
*  reality and the reality in the future is why not call somebody or connect with somebody with a
*  hologram? It's possible. And also to mention some increasing amount of intelligence in our cars.
*  So semi-autonomous, autonomous cars and the interactivity between human and car,
*  which for me, things are really exciting. Let me ask you a big question. So when aliens, again,
*  now on the other side, right, and humans destroy themselves through nuclear war centuries from now-
*  Let's hope not.
*  Let's hope not. But in case, let's just hypothetical thought experiment. And they write a history of
*  humanity in the 21st century. What would they remember Qualcomm in the 21st century as a
*  company? Would it be a car company? Think of all the crazy pivots that might happen in the next
*  50 years. Because you said Qualcomm enables all of these things with 5G and there'll be probably
*  other Gs. It keeps increasing. So basically connectivity and computation and everything
*  becomes connected and everything is capable of computation. Might you become a robotics
*  and car company? I will argue we already an automotive company today. But let me tell what
*  I would like Qualcomm to be remembered and recognized for. I think everyone that knows
*  Qualcomm immediately connect us, pun intended, to connectivity and wireless. But the reality is
*  we've been actually the company providing intelligence and processing to everything on
*  the edge. Everything outside the data center that we're doing. Those billions of devices,
*  they're going to be connected. And that's kind of explained when we talk about the connected
*  intelligent edge, the beyond phones, cars, species, and all of those. And the broader IoT,
*  as we talk about everything will be connected and intelligent. And that's what we want Qualcomm to
*  be recognized for.
*  So by the way, for people who are not familiar, there's some technical jargon. But people use
*  the word edge, like edge computing. By the way, that's probably changing what that even means.
*  But it's basically everything that's not a giant thing that's making a lot of noise in a building
*  somewhere. So it's mobile devices and the mobile devices of all kinds of, well, refrigerators is
*  not mobile, but it would be edge. So it's like, what's a sandwich? That kind of discussion.
*  But basically edge computing is the edge of that expanding space that you mentioned that Qualcomm
*  was trying to connect and enable with computation.
*  Huge and simple way to describe what the edge is and edge computing is. I think as we think about
*  the evolution of the data center, you need to bring the computational closer to the devices.
*  Also, when you put the computation together with the connectivity, at the same time, you're going
*  to see a lot of advancement of artificial intelligence happening closer or at the device.
*  Look, I have a simple way to describe it. Remember, in the beginning of this conversation,
*  we talk about in the 4G era, broadband and mobile computing evolved side by side. If you're going
*  to have broadband, you might as well have a computer in the palm of your hand. So we needed
*  to invest in those two technologies. In 5G, AI develops side by side. You're connected to the
*  cloud 100% of the time. You have a high bandwidth and you have now a smart and intelligent thing
*  that can make decisions in real time, provide context information to the cloud to make the
*  models more accurate and as well compare and contrast with the cloud. So there's going to be
*  an exponential development AI happening with all the edge devices. The devices that are outside
*  the data center and computation is going to go alongside that. A great example is the car.
*  We haven't talked much about the car, but Qualcomm is now,
*  you could argue, as much as an automotive company as well as a company working 26 global brands.
*  And it's easy to see if you look at our mobile heritage and we talk about form factors, thermal,
*  battery life, you're not going to put a server in the trunk of a car, but you need as much
*  computational capabilities. And that's what we see Qualcomm providing as the car becomes a connected
*  computer on wheels. We provide the computational and all the sensors for you to do assisted driving
*  for the new digital cockpit experience connecting the car to the cloud. And it's all of that's
*  happening at the end. Does Qualcomm want to be the brain of a lot of autonomous vehicles in the
*  future of different, you said brands like Mercedes, I don't know, whatever, just whatever car, you know,
*  cars have the sexy thing they do and then it defines their brand and so on. And then there's
*  the brain that doesn't need to have branding suppose, you know. So does Qualcomm see that or
*  will I be able to buy a Qualcomm car? Like literally? No, you're not going to be able to
*  buy a Qualcomm car, but we are ready. We're ready on our way to become, you know, the brains of the
*  car. The way you should think about Qualcomm automotive strategy is the car companies realize
*  they need to become technology companies. You just look for example of the market cap of some of the
*  new electrical commerce and compare them with the legacy car companies. Which one is that? I heard
*  of... Well, let's just use an example. One of them lives in Austin. Let's say Rivian, right? Rivian.
*  Oh, that one too, yes. You know, the car companies are not going away. It's actually a mistake not
*  to bet in the car companies. The car companies need a technology partner that will provide
*  the digital chassis for them. And that's what we're doing. So if you look at Qualcomm,
*  we talk about a Snapdragon digital chassis. So we want to be the preferred technology partner
*  of the car companies. And I think it's working. Strategy is working right now. So basically
*  helping the car companies accelerate into becoming technology companies. Connecting the car to the
*  cloud, redesign the interior of the digital cockpit experience, and provide the computation
*  and sensor capabilities for autonomy and assisted driving. On the topic of robots, when millions or
*  billions of robots roam the earth in the future among us humans, and I'm for one concerned in a
*  small percentage, but largely I'm excited about that future. Will Qualcomm be the thing that powers
*  their brain? We have in our IoT business, which has been one of the fastest growing business for us,
*  a number of robotics engagement. So I'll give you some example.
*  If you look of the Amazon Astro, you're familiar with that? There's two Snapdragon in there.
*  This is really exciting. They're supposed to ship it to me. Where is it? Okay. But anyway,
*  that's really cool. I didn't know it was Snapdragon. Yeah, we're working with robotics
*  in industrial, of course drones. We're getting more and more traction for robotics. Sorry to
*  interrupt. Industrial robotics too. Especially when you think about what's going to happen
*  with the factory of the future, the industrial side of the future, the warehouse of the future,
*  when you bring 5G, for example, to it, and you have a number of different use cases,
*  and then you see a lot of robotics application. And of course drones. The most famous,
*  I will consider that a robot, the most famous robot in the world right now, it's powered by
*  Snapdragon, which is the Mars Ingenuity helicopter. The whole helicopter, the cameras and everything
*  is powered by Snapdragon. And talking about exciting thing for an engineer, the same
*  Snapdragon that goes to a phone and it can go to a galaxy phone, for example, Samsung, the same,
*  not a special one, went all the way to Mars. It's exploring other planets looking for alien life.
*  It maybe gets to meet them. Wouldn't that be interesting if a Snapdragon is the thing that
*  first sees an alien? It's like, what the hell? We did not program this in the computer vision.
*  I want to use the example to go back to the conversation we had about quality.
*  As an engineer, you need to make sure it works. Can you imagine if it gets over there in Mars
*  and it doesn't work? Listen, this is very stressful. What NASA, what SpaceX, what all those
*  companies are doing is extremely stressful. The room for mistakes is tiny, but that's super
*  exciting for an engineer once again. There's been a global semiconductor chip shortage. So from your
*  perspective, just to be interesting to get your expert analysis of the situation, what do you
*  think are the main reasons and how is Qualcomm being affected and how can it help in this,
*  in the future, things like it? Okay. That's a big topic of conversation.
*  And we only have five minutes. So I'll try to be as objective as I can.
*  So first, let's talk about what caused it. And you hear a lot of different things. I will try to
*  put it within the right context. The first thing that caused it really is the acceleration of
*  digital transformation of pretty much everything in every industry. Every industry has been
*  digitally transformed. And as such, the amount of semiconductors that are required is much larger.
*  Just to give you a practical example, if you think about the automotive as an example,
*  the cars, there are cars, there are launch, a new model launching today. The new model launching
*  today most likely has 10X the amount of chips off the prior model. And the model is people
*  working on this coming in next, probably 10X that one. So you see the amount of silicon and then
*  billions of things become smart. More and more data goes to the cloud, the data center grows.
*  So the floor for semiconductor consumptions went up by a lot. Then you have things that
*  aggravated this. The pandemic aggravated this. There's a couple of trends from the pandemic,
*  the enterprise transformation of the home. The home became an enterprise, massive amounts of
*  upgrades on broadband and IoT. The office has changed to the way we work now, including the
*  ability to support collaboration tools and video. Then you have the higher demand for products during
*  the pandemic because people wanted to be connected. People bought new phones and new tablets and new
*  computers, new gaming. So all of those things came on top of that as the aggravated issue.
*  But they're not the main issue. The main issue is exactly a long term growth of digital.
*  So what I'm hearing you say is the pandemic was not the cause, it was an aggravation.
*  Is there a way we can support as a human civilization in terms of manufacture,
*  in terms of supply, the kind of growth that you're talking about in devices and so on? Is there
*  high level ideas you can say of what that's required there?
*  Yes. I think that's the second part of the answer. So what's happening now? How are we going to get
*  out of this? So we see a lot of capacity investments put into place by the industry.
*  We had invested a lot with our suppliers. A lot of the suppliers had made plans about
*  increasing the capacity. The industry is planning to double its total semiconductor manufacturing
*  capacity within the next five years, as an example. So that's already happening.
*  And then you see things which are actually good. They're good. The initiative such as the United
*  States Chips Act and now the European Chips Act. The United States Chips Act is about $52 billion,
*  the Europeans about $43. Their goal combined is to get at least 50% of the consumption
*  with manufacturing installed within the US and European geographies. And that's also very good.
*  That's yet another incentive for more manufacturing capacity to be built and to be built with a
*  geographic distributed way, which that's how you plan supply chain. So those I think are good
*  things. So if anything we learn through the crisis is that semiconductor is important.
*  Semiconductor companies are important and we need to invest in semiconductors.
*  Returning to the grilling of the CEO with the hard questions.
*  This is almost for my own education of the space. You mentioned regulators.
*  Qualcomm paid out and received payment of billions of dollars in settlement and fines.
*  There seems to be a lot of huge lawsuits in the space. How do you explain that?
*  Does this get in the way of innovation or does it promote it?
*  I will rephrase it by saying there used to be a lot of lawsuits in the space. In addition of
*  what we do in semiconductors, our processors and our modems, the Snapdragon platform,
*  we also have a licensing business which has been a part of the company since the beginning.
*  As the largest inventors of the essential technology in 2G, CDMA, 3G, 4G, and 5G.
*  Qualcomm contributed that to the standards. So we always had this model that
*  rather than invent the technology and be the only one producing the products,
*  we license so everyone can produce it. As such, we receive intellectual property
*  for these standard essential patents. As part of our past dispute with Apple,
*  they're my customers. As part of that, I think the licensing model got tested in every geography.
*  We succeeded in every single geography to validate the pro-competitiveness of this model.
*  I would argue that besides being the most successful licensing business to date in the industry,
*  probably the one that's been battle tested and is most stable because there's not a single
*  jurisdiction that we have not had to validate that model. So it's part of our past and what
*  it creates is probably create a lot of stability in our licensing business. But having said that,
*  the growth of the company is in the semiconductor space.
*  In the semiconductor, licensing is you come up with a pretty good idea. You have a bunch
*  of smart people coming up with cool ideas. Then once you come up with that idea, you sell that
*  idea to others that get to use it. That's essentially what a license is.
*  The license revenue we have is for what we call the SCP, standard essential patents,
*  that are part of the 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G standards. So if you want to build anything with 5G,
*  you need to get a license from Qualcomm because it uses Qualcomm. Essential technology is part
*  of the standard. A slightly different model or a lot different model with the semiconductor
*  is you design, you inject a bunch of fascinating ideas how to build the Snapdragon. Then there's,
*  because it's a fabulous company, you have somebody build the chip and then goes into a phone with
*  the branding and all that kind of stuff. That has less players involved. It's not a license.
*  We sell the product. We don't license semiconductor technology. We build products
*  and we sell products. This is your first year as a CEO.
*  Not one year yet. Not one year yet.
*  Let's hope it'll be in June. It'll be one year. Okay. This is a company that's involved
*  with a lot of fascinating technologies and it's touching the lives of billions of people.
*  A lot of complicated stuff. Like I said, licensing technologies. You have to collaborate with
*  manufacturers. You have to then work with however many you said, car companies and all these
*  clients and so on. You have to, with tech companies, Apple and so on. What's that like?
*  What lessons have you learned about leadership and maybe about yourself as a human being from this
*  first, almost a year, soon to be a year as a CEO of this incredible, this complex, this large company?
*  That's a loaded question. Let me answer in reverse order. First thing that I learned,
*  I think is probably common across CEOs, especially in our industry is it will be great
*  if I had more time. I think there's, especially because we grow in so many areas and there's so
*  many things to learn, so many relationships to build, time to spend with a number of different
*  technologies. It kind of reflects really the size of the opportunity that exists for Qualcomm.
*  Qualcomm, it is really growing in a number of different directions all at the same time.
*  So it did get busier. Part of this is because I'm spending a lot of time understanding the
*  new industries we're going in and building relationships. Second thing, which is a lot
*  to do with how I think about things and a little bit of my personality. At the end of the day,
*  business partnerships are really done by people. I think the importance of having
*  trusted relationships for the long term is extremely important and I've been dedicated
*  to do that as CEO. We're not a company that plays for the short term. We don't. When we build new
*  partnerships, we expect that to be for decades. So I spend time doing that and think that's
*  important for Qualcomm. The other part of your question is we do have a lot of opportunities in
*  all different areas. What we like, and I've been fortunate enough to become CEO at a time,
*  that a lot of the trends are pointing to our technology. We talk about some of them. We talk
*  about merger of physical and digital spaces. We talk about the transformation of the automobile.
*  We talk about the merge of computing and mobile. The enterprise transformation of the home. There
*  are many of those trends and those trends create opportunities for Qualcomm to be
*  providing technology first and as such, we're in a hurry. So I'm in a little bit of a hurry
*  because I think the opportunity is incredible for technology, but having fun and enjoying the job.
*  Is there a burden because of so much of what you said is partnerships and almost like friendships,
*  connections with other human beings? Me as an introvert that has a lot of social anxiety,
*  that seems extremely stressful. So is there that burden on your shoulders? You have to wake up
*  every day and talk to friends you've had for many years. It can be, you know, and then convince them
*  and make partnerships with them, talk with them, describe to them the future, sell them an idea,
*  and then yourself grow because you don't know what the heck the future is going to be like.
*  And you have to project both confidence and humility, all those kinds of things. Is that exhausting?
*  Um, it is exhausting, but it's something I do like to do and it's not only with partners,
*  really. It's also internally to your employees, I think, to get alignment on the vision and
*  faith in the vision and execute. And at the end of the day, we're very fortunate. We have a lot of
*  smart people, so people, if they're aligned with the vision, they know what to do. And then, of
*  course, as CEO, you have to convince your investors that that's the right idea as well.
*  If you can put on your wise sage hat, do you have advice for young people in high school and college?
*  You yourself started from the humble beginnings in Brazil, maybe a bit of a wild, risky decision to
*  go to Japan, and now are at the head of one of the biggest, most successful, most impactful companies
*  in the world. Given that story, can you give advice to young people today that,
*  you know, how they can have a career or just the life they can be proud of?
*  I think the first thing, and of course, all those answers are going to relate to my own experience,
*  right? The first thing is, it always worked for me to have a plan, even if the plan is just what I'm
*  going to do in the next two years, but what do I want to do? Where do I want to go? And I think
*  it's important for people, especially young people, is to really, you know, have a dream and go pursue
*  it. I mean, have dreams, not go back to bed to sleep. It's really what do you want to accomplish,
*  and then what it's going to take to do that. And then believe in yourself. You know, like I said,
*  I joined Qualcomm as an engineer, and I didn't have any plans when I joined to be CEO, but I do
*  want to, as an engineer, what do I want to do? Where do I want to contribute what I want to work
*  on and then keep evolving from that point in time. The other thing is, this is an advice, it's more
*  of like career advice that I got early in my career was extremely helpful for me, and I will give that
*  advice to everyone that is interested. Spend time understanding what are the things you're good at
*  and what are the things you're not. Like, what is the real border between your area of competence
*  and your area of incompetence? And once you see that, once you see that, you know exactly what
*  you have to work on, and you can say, if that's what I want to go next, this is the gap I need
*  to do it. And it's faster when you can identify yourself before other people can tell you.
*  Then it leads to automatically the next step. Surround yourself with the people that are very
*  good at the things that you're not. So you have to be radically honest about the things that you're
*  not good at, but given what you're passionate about, you need to get good at, or you would like to get
*  good at, and surround yourself with those people. How often did the plans you make actually work out?
*  You said it's important to make plans. You didn't say anything about it's important to execute on
*  those plans? More than 50 percent success rate. Try to keep it above 50. Try to keep it above 50.
*  What was the whole, why did you end up in Japan? You know, I've been fortunate enough to work in
*  cellular and wireless my entire career. So I always liked communications. When I entered
*  engineering school, my dad was an electrical engineer, but he worked with the utility company.
*  He wanted me to graduate in traditional electrical engineering, like energy generation, distribution.
*  But I like electronics communication, so I ended up doing both. I always liked communication. I was
*  fascinated by wireless communication. So my first job out of college, I started working for a
*  Japanese company down in Brazil. It was NEC. Within about a year in, they transferred me to
*  Tokyo. They asked me to go to the headquarters, and it was the first time I left Brazil.
*  A little bit different from Brazil. Very different. It's in the other side of the planet,
*  and that's how it started. You said your father's an electrical engineer.
*  Do you think what you're doing now makes your father proud?
*  I think he's very proud. He tells me that I'm still the same person that never changed.
*  Does he give you advice? Does he criticize what you're doing?
*  My mom and dad still give me advice today. I'm very fortunate for that. But he's proud.
*  Also proud because there are very few Brazilians that have achieved a position as CEO of a company
*  the size of Qualcomm. I do know that I also carry a burden, especially for the Latino community,
*  to be an inspiration for them and make sure I set a good example.
*  So not just your mom and dad, but the culture of the people that were originally your home.
*  Life is finite. Do you think about your own mortality?
*  Look, I'm a devout Christian, so I'm a big believer that this is just a transition.
*  But don't spend a lot of time thinking about that. I am somebody good, better, and different that
*  try as much as possible to leave the present, and that's what I do.
*  And try to make the present better on this place here on Earth.
*  Absolutely.
*  And that some of these technologies, some of these ideas are kind of
*  a different kind of immortality as well because they propagate through time and have impact on
*  people in the best possible way. So technology can be scary, technology can be destructive,
*  but it seems like in the end it can do a lot of good.
*  More good, there's more good than bad.
*  What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? I asked you about aliens observing us.
*  What's the meaning of life? Christiano, what's the meaning of life? Easy questions.
*  That's not an easy question at all. I think that's a question, at least for me,
*  you have to answer individually. But I do believe we're all here for purpose.
*  In my prayers, I always ask that I stay on track to whatever my purpose is,
*  but I do believe we're here for purpose and we need to do the best we can during the time we
*  have on this Earth.
*  So that means create beautiful things for you as an engineer?
*  Yes, and create beautiful things.
*  What about love? What's the role of love in the human condition?
*  Love is very important and it's an essential part of being human. It comes in the package.
*  I think if you look at the situation, what's happening right now, I think
*  you look at the situation with some of the underprivileged communities,
*  you look at the homeless situation, I think we all need more love.
*  People that build incredible technology sometimes forget the love part. It's all integrated.
*  Thinking about humanity is really important when you build tools that empower that humanity.
*  At least I personally believe we're all capable of both evil and good.
*  We have to build technology, build societies, build governments, build communities that
*  inspire us to connect with the good part within all of us.
*  I'm a big believer that technology is at the end the force for good.
*  If you just look, not trying to move away from a deep discussion to a more
*  specific technical one, but if we start the conversation talking about smartphones,
*  smartphones really the first time that you could say that everybody in the world was able to
*  connect to the internet and connect to each other. I think that empowerment that that provided,
*  it's an incredible force for good. Well, the company you lead, the technology you've created,
*  one of them that I'm especially excited about, which is Snapdragon, the whole line of processors
*  there. Currently, I would say at about 10 billion transistors. If you think about the human brain,
*  it's about 100 billion neurons. I think 11 Samsung Galaxy S22s are already smarter than me,
*  and that's being nice to me. I'm really honored that you spent an extremely valuable time with me.
*  Even though you said Pelé is the favorite player, beyond all of that, I think you're an
*  incredible person, an incredible leader, and you lead an incredible engineering company.
*  Thank you for doing that. Thank you so much. Thank you for the kind words.
*  Really a pleasure having this conversation. I really had a lot of fun doing it, and
*  thank you for having me in your podcast. Thanks for listening to this conversation
*  with Christiano Amman. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, let me leave you with some words from Stephen Hawking.
*  For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened,
*  which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk and we learned to listen.
*  Speech has allowed the communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together to build
*  the impossible. Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking, and its greatest
*  failures by not talking. It doesn't have to be like this. Our greatest hopes could become reality
*  in the future. With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded.
*  All we need to do is make sure we keep talking. Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
