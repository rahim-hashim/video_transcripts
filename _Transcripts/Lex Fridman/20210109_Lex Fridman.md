# Dan Gable: Olympic Wrestling, Mental Toughness & the Making of Champions | Lex Fridman Podcast #152
**Lex Fridman:** [January 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRzelZlKl7E)
*  The following is a conversation with Dan Gable from two years ago.
*  I did not previously publish this conversation as part of this podcast,
*  but as a separate thing, and as a result, it did not receive many listens.
*  Let me be honest and say that while I usually don't care about how many listens
*  or views something gets in this one case, I feel like I failed one of my heroes.
*  I feel I didn't properly introduce a truly special human being to an audience
*  that might find him as inspiring as I did.
*  Dan Gable is one of the greatest Olympic athletes of all time.
*  Bigger than records and medals, to many like myself, he's a symbol of guts,
*  spirit, mental toughness and relentless hard work.
*  As a wrestler, he was undefeated in high school, undefeated in college
*  until his very last match, and having lost that match, he found another level
*  and became a world champion and an Olympic champion.
*  And most importantly, he did so perfectly dominating his opponents.
*  He did not surrender a single point at the 1972 Olympic Games.
*  As a coach, he led the Iowa Hawkeyes to 15 national titles and 25
*  consecutive Big Ten championships.
*  He coached 152 All-Americans, 45 national champions, 106 Big Ten champions,
*  and 12 Olympians, including eight medalists.
*  He's the author of several books, including A Wrestling Life 1 and 2,
*  and Coaching Wrestling Successfully.

*  As a side note, let me say that I spent a few days in Iowa and got to attend
*  a wrestling dual meet in the historic Carver Hawkeye Arena.
*  Part of me wanted to stay in Iowa forever, to drill takedowns, to start
*  a family, to live life simply.
*  Wrestling is one of the pure sports, both beautiful and brutal, where both
*  mental toughness and technical mastery of the highest form are rewarded with victory.
*  And everything else is punished with defeat.
*  And every such loss weighs heavy on the minds of anyone who has ever
*  stepped on the wrestling mat, including myself.
*  The same is true for one of the greatest wrestlers in history of the sport, the
*  man who graciously welcomed me into his home for this conversation,
*  the legend, Dan Gable.

*  And now here's my conversation with Dan Gable.
*  You're persistent.
*  And I love that because you've been trying to get me on this podcast for a long time.
*  And until I saw you on another podcast and you said you were Russian,
*  did I call you back?
*  Then it was over.
*  Because Russia to me, you know, is leading the world in wrestling almost every year.
*  What's the difference between American wrestling and Russian wrestling?
*  You showed me this painting.
*  Well, it's MIT.
*  It's science.
*  It's science.
*  You know, and they really study the sport.
*  They're really good technically.
*  They're really, really good in strategy.
*  They don't really push like the real toughness.
*  They don't push like conditioning.
*  Right.
*  And so Americans, we need what they have.
*  Russians need what we have.
*  And when you get two together, and for me, why I could beat the Russians is
*  because I went their way a little bit.
*  But I kept my toughness.
*  But you're known for your toughness.
*  Yeah, but I wasn't known for my art.
*  I wasn't known for my science.
*  So when did you become a bit of an artist?
*  It took a loss.
*  The Larry Owens loss.
*  Most people thought I was already an artist just because I won 181 straight
*  matches in seven years.
*  And not just winning, but you know, kind of punishing people.
*  And from that point of view, yeah, I might've been pretty good,
*  but I had a long ways to go yet.
*  And I didn't really realize that, or I should have, I should say, I didn't
*  really know how to get it out of me until I had a loss.
*  And then I realized I got to buckle down, learn some of that science,
*  become more of an artist.
*  How do you become an artist?
*  So that's the Russian way has this drilling technique, thousands of reps.
*  How do you think you work on the science, the art part?
*  You got to study the best in the world.
*  I think Dave Schultz was our guy in America that probably showed us that
*  being artistic, you needed that.
*  And he studied it.
*  He went over there as a high schooler and rustled in some major tournaments over
*  there and he saw their ways.
*  He used that Russian science and then he was already an American and he saw what,
*  how I trained athletes.
*  He saw what I did in the Olympics.
*  He saw what other people, how we held up and he applied that as well.
*  But I'd have to say he was more of the artistic type.
*  He was more of a Russian than an American when it came to wrestling.
*  You've coached 45 national champions, 106 big 10 champions and eight Olympic
*  medalists, which is incredible.
*  What is a common thread between them and what are maybe some of the fundamental
*  differences?
*  I think the common thread is that they all had one of those two avenues that we
*  talked already and because we intertwined them.
*  So in a Russian wrestling room, they got the same people.
*  Most of the time in an American wrestling room, we had the same people.
*  But when I was out recruiting, at first I recruited just attitude, but I
*  needed more than that.
*  I needed some genetics in that wrestling room to actually that hard work people.
*  You know, they could look and see, wow, that execution, that's unbelievable.
*  But yet I can beat that guy after the first minute.
*  So you think, you think the art, the, the technique is genetics.
*  You're born with it.
*  You think it's not something.
*  I think your pop and your, you know, your ability to move and timing and your
*  quickness and your strength.
*  You know, the Russians, they usually picked out the people that can go into that
*  sport.
*  That was the old fashioned sports school.
*  But it's, it's mostly like when you see, when you walk into a Russian
*  wrestling room, you see him hitting skills, techniques, you know, you don't
*  see him banging against each other that much.
*  But then when practice is over, you might not see a bunch of sprints.
*  You might see him walk over to the, the ropes and they drop down from the
*  ceiling and they'll jump up and climb a rope.
*  Boom, boom, boom.
*  And then they come down and then they don't jump right back on.
*  They have three or four other guys go and then they jump back on.
*  Whereas I probably made my guys climb them, get right back down, climb
*  them right back again.
*  But I also realized that I had to have a mix of that.
*  What was the role?
*  What was your role?
*  I mean, those guys looked up and Dan Gable and what was the role in helping
*  these athletes become their best, these national champions?
*  First of all, prove that you were.
*  Knew what you were doing in terms of technique or in terms of everything,
*  everything they just, you had to be the first guy there and the last guy to
*  leave and you had to be the most dedicated guy, even though they were the
*  ones that's trying to win the championships.
*  You had to prove that you were going to work just as hard as they were as a coach.
*  And what does that look like?
*  What?
*  So you can see it when you, you know, when you see it, well, you, you, you're
*  there ahead of them and you're there after they leave, you know, it's that,
*  it's that simple.
*  I'm picking up after them and you're analyzing them.
*  You, you outwork them, you outwork them and you outthink them.
*  And so, you know, use that type of strategy.
*  And over time, when you prove it works, because some of my kids that were the
*  best kids in the world really shouldn't have been a wrestler.
*  I mean, they weren't very coordinated, but they worked so
*  hard to develop themselves.
*  What was your role in that process?
*  I mean, that means pushing kids to their limit.
*  If, if you're not, but you can't push kids to their limit.
*  And even when you push them to their limit, that's not their limit because
*  their limits above and beyond that.
*  I mean, yeah, coaches sometimes accidentally don't, they lose kids
*  because of the heat, because of hard work and all that.
*  And you gotta, you gotta know where to, when to back off.
*  You gotta read your athletes.
*  And by that, I mean, you gotta know them pretty well.
*  Every once in a while you make a little bit of a mistake, but if you don't react
*  right on that mistake before it gets too far, then it's going to be a casualty.
*  And I don't mean somebody dying necessarily, but maybe something that could
*  turn them off or maybe something that could run them away or maybe something
*  that, wow, that was close.
*  Maybe shouldn't have pushed them that far.
*  So you really have to be very educated and it's not just what you know.
*  It's what you know about them.
*  And I'm not talking about the team.
*  I'm talking about each guy.
*  Individuals.
*  Yeah.
*  Each person on the team.
*  And you, you know it how you see it in their eyes.
*  How, because you're the first one there and you're the last one to leave.
*  And, and you set in the environment with them.
*  You're there for, in the morning for practice.
*  Sometimes you're there in the afternoon for two or three hours after practice.
*  You might have a, a hot room or you might have a sauna or a steam or a whirlpool.
*  And you get in there with them and you listen, you know, you're not
*  just feeding out information.
*  You do that, but you're taking in a lot of that too.
*  And I'm telling you, when you get in an atmosphere that they're relaxed
*  and they feel comfortable, it's like a massage.
*  And that's after practice in one of those areas that people are around you.
*  You learn a lot.
*  I mean, you got a lot to learn as a coach.
*  And when you get in that atmosphere, when all of a sudden you feel like very
*  comfortable, words start flowing.
*  And when those words flow, you take them in as a coach and there's something
*  probably going to be said that you can do and act upon that's going to help
*  certain situations.
*  I've saved a couple of kids lives for sure that we're on the brink.
*  You know, sometimes performance is at such a high level, in a high level
*  atmosphere that life and death is actually involved.
*  And I don't mean pushing a kid to where he just dies, but I mean, he might
*  feel himself as a failure and he may go home and take his own life.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, but that's part of it.
*  You're putting so much heart, so much blood and heart and sweat and every,
*  your whole meaning of life becomes winning.
*  So, and sometimes it's so hard to lose within that context.
*  So if you're in your, I think the first wrestling life you wrote about Chad
*  Zapito who lost, I mean, incredible wrestler, but lost in three finals in
*  the nationals and has this tattoo of a hawk clawing out the human heart.
*  Yeah.
*  So what lessons, is there any lessons from the incredible wrestling he's done,
*  but also the incredible suffering that he went through on himself?
*  Yeah.
*  Again, you like that word suffering, which is okay.
*  No, no, no, no, no, keep it.
*  Keep it.
*  Cause it fits right in where I want.
*  I have to turn that suffering around to where he makes him feels good about
*  himself or better, doesn't have to feel perfect because he did lose, you know?
*  And so, but you have to actually get him to realize that, yeah, he's still unique
*  compared to the walk of the earth.
*  He was unbelievably unique right at the top, just a little bit short of, but
*  because it was, you know, he felt the suffering.
*  You now have to go about and change that and put it into goodwill some way.
*  And because he's, you really have a lot of goodwill, you can do a lot of goodwill.
*  And so, and it's not easy.
*  It took him probably years, years of tattooing, years of covering the tattoos.
*  And, you know, he told me he moved to Cal, I go, why are you moving to California?
*  Cause he was here for a couple of years after his wrestling was done.
*  Cause he had a good job around here and he was, I thought he was doing a good job,
*  but he just, he said, I had to escape.
*  You know, same as the tattoo.
*  I had a wrestling terminology.
*  I have to get, I hate to say this.
*  I had, I hate to say this.
*  I go, where are you going?
*  He said, I'm going to go to California.
*  And I go, is there any reason why you go into California?
*  He says, that's where everybody goes to hide.
*  But I said, I think you're wrong there, but you know, I think you want to determine
*  your life will be what you do from now on, you know, and if you can find it.
*  And he's actually turned it around.
*  He's actually turned it around.
*  You have to discover that yourself.
*  Exactly.
*  And he went someplace that he thought he could fit into.
*  And I think he did.
*  And he's covered that tattoo with feathers.
*  Another tattoo.
*  Well, in the end, it's a beautiful story.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  It really is suffering and overcoming.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's not done yet.
*  He's not done yet.
*  No, he's not done.
*  He's got a lot more to do.
*  So you mentioned Roger Bannister again, I think in your first book and somebody
*  you looked up to, you know, you know, you're a man of your word, but you're
*  When everybody said it was impossible, everyone thought it was impossible.
*  Oh, you would die.
*  He would die.
*  It's not human.
*  It's not human.
*  Yeah.
*  So what?
*  Well, you've done your homework.
*  For what?
*  The book or what?
*  I don't know.
*  For me, you've done your homework.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  But yeah, I've sent here by Putin to do research.
*  Yeah.
*  So what lesson do you take from that story?
*  I mean, I think it's a very interesting story.
*  I mean, I think it's a very interesting story.
*  I mean, I think it's a very interesting story.
*  So what lesson do you take from that story for yourself?
*  The impossible, trying to accomplish the impossible.
*  Well, the impossible is possible.
*  It's just that simple.
*  Time changes things.
*  I mean, I mean, if you looked at where the mile time is right now, compared to that
*  four minute mile, which when it was broke by a couple tenths or three or four tenths,
*  it's now broke by another 20 seconds.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  By several hundred people, yeah.
*  Yeah, I mean, by tons of people.
*  And it's pretty much the common knowledge that you've got to run a four minute mile
*  if you're going to go somewhere now or below if you're going to win events at major level,
*  that you've got to be able to do that.
*  And so you can take that and you can look at what in time history has as its
*  record performance.
*  And you can realize that that record performance is going to change.
*  And they don't take into all the factors of knowledge.
*  They don't take in all the factors of better shoes.
*  They don't take in all the factors of better understanding of nutrition.
*  I mean, it's like me as an athlete.
*  I went to practice every day in high school for at least my sophomore and my junior and part of my
*  senior year.
*  And all of a sudden, a new rule came up.
*  Mm hmm.
*  It said, the rule said before that said, at least most of the coaches,
*  we don't want you drinking water at practice.
*  Yeah.
*  And OK, why?
*  And OK, why?
*  Because you got to toughen you up.
*  That's a weakness, water.
*  And so we would go through practice.
*  I mean, and you're sweating and then you're sweating so much that you're almost out of sweat.
*  Yeah.
*  And so you're mostly at the end of practice, you're not even wrestling.
*  Excuse me.
*  You're you're setting against the wall.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you're tired.
*  So then all of a sudden, they say, OK, go and drink water during practice,
*  bring greater aid during practice.
*  And all of a sudden, at the end of practice, we're still out there competing.
*  And so I look at my career for two and a half years where I end junior high, too.
*  So I got another three years where I didn't really wasn't able to push as good as I could
*  because I just was probably under under hydrate.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So what so but at the individual level, in terms of the impossible,
*  when did you first believe the thing that maybe probably people would laugh at you about?
*  That you would be an Olympic champion?
*  Well, I always visualized me being the best.
*  You believed it in the very forever.
*  Forever.
*  Yeah, I was because I was I don't know if you call it a dreamer or somebody that
*  I was just involved with competitive sports at the YMCA from from age five.
*  Did you tell people that dream that you're going to be Olympic champion one day?
*  You can be the best in the world.
*  I think they knew.
*  And the only reason why they knew because there was something a little different about this guy.
*  He was he's not going to stop.
*  Well, he was out in the yard.
*  And he was swinging baseball bats.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, at six, at seven and eight and nine and ten.
*  And he was swinging baseball bats.
*  So much right handed and so much left hand with nobody even there throwing the ball.
*  That all of a sudden when they walked by, all of a sudden the grass was down to dirt
*  on both sides.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like they saw me on the yard playing by myself sports or, you know,
*  or you get the neighborhood kids and you play a lot.
*  But if they weren't there, you know, if you walked in my front room, I was hiking a ball
*  like I was the quarterback and I was running and running through the through the furniture,
*  you know, that type of stuff.
*  So, you know, who saw this guy mostly was probably the parents and the coaches at the
*  YMCA level, the junior high level.
*  They saw this guy come first and end up last.
*  But I wasn't that great.
*  I wasn't the fastest guy at that time.
*  And I wasn't the strongest guy.
*  You know, actually before I went to the Olympics, when they tested me, they tested everybody.
*  And I probably came back with one of the highest scores, but it was it was not like the highest
*  person on this and this and that.
*  I was all high across the board, straight across the board high on every one of them.
*  But there was always people that were higher than genetics, but then they would go down.
*  Then they would test on something else and go back up.
*  Mine stayed high all across the board.
*  And so I, you know, I really didn't have too many flaws, but I didn't have any
*  things that also said that you were going to be unscored upon at the Olympic Games.
*  Right.
*  So take me through that day, if you could.
*  1972, when you were going for the 68 kilogram freestyle wrestling gold, you scored
*  57 points, if I'm correct, and had zero points scored on you.
*  57, zero.
*  So maybe take me through almost the details.
*  What was your routine?
*  What was your process?
*  What was going through your mind, your thoughts of that day?
*  Yeah, first of all, it was quite a day because we weighed in every day at that time.
*  Yeah, we weighed in two hours before the start of the competition.
*  And so that didn't mean that you weighed in two hours for your
*  wrestle because you didn't know whether you're going to wrestle right away or later on.
*  In fact, in that day, I don't think I wrestled until later on in the evening.
*  So had all day to recover, but I didn't really need it anyway because, you know,
*  I wasn't really pulling a whole lot of weight, but it was just interesting.
*  But what was in your mind?
*  What were you thinking?
*  Were you nervous?
*  I was confident.
*  I was confident.
*  You knew you were going to win the gold?
*  Yeah, I knew I was going to win.
*  But in reality, I didn't know it from a cocky point of view.
*  I only knew it because for the last three and a half years, I had been going to practice
*  and I'd been winning every practice.
*  You felt good.
*  And I hardly ever lose a takedown.
*  And if I lost, if somebody scored on me, it was like when I went to bed,
*  I couldn't sleep until I figured it out.
*  Or if I didn't figure it out, I would fall asleep and I would be woke.
*  I would wake up with the answer of what I needed, why I got scored upon.
*  So maybe now that you've won the gold, can you tell me in the practice room,
*  somebody took you down, how do you take Dan Gable down in the practice room?
*  Timing, technique?
*  Very difficult.
*  But somebody could because they were going for one move.
*  All I wanted was one move.
*  Whereas, you know, if you can arrest somebody and arrest them
*  the whole practice or half of practice for at least 10, 15 minutes,
*  and they were maybe going to score if they could work it in their mind.
*  But they knew that was going to be their victory.
*  So in the practice room, maybe you can educate me.
*  And that when you go for the Olympic gold, you didn't want to allow any takedowns.
*  So there's no such thing as working on some kind of weird position,
*  a weak point or something.
*  It's important to not let down a takedown.
*  It's kind of like what we were saying before.
*  If something happened and somebody scored on me in a certain way,
*  somebody scored on me in a certain way, I would go over that situation,
*  over that situation, over it again.
*  And I would come up with an answer and then I would actually test it.
*  Maybe I wouldn't go right back the next day because I didn't want the guy to,
*  you know, do not have some, I didn't want him to think that I was
*  thinking about it all night.
*  I didn't tell him.
*  But maybe three days later when Russell again, I actually had it figured out
*  because he wasn't able to, or even if I was in on a take, an offensive move,
*  and I got stopped and didn't score, you know, I had to go back and filter that.
*  But it wasn't something that usually I couldn't solve.
*  I could usually solve it.
*  Let's go back to the Olympic game.
*  So I get up in the Olympic in the morning and I'm not sure when the weigh-ins were,
*  but I think I was probably a pound over, you know, and that's about a half a kilo,
*  1.1 pounds is a kilo because we went in kilograms.
*  So what do you do with that pound?
*  You are off or?
*  No, I just, I just went over to the, they had a sauna there and I got in the sauna.
*  And the funny thing was the morning of the, of the, of the finals,
*  there was, there was another athlete in the sauna.
*  And it was.
*  American or?
*  No, it was a European.
*  I didn't, I don't remember where she was from.
*  Not a Russian.
*  Well, you know what?
*  I kind of think it was a plot because it was a girl.
*  Interesting.
*  And she didn't have her top on.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And that was pretty common.
*  And so, you know, it's kind of interesting.
*  You think back about it because there's some funny things that,
*  that go on behind the scenes in Olympic games, in world games,
*  anytime when you have country against country.
*  And so there's some crazy stuff that goes on.
*  Yeah.
*  Did any of it affect you?
*  Did you, was there any?
*  Well, I almost stayed too long in the sun.
*  You lost a little bit over a pound.
*  I lost a little more in a pound.
*  Yeah.
*  But it didn't really bother me because I wasn't like,
*  I wasn't like cutting a lot of weight.
*  So your match against the Russian, the...
*  Azholiyev?
*  Yeah, Azholiyev.
*  He went on to be a two-time world champion, a silver medalist as well.
*  I mean, this is an incredible wrestler.
*  So what was going through your mind before stepping on the mat with that guy?
*  You've beaten a bunch of wrestlers, haven't had a point scored on you.
*  And you're stepping on the mat against the Russian, who you said was,
*  really they picked, the Soviets picked to beat you.
*  And I know why they picked him.
*  Because he had a great attitude.
*  So he wasn't just the typical artist.
*  He was a good artist.
*  He hooked elbows like Azholiyev and he's from that area of the world
*  where they have some of those types of moves.
*  And he was a goer, but by cutting him down a weight, he lost some of that go.
*  And I don't know if you got to, that's a process you got to go about scientifically.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and so, you know, if you don't do it as an American,
*  it can really hurt your performance.
*  If you don't do it as a Russian, it can hurt your performance.
*  And they already didn't really do that a lot,
*  where usually wrestled a weight where it was more like your weight.
*  And so by cutting him down, you know, it maybe slowed his belief down a little bit.
*  You saw it in him.
*  The spirit was a little bit gone when you were facing him.
*  Yeah, but then he came back and he won, you know, rest of the matches.
*  And he was in the round robin and he was able to go to the finals.
*  But he had lost another match actually against in the round robin against the Japanese.
*  So I think I had already gained enough of artistic being able to finish a match.
*  Once I lost my match in college for the last two years,
*  I took on some of that artistic work.
*  And I think that he was already hoping to win,
*  but he was hoping to win by a long ways because he had to pin me or beat me by eight points
*  to be able to win the gold.
*  And, you know, that wasn't going to happen.
*  I mean, the chances of pin is pretty good.
*  Is it hard to pin Dan Gable versus take down?
*  Like, have you taken risks where you could pay for them?
*  I can't remember too many that I took that would actually put me in a danger position.
*  I've taken risks, but the risks were so scientifically technically correct
*  that I wouldn't land in that danger zone.
*  It's like if I'm going to lock up and throw you,
*  I'm not going to throw you to my own back and roll you through.
*  I'm going to turn in the air.
*  So you were scientific about it.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  You know, it just, I learned the hard way early on.
*  There was moves from collegiate wrestling that you did that exposed your shoulders,
*  which it cost me in some early freestyle matches against great wrestlers.
*  But I would go back to my collegiate escaping type moves to where I hit a Granby roll,
*  where you expose your shoulders and you lose two points every time.
*  But you learn that that's not the system.
*  But if you hadn't wrestled much, you would get exposed under maybe a desperate situation.
*  You would hit it.
*  So you won the gold.
*  How did it feel?
*  I think it would have.
*  I think the question would be how would it feel if you lost the gold for me?
*  Because I already went through that once, not at that highest level,
*  but the national collegiate championship level, my senior year.
*  The Larry Owens loss.
*  Larry Owens, yeah.
*  And that didn't set well.
*  Were you afraid of that happening again at the Olympic level?
*  Was that?
*  No, I really wasn't.
*  But it was why I changed my philosophy of training and added to the scientific artist type.
*  And if I had won that match, even though I wouldn't have felt good about it,
*  even if I squeaked it out, I wasn't feeling good about that match.
*  It would have affected me a little bit.
*  But if I'd have won it, I would have got over it.
*  I mean, I'm not over it now.
*  I mean, I don't know why I was doing this kind of stuff right before my match.
*  By that, I mean, this kind of stuff.
*  Interviews, journalists.
*  Yeah, and I really wasn't a good talker.
*  I mean, me and you were talking pretty good right now except for I got a little cold.
*  I don't think I could say two words hardly then.
*  And they took takes.
*  Wide World of Sports says, hey, we want you to be the introduction for our next week's show.
*  So I just say, hey, I'm Dan Gable.
*  Come watch me as I finish my career undefeated 182 and 0.
*  That's what they want me to say.
*  Everybody assumed you'd be undefeated.
*  And I said it.
*  I had to take it 22 times.
*  And the last two or three times, they wrote it out.
*  And I read it.
*  And still, it wasn't like I just said it.
*  I was reading it like, hi, I'm Dan Gable.
*  Come on.
*  You know, that type of stuff.
*  So and he finally just closed the book and said, yeah, that's good enough.
*  But I turned and it was my time to wrestle.
*  And so you just you learn that.
*  For me, it was great coaching experience because that's what I turned into be.
*  I coached for longer than I wrestled.
*  And I put out a lot of champions.
*  But you learn through mistakes that even in your own career that you had made,
*  it's an ever learning process.
*  It's an ever learning process.
*  Have you ever been afraid on the mat?
*  Does fear have any role, do you think, for a wrestler or it must be?
*  Well, I'm sure fear is out there.
*  And I'm sure that was to my advantage almost every time.
*  I'm sure in my Olympic finals, I was really off.
*  He had these doubts.
*  He probably had these doubts.
*  And that gives gives me the edge.
*  And I don't know if I really ever had fear.
*  But obviously, there was points and times where I didn't perform as well, not many, but a few.
*  And if I look back of it, look back at it, I don't think it was that
*  American, you know, raw, raw, raw stuff.
*  I think it was probably the fear of not being an artist as much.
*  You know, maybe this guy might be better than me scientifically.
*  And, you know, you're a scientist.
*  I think that got to me more than anything else.
*  I said early on that I want to eliminate ever having to worry about getting tired in a match.
*  So I kind of eliminated that.
*  So I got rid of that point.
*  And I do think that in wrestling, that is one of the fears that a lot of wrestlers have.
*  Actually, how they feel during the match and and do they get are they going to get tired
*  and is it going to affect my performance?
*  As a coach, that really was one of the things I tried to eliminate on all my athletes.
*  So there wasn't that fear factor.
*  But that fear factor would be put upon my opponent, which would give me an edge.
*  But that's not what I needed as much.
*  I needed to just focus, make sure that I was doing the right things.
*  And I needed my team to be focused.
*  So I made sure that for my mistakes as an athlete or even as a coach sometimes,
*  that I didn't repeat them.
*  Didn't repeat them.
*  If you make a mistake once and you can repeat it, then it's like you didn't learn anything.
*  Your goal throughout your wrestling career, as you've beautifully put,
*  was to work so hard that you pass out on the mat, right?
*  That you would be carried off the mat.
*  So you never did successfully.
*  That's one of the ways you failed in your career is you've never
*  worked so hard that you've passed out.
*  Have you ever come close?
*  Do you remember a time that you've come close?
*  You've been pushed to the limits of exhaustion.
*  You know, the question is really a good question about that pushing to you collapse.
*  As a coach today, I don't think I could...
*  If I said that to my athletes, I don't know, I could get in trouble.
*  Because, you know, it's like...
*  It's understood, isn't it, by the athletes?
*  Yeah, they understand it.
*  But the outside might not understand it.
*  Because it's almost like, what do you mean?
*  You push them to the point where they go collapse.
*  That means they might die or something might happen to them.
*  And, you know, that's dangerous.
*  That's dangerous.
*  We can't have our kid in that type of atmosphere.
*  But it's something that's highly unlikely that's going to happen.
*  But I'm going to tell you, there's many times in a practice
*  where I had pushed myself to all of a sudden the whistle blew or it was time to stop.
*  And when I got up off the mat or wherever I was at,
*  and I needed water, I needed fresh air.
*  Because you're usually in a fairly small room with a lot of guys
*  that the heat rises and it's hard to breathe.
*  And that I can remember, and I stayed a lot of times not by the door,
*  at the far end of the room.
*  I can remember walking from the far end of the room to that door.
*  And I can remember, am I going to make it the next step?
*  Am I going to make it the next step?
*  I need air.
*  I need water.
*  I need oxygen.
*  I need to get out of here.
*  It didn't happen often, but I can recount four or five times in my career
*  that I pushed myself to that level where I thought I was going to maybe go out.
*  But every step I was dizzy.
*  But once I got to that door, I was able to open it and go out.
*  Yeah.
*  And grab the water and get cold water in my face.
*  And so, no, I never really was able to do that.
*  And I think the story is in a book where my daughter pushed to collapse.
*  Molly.
*  It made you proud.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  You know, and she didn't win.
*  But she pushed to collapse.
*  Now, did she suffer because of that?
*  Well, she didn't get to go to the next event because she had to qualify.
*  But I think it probably helped her to realize, because she was winning the race
*  and she was beating people she normally never pushed.
*  But she was at a new level that she had never been before.
*  And she only needed about five feet to finish.
*  And it was just one of those things that I bet there was a lot of learning that she did there.
*  And it probably made her realize that she could be better.
*  But she had to hold up, though.
*  So you mentioned in Wrestling Life that the Brands brothers looked up to Roy Salger,
*  who was known for pushing the limits of physical wrestling, but not getting too rough.
*  So how do you find the line between extreme physical wrestling,
*  but at the same time, not rough wrestling or angry wrestling?
*  So that line between aggression, tough wrestling, and anger?
*  Well, I think anger would cause less successful wrestling.
*  I think anger would cause you to make mistakes and actually get out of position.
*  Because I think anger is kind of a loss of control.
*  And there can be a furious type of attack.
*  But I think if it crosses the line to anger, then you're going to be vulnerable.
*  And so Royce and the Brands wrestled to the edge, through the edge.
*  But when the whistle blew, they stopped.
*  And there's people that when the whistle blows, they keep going.
*  It's like in a football game, a fight breaks out and it's after the whistles blow.
*  Well, when the whistle blew, they backed off.
*  So that whistle was something that in a match, that kind of gave them the boundaries.
*  But perhaps it could be a little bit of fuel.
*  So in Wrestling Tough, the book that you just got from Mike Chapman, the new edition,
*  talks about Bill Cole, undefeated Northern Iowa wrestler, and how he talked about how
*  my strength, speed, and ability to think were increased tremendously by just sitting apart
*  from the action prior to the match and getting into a state of controlled anger.
*  So can anger-
*  Controlled anger.
*  Controlled.
*  Yeah.
*  So anger could be fuel as long as it's controlled.
*  Right, exactly.
*  You had that line.
*  One side of the line, you can have an anger for performance.
*  And the other side of the line, if you go beyond that, it's not going to be for performance.
*  It's going to be for not performance because you're going to lose points.
*  It's a fine line.
*  There's definitely a fine line.
*  You're talking about Roy Selger.
*  You're talking about Tom Brands.
*  You're talking about Terry Brands.
*  You got world championship titles there.
*  You got an Olympic championship title there.
*  You got a world silver medalist in Roy Selger.
*  When I talk to him about the world silver medalist, he's haunted by that
*  because he was actually 20 seconds away from winning when he got beat in the end there.
*  But that's part of the game.
*  I don't know whether he's okay with it or not because he says
*  after talking about things, he goes, I'm okay with it now.
*  But then he keeps talking about it.
*  So I don't really think he's okay with it.
*  It's hard for him to actually make amends to himself when you really don't do it.
*  I mean, it's no matter what the situation, even with the Owings loss.
*  Yeah, it still eats it.
*  I mean, yeah, I'm a world champion.
*  He's not.
*  And he wanted to be.
*  I'm Olympic champion.
*  He's not.
*  He wanted to be.
*  One of the greatest coaches of all time.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And so, you know, so he, you know, it's like, why do I keep going back to it?
*  Because you're not, you don't get over those things.
*  So Royce really keeps going back to it, even though he says he's fine.
*  But then he realizes he's really not fine because that's just the nature of the game.
*  And that's why he was able to win national titles and make world teams and stuff like that.
*  You know, even what's interesting about him, he's analyzed all the people that he's wrestled.
*  And a lot of them have won world and Olympic championships.
*  And he's beaten every one of them at one time or another.
*  And he didn't get to that world championship gold or Olympic gold.
*  And that he says it because they did it.
*  So he's showing people that I beaten those guys.
*  But apparently he didn't beat him at the right time.
*  And so it's still haunting.
*  You don't get away from that stuff.
*  I mean, it's just like anything in life that's really high.
*  I mean, it doesn't have to be athletics.
*  I mean, you think I'm ever going to get over the murder of my sister?
*  And you might not even know that.
*  Let me pause for a second, please.
*  You've talked about it.
*  You've written about it.
*  So I hope it's okay for me to say that your sister, your older sister, on May 31st, 1964,
*  was raped and murdered by a local boy.
*  So the echoes of pain and anger from that tragic day,
*  do they ripple through your life still?
*  Through your wrestling, through your coaching, through your,
*  the way you when you wake up in the morning?
*  What is that like?
*  It can be very emotional to me under certain circumstances.
*  And it can be the mood I'm in.
*  It can be maybe if I've had a Mountain Dew or maybe if I've had a Gable beer.
*  Or maybe if you turn the country music up a little bit loud.
*  You know, emotions come out and everybody has them in their life.
*  It just so happens, you know, what brings it out.
*  And hopefully it's nothing that you do to the extreme point of to where it brings it out.
*  For me, it's not extreme.
*  I don't have to have any of that really.
*  I can get emotional.
*  How did that change you as a man?
*  What it did was realize that I was already pretty well developed because I was only a
*  sophomore, 15 years old in high school.
*  And I had parents that weren't making it.
*  And my parents are a lot older than me.
*  And now that we're down just to me and my parents, and I'm going to be around the house
*  for another two years and they had just lost a couple of years of my life.
*  And they had just lost a daughter that was the only other sibling.
*  They weren't handling it.
*  They were the ones that were suffering much more than me.
*  Even though I always look back upon one area that I wasn't good at was communication at
*  that time, except inside the residence room, because I had been tipped off.
*  And tipped off.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, the neighbor always said that something to me about my sister,
*  just three weeks before that, that really wasn't normal or practical.
*  And I said nothing to nobody.
*  Is there a part of you that blames yourself?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  But I'm 15 years old and you make mistakes.
*  And you don't really act on everything that happens in your life.
*  But I can tell you how it affected me.
*  I acted a lot on anything that maybe wasn't even of that consequence.
*  I mean, because I had four daughters and I'm telling you, when they left every time to go
*  somewhere in a car or go out with someplace, I always said something to them.
*  And they had always said, Dad, you said that last night.
*  I don't care.
*  What? Like, I love you or like, be careful?
*  I'd say like, don't be driving and drinking or don't be in a car with somebody that's
*  of the same nature or stay out of trouble.
*  You know, don't go be somewhere where you have.
*  I said, you know how to get out of a car if your car goes into the river.
*  I just, you know, I'm always thinking ahead a little bit, just in case of something
*  did happen.
*  And it goes back to that, it goes back to that walk to school with that young man.
*  When he was talking to me and I just, I took it and I kept it inside me.
*  And once I found out she had been murdered, it took me maybe 25 to 30 minutes.
*  And I told my dad, I think I know who killed her.
*  And he looked at me and he just like, he slapped me actually.
*  He pushed me against the car.
*  He didn't slap me, pushed me against the car.
*  My mom slaps me.
*  She was the one to slap me around a little bit.
*  But my dad, he pushed me against the car and said, what do you mean you might know
*  something about this?
*  I said, dad, I don't for sure.
*  But, and I will probably all crying.
*  But, and I don't, I doubt if I was crying yet.
*  I've probably cried a lot of tears since.
*  But, you know, I just said, hey, I was walking to school with this neighbor
*  and I never had walked to school with him before.
*  And he was kind of a troubled kid.
*  And he said something about Diane and it wasn't good.
*  But I, I didn't, he goes, why didn't you say something?
*  I said, dad, I just boy talk, you know?
*  So, you know, and so he hugged me.
*  He hugged me.
*  He hugged me.
*  And, you know, it was one of these things that it's definitely made me a lot of who I am.
*  Because there's been a lot of choices and I don't, I took the word choice.
*  Out of my life.
*  And I just like to say, okay, do the right thing.
*  Do the thing that you should do.
*  And so I don't really, it's like, you're going to do this or this?
*  Well, what do you mean?
*  Which one's better?
*  You know?
*  Well, then I, so I don't have that choice.
*  Just give me the right way to go.
*  And so not that I've been perfect by any means,
*  but it's made a big difference in my life on how I handle my life.
*  It's probably given me the opportunity to be married for 44 years.
*  It's just given me opportunities to be better in my life.
*  And, you know, I want to thank my sister for that, you know?
*  And I think my family was ready to make a split because of that incident.
*  They're blaming each other.
*  And I think that I was able to help.
*  But more than that, they really liked each other, but they didn't really know it at the time.
*  Until I got out of the house.
*  Two years later, it probably was going on for a couple of years until I moved on and went to college.
*  Then they found out they really liked each other when they were alone.
*  And it worked out pretty good.
*  But I think them being able to follow me, not just through college and Olympics and worlds,
*  but my coaching.
*  So it's the same, the same success and factor, you know, the excitement and all those things
*  gave them a real purpose.
*  And it gave my four daughters, it gave my wife, you know, a real purpose to be able to be close to
*  all these champions and championships.
*  And now it's like there's a family of 22.
*  And they're all interested in what we're interested in.
*  And it's going good, knock on wood.
*  But, you know, it's something that when all of a sudden you got too much time in your hands
*  and you're not doing and accomplishing much, that things probably, you know, get off track.
*  RG What do you think is the role of family in wrestling?
*  Can a man do it alone?
*  And if not, where's family most important?
*  JL You know, you could do it alone.
*  But why would you want to?
*  I think the chances of doing it alone are much less than the chances of doing it together.
*  Yeah.
*  I know they say don't bring your profession home.
*  Sometimes they say that.
*  I never got away from my profession.
*  And, you know, sometimes I it's like my house right here.
*  So when I'm moving home, I'm not going to have an office because I'm not going to coach anymore,
*  or I'm not going to be an assistant athletic director for a while.
*  That you got to do something that
*  gives you a little bit of a break, not you necessarily, maybe the person you're living with.
*  And so I don't know if you looked outside there, I got a cabin right out in my backyard.
*  You probably can't see it right there.
*  RG What's in the cabin?
*  JL That's my house away from my house.
*  It's only 30 feet from my house.
*  And it's my office.
*  And it's my workout room.
*  It's my I got a sauna there.
*  It's a bed upstairs if I need it.
*  If I ever get too close and she says, Hey, why don't you go sleep in the other house?
*  But you know, it kicks me out of the bed.
*  But it's never happened.
*  But I do spend a lot of time out there.
*  And it's, you know, you got to have a little distance sometimes.
*  You got to know your got to know your role.
*  And so all of a sudden, when you're a guy that's been gone your whole life from
*  eight o'clock in the morning till close to seven thirty or eight o'clock at night,
*  so 11, 12 hours a day,
*  then all of a sudden you're not gone as much.
*  Even though you still work, she's trying to slow me down.
*  Now I'm doing not so much like here what we're doing right now.
*  But when I get in the car and drive somewhere or fly somewhere,
*  you know, like just last night I went to bed and I hadn't told her that
*  this guy called me and he wants me to speak for a want to build another wrestling wants to
*  start another wrestlers in business networking out in
*  Delaware because we don't have any colleges in wrestling in Delaware.
*  I see, you know, I'm glad that because that's my life, you know.
*  So but then all of a sudden I didn't say anything to my wife until all of a sudden this morning.
*  And I told her that I might go on the Friday, the 21st of December.
*  Oh, no.
*  Well, well, I said that's not Christmas.
*  She goes, we're celebrating Christmas that weekend early because a lot of the family
*  can't be here except for that weekend.
*  Yeah.
*  And I said, oh, well, that's not going to work.
*  But I kind of didn't say anything to her at first.
*  And then, well, I'll tell you, she started getting a little emotional.
*  And if I want to stay married for another year, 45 years,
*  then I better tell those people that I got family obligations because
*  that depends what's most important.
*  Yeah.
*  I love wrestling.
*  I love wrestling.
*  And I want to start another help, start another wrestlers in business network.
*  But there's more than one Dan Gable out there.
*  Well, maybe not.
*  But there's a lot of people that are maybe even closer.
*  And they got big names.
*  I mean, we're doing pretty well right now.
*  I mean, we got first two years ago and we got second this year.
*  And then we got the women's freestyles doing good in wrestling.
*  We got to work a little bit on our Greco yet, but they are working on it.
*  But our men's freestyle team right now are excellent.
*  And the key for them is to get them all on the same page
*  instead of just have new highlights.
*  And by that, I'm saying, you look and see who won this year.
*  Well, the three guys that have never won before won this year.
*  We had three world champions.
*  Our two past world champions didn't win this year.
*  I mean, they did OK.
*  They got medals.
*  Did Boros win?
*  No, he did not.
*  He got third.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  He got bronze.
*  Yeah.
*  And Sajil Afghans.
*  I mean, Snyder got second.
*  So those two are our main guys.
*  So the three new guys that came through were guys that hadn't won world gold.
*  In fact, two of them have never made a world team before.
*  And so we have three world champions this year,
*  but we needed all five of them to come through to win the championships.
*  And so the key really is getting them all to do the same at the same time,
*  year in and year out, and not just based on, OK, Boros got beat this year,
*  so he'll win next year.
*  It's got to be every year if you're capable of doing that.
*  And that's what the coaching staff has to do.
*  What's kind of funny that I do have a lot of influence actually on the coaching
*  staff right now at the USA level because the women's freestyle guy is Terry Steiner.
*  And he wrestled for me.
*  He was a national champion.
*  He's got a twin brother that's at Fresno State.
*  And then Billy Zadik is the freestyle coach.
*  And he wrestled for the Hawkeyes back in the early days.
*  And he was the national champion.
*  So we got a lot of former Gable influence on there.
*  But you got deep roots in there.
*  In 2013, the International Olympic Committee, IOC, voted wrestling out of the Olympics.
*  So a lot of folks know about this, the absurdity of it, and so on.
*  But in a big picture, you can step back now.
*  It's five years later.
*  What did you learn from that experience?
*  Well, first of all, did it surprise me?
*  Yeah.
*  But did it really surprise me?
*  No.
*  You got to have people running the organization that are top notch.
*  If you take anything for granted and you're not the person of authority, somebody can
*  kick you out.
*  And even though we had a lot of authority because we're wrestling,
*  we're one of the first sports in the Olympics ever,
*  and that we think that we're in 180-some countries.
*  And some of the number one countries in the world that are politically strong have the sport.
*  We thought we were OK.
*  But then you got to look and see who's running the IOC.
*  The IOC, the International Olympic Committee.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you got to see that in wrestling, we don't have anybody in there.
*  I mean, that shocked me.
*  We've never had anybody on the IOC from wrestling.
*  You know why?
*  Because we didn't have to.
*  But yes, that's wrong.
*  You have to.
*  And if you don't have somebody looking out for you right within the structure,
*  then it's pretty easy for people to turn their head.
*  But all it took was the statement, you guys are kicked out of the Olympics.
*  You guys are done.
*  Everybody came together.
*  Well, yeah, I mean, it's the first time in ever in history that probably all this
*  competitive people that were working for their own agenda turned that agenda to the sport.
*  So that made a big difference.
*  And we got a lot done.
*  In fact, in America, there was several people that were
*  really out there that we didn't know about until this point in time.
*  And when they came aboard, now they're still aboard.
*  That doesn't mean we're doing everything perfect because just because we got voted back in before
*  we even got kicked out, really.
*  That doesn't mean we're by any means safe.
*  We have to do some of the things that I'm talking about or some of the things that we didn't do
*  before.
*  We can't fall right back into the same mess.
*  Yes.
*  And so our leadership got changed and it's better, but it's got to stay better.
*  But there are things that we could still be doing to make sure that we don't have situations like
*  this happen.
*  I'll tell you, when I first learned about it, I was like, I broke down and went, well,
*  I broke down and wept.
*  Again, it's like every once in a while, I'll break down and cry about my sister.
*  Or I'll break down.
*  I don't know if I cry about losing the Owings, but I probably get more determined.
*  But that's kind of, you have to go back and think about those moments when you heard.
*  When I heard that moment and I said, it just overcame me.
*  It was like four o'clock, four for 30 in the morning.
*  When I heard about it and my wife had been up looking at the internet and she woke me
*  up and I thought she was joking.
*  But I jumped out of bed really quick when she said that I knew she was serious.
*  And I started making phone calls right then to find out if it was true.
*  And when I found out it was true, it was just like devastating.
*  You know, and it was one of these things that it's a nightmare.
*  And but you don't let it happen again.
*  It's that simple.
*  Yeah.
*  And you keep getting stronger.
*  Yeah.
*  And if people haven't read, they should read the loss of Dan Gable by Ray Thompson,
*  the ESPN article that kind of in this very beautiful poetic way.
*  Ties together.
*  All the losses of Dan Gable, the losing your sister, losing to Larry Owings,
*  losing wrestling from the Olympics, all of these tragedies of various forms.
*  So that's the IOC, there's politics and you're sort of being very pragmatic.
*  But stepping back, wrestling is one of the oldest forms of combat period.
*  Dating back, there's cave drawings 15,000 years ago.
*  And if you look at the ancient Olympics, the Greek Olympics, 2,700 years ago,
*  did you ever when you wrestled or coach, do you now see wrestling in this way?
*  See wrestling in this way, freestyle and folk style wrestling,
*  the purity of sort of two human beings locked in combat, the roots of that, us just human beings,
*  this fair struggle between two men or two women?
*  I don't think I ever looked at it as anything but just a combat.
*  And I think there's times that have made me figure out how to make that combat better.
*  There's little markers or little points in time in your life that make you
*  wonder or I should say determined to be able to get more out of yourself
*  and to be able to take it to a new level.
*  And I don't think people can actually feel that way unless you've actually had a lot of
*  accomplishments in anything. I think there's anything out there.
*  I mean, no matter what sport or breaking the four minute mile.
*  I mean, when you broke that, when they broke that,
*  Roger Bannister broke that four minute mile, I can't imagine him breaking it from
*  his best time being 430.
*  You know, it's one of these things that along the line there that he did had some close calls
*  or he had some coaching that was given him the opportunity to become a little better.
*  But I think because he was doing well and being very successful that the opportunity came.
*  And so it's for me, it's like the same thing. I had so much success
*  and so many practices that went well and so much goodness out of this sport
*  that it gave me the opportunity to really look more finite and look more how I can even make it
*  better. And so it's like, if you look at my library upstairs, I got a library upstairs
*  and there's a lot of books up there from the family.
*  And but if you look at the Gable books up there, I got a lot of Russian technique books.
*  I can't read the book, but I can see the diagrams and I can see the figures.
*  They don't really show it in pictures. They do it in drawings.
*  And so it was like when I was trying to beat the best that is labeled the best because
*  they win the world championships every year since they've been just about involved.
*  And I don't think they got started involved till like the 50s. But you know, it's something,
*  you know, you study the best who's out there, but then you don't focus so much on the best
*  on the best that you can't beat the best. You learn from them, but there's something that they
*  don't have that you can have. Toughness to technique, to the art, to the science.
*  Yeah, all that stuff. And that's why even talking to you when you're sitting over there,
*  you love MIT and you're bragging about it over Harvard, you know, it's because it's true
*  in your eyes. And that's great. And it might be, but it's the same type of thing that,
*  you know, there's something that you're probably stealing from Harvard, but you won't give them
*  credit. Well, Dan, in the interest of time, I've read that you're pretty serious. You're
*  pretty seriously into fishing. So what's the biggest fish you ever caught?
*  What are we talking about here? Are we talking about?
*  No, I don't think I've ever caught a big ocean fish. I'm not, I'm a river lake fisherman.
*  I have.
*  Bass? Trout?
*  No, probably, probably northern. I probably caught a northern that weighed 20 some pounds.
*  You know, I, my fish I like to catch is walleyes. And the reason why I like to catch them,
*  because they're really good eating fish. And the best eating fish are not the real big ones.
*  You know, it's kind of interesting. They, I got people hunting deer right on my land
*  and they're looking for the big bucks, but they're not the best eaters. If you want,
*  if you want to eat them, but they're the best trophy. So, you know, I do have a couple of trophy
*  walleyes on the wall, but, but most of the time I throw the big ones back and put them back in
*  there. So I don't know if you know, there's a book by Hemingway called old man in the sea.
*  Heard of it.
*  And, uh, Ernest Hemingway, Ernest Hemingway. Yeah. And he, uh, there's a, there's an old man that
*  basically, uh, catches an 18 footer, but it can't pull it in, doesn't have the strength. So they
*  together spend while the sharks eat away at it. I mean, this is very powerful story. I think one of
*  the Nobel prize, but he says it's better to be lucky. The old man says better to be lucky,
*  but I would rather be exact that, that, that way when luck comes, you're ready. So let me ask,
*  uh, what do you think about luck? Do you believe in free will that we have actions
*  that control the direction, destination of our life, or does luck and some other outside forces
*  really land you where you end up?
*  For me, I'm not about luck, but I do think there is luck is involved, but I think it's mostly
*  created, uh, just how lucky you are through preparations and things have, things have happened
*  in my life forever. A lot of good things and a lot of people could say, Hey, you've been pretty
*  lucky to win all these awards. I don't know if you analyze my life, I don't think it was involved
*  with luck. You know, I think it was more involved with preparation and, you know, and again, science,
*  had you been smarter, had you understood that you could do some things and be just as lucky,
*  that'd be great. But I'm only as smart as today. So when I was training in my life and me even
*  training people in my life, as of that moment, that's how lucky I am to be able to have whatever
*  is available to me. And that's what you call that a lot of science. So for me, I, I think that,
*  you know, like right now, if I look back, I do a lot of things different, uh, just because
*  things are proven differently. Like I give people water during practice and I did,
*  and I would let them change their running wrestling shoes into running shoes to run sprints on the
*  concrete. Or I would actually maybe, um, maybe I've had a guy climb 12 ropes after practice,
*  one after another, and then maybe the next day I'd do it again. Uh, you know, I might not make him
*  do it the next day. I might let him recover a little bit more. And, uh, you gotta learn,
*  keep adding to your philosophy and your philosophy may have been great at that time,
*  but it's at that time. And what is really important is where you at with this time today.
*  And so there's better ways to do things. Now, if you ever take attitude out of it
*  and just depend on total science, then you know, you're not going to be as, as, uh, you know,
*  I think it's, I listened to a couple people that are really pretty famous people. Uh,
*  you know, one of them was John Irving. He was a writer and he told me, he says, you think I really
*  learned how to be a great writer in, uh, writing school.
*  I said, yeah, I learned a lot there, but really what gave me the ability
*  to stay focused, to work extra hours, to be more disciplined was wrestling practices.
*  That's right. He was a wrestler. Yeah. Yeah. He goes, I go back to that.
*  That's what gave me that chance, you know, and, and there's a guy in Iowa that, uh,
*  guy named Norman Borlaug. He, uh, he learned, he, he invented a process to feed the underprivileged
*  countries of the world. And he was a wrestler and he said the same thing and he worked extremely
*  hard. And he said, uh, I give a lot of credit to the sport of wrestling. Uh, and even though I was,
*  I'm known for this and I got a statue in, in Washington DC because I saved a billion lives.
*  Plus, uh, I'm going to give wrestling a lot of credit. So, you know, I think some of these
*  MMA stars and some of these guys that maybe weren't wrestlers that had to wrestle, had to fight
*  wrestling guys and stuff missed a little bit there. But I think the ones that did have wrestling
*  probably have a really good chance and can adapt to the other ones. But I think every
*  martial art or every activity is good and you probably can't skip any, but I don't think they're
*  ever going to overlook and say that wrestling's pretty, pretty not, or not valuable because
*  it is. However, that doesn't mean you're going to make it. You still got to take the values and
*  apply it, whatever area you're going to be in. And, and some people forget that some people can't get
*  over the highness of getting your arm raised in a wrestling match. And you know what, what's even
*  greater than me getting my arm raised is that I, if I'm a coach or if I was in belong with you,
*  that you get your arm raised. And even if you don't get your arm raises, what you walk away with
*  and how you learn to handle that as well, because there's going to be some losses,
*  but you don't want many because you don't want to get used to losing. I can tell you that.
*  So it's the hunger for the win. It's the brotherhood, the sisterhood of the wrestling room
*  and it's hard work and science that's going to beat luck at the end of the day. Absolutely. That
*  luck, you know, I'm, you know, I, I like luck, but I think it's created by the opportunity that,
*  you make your luck. You make your luck. Yeah. Dan, it was a huge honor. Thank you for welcoming
