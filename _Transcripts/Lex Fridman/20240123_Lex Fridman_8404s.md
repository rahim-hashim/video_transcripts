# Ben Shapiro vs Destiny Debate: Politics, Jan 6, Israel, Ukraine & Wokeism | Lex Fridman Podcast #410
**Lex Fridman:** [January 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYrdMjVXyNg)
*  Something has to happen with Iran. There has to be some diplomatic bilateral communication there
*  No, what has to happen is the containment of Iran history moves in one direction, right?
*  Because of time communism Nazism all of that was a regression from what was happening at for example
*  The beginning of the 19th century in the 20th century what in what way?
*  Do you think that today Donald Trump knows that he lost the election? Absolutely. So I I don't this is one of the areas
*  Where we get into this I don't understand if there's like brain breaking happening or what's going on
*  I don't know what world we can ever live in where we say that Trump is less divisive for the country than Biden Joe Biden
*  Literally used the Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration to try to cram down vax mandates on 80 million Americans. That's insane
*  What about supercalifragilisticexpand then you're right about new ultra microscopic?
*  Yeah, or the science terms exactly what about the 7,000 letter thing? That's from part of a bio camera
*  I got my education the Soviet Union. So we just did math
*  That's why you're a useful person does body count matter
*  The following is a debate between Ben Shapiro and destiny each arguably representing the right and the left of American politics
*  Respectively, they are two of the most influential and skilled political debaters in the world
*  This debate has been a long time coming for many years
*  It's about 2.5 hours who could have easily gone from many more and I'm sure we will
*  It is only round one
*  This is the Lex treatment podcast to support it
*  Please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends. Here's Ben Shapiro and Destiny
*  Ben you're conservative destiny. You're a liberal
*  can you each describe what key values underpin your philosophy on politics and
*  Maybe life in the context of this left to right political spectrum. You want to go first?
*  Yeah, so I think that we have a huge country full of a lot of people a lot of individual talents capabilities
*  And I think that the goal of government broadly speaking should be to try to ensure that everybody's able to achieve as much as possible
*  So on a liberal level that usually means some people might need a little bit of a boost when it comes to things like education
*  They might need a little bit of a boost when it comes to providing certain necessities like housing or food or clothing
*  But broadly speaking, I mean, I'm still a liberal not a communist or socialist
*  I don't believe in the you know, total command economy total communists takeover of all of the you know economy
*  But I think that broadly speaking the government should kind of like kick in and help people when they need it and that government
*  Can and should be big not necessarily. I noticed that when liberals talk about government, especially taxes
*  It seems like they talk about it for taxes sake or bigs bigness sake
*  So people talk about taxes sometimes is like a like a punishment like tax the rich
*  I think taxing the rich is fine in so far as it funds the programs that we want to fund
*  But Democrats have a really big problem demonizing success or wealth and I don't think that's a bad thing
*  I don't think it's a bad thing to be wealthy to be a billionaire or whatever as long as we're funding what we need to
*  fund
*  Ben, what do you think it means to be a conservative? What's the philosophy that underlies your political view?
*  So first of all, I'm glad that destiny are already coming out as a Republican. That's exciting
*  I mean I we hold a lot in common in terms of you know, the the basic idea that
*  People ought to have as much opportunity as possible and also in so far as the government should do the
*  Minimum amount necessary to interfere in people's lives in order to pursue certain functions, particularly at the local level
*  So a lot of governmental discussions on a pragmatic level end up being discussions about where government ought to be involved
*  But also at what level government ought to be
*  Involved and I have an incredibly subsidiary view of government
*  I think that you know local governments because you have higher levels of home agenarian and consent
*  I are capable of doing more things and as you abstract up the chain
*  It becomes more and more impractical and more and more divisive to do more things in my view government is basically there to preserve
*  certain key liberties
*  The those key liberties pre-exist the government in so far as they are more important than what priorities the government has
*  the job of government is to
*  Maintain for example national defense
*  protection of property rights
*  Protection of religious freedom and these are these are the key
*  Focuses government as generally expressed in the Bill of Rights in the Constitution
*  And I agree with the general philosophy of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution now that doesn't mean by the way that you can't
*  Do more on a governmental level again as you get closer to the ground which by the way is also embedded in the Constitution people forget
*  The Constitution was originally applied to the federal government not to local and state government
*  But you know if I were going to find conservatism
*  It would actually be a little broader than that because I think to understand how people interact with government
*  You have to go to kind of core values and so for me
*  There there are a couple of premises one human beings have a nature that nature is neither good nor bad
*  We have aspects of goodness and we have aspects of badness human beings are sinful
*  We have temptations and
*  What that means is that we have to be careful not to incentivize the bad and that we should
*  Incentivize the good human beings do have agency and are capable of making decisions in the vast majority of circumstances
*  And it is better for society if we act as though they do
*  Second the basic idea of human nature there is an idea in my view that all human beings have equal value before the law
*  Yeah, I'm a religious person so I'd say equal value before God
*  I think that's also sort of a key tenet of Western civilization being non-religious or religious that every individual has
*  Equivalent value in sort of cosmic terms
*  But that does not necessarily mean that every person is equally equipped to do everything equally well
*  And so it is not the job of government to rectify every imbalance of life the quest for cosmic justice as Thomas Sowell
*  Suggests is something that government is generally incapable of doing and more often than not botches and makes things worse
*  So those are a few key tenants and that that tends to materialize
*  In a variety of ways the the easiest way to sum that up with the traditional kind of three legs of the the conservative stool
*  although now obviously there's a very fragmented conservative movement in the United States would be a
*  Socially conservative view in which family is the chief
*  institution of society like the little platoons of society is as Edmund Burke suggested in which
*  free free market and property rights are
*  extraordinarily valuable and necessary
*  Because every individual has the ability to be creative with their property and to
*  freely
*  alienate that property and
*  And finally I tend toward a hawkish foreign policy that suggests that the world is not filled with
*  wonderful people who all agree with us and think like us and
*  Those people will pursue adversarial interests if we if we do not protect our own interests. Can I ask a question on that?
*  I'm so sure it's okay
*  I'm excited for this conversation because I consider you to be really intelligent
*  But I feel like sometimes there are ways that conservatives talk about certain issues that seem to defy
*  Logic and reason I guess so here and I'm sure you feel the same way about progress
*  I feel something about progressives, but even some liberals for sure
*  Before I ask this question is going to relate to education. We can agree broadly speaking that
*  Statistics are real and that not everybody could do everything. So for a grounded example, my life was pretty bad
*  I got into streaming and I turned my life around and that was really cool
*  But I can't expect everybody to do what I did, right?
*  Like everybody being able to join the NBA or to be like a streamer. Of course. Everybody has different sure
*  Okay
*  So I used to be a lot more libertarian when I was 20 21 and one of the things that dramatically changed kind of my view on
*  government
*  manipulation of things in the I guess in society came
*  when it came time to deal with my son and the school that he went to and
*  One of the things that I noticed was when it came time to send my son to school I could either do private education
*  I could do public personally. I did 12 years of Catholic private education
*  However, the public schools in Nebraska depending on what you lived were very very very good and I opted for a certain district
*  I bought a house there. I moved there and then my son was able to go to those schools
*  and he's been going through those schools and the difference of availability of like
*  Technology like these kids are taking home iPads and like first grade
*  They've got like huge computer labs and everything
*  Do you think that there is some type of I don't want to say injustice or unfairness because I'm not even looking at it
*  That way just pragmatically that there might be children that are in certain schools that if they just had better funding or more
*  Access to technologies or things available to them that those kids would become more productive members of society
*  That would like a little bit of a help that they could actually achieve more and do better for all of society
*  So I think that on the list of priorities when it comes to education the availability of technology is actually fairly low on the
*  List of priorities sure I've heard our food availability and I think air conditioning. I think are the two biggest ones that I hear
*  But sure I mean the biggest thing in terms of education itself
*  Not just the physical facilities that we're talking about. Mm-hmm would actually be two parent family households
*  Sure communities that that have fathers in them
*  It's actually the number one decisive are going to roll in fryer and many studies done on this particular topic
*  And the idea that that money alone that investment of resources is the top priority in schooling is belied by the fact that
*  La USD which is where I went to school when I was younger
*  They pour an enormous amount of money into la USD
*  We're talking about tens of thousands of dollars very often per student and it does not result in better schooling outcomes
*  And so when you say if we could give every kid an iPad
*  Would you give every kid an iPad the question is not if I had a replicator machine from Star Trek would I give everybody?
*  An enormous amount of stuff sure I would every every resource is finite every resource is limited and you have to prioritize
*  What are the what are the outcomes that you seek in terms of the means with which you are seeking them?
*  and so
*  again, I think that the question is is I
*  Quibble with it with the premise of the question, which is that?
*  again the the chief injustice when it comes to education on the list of of injustices is lack of availability to
*  Technology or that it's a funding problem
*  I just don't think that's the case sure and I can half agree with you there
*  But I don't think any amount of changes in the schools will create two-parent households, right?
*  We can't bring it. I totally agree with you. So why I think that the fundamental educational problem is not in fact a schooling problem
*  I think that it pre-exists that sure but then I feel like we're now I feel like this is kind of the
*  Conservative merry-go-round where it's like what can we do to help with schools?
*  So two of the things that I've seen I think that are usually brought up in research is one is air conditioning that
*  Children in hotter environments just don't learn as well
*  And then the second one is access to food
*  So like kids that are given like a breakfast or a lunch that's provided at school like increases educational outcomes now
*  I agree that neither of these things might be
*  Determinative in like well 20% of kids were graduating and 80% of kids are graduating or these kids are all going you know from with
*  Their GEDs into the workforce and now these kids are all suddenly becoming engineers, but in terms of where we can help
*  Do you think there should be like some minimum?
*  Threshold or minimum baseline of like at the very least every school should have a non-leaky gym or every school should have
*  If children can't afford lunch or breakfast like some sort of food provided or every school should have these like baseline things so
*  Again, I'm gonna quibble at the premise of the question because I think when it comes to for example food insecurity
*  School food programs again you can always pour money into any program and at the margins create change
*  I mean there's no doubt that pouring money onto anything will create change in a marginal way
*  The question is how large is the margin and how big is the movement?
*  Right to the Delta is what I'm looking at and so I think that the you're starting at a second-order question
*  Which is what if we ignore what I would think are the big primary questions of education namely?
*  Family structure value of education at home how much you have parents who are capable or willing to help with homework
*  What are the incentive structures we can set up for a society that actually facilitate that?
*  How local communities take ownership of their schools is a big one right all of these issues?
*  We're ignoring in favor of say air conditioning or lunch programs and so in a vacuum if you say air conditioning and lunch programs
*  Sounds great in a vacuum in in terms of prioritization of values and cost structure
*  Are those the things that I think are gonna move the needle in a major way in terms of public policy I?
*  Do not and in fact I think that many of them end up being disproportionate wastes of money
*  I mean I've talked before pretty controversially about the fact that an enormous amount of school lunch programs are thrown out
*  Like an enormous amount of that food ends up in the garbage can is there a better way to do that if there is a better
*  Way to do it then I'm perfectly willing to hear about that better way to do it
*  but it seems to me that one of the big flaws in the way that many people of the left approach government is what if
*  we hit every now with a hammer and
*  My question is what if the Nat isn't even the problem?
*  What if there is a much bigger?
*  substructure problem that needs to be solved in order to
*  If you're shifting deck chairs on the Titanic sure you can make the Titanic slightly more balanced because the deck chairs are slightly
*  Better oriented, but the real question is the water that's gaping into the Titanic right yeah, and I agree with you 100%
*  But again that I feel like we're on the conservative merry-go-round then of never wanting to address as any conservative merry-go-round
*  I can give you ten ways well sure but so like here would be the merry-go-round
*  I would say that like there is a minimum funding for schools that I think would help children and then we go well the
*  Thing that would help them the most is two-parent households. I go okay
*  Well two-parent households actually aren't the problem the issue is access to things like birth controls that people don't have children early on and it's like
*  But the issue isn't actually birth control the issue is actually you need a certain amount of money to move out early and to get married
*  And then to have a two-parent household, so it's actually like economic opportunity. No well
*  It's not you know just two-parent households. Yeah, but like what is that?
*  What are the people before you're ready to have babies sure done?
*  That's great
*  We can say that and try to fight against you know however many hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution
*  But people will have sex and people will make babies and then they used to get married the vast majority of people in this
*  Country with kids used to be married the vast majority of people with kids in this country sure now are not married increasingly
*  Obviously a societal change come changed it wasn't human evolution
*  But a lot of those things in terms of resting on whether or not people get married have to do with financial decisions
*  Do you have the money people are worse off now than they were 50 60 years ago when the marriage rates were higher people are
*  Delaying the start of their careers because education is going to be increasingly important so in in other words people are richer now and they have
*  More education now and yet they're having more babies out of wedlock now because they're richer and have more education
*  I'm saying that the one of the biggest indicators for whether or not somebody's willing to get married is how much money both people are
*  Making if they can move out of their household people don't tend to want to get married at 22 when they've just finished college when they
*  Don't have the money to move out
*  And they can't afford a house because we have changed the moral status of marriage in the culture
*  Meaning that everyone poor rich and in between used to get married that is by the way a huge percentage of marriages in the United
*  States used to be what they would call shotgun marriages meaning that somebody knocked somebody up and because they did not want the baby to be
*  Born outside of a two-parent household they would then get married do we think that shotgun marriages though our way to bring back
*  Equilibrium to education yes, we yes absolutely
*  Yes, 100% do we think serves a mother and father sure that is the basis for all of this including education
*  Do we think that shotgun marriages are well?
*  Let's say this do we think that that's a reasonable direction that society would ever take or is this like it was the reasonable direction for
*  Nearly all of modern his lies, but history moves in one direction right because of time made up people people don't think that's in
*  What in what way is this and I don't think we've ever like regressed social standards back to like oh well
*  Let's go a hundred years back and do things that you know used to exist before
*  The entire left right now is arguing that we regressed social standards by rejecting Roe versus Wade
*  So that's obviously not true the Roe versus Wade is not a social standard the Supreme Court ruling number one number two
*  What if you read the actual majority of opinion on Roe v
*  Wade we can see that socially we ever actually never made huge progress on how society viewed abortion
*  This has always been an incredibly divisive thing right even that was I think part of Alito's
*  Writing on it was that things like gay marriage for instance we've kind of moved past and it's not really as debated anymore
*  But abortion was never a subtle topic to buy this
*  Arc of history constantly moves in one direction is belied by nearly all of the 20th century
*  What do we mean by that? I mean? I mean
*  Barbarism communism Nazism all of that was a regression from what was happening at for example the beginning of the 19th century in the 20th
*  century what in what way
*  Nazism and communism were to regression from what was very well
*  These are well in terms of like communism being a regression for instance
*  I'm not a communist
*  But like the industrialization of the Soviet Union happened under a communist society the industrialization
*  Regression which is what we are talking about now moral regression, and you're you're suggesting the moral regression
*  I wouldn't term a return to traditional values in moral regression you would
*  But your suggestion is the history only moves in one direction
*  And I'm suggesting the history does not only move in in one direction it tends to move actually back and forth sure
*  I don't think that all of history moves in one one direction. They're gonna be wars. They're gonna be times of peace
*  I think in general we're more peaceful now than we have been in the past
*  But I think when we look at the way that people live their lives
*  I think that we tend to move in a certain direction socially so when it comes to things like racism or when it comes things like
*  Slavery or women's rights
*  I think that there are two huge things that probably aren't changing in the US and one is access to contraception and one is women
*  Working jobs. I think that these two things are probably huge things that are moving us off of shotgun marriages or getting married very early on
*  And I don't see though
*  Do you think that those two things are gonna change first of all what the data tend to show is that actually?
*  More highly educated people as you were saying tend to get married more so the idea is that women getting an education somehow throws them off
*  Marriage, it's the opposite
*  Usually those women are not educated, but those women aren't getting shotgun marriages those women aren't having children
*  Yeah, but now you're shifting the topic my my topic was how to get more people married
*  And what I've been suggesting then then you suggested that higher levels of education are delaying marriage and making it less probable
*  And what I'm telling you because this is what the data suggests is that actually as you raise up the the educational ladder
*  People tend to be married more than they are lower down on the educational ladder if you're a high school graduate
*  You're less likely to be married than if you're a postdoc
*  I agree with you
*  But that's because one of the biggest precursors to getting married is having like a level of economic stability
*  So as people get more educated they obtain this economic stability and then they're in a more comfortable position to explore more serious
*  There's another compound there. I mean the confound is then
*  People in stable marriages tend to be the children of stable marriages
*  And there's only one way to break that cycle which is to create a stable marriage
*  And that is something that is in everyone's hands again this notion that it is somehow an unbreakable
*  Unshatterable barrier to get married and have kids. I don't understand where this is coming from. Why is that such a why is that such a challenge?
*  I don't think it's unbreakable or unshatterable
*  I was just the initial point was for school if we can provide a minimum level of
*  Educational stuff for children that probably be good
*  But when we retreat back to well it has to be the families that are fixed first fixing families is a
*  Multivariate problem that was so many I am fine within my local community we all vote again
*  I've suggested that there's a difference in local community in federal
*  I'm fine with my local community voting for school lunches or air conditioning or whatever it is that we all agree to do because the
*  More local you get the more homogeneity you get in terms of interest and the more interest you have in your neighbors all that's fine
*  I'm part of a very very solid community in our community. We give to each other
*  We have minimum standards of helping one another all that's wonderful when it comes to the actual problem of education
*  What I object to in the political sphere and this happens all the time is
*  Everybody is arguing on top of the iceberg about how we can move the needle
*  0.5 percentage point as opposed to the entire iceberg
*  Melting beneath them and we just ignore that we pretend that that's just you know
*  Sort of the natural consequence of thing the arc of history suggests that people are never gonna get married again
*  Well, I mean actually what the arc of history suggests realistically speaking is that the people who are not getting married are not going to be
*  Having kids and what it also suggests the people who are married are going to be having kids
*  And so the demographic profile actually over time is rather going to shift toward people who are having lots and lots of kids
*  I'm married. I have four kids everyone in my community is married. It's like minimum buy-in in my community is four kids
*  Okay
*  And so what's happening actually in terms of demographics is that the people who are more religious and getting married are having more kids
*  And so if you're talking about the arc of history shifting toward me
*  I would suggest that actually demographically over time long periods of time not over one generation over long periods of time
*  The only cure for low birthrate is going to be the people who get married and have lots of kids
*  Yeah, I don't necessarily disagree with any of that
*  But I'm just saying that again on the I know you're upset when I bring up the term married around
*  I think that there are good conversations to be had about people getting married
*  Because stable families produce stable children that are less likely to commit crime that are more likely to go to school
*  They're more likely productive members society. So I'm not gonna disagree with you on any of that. All of that is true
*  It's just frustrating that sometimes when you bring up any problem
*  All of it will circle back to other things that makes it seem like we can't make any progress in any area without like fixing
*  I mean, I literally just told you that on the local level. I'm fine for people voting for yeah
*  So for instance on the local level so for school funding school funding is done. I think generally per district
*  So what are you doing? You have poor districts that can't afford air conditioner for their schools. I
*  Mean the idea there would be that presumably if the society meaning the state and I generally don't mean the federal state
*  I mean like the state of California for example decides that everybody ought to have air conditioning people will vote for air conditioning
*  And that's perfectly legal and I don't think there's anything morally objectionable
*  About that per se cool
*  I also don't think that that's going to heal anything remotely like the central problem
*  And I think that what what what tends to happen in terms of government is people love arguing about the problems that can be solved
*  By opening a wallet and nobody likes to solve a problem by you know
*  closing
*  their sex life to one person for example
*  Or having kids within a stable religious community like the things that actually build society
*  I'm fine with arguing about each of these policies and whether we apply them or not is a matter generally of pragmatism
*  Not morality it's a matter of incentive structures not per se morality because incentive structures do have a moral underpinnings
*  There's such a thing as you know for example if you use a welfare program you have to decide how effective it is to what?
*  Crowd it applies where the cutoffs are does it disincentivize work does not
*  All of these are pragmatic concerns
*  but on a moral level the generalized objection that I have to
*  People on the left side of the aisle is that they like to focus
*  in these conversations very often it feels as though
*  It's a conversation with with people who are drunk searching under the the lamp for their keys the problems
*  They want to look at are the problems that are solved by government
*  and then all the problems they don't want to look at which are the actual giant monsters lurking in the dark and
*  Not particularly solvable by government are the ones they want to ignore and assume are just the natural state of things and I don't think that's
*  Correct and I 1 billion percent agree
*  And then obviously my criticism for the conservative side is the exact opposite where where there are parts where government could remedy some issues
*  For instance, you know children having sex with each other producing other children out of wedlock
*  Like sometimes having after-school programs is nice to prevent that like I didn't have time for these things when I was in school
*  I was doing football practice. I was doing cross-country practice. I went in early for a band, you know
*  I agree with you that sometimes people only focus on one end of the problem as a I hate to be that guy
*  But as somebody that what have you ever watched The Wire sure I'm not gonna cite the wire as real-life example
*  Obviously there's only so much you can do in a school when the children coming in are so beyond destroyed because of the family life
*  And everything prior to them even getting to school that day
*  So I agree government is not like the solution to broken families
*  That would never be the case and it's actually not the solution to education depending on the kind of solutions that you're talking about some solutions
*  Yeah, some solutions. No. Yeah
*  So the only thing I'm looking at is as I said earlier just like these minimum threshold things where it's like where can government make?
*  Because you mentioned marginal which I think is a really good way to look at things
*  Marginal costs and marginal utility to things where the first thousand dollars per student you spend might give you a huge return
*  But the extra twenty thousand after I think these are all pragmatic discussions
*  And actually this is what we used to hash out in legislatures before they turned into platforms for people grandstanding
*  But yes, sure. Okay. Yeah as we descend from the heavens of philosophical discussion of conservatism and liberalism
*  Let's go to the pragmatic muck of politics
*  Trump versus Biden
*  Between the two of them who was in their first term
*  The better president and thus who should win if the two of them are in fact our choices should win a second term in 2024
*  Ben
*  Sure. So in terms of actual job performance, you have to separate it into a few categories in terms of
*  Actual performance in foreign policy. I think Trump's foreign policy record is significantly better than Biden's the world being on fire right now being
*  Fairly good example of that and we can get into each aspect of the world being on fire and where the incentive structures came from
*  And how all of that happened in a moment when it comes to the economy
*  I think that Trump's economic record was better than Biden's doesn't mean he didn't overspend. He did he wildly overspend
*  but he also had a very solid record of job creation a
*  Huge percentage of the gains in the economy went to people on the lower end of the economic spectrum
*  actually the gross income to the average American rose about six thousand dollars during his term and
*  The unemployment rates were very very low before COVID
*  Yeah
*  I think that you almost have to separate the Trump administration into sort of before COVID and during COVID because COVID obviously is sort of a black
*  Swan event the most signal
*  Change in politics in our lifetime. And so, you know governance during COVID is almost its own category which we can discuss
*  But you know in terms of foreign policy in terms of domestic policy
*  I think the Trump was significantly better than Biden has been and that's on the upside for Trump on the downside for Biden
*  Obviously you're talking for dear highs and inflation. You're talking about savings being eaten away
*  You're talking about everything being 20 to 30 30 percent more expensive. You're talking about
*  Massive increases to the deficit even at a rate that was unknown under Trump the deficit under Trump
*  Raised by about a little under a trillion dollars every year up until 2020 again 2020 was kovat year
*  So everybody decided that we're gonna fire hose money at things
*  But then Joe Biden continued to fire hose money at things in 21 22 and 23
*  You know that obviously is in my opinion bad economic policy
*  And then you get to the rhetoric and you get to the stuff that Donald Trump says and as I've said before
*  My view is that on Donald Trump's epitaph on his gravestone. It will say Donald Trump. He said a lot of shit
*  I think that Donald Trump does say a lot of things
*  I think that that is basically baked into the cake
*  Which is why everyone who's bewildered by the polls is ignoring human nature
*  Which is at the beginning when you see something very shocking
*  It's very shocking and then if you see it over and over and over and over for years on end
*  It is no longer shocking. It is just part of the background noise like tinnitus
*  It just becomes you know something that your brain adjusts for and so do I like a lot of Donald Trump's rhetoric?
*  No, and I never have do I think that that is just positive as to his presidency?
*  No, I do not when it comes to Biden again. I think he's underperforming economically
*  I think that his foreign policy has been really a problem
*  Even the things I think he's done right are I think band-aids for things that he created by doing wrong?
*  And when it comes to his his own rhetoric
*  You can argue that it's grading on a curve because Trump was coming in with such wild rhetoric that just to maintenance of that wild rhetoric doesn't really change again the baseline
*  For Biden he came in in the same way that Obama did on the sort of soaring rhetoric of American unity
*  I'm the president for all like Trump came in he's like listen
*  I'm the president for what I am and you know, I'm gonna say the things I want to say I'm beyond the toilet
*  I'm tweeting you're like, okay, you know, that's what it is with Biden. He came in with I'm a president for all Americans
*  I'm trying to unify everybody and that pretty quickly broke down into a lot of
*  Oppositional language about his political opponents in particular and attempt to lump in for example
*  Huge swaths of the conservative movement with the people who participated for example in January 6th or who are fans of January 6th
*  And you know the the the sort of lumping in of everybody into MAGA Republicans
*  Who wasn't personally signed on to an infrastructure bill with him that sort of stuff I think has been truly terrible
*  I thought his Philadelphia speech was truly terrible and again
*  I think that you do have the problem of he is no longer capable of certainly rhetorically unifying the country when
*  Every speech from him feels like watching Nick Malenda walk across a volcano on a tightrope
*  It really is like you're just sort of waiting for him to follow. I mean, it's it's sad to say
*  I mean the other day he was speaking for what was in effect his campaign kickoff
*  And this is in Valley Forge
*  And I mean Jill rushed up there like off that off the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top
*  And you know that's not really you know, I let's put it this way
*  It does not quiet the soul to watch Joe Biden rhetorically again. That's a different problem than Trump's problem, but that's my analysis
*  This is one of the areas where we get into this. I don't understand if there's like brain breaking happening or what's going on
*  I don't know what world we can ever live in where we say that
*  I don't know what we can ever live in where we say that we're going to be able to do this
*  I think it is so patently obvious Trump is so divisive
*  Like not only does Trump make an enemy out of every person in the opposition party
*  He makes an enemy out of his own party and every single person around him like we all watched him bully
*  You know Jeff Sessions we all watched him bully his own party on Twitter
*  We all watched like all of these people walk away from him even recently. I think
*  I think it's a really interesting thing that we've seen in the last few years
*  We all watched like all of these people walk away from him even recently I think
*  His uh, the secretary of defense Esper and John Kelly the chief of staff were you know saying I think Trump is a threat to democracy
*  You know, you've got all of his prior people that were around him some of his closest allies
*  You've got bill Barr that won't co-sign a single thing that he says
*  You've got all these people that he used to work with that all say Trump is a horrible evil person
*  He is ineffective as a leader
*  He doesn't accomplish anything and he didn't you know to say that Biden has failed at bipartisanship when you know
*  We've gotten the chips act. We've gotten the IRA. We've gotten the ARP
*  We've gotten the bipartisan infrastructure bill when we've got like all this major legislation that is working in this historically divided Congress as opposed to
*  Trump that got us tax cuts and deficit spending
*  I I don't understand where we ever are in this world where Biden is somehow
*  More divisive than Trump even the speeches that Ben is bringing up. They always bring up
*  I remember that one up
*  I think we might have even done it on our episode though the one speech that Biden gave were at one point that like
*  The background is red and I'll be speaking reference. Yeah, and they're like, oh my god, it's over
*  This is the end and then meanwhile you've got Donald Trump, you know coming into office saying things like if you burn the flag
*  You should have your citizenship revoked or talking about MS
*  DNC that I'm gonna investigate every single one of these media organizations for corruptness. I'm gonna open the libel and definition laws
*  I'm gonna take all of these guys to court
*  You've got this weird project 2025 stuff where
*  It's a John Pashel, I think is talking about
*  You know, we're gonna we're gonna investigate all of these people and we're gonna try to throw crimes and all these people
*  Trump is like the most divisive president
*  I think we've ever had and in at least in my lifetime of being
*  An American citizen and the rhetoric from him is just it's on a whole other level in terms of the demonization of political opponents
*  I mean, this is a guy that's known for giving his political opponents bad nicknames
*  Right, like that's what Trump does
*  You know like it's funny, but even as a resident of Florida if Florida had another natural disaster
*  Do you think Trump would withhold aid?
*  Because you had I think that was one of the few nice things that dissent is actually said about Biden was it like hey
*  Listen, you know when the buildings collapsed and I think that was idea Miami Beach
*  Yeah that you know for the hurricane stuff that Biden was there
*  He was saying if you guys need aid however many billions you can have it
*  Meanwhile Trump I think was threatening to withhold federal funding from blue states that wouldn't I think
*  it had to do with the National Guard stuff the deployment of the National Guard that they weren't like doing enough for the riots and
*  Trump was threatening to withhold aid from some of these blue states
*  Yeah, Trump is literally the most divisive person in the world
*  I don't see how on any metric he is ever succeeding in the divisive category in terms of the economy
*  I do think it's funny that Republicans are very keen to say that like well
*  We can't really grade Trump, you know post kovat because obviously kovat mess everything up, which is fair, but pre kovat
*  What did Trump do yeah, he didn't he didn't deficit spending tax cuts
*  He presided over historic low interest rates and an economy that was already like like blazing past the final years of Obama
*  We were posting all-time highs and all the stock markets of 2013 onwards
*  You know unemployment rates were falling now under Biden unemployment rates are even lower than they were under Trump
*  But it sucks that for Trump we can say well, we can't really hold him accountable for 2020. That was kovat
*  Well, all we have for Biden is post kovat. We don't have any pre kovat Biden
*  You know economy and it was the same thing for Obama to coming in right after the housing collapse as well
*  And it sucks that Republicans are able to walk out of office, you know having burned the entire American
*  Society to the ground economically and now we've got to try to evaluate
*  Okay
*  Well, what did Obama do during his first two to three to four years just trying to recover from where the housing crash left it?
*  And then we look at Biden now who's trying to recover from kovat and now we're grading him on on a totally different scale
*  Yeah
*  On the foreign policy I'm gonna be honest I am a I am very liberal very not progressive
*  I'll probably come off as more hawkish than others
*  Because I'm not a big fan of this which also if I mean if Ben agrees like I think
*  People like people like Trump are gonna be the most dovish isolationist people ever. They don't want to do anything
*  Internationally they just want to you know, protect America be at home protect our economy don't do anything
*  internationally
*  Which is why he was constantly undermining NATO and constantly, you know attacking all the European Union and you know cheering on the UK for
*  Brexit away from the EU. I think that being said I think that by understanding phenomenal job when it comes to foreign policy
*  I think that the coalition building was so important for Ukraine Russia
*  And I'm so happy that he decided to go to our European allies and our NATO allies and try to build a coalition of people
*  To help Ukraine so that that wasn't only the United States
*  Personally, especially after doing a whole bunch of research. I do tend to side with Israel over
*  Palestine and a lot of the Israeli Palestinian conflicts
*  I'm glad that Biden while remaining a staunch defender of Israel is trying to rein in some of the more aggressive posturing towards
*  The Palestinians and the Gaza Strip. I'm proud that Biden said hey listen, we're going to delay some of these attacks
*  Hey, listen, we are going to allow humanitarian aid here. Hey, listen
*  We are going to try to you know, not kill as many Palestinian people down there while still, you know signaling that he would be a staunch supporter of
*  Of Israel in the conflict assuming the civilian casualties don't go too high
*  For foreign policy, I mean blemishes. I mean like the biggest one you can give to Biden is
*  Afghanistan and the pullout there but man are we gonna talk about you know
*  The inspector general report that says that one of the biggest reasons why the Afghanistan pullout was so disastrous was because of the Doha accords
*  Where Donald Trump headed talks that didn't even include the Afghanistan army?
*  I mean like these were disasters but like when when Biden took office we had 2500 troops left in Afghanistan
*  Like what was the options even afforded to buy at that point?
*  Obviously, you've got the abandonment of the Kurds and or there's Syria to you know for the Turkish armies to lay waste to
*  Talk about Iran and North Korea. Although I'm not sure where
*  Then would land on those but yeah, that's a broadly. That's that's a lot from both
*  Yeah
*  Pick something where you disagree with here. Well, I mean there's a lot
*  So I mean it's uh, I want to ask a few questions on each one of these. Yeah, so let's let's talk about
*  divisiveness for a second. So
*  There's no one who can make the case that Donald Trump is not divisive. Yeah, of course. He's incredibly divisive
*  It's a given. Mm-hmm. Do you treat
*  Biden's rhetoric with the same level of seriousness that you treat Trump's rhetoric or I should probably put that to the other way around
*  Should we treat Trump's rhetoric with the same level of seriousness as Joe Biden or say Barack Obama's rhetoric?
*  I'm gonna try to be concise when I say this
*  Broadly speaking, especially in studying Israel Palestine and you could Russia I try not to take politicians at their word because sometimes they just say
*  Stuff to say stuff. I understand that but broadly speaking
*  I'm gonna look at the rhetoric and the actions and I am gonna grade them the same
*  So yes, I would hold Biden and Trump to the same state right? So my feeling is in this one area where for clarification
*  Is that I of course don't treat Trump's rhetoric in the same way that I treat Biden's or Obama's he's utterly
*  Uncalibrated and he says whatever he wants to at any given time and it doesn't even match up with his policy very often
*  Can I ask you like for our head of state our chief executive?
*  Shouldn't rhetoric be arguably one of the most important things that he does
*  I mean the answer would be yes
*  And now I've been given a choice between a person who I think in
*  Calibrated ways says things that are divisive and a person who in uncalibrated ways
*  Says things that are divisive and so the evidence that Joe Biden is divisive is every poll taken since
*  Essentially August of 2021
*  he he is
*  By all available metrics incredibly divisive a huge percentage of Americans are deeply unhappy
*  Not only with his performance, but don't believe his uniter there that's just the reality and that may just be a reflection
*  I mean, honestly, we may be putting too much on Trump or Biden personally
*  The American people themselves are rhetorically divided because of social media and social media can in fact be accessible
*  All that I would ask you about that though is I agree especially when you look at the favorability
*  But sometimes when I look at these polls when you start to disaggregate them by party
*  I wonder if it's actually is Biden historically divisive or
*  I'm trying to think of a really polite way to say this the people that like Trump worship Trump
*  I don't know
*  I like one of the most prescient things that Trump could have probably ever said was that I could kill someone on 5th Street
*  And nobody would so make Hannibal. So is it really the Biden's certainly divisive or is it that every single Trump supporter?
*  Will always say that Trump is great. No
*  The reason I would say that Biden is in fact historically divisive is because Republicans felt much more strongly about Barack Obama
*  I agree then Joe Biden actually but they didn't feel as strongly about Trump as they did about like Romney or McCain
*  Right in what way I mean and that they allegiance to oh no
*  There's certainly more allegiance to Trump than it is to Romney or McCain largely because Trump won in 2016
*  but beyond that the the point that I'm making is that if you're looking at the
*  Stats in terms of divisiveness Republicans always find the Democratic president divisive
*  The question is where the rest of the country is and right now there are a lot of Democrats who either don't agree with Biden
*  Or you know finding divisive there are a lot of independents who find him divisive
*  So when you're when we're comparing these things
*  I don't think their leagues apart in terms of the divisive effect of what they say
*  Right in and I'm separating that off from like the inherent content of what they say
*  It's obviously what Trump says is is more devices just on like the raw level
*  I mean if he's insulting people as opposed to Joe Biden doing MAGA Republicans
*  Like if I were to just if I were an alien come down from space and look at these two statements
*  I'd say this one's more divisive than this one
*  but then there's the reality of being a human being in the world and that is everyone has baked Donald Trump into the cake and
*  Joe Biden again started off with a patina of being non divisive and now has emerged as divisive
*  I if you don't mind actually want to get to the foreign policy questions because this one is actually slightly less interesting to me
*  One quick thing I guess like because we can say the reality of it and we can look at opinion polls
*  What if we look at like legislative accomplishments like Biden is working on a 50-50 divided Senate
*  Donald Trump had both House of Congress and the Supreme Court and got like no major legislation passed
*  Well, I mean he did lose Congress in 2018
*  But you sure but prior to that because we got the we got the infrastructure bill
*  I think in one year which Trump promised for his entire presidency didn't get anywhere
*  I mean, yes
*  His Republican base was not in favor of mass spending on infrastructure and neither my so there's that I think that's mostly a state and local
*  In favor of mass spending for a tax cuts that's not spending. I mean
*  Like effectively it's not well if you're cutting tax receipts, but you're not changing the level of spending like Biden did with the IRA
*  Yeah, again, well, we have we have a fundamental philosophical difference here
*  I think that when the government takes my money that is not that is not the government
*  Somehow being more fiscally responsible and when the government allows me to keep my money
*  I don't see that as the government spending I see that as my money and the government is taking less of it
*  That's great
*  But at the end of the day the government is still going to be in a deficit spending and they're gonna have to borrow money
*  Right. We have a spending problem. It's not a receipts problem
*  It's the case that I'm making the problem with with Donald Trump is not that he lowered taxes
*  The United States has one of the most progressive tax systems on the planet
*  And in fact, if you wish to have a European style social welfare state
*  Well, you actually need us to tax the middle class to death
*  I mean the reality is the top 20% of the American population pays literally all net taxes in the United States after after state benefits
*  And all of us sure
*  So if you actually wanted to have the kind of social welfare state that many liberals seem to want to have like Northern Europe
*  You'd actually have to tax people who make 40 50 60 thousand dollars and I don't want that I agree with that
*  So how do you explain the lack of legislation?
*  I mean if he's like such a uniter because I think the Republican Party itself is quite divided and I think that Trump's but isn't
*  That he's the head of the Republican Party is the president Republican president of the United States. I mean again
*  I don't think that Joe Biden has passed
*  wildly historic
*  Legislation other structure, but was the largest like so here's the problem
*  If you're a Republican, uh-huh
*  the only bills that you can get consensus on tend to be bills that either that that
*  let's be real about this that our tax cuts because as
*  You would I think agree with when it comes to polling data Americans constantly say they want to cut the government and then the minute
*  You ask them which program they have no idea what they're right
*  Exactly
*  And so trying to it's much harder to come up with a bill to cut things
*  Then it is to come up with a bill to add things coming at which is why spending was out of control under under Trump as well
*  But there are some Republicans who still don't want to spend on those things, right?
*  So inherently the task that this goes back to the first question the task that Republicans think government is there to do is different than the
*  Task that Democrats think that government is there to do
*  So the way that the very metric of success for a Democratic president versus a Republican president namely for example
*  Pieces of legislation passed as a Republican one of my goals is to pass nearly no
*  Legislation because I don't actually want the government involved in more areas of our life
*  I want to ask a couple questions on the foreign policy. Sure. Yeah, okay
*  So friends like Donald Trump wanted to punish China and he wanted to bring
*  Microprocessor manufacture the United States
*  Biden did that with legislation with the Chips Act you talk about like spending being out of control and I mean I can agree with that
*  I think anybody looks at the numbers has to agree with that
*  But why not pass legislation like the inflation reduction act which is at least like spending neutral, right?
*  Like why are there not bills where Donald Trump could take well, I mean at first all
*  I think that whenever the government says something is spending neutral it rarely materializes that way that is not going to be a spending neutral
*  There's a difference between like at least they say it's spending neutral versus this is a five hundred billion dollar bill over like ten years
*  I mean, I well but again
*  I don't see a tax cut as a matter of corn spending neutrality the big problem is they keep spending not that they are
*  Allowing me to keep the money that I earned and they did not earn but okay
*  So then just to understand so if somebody just did massive like reductions in tax receipts
*  So tax cut after tax that I've taxed out
*  But they didn't change spending at all
*  You wouldn't consider that like an increase in deficit spending or out of control spending you would just say they're just tax cuts
*  I would consider it a wild I would consider it a wild overspending
*  Okay, meaning then was it under Trump then when he did the time in the day
*  I'm spending by the way under under Biden is way worse than it was of course, but we're in post-covid, right?
*  COVID ended effectively spending you live in Florida COVID effectively ended in the state of Florida by the middle of 2021
*  Yeah, I mean even if you're a vaccine fan by like April May of 2021
*  There was wide availability of vaccines whether or not you like the vaccines. Yeah at that point we were done
*  Like we're in a post like how many
*  Trillions of dollars have been dumped in worldwide that are like leading to inflation, right?
*  The inflation is like a worldwide issue right now because of the economy shutting down for a year or two
*  It's not like those effects are gone in one year, right?
*  COVID might be gone
*  But the after effects of all the stimulus spending and the unemployment everything definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods
*  So pouring more money on top of that makes for more inflation. That's what it does. Sure. I
*  agree
*  But like there's also the definition of when do you deficit spend is when economies are headed for recessions, right?
*  Rather than when economies are doing really well like they were under Trump and he was deficit spending
*  Whereas Biden can at least make the argument that I should I ought to be deficit spending because the economy is heading for potential
*  So here's the thing. I don't think that the economy was actually headed for a session in
*  In fact, if you look at the economic statistics
*  Okay, they're still saying that there's like a recession coming right right
*  But that was largely because of the after effects of inflation meaning if you inflate the economy
*  What you're going to end up doing is bursting a bubble and then when that bubble burst you'll get a recession
*  I mean that was the basic idea right the idea the question was whether you're gonna get a soft landing
*  But if you actually look at for example the employment statistics or the economic growth statistics in the United States what they look like
*  Under the last year's Obama and then Trump I mean is what the chart looks like is it looks like this and then it hits
*  March of 2020 goes like that. Yeah, right and then by like September it balances back up, right?
*  It's a V-shaped recovery and then it starts to peter out sure a lot because of the American recovery plan, right that Biden did as well
*  We I mean four million jobs. Yeah
*  No
*  I don't I'm not gonna attribute it to that because the rates of growth in in job growth from September October November
*  Were actually very similar to the rates of job growth after Joe Biden took office. Well, you see is actually kind of a straight line
*  I mean what the chart looks like get in any case? Okay, so on the form policy stuff is getting them screws
*  but on the on the foreign policy stuff, so
*  The the questions that I have with regard to to Biden on foreign policy
*  Very very simple question. Do you think that the situation in the Middle East is better now than it was under Donald Trump?
*  I
*  probably
*  That's a hard one the fact why that I'm making right now are
*  Like obviously you've got the Israel-Palestinian war that's going on right now, which is kind of bad
*  But like broadly speaking
*  I'm not sure how much that affects the Middle East as much as like the collapse of Syria
*  2013 Syrian Civil War sent millions of immigrants throughout all of Europe which was under
*  Which was under Obama and continued under Trump Trump didn't do anything to alleviate any of the Syrian Civil War
*  In terms like did Syria end up as a preserve of Russia again, how did Syria end up as a preserve of Russia?
*  Yes, why did it end up being essentially a client state of Russia?
*  I know that Putin enjoys access to the ports down there
*  I don't know you tell me the reason is because Barack Obama suggested that there was a red line that would be drawn in the
*  Face of chemical weapons use but sure I said then used chemical weapons in Syria and Barack Obama was unwilling to then
*  Essentially create consequences for Syria in the form of any sort of Western strike and so instead he outsourced it to Russia
*  This is 2013 2014 sure I think there might have been some hesitancy after like seeing how Libya ended up that maybe us like
*  Intervening
*  Yeah, I mean
*  There might have been like a mistake learned that actually the Middle East I mean just historically speaking was historically good under Donald Trump
*  I mean, it's very difficult to make the case that either before or after Trump were better than during Donald Trump
*  I mean the Syrian I don't think that that Trump contributed to the Syrian situation and improving my opinion
*  Improving much I mean he did wreck ISIS which was in the world
*  I mean ISIS had been getting wrecked by the Kurds in Iraq by every single person by
*  Assad's army by Putin by Turkey literally everybody was fighting against ISIS at that point
*  There's a spike in violence and then the the trumpet
*  I mean you get credit for when your president presumably I mean things got better with ISIS under Trump
*  I mean, yeah, they did I mean things got worse with ISIS under Obama
*  For sure. He called them the JV squad sure and then they became not the JV squad
*  Isis is originating in Syria and
*  Baghdadi and all of the growth of that is necessarily Obama's fault
*  I know that we like to say that Obama created ISIS. I don't know if you say that but I've heard that saying a lot
*  I think that's a little bit simplistic. I
*  Don't think that when I'm looking like actions that presidents have taken the
*  Biggest criticism I have for like Middle Eastern policy is I think the Doha Accords were a disaster and I think that's like one
*  Of the biggest blemishes that we have right now
*  I would also argue that moving the embassy to Jerusalem was also kind of silly and arguably
*  Contributed to some of the conflict we see right now. No, it's actually I'll argue precisely the opposite
*  especially given the fact that after the movement of the embassy to Jerusalem the Abraham Accords continued to sign and actually expand and
*  That if Donald Trump had been elected
*  I have no doubt in my mind that Saudi Arabia would now be a part of the Abraham Accords
*  In fact, that was basically pre-negotiated and then when Joe Biden took office Joe Biden took a very anti Saudi stance on a wide variety
*  of issues
*  the the biggest single effect in the Middle East of Joe Biden's presidency and again, I
*  Agree with you that not every foreign policy issue can be laid at the hands of a president
*  Joe Biden's main approach to the Middle East was very similar to the Obama approach
*  which is why the Middle East was chaotic under Obama and chaotic under Biden and that was to alienate allies like Saudi Arabia and
*  Israel and instead to
*  Try to make common cause or cut deals with Iran. What that did is incentivize terrorism from Iran
*  What we're watching in the Middle East is Iran
*  Attempting to use every one of its terror proxies in the Middle East and it was specifically launched in an attempt to avoid
*  What Biden actually was trying to which was good which was after two years of failure with Saudi Arabia try to bring them into the Abraham
*  Accords, right?
*  that was what was burgeoning at the end of at the end of last year and
*  Iran saw that and Iran decided that they were going to throw a grenade into the middle of those negotiations
*  By essentially activating Hamas Hamas activates Hamas commits October 7th
*  Israel as a sovereign nation-state has to respond to the murder of 1200 of its citizens in the taking kidnapping of
*  240 Israel has to do that not only to go after its own hostages and try to restore them but also to reestablish
*  Military deterrence in the most violent region of the world. He's Bala gets active on Israel's northern border
*  He's Bala's an Iranian proxy. They get active on the northern border
*  The the who these in Yemen get active. These are all the only reason all this is happening
*  It's a time is because Iran is doing this right?
*  But I not just that they're they are threatening global shipping sure you're talking about the effects of global supply lines
*  Which I totally agree had a major inflationary effect on the economy. Thanks to cove it right now the cost of shipping is
*  Nearly double what it was just a few weeks ago and that is because a ragtag group of who the barbarians are attacking
*  International shipping and forcing everybody to stop using the Babel Mountain straight instead going around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa
*  All of that is the result of the fact that Joe Biden
*  Reoriented the United States in the very early days in favor of a more pro-Iranian stance
*  He appointed Robert Mallet to negotiate the Iran deal who as it turns out was using proxies
*  He had many of his aides were actually taking money from Iran
*  The the Biden administration literally one of their first acts was to delist the who these as a terror organization and sanctions
*  Against the who these these are all moves that Biden made very early on they were disastrous moves
*  But when it comes to domestic policy, I think he hasn't been nearly as damn
*  Sure, so just on a couple of Middle Eastern things
*  So one of the big things that threw the Middle East into disaster was what we all traumatized by it now
*  Was the Iraq invasion which I'm in a Republican president sure you're that right?
*  The
*  deposition of Saddam Hussein and everything that followed after
*  Probably contributed more to the growth of Isis and the destabilization of that entire region probably more than anything else
*  I think that under prior to Bush for Clinton even at the beginning of Bush's presidency
*  We were on some kind of road to normalcy with Iran, which I think has to happen whether we like them or not
*  Until Bush for whatever reason decides to throw Iran into the axis of evil
*  And it means that we're on a road to normalcy with Iran in the 1990s
*  Do in the way what that we are on a road to normalcy with Iran in the 1990s my understanding is that yeah from
*  The late 90s and prior to the axis of evil
*  Labeling of Iran that there was going to be some path forward to where we could start to normalize relationships with them
*  I find that very difficult to believe and I don't see a lot of evidence. I mean we just disagree on that
*  Okay, yeah sure we can disagree on that, but I know that
*  The after effects just quick note the after effect of the Iraq war that was the most devastating was the increase in power of Iran
*  I agree. Yeah because of the destabilization Iraq and Iraq not having a
*  Government there that was functional for at least a decade and was in fact Sunni government right originally
*  It was a Sunni government
*  Disbanding the Sunni army was one of the worst things that the bush administration did ending all the former both parties sectarian
*  Yeah, all horrible under Republican president
*  But disagree that the yeah that that probably contributed more to ISIS to the growth of power in Iran
*  Maybe even limited to the decimization of Syria probably more than anything that Obama did
*  Also the when we look at Iran funding people in the region. I don't disagree with that as well
*  I think Iran is the number one instigator of bad guy things right now in the Middle East Iran on the IRGC
*  I supported when Donald Trump killed Soleimani. I think that was a great thing. I think that Iran is a major problem
*  however, I don't know if the path forward is
*  Constantly being a belligerent to Iran or trying to figure out some road to normalcy
*  I don't know if the collapse of Iran or the destruction of that country considering how unpopular
*  The I told even is there like the citizens of Iran? I don't think our big supporters of the government there
*  I feel like moving on a path where you know, let's do our nuclear inspections
*  We had that Iranian nuclear deal that Trump pulled out of let's do the nuclear inspections
*  Make sure you're not on a way to nuclear weapons. Let's unfree some funds
*  Let's move in some direction where we get on a good term with you
*  I feel like that's the most important thing that needs to happen in the Middle East as much as people like to look at
*  The Abraham Accords who cares if what was it Bahrain? I think Oman
*  I think UAE Morocco UAE and Morocco
*  Yeah, our son like all of these people even Saudi Arabia already have like de facto normalization with Israel
*  Anyway, they're all trading. No, I mean to pretend that that anybody even
*  15 years ago would have been talking about normalization Saudi Arabia and Israel is insane
*  They mean that's they already they were already on that path
*  They they had already been trade there already de facto trading partners with each other that that they had already been collaborating
*  It's a wild claim that that Israel and Saudi Arabia were going to normalize 15 years ago 15 years ago
*  I might have been a wild that's what that's what after Turkey
*  After Jordan and then in the past like 20 years of like economic relations and ties with each other all the
*  Leadership in the Middle East and you'll agree with this look at Israel and they go. Okay. Well, we've got Palestinians who you know
*  God bless them do nothing and then you've got Israel which is on a on a region with no natural resources to somehow become like an
*  Economic giant they're good to trade with their populations educated
*  They you know have military power
*  All of the leadership in these Middle Eastern countries are wanting to be friendly with Israel and are engaging in trade de facto with Israel and
*  The idea that like the UAE and Bahrain were brought in to say like oh well now we're gonna officially say this
*  Those are the first steps toward obviously the formation of a new Middle East in which
*  Economics would predominate over sectarian conflict. The chief obstacle to that is Iran. I agree notion that you that that negotiations with the Ayatollah
*  We're going to be a solution to any of this is
*  But do we think absolutely tonight are the is it the Abraham Accords that's convincing Saudi Arabia to take a stance against Iran?
*  No, I mean there are already fighting with each other, right?
*  I don't think Abraham Accords moved us any closer towards any type of real peace in the real the point to happen is something has to
*  Happen with Iran there has to be some diplomatic bilateral communication there
*  No, what has to happen is the containment of Iran which was what was in praise?
*  Which was what was taking place with the increased normalization with the Sunni Arab world and Israel combined with significant economic sanctions
*  they the notion that that
*  There's this far-fetched notion in in foreign policy circles that diplomacy can serve be wish cast out of thin air
*  That if you sit around a table that you can always come to an agreement with somebody the ayatollahs do not have common interests
*  With the United States they do not and this idea that they are willing to take money in exchange for for example
*  Some sort of people peaceful acquiescence to Israel's existence is obviously untrue
*  That's literally only hasn't that been the case though that you've had a region with tons of sectarian violence for a long time
*  And then finally Turkey was like you know what this isn't worth it the United States paid him a lot of money
*  They had conversations with Israel you know what the economy the economic game
*  I mean the relation that's anything with Jordan same thing with Turkish politics
*  but the the situation with Turkey was actually quite warm between Israel and Turkey in the 90s when you had the the
*  you know sort of
*  secular
*  Muslim regime in 90s, but they sign a mahatat in place and and now Erdogan is has joined in the fray and Erdogan is
*  Significantly more radical sure then what I'm so sorry if I said Turkana Egypt my bad
*  Yeah, right, so yeah, so yeah in terms of like Egypt and Jordan right where the first two you need back to it
*  So you here's the thing you need is it possible that you could theoretically come to a deal with Iran only with a new leadership
*  Crew okay, this is true for every peace agreement in the region
*  Mm-hmm you could not Israel could not have made peace with well
*  They made peace for Egypt and then Sadat was the leader for young Kapoor right not make peace with Nasser
*  Right the point is that this is a different regime you need a different regime
*  Same regime that did the part of the young Kapoor war was the same regime that negotiated peace with Israel
*  I mean that's true
*  it is also true that that is a relationship that could be cultivated specifically because
*  It was Sadat who made clear who's gonna come to the table
*  Mm-hmm have the Iranians ever made clear that they would come to the table over for example the existence of the state of Israel
*  Oh, no
*  That is not a thing that's going to happen
*  But I think people probably are the same ever every single one of the proxy every one of them not only calls for the destruction
*  Of Israel they also call for the destruction of America. I mean, this is literally the Houthi slogan
*  They're busy hitting ships and their slogan is literally alahu akbar death to America death to the Jews death to Israel
*  It doesn't fit on a bumper sticker, but that it's not all that catchy
*  But that is in fact their slogan the notion that the regime that propagates that is going to be approached with diplomacy is
*  Not only wrong. The problem is that we it's easy to say the stakes of diplomacy are okay
*  So we try to talk right jaw jaw is better than war war
*  Sure, the only problem is that in the Middle East
*  Weakness is taken as a sign that aggression might be an appropriate response
*  That is how things work in the Middle East and the fact that Barack that that Joe Biden rather
*  Came into office with an orientation toward continuing the Biden the Obama policies in Iran has led to conflagrations
*  These sort of brushfires breaking out everywhere that Iran has borders with either the West or Israel or both, right?
*  Anyplace that's happening is leading to brushfires because again the logic of violence in the Middle East is not quite the logic of violence in
*  Other places in the world, by the way
*  I think the logic amounts in the Middle East actually closer to what most international politics looks like than we then we wish that it were
*  I mean, I think that's part of what's happening in Ukraine as well. So you think which brings me by the way
*  Here's my question about Ukraine
*  So you think that for Iran right a country that has been sanctioned for God knows how many years now you think that for Iran just
*  Continuing to sanction them and contain them is an effective way is more effective than trying to engage them in bilateral or multilateral peace talks
*  Yes, 100% and the proof is in the pudding before we go to Ukraine. Can I ask about Israel?
*  So you're both mostly in agreement, but what is this? I say that okay, but
*  As I'm learning
*  What is Israel doing? Right? What is Israel doing wrong in this very specific current war in Gaza?
*  I mean frankly, I think that what Israel's doing wrong is if I were Israel, okay, like again America's interests are not coincident with Israel's interests
*  If if I were an Israeli leader, I would have swiveled up and I would have knocked the bleep out of his blah early
*  What does that mean?
*  So I would have I would have the Yavgalant who is the defense minister of Israel was encouraging Netanyahu is the prime minister and the war cabinet
*  Including Benny Gantz. So whenever people talk about the Netanyahu government, that's not what's in place right now
*  There's a unity war government in place that includes the political opposition
*  The reason I point that out is because there are a lot of people politically who will suggest that the actions Israel is currently taking are somehow the
*  Manifestation of a right-wing government Israel currently does not have a quote-unquote right-wing government
*  They have a unity government that includes the opposition in any case
*  Yavgalant was urging in the very early days of the war that Israel should turn north and instead of hitting Hamas
*  They should actually take the opportunity to knock his blah out because he's blah is significantly more dangerous to the existence of the state of Israel
*  I actually agree with that as far as what Israel has been doing wrong in the actual war. I mean, I think that
*  Again from an American perspective, I think that Israel is doing pretty well from an Israeli perspective fire Israeli. I would actually want Israel to be less
*  Loose about sending its soldiers in on the ground level. So Israel's attempting to minimize civilian casualties and the cost of that has been the highest
*  Military death toll that Israel has had since the 1973 Yom Kippur war
*  I mean, I personally know through one degree of separation three separate people have been killed in Gaza and that's because they're going in door to door
*  It's because they're they're attempting to minimize civilian casualties and they're losing a lot of guys in in this particular in this particular war
*  You know the the problem that Israel has had historically speaking is that Israel got very complacent about its own security situation
*  They believe the technology was going to somehow correct for the hatred on the other side of the wall that it very okay
*  So our people have to live underground for two weeks at a time while some rockets fall, but at least it's not a war and that complacence
*  You know bred what happened on October 7th?
*  So to me what Israel did wrong was years and years and years of complacence and belief in an Oslo system
*  That is at root a failure because you cannot make a peace agreement with people who do not want make peace with you
*  So that that's what I think Israel is doing wrong. I have a feeling there's gonna be wide divergence on this point
*  Maybe so in terms of broadly speaking I generally oppose settlement expansion is a thing that Israel does incorrectly that I think is kind of like provocative to at least all the Palestinians
*  In the West Bank and I probably energizes hatred in the Gaza Strip for them as well in terms of conducting in terms of conducting warfare
*  The one thing that I always say to everybody especially Americans is you can't evaluate things from an American perspective
*  It's very stupid happened a lot with Ukraine where people like oh well didn't they work with the Nazis and like weren't the Soviets the good guys?
*  And it's like well in other parts of the world it's not quite as simple and I think the same is true for Israel Palestine that a lot of Americans will analyze the conflict is just being one between only Israel and Palestine
*  Which is not it's a conflict between Israel and then Palestine Hezbollah the Houthis and Iran right now it is
*  I think that the however one area will I break with Ben is is I think that minimizing civilian casualties and everything is a very very very important I think on the Israeli side
*  I don't think it's important so that the US will stay with them because I think the US is probably going to stick with Israel as long as I know anything crazy
*  And I don't even think it matters for the international community doesn't definitely matter for the UN because Jesus Christ
*  However I think it's really really really important that I think that in the Middle East broadly speaking I think that leadership especially in the Gulf has gotten over the Palestinian issue
*  I think that leadership is kind of like they don't care as much anymore but the populations still care quite a bit
*  And I think that the main issue that Israel could run into is if the civilian death toll does climb too high
*  And if they start to hit this you know 40 50 60 thousand numbers civilian casualties they run the risk of the civilian populations in the surrounding Middle Eastern states becoming so antagonistic towards Israel
*  That they start to take steps back towards normalization in the region so for instance I know that Bahrain I think already pulled out their ambassador to Israel my guess is going to be it's temporary
*  I know that on the on the public speaking side you've got a lot of people condemning Israel for the attacks and on the private side you've got people telling Israel please kill all of Hamas because this is untenable
*  Nobody wants to work in this situation I don't know if this ended up being true or not I'm guessing it didn't but I saw on a couple of Twitter accounts it was leaked that potentially Saudi Arabia was considering installing a government in the West Bank that they would run
*  No I mean I think Israel would love nothing better than that but that is for sure okay one of the big problems in the Middle East is literally no one wants to preside over the Palestinians yes no one so I think the Arab states Israel no one
*  So I think the issue and I think and I'm largely actually I'm very sympathetic towards the Palestinians because I think that for since 48 and onwards I think that all of the Arab states super gassed them up on that they wanted the Palestinians to fight because they wanted to fight with Israel
*  However as time has gone on and they realized that it's kind of a lost cause states have started to drop out so you're getting these bilateral peace treaties with Egypt and with Jordan you're getting multilateral agreements like the Abraham Accords and now the Palestinians are looking around
*  I'm like okay well you guys told us to fight all this time and now the only people that we have supporting us are Iranian proxies so the Palestinians are in a very weird spot where they've like lost all their support yeah I think that I think that Israel what I would say to be
*  quote unquote critical of Israel is Israel needs to take strong steps towards peace that probably involves them enduring some undue hardship so not the October 7th attacks because Jesus that's way too much but you know other types of you know attacks that they might have to deal with that might cause some civilians to die that they don't come out over the top with and and retaliate with if there's ever going to be peace in that region however another thing that I've always said is a huge problem between Israel and Palestine is I think that both sides think that if they continue to fight it will be good for them and I think that
*  but the problem is one side is delusional Israel I think Israel wants to continue to fight because they get justifications for the annexation of the Golan Heights they get justifications for expansions especially in area C that I think they're probably gonna try to annex soon they get justifications for the increased military posturing towards the Gaza Strip and the embargoes and Israel is right that if the conflict continues really the situation only improves for Israel over time but the Palestinians also all believe that if they keep fighting they thought that since 2000 or Arafat that if they just keep fighting
*  they'll get better gains too but that's not the case. Is there a difference between Palestinian citizens and the leadership when you say that? I love all people I love all people around the world and I think that when we analyze issues I think that we have to be very honest with what the people on the ground think and the idea that Hamas is just this one-off thing in the Gaza Strip is not only incorrect with the situation on the ground it's also incredibly ahistorical and the idea that like the Palestinians in the West Bank of which I believe the most recent polling shows I want to say 75 to 80 percent
*  support the October 7th attacks Palestinians in general want to fight in violent conflict with Israel that's not just the position of the government that's not just people there's a reason why a boss doesn't want to do elections in the West Bank and it's because the
*  Palestinian people really do want to fight with Israel but to combat that problem is like you have to get the UN on board we've got to do an actual addressing of the Palestinian refugee problem which is handled like a joke right now Iran has to be brought to the table in terms of
*  negotiations there has to be huge efforts made to economically revitalize these like Palestinian areas even though they're one of the highest recipients of aid in the world you have to do something about the embargo in the blockade in the Gaza Strip which isn't just maintained by Israel it's also maintained by Egypt you should ask why yeah there's a lot of things that have to happen to fix that problem but the reality is I don't think Israel really wants to because they get to continue their expansion into the West Bank and I don't think anybody around the world really cares that much so I will argue with that the idea that Israel does not want to end the conflict
*  is belied by the history of what just happened with the Gaza Strip so when we talk about settlements for example Israel did have settlements inside the Gaza Strip there are 8,000 Jews were living inside the Gaza Strip in Gush Katif up until 2005 they withdrew all of those people I mean took them literally out of their homes and the result was not the burgeoning of a better attitude toward the state of Israel with regard to for example you know the Palestinian population in Gaza in fact is more radical in Gaza than it was in the West Bank the the
*  result was obviously the election of Hamas the the October 7th attacks in which unfortunately many civilians took place it took part in the October 7th attacks there's video of people rushing who are civilians and dressed in civilian clothing into Israeli villages always the same thing
*  that is 100% true obviously and when it comes to you know area C and Israel's supposed deep and abiding desire for territorial expansion in area C area C so for those who are not familiar with the Oslo Accords and again this is getting very abstruse but the Oslo Accords are broken down into three areas of the West Bank area A is under full Palestinian control that would be like Janin and Nablus the major cities for example there's area B which is mixed Israeli Palestinian control where Israel provides some level of military security and control and then there's
*  area C and area C was like to be decided later it was left up for possible concessions to the Palestinian Authority if the Oslo Accords had moved forward those are disputed territories there is building taking place in area C by both actually no one talks about this but by Palestinians as well as Israelis and the the you know question is whether if Israel stopped building there have been many settlement frees in the past including some undertaken by Netanyahu and and it actually has not done one iota of good in moving the ball forward in terms of
*  actual negotiations again the biggest problem is that the leadership for Palestinians has spent every day since really 67 it's not even 48 because after 40 between 48 and 67 Jordan was in charge of the West Bank and Egypt was in charge of the Gaza Strip and at no point did either of those powers say hey maybe you ought to hand this over to an independent Palestinian state which was originally the division that was that was promoted by the UN partition plan in 47 because of that the the leadership post 67 and really starting in 64 the Palestine Liberation Organization
*  was founded in 64 and it called for the liberation of the land in 64 they had the West Bank and they had the Gaza Strip so they're talking about Tel Aviv when it was founded in in 64 the basic idea as you know kind of indicated by that was Israel will not exist and that was a promise that's been made by pretty much every Palestinian leader in Arabic to the people that they are talking to us are famously would do this sort of thing he's speaking English and talk about how I wanted to state solution and then he go back to his own people and say this is a trojan
*  horse and if Israel could if you think that Israeli parents want to send their kids at the age of 18 to go and monitor Janine and Nablus and be in in on Eunice you're out of your mind you're out of your mind Israelis do not want that in fact Israelis didn't want that so much that they allowed rockets to fall in their cities for full on 18 years in order to avoid sending soldiers on mass back into the Gaza Strip true but I think Israel does want to continue to expand settlements under the West Bank right they want to continue to build they want to have a Jerusalem East Jerusalem as well well I mean East Jerusalem has already been
*  annexed so East Jerusalem is according to Israel part of Israel that's not a settlement okay so there's that with regard to you know does Israel have an interest in expanding settlements in the West Bank what why would they not until there's a peace partner sure that's what I mean but I'm saying as long as the conflict continues like because even when you know your suggestion is that they're incentivizing the conflict to continue so they can grab more well not let me be very clear I don't think there's like a plan like so some people say for instance they'll take that one quote from Netanyahu and I'll try to say that like he was funding the people in the Gaza Strip by allowing Qatari money to come in even though he was actually speaking in opposition
*  to a boss allowing the Gaza Strip to fall for Netanyahu to clear it out for him they give it back etc etc I'm not saying I'm not claiming those theories I'm just saying that I think that Israel will take a relatively neutral stance towards conflict enduring because as long as the conflict
*  endures and as long as the settlements can expand I think that benefits I think that ultimately benefits Israel that they I think there would be very let's put this way if suddenly there arose among the Palestinians a deep and abiding desire for peace approved by a vast majority of the population with serious security
*  guarantees I think you'd be very hard pressed to find Israelis who would not be willing to at least consider that in a way like we're not expanding bathrooms in a fraud I kind of I would have agreed with you on October 6 I think we're probably a year or two away from that right now no no but the point I'm making is that Israelis now realize that the entire peace process was a sham meaning the people who are on the other side of the table were using it as a Trojan horse in the first place the death of Oslo is not the death of Israeli hopefulness it's the death of the illusion that on the other side of the table was anyone worth bargaining with that's what's happening
*  and that's why you have this sort of insane disconnect right now between the United States and the Israeli government again it's a unity government no one in Israel is talking about making concessions to the Palestinian Authority for a wide variety of reasons including the fact that Mahmoud Abbas is fatah continues to pay actual families of terrorists who kill Jews are the market fund yeah right and and which is from the the moderate West Bank right exactly that's the so yeah again like the taste in Israel for this is even the people who are the the helonim right those are the most secular people in Israel which was by the way the place that was attacked on October 7th I mean what people
*  should understand is that October 7th was not an attack against settlements in the West Bank it was an attack on peace villages that were essentially disarmed and many of these people who were killed were peace activists who were literally trying to work with people in Gaza to get them job I mean it's just it's it's mind-boggling that's why you've had this ground shift in Israel the next 20 years in Israel is going to be about security and economic development period end of story everything else goes second third place and I will say I agree essentially with everything you're saying not to loop back another topic but this is one of the reasons then why I was so critical I want to say
*  critical but like kind of nonchalant about the Abraham Accords because they didn't address anything with the Palestinians whatsoever they brought up countries that weren't super relevant to the conflict they didn't bring in Qatar which is where a lot of the money and support for the Gaza Strip comes up they didn't involve Iran at all they involved bilateral no but it totally changed the mentality and this is why what I'm seeing right now this is why listen I think that Biden has done better than I certainly expected him to do in terms of support for Israel like Obama was way less supportive of Israel for sure Biden by every metric with that said the rhetoric that he's been using recently in the blanket have been using recently about Israel needs to make painful concessions for peace Israel recently
*  centering this issue at the center of relations in the Middle East is doomed to failure the magic magic is strong work the benefit of the Abraham Accords was proof of what you're saying which is true which is that all of the surrounding countries in reality have abandoned the idea that there is a centrality to the Palestinian Israeli conflict that is not the central conflict in the Middle East and by the way one of the reasons that central conflict in the Middle East is because actually ironically because the rise of Iran right it's it's Sunni states that are largely signing up with Israel because they're realizing they need
*  some sort of counterweight to a burgeoning nuclear power in Iran can we talk about Ukraine sure you have a disagreement with you with what destiny said my main problem with Biden's policy with regard to Ukraine is that he outsourced the end goal of the war to Zelensky early on now that might make sense if that goal were something that he was willing to fund to the point of achievement or if Zelensky could have achieved it on his own but
*  right now and this has been true since pretty early on the wars point Henry Kissinger made this is that that pretty early on in the war is very clear that for example Crimea was going nowhere the Russians had control of Crimea barring the United States giving permission to fly f16s over Crimea nothing was going to change over there the same thing was true in most of the non bass right in Luhansk and that's that that was not going to change Zelensky stated goal and you understand it he's a leader of Ukraine right is that there was a predation on his territory in 2014 and that the Russian sent their
*  little green men across the border and then they took all of these areas and so he is leader of Ukraine is saying okay I want all of that back now the reality is that the US interest had largely been achieved in the first few months of the war meaning the revocation of the ability of Russia to take Ukraine and just ingest it and to the devastation of Russia's military capability Russia has just been wrecked in the military is in serious straights because of the war in Ukraine from an American perspective I'm very much pro all of that I think that we have an interest in Ukraine maintaining the buffer status against
*  a territorially aggressive Russia I think that the United States does have an interest in degrading the Russian military to the extent that it can threaten the Baltic states or threaten Kazakhstan or other countries in the region the problem I have with Biden strategy is as always I think that it's a model and I think models tend to end with misperceptions war tends to break out and maintain because of misperception misperception the other side strength the other side's intentions and all of the rest people misperceive what's going to happen they say I'll cross the line and nothing will happen right this is what Putin
*  thought he thought I'll cross that line they'll greet me as a liberator and because the United States just surrendered in Afghanistan essentially they won't do anything and the West is fragmenting because NATO is fragmenting and all the rest of this and obviously he was wrong on all of the scores the problem for Biden is that as with virtually every war no end line was set and so it became out recently that is widely reported that actually there was a peace deal that was on the table in the first few months that Putin was on board with that basically would have seeded Luhansk and Donetsk and Crimea
*  to Russia in return for solidification of those lines American and Western security guarantees to Ukraine right Ukraine wouldn't formally join NATO but there would be security guarantees to Ukraine we're ending up there anyway it's just taking a lot more money and a lot more time to get there and you can Trump would have helped push that piece yes and I think and I think that Biden actually did so once you better be disservice because once he knows where this was going to end is not going to end with Luhansk and Donetsk and Crimea in Ukrainian hands is just not going to and he knows that what actually in my opinion is a Lensky
*  needed was for Joe Biden to be the person who foisted that deal upon him said he could then go back to his own people and say listen guys I wanted all those things but the Americans weren't willing to allow me to have all those things
*  and so we did an amazing job in a heroic job in defending our own land we devastated the Russian military even though no one expected us to but we can't get back those things because it's unrealistic to get back those things because America basically
*  there are big funder and they're the ones who want the deal instead what Biden said this was reported in the Washington Post last year the Biden administration said we're going to fight for as long as it takes with as much as it takes and when they were asked until when they said whatever's Lensky says
*  and that's not a policy that's just a recipe for a frozen conflict with
*  endless funding now maybe the putin's walked away from the table that deal is no longer available if that deal is available right now I certainly hope that's being pursued behind closed doors my main critique again a Biden is that when you outsource the end goal to another country without stating what America's interest is that's a problem I also think that Biden did really quite a poor job of sort of explaining what America's realistic interests are I don't like it when American leaders
*  is weird for me to say this but I'm not a huge fan of the we're in it to protect democracy kind of rhetoric because frankly we are allied with many many countries that are not democracies and that's not actually how foreign policy works we should as an overall you know 30,000 foot goal advanced democracy and rights where we can but the reason that we were fighting
*  in favor of Ukraine and when I say fighting I mean giving money and giving weaponry the reason that we were doing that in favor of Ukraine is not because of Ukraine's long history of clean voting and non corruption the reason that we were doing that is to counter Russian interest in the region I mean it was a pure real
*  and that real policy plays hard to deny no matter what side of the aisle you're on I think that what many Americans are going to our verting to is we have no interest there why are we spending money they are not spending money here and that that kind of stuff and that that argument can always be applied unless you actually articulate the reason why it is good for Americans beyond simply the ideological for the United States to be involved in a thing so for example I think right now when when Biden is taught I think that what Biden just did he's the United States as we speak is striking the Houthis I think that that's a really really good thing I think that's a necessary thing I think that's a really really good thing I think that's a necessary thing I think that's a really really good thing I think that's a necessary thing I think that's a really really good thing I think that's a really really good thing I think that's a really really good thing I think that's a really really good thing I think that's a really really good thing I think that's a really
*  I think American people should understand why that is happening it's not because of

*  not saying that Ben Ted here go In general yeah
*  neither
*  I think on the macro, I agree.
*  Maybe we get at the weasel a little bit on some things.
*  On the final thing that he said though,
*  I wish that Americans could have honest conversations
*  about foreign policy.
*  I think that it would just be better for everybody.
*  I don't know if it's a red scare after the Cold War
*  where it was like literally, the behemoths,
*  we're fighting against communism.
*  And we felt like after 91,
*  every single foreign policy decision needs to be able
*  to be explained in like seven words.
*  Like he's the bad guy and that's it.
*  I wish we had more honest conversations
*  about what our foreign policy interest is
*  in a particular region.
*  Because I don't think most Americans honestly
*  could even articulate why Israel would be an important ally
*  or why it's important to defend Ukraine against Russia
*  or why should we care about Taiwan at all?
*  I don't know if most Americans could articulate anything
*  there even though they might have very strong opinions
*  about why we ought to be involved in certain conflicts.
*  So I do agree with that.
*  I wish we had more honest conversations
*  about foreign policy.
*  In terms of how Biden has handled Ukraine,
*  the things that I liked the most were one,
*  that he was very clear in the beginning
*  about what we wouldn't do.
*  So Biden saying that we're not gonna do,
*  not a red light, no fly zones over Ukraine.
*  We're not gonna be deploying troops on the ground in Ukraine.
*  We're not gonna be doing anything that would have,
*  US soldiers and Russian soldiers
*  crossing swords with each other.
*  That's not gonna happen.
*  I liked that he made that very clear at the beginning.
*  And I liked that he coalition built between NATO and the EU
*  to get people to send funds, training, soldiers, airplanes
*  and everything to Ukraine.
*  I thought those two things were really good.
*  In terms of basically writing Zelensky a blank check,
*  I would like to hope that Biden
*  and the entire United States learned a lesson
*  from Iraq and Afghanistan,
*  that open-ended missions with unlimited budgets
*  and no clear goal are like the worst foreign policy decisions
*  you can ever do.
*  They've like defined US foreign policy
*  for the past two or three decades,
*  which is unfortunate, but seems to be the case.
*  My feeling would be, and this is just a feeling,
*  I don't know if internal cables have leaked
*  that say otherwise,
*  is the Biden administration
*  has probably always had a quiet position of,
*  at some point there's gonna be an off-ramp here.
*  And I think even a month or two ago,
*  I think those talks were being leaked
*  that discussion had begun with Zelensky
*  looking for an off-ramp.
*  But publicly, of course,
*  the United States is never gonna come out and say,
*  we are gonna support you guys
*  to fight as much as you want for three months.
*  And then after that, it's no more.
*  Obviously that can't be the statement.
*  It's always going to be that we're gonna support you
*  in your fight against Russia.
*  Now we tried that under Obama with Afghanistan.
*  It was terrible.
*  Sure, yeah, you can't-
*  We'll escalate the troop levels to X,
*  but only for six months and then we'll put it out.
*  Yeah, you just can't do that.
*  It's always gonna come off as,
*  we're gonna support you forever.
*  And as long as it takes, and as long as you need,
*  whatever we have to do to defend freedom
*  and democracy in your country,
*  and any other statement would be absurd.
*  So I can understand why it feels like on a public level,
*  a blank check and an indefinite time period
*  was granted to Zelensky,
*  but I don't think that's gonna be the case.
*  I think, again, I hope we've learned our lessons
*  in the Middle East about the forever wars,
*  that this isn't gonna be a forever funding to Ukraine
*  to fight for as long as they want.
*  I do disagree.
*  I feel like we're playing a little bit retrospectively,
*  saying that like, well, it's obvious
*  that they're not gonna capture the Donbass.
*  It's obvious that they're not gonna capture Crimea.
*  I agree for Crimea, that was incredibly obvious,
*  but it was also really obvious that in two weeks,
*  Russia would own Kiev
*  and Ukraine was gonna be Belarus 2.0.
*  I think that even for a lot of military people
*  and analysts around the world,
*  that that was an expectation,
*  or at least a significant probability.
*  Nobody knew, the phrase that's thrown around now
*  is paper tiger,
*  that Russia's military was as ill-equipped as they were.
*  So I can understand why,
*  especially if you're Ukraine
*  and if you've repelled an invasion
*  from one of the world's largest armies,
*  why you might feel like, well, fuck it,
*  let's fight for a few months, let's fight for a year,
*  let's see what happens.
*  And I can understand the United States supporting them,
*  but I agree that there has to be some reasonable off-ramp
*  where we're not gonna fight forever.
*  I think the US State Department
*  has already begun those conversations with Zelensky
*  to look at what that off-ramp looks like.
*  But yeah, I'm not too sure,
*  other than like explicitly stating publicly,
*  you can only fight until this date.
*  I don't really know what else I would change.
*  I don't think the Biden administration
*  should have done that.
*  I don't know what else they should have done.
*  Do you think Biden should cut this deal on the funding?
*  Meaning there's this $105 billion deal
*  that's been held up by debate
*  between Republicans and Democrats over border, right?
*  So basically it contains $60 billion for Ukraine,
*  $14 billion for Israel,
*  another several billion dollars
*  for Taiwanese defense against China,
*  and then it includes some border funding
*  and some border provisions.
*  Republicans want the border funding
*  and the border provisions
*  because we can get into the illegal immigration issue,
*  but that's a pretty serious issue.
*  And Biden and Democrats have been unwilling to hold that up.
*  And that seems to me like just from,
*  put aside Republican, Democrat,
*  it seems like political malpractice,
*  meaning there's a widespread perception in the United States
*  that the border is a disaster area.
*  Joe Biden wants these things.
*  Many Republicans don't want these things.
*  If he caves on the border stuff,
*  he gets all the things that he wants
*  and he's gonna be able to go back to the moderates
*  in the country and say,
*  I did something about the border.
*  It seems like such an obvious win.
*  If he caves on the border stuff,
*  you mean on the Ukraine stuff?
*  Yes, because then he gets the whole package.
*  Sure, yeah.
*  Meaning he can go back to his own base
*  and say, listen guys,
*  I wanted to be easy on the border.
*  The Republicans forced me to it,
*  but we needed the Ukraine aid.
*  We needed the Taiwan aid.
*  Yeah, honestly, you're gonna be more educated
*  than me on this.
*  I don't like, or maybe I just don't know enough.
*  I don't like the principle that when we negotiate things
*  in the United States,
*  there's like 50 million hostages at all points in time
*  for every single thing.
*  Like, oh boy, here comes the debt ceiling.
*  What do the Republicans want?
*  What do the Democrats want?
*  Oh boy, like here, we can't fund our government.
*  But I mean, obviously the argument is gonna be
*  that if the Ukraine funding doesn't come in this bill,
*  and if Biden and his administration feel
*  like it's really important that,
*  or not unilaterally, but as a single issue,
*  it's not gonna pass.
*  So I would say that at this point,
*  and I don't know what the conversations look like
*  between the Biden administration and Zelensky.
*  I would say at this point that it's probably fair
*  to start making contingencies on the money
*  that we give to Ukraine that listen,
*  like this conflict has waged on now.
*  Like now we need to start looking for potential peace.
*  We can't just write you an unlimited check.
*  So I mean, if those strings are attached,
*  I'd be okay with it.
*  But the broader question of like,
*  is it okay to make this particular piece of legislation
*  with all this funding contingent on the Ukrainian funding?
*  I mean, that just seems to be the way
*  the government works now, unfortunately.
*  Quick pause, bathroom break.
*  One of the big issues in this presidential election
*  is gonna be January 6th.
*  It's in the news now,
*  and I think it's gonna get,
*  become bigger and bigger and bigger.
*  So question for Destiny first.
*  Did Donald Trump incite an insurrection
*  on January 6th, 2021?
*  Absolutely.
*  This is probably ignoring every other issue
*  we've talked about, of which I think there are plenty
*  that I would say disqualified Trump from holding office.
*  I think that the conduct and the behavior leading up to
*  and including January 6th,
*  I think is wildly indefensible.
*  I am excited to see Ben try to, yeah.
*  The three to four stages are the taking
*  what I think any reasonable person would say,
*  knowingly false information about elections being rigged
*  or ballot boxes being stuffed or Ruby Freeman,
*  running ballots three times in Georgia,
*  taking that knowingly false information
*  and trying to call state secretaries and stuff
*  to have them flip their electoral vote.
*  That was horrible.
*  The plot that Eastman hatched
*  in order to have these like false slates of electors
*  where all seven states had citizens go in
*  and falsely say that they were the duly elected electors
*  that could submit votes to Congress.
*  That was insane.
*  That happened.
*  Asking or begging Pence to accept these false states
*  of electors initially, and then just say,
*  you should just throw it out completely
*  and throw it to the house delegation,
*  which was majority Republican.
*  That was absolutely unbelievable.
*  And then on the day of January 6th,
*  trying to capitalize on the violence by him,
*  Giuliani and Eastman making phone calls
*  to senators and congressmen saying,
*  well, don't you think maybe you guys
*  should delay the vote a little bit?
*  Don't you think they're just really mad about the election?
*  I think he said to McCarthy, they're more upset than you.
*  And his utter dereliction of duty
*  and not doing anything to stop the rioting
*  that happened on January 6th,
*  because he was too busy taking advantage of it.
*  I think all of these things are horrible.
*  I look forward to seeing the Jack Smith indictments
*  play out in court, maybe even the Georgia Rico case.
*  But yeah, I think all of these things are unfathomable.
*  And I think when you look at the plot from start to finish,
*  clearly the goal the entire time was to circumvent
*  the peaceful transfer of power.
*  That was the goal from start to finish,
*  whether it was through false claims,
*  whether it was through illegal schemes,
*  or whether it was through violence at the Capitol
*  to delay the certification of the vote.
*  Ben.
*  So I'm glad you're excited.
*  It's always fun.
*  So there are two elements to incitement of insurrection.
*  One is incitement, the other is insurrection.
*  So incitement has a legal standard,
*  so does insurrection.
*  Neither of those standards are met.
*  So if you're asking me, morally speaking,
*  did Donald Trump do the right thing
*  between November 4th and January 6th,
*  I said, I will continue to say no, he did not.
*  I think he was saying things that are false,
*  just factually false about his theories
*  with regard to the election,
*  about the election being stolen, about fraud.
*  This was all adjudicated in court.
*  He did not even bring many of the claims
*  that he has brought publicly and all the rest of that.
*  If we're talking about incitement of insurrection
*  as a legal standard, it doesn't meet any of those standards.
*  When it comes to incitement,
*  it has to be incitement to immediate lawless action.
*  That's the standard for incitement.
*  And I'm very meticulous in how I use this
*  because I happen to speak publicly a lot,
*  and that means there are lots of people who listen to me,
*  which means some of those people are probably crazy.
*  And some of them may go and do a crazy thing.
*  Did I incite them?
*  The media tends to use the word incitement very loosely
*  with regard to this sort of stuff
*  in the same way that Bernie Sanders
*  quote unquote incited the congressional baseball shooting.
*  He did not.
*  Bernie Sanders has a lot of things I disagree with.
*  I think Bernie's a schmuck, doesn't matter.
*  He did not incite that.
*  So saying bad things is not the same thing
*  as inciting violence.
*  Inciting violence, the legal standard in the United States
*  is I want you to go punch that guy in the face.
*  That's inciting.
*  With regard to insurrection, typically in insurrection,
*  and there are some descriptions in case law,
*  though none in statutory law as far as I'm aware,
*  the typical description in case law
*  is the replacement of one legitimate government
*  of the United States with another by violent means.
*  The notion that Donald Trump coordinated
*  any such insurrection is belied by the FBI itself.
*  The FBI put out a report in, I believe it was August of 2021,
*  suggesting that there was no well-coordinated
*  insurrectionist attempt coordinated by the White House.
*  In fact, what you had was Donald from thrashing around
*  like that weird alien in the movie Life.
*  I don't know if you ever saw it with Jake Gyllenhaal
*  or he's like kind of thrashing up against this glass box,
*  just an alien just thrashing up against the glass box.
*  That I think is more what you were seeing
*  from November 4th to January 6th.
*  And then again, the claim that January 6th itself
*  was an insurrection.
*  So virtually, I'm not aware that anyone was charged
*  with actual insurrection.
*  There were some people who were charged
*  with seditious conspiracy.
*  There are insurrection statutes that do exist.
*  No one was charged under those particular statutes.
*  You know, there were some people who you could say
*  informally had insurrectionist ideas.
*  Those would be the people who wanted to hang Nancy Pelosi
*  or kill Mike Pence.
*  And those people are in jail right now.
*  And the election went forward.
*  The election was certified.
*  Mike Pence presided over the certification.
*  Mitch McConnell presided over the certification.
*  Joe Biden has been the president for the last three years.
*  So Donald Trump, by the way,
*  was still president at that point.
*  If he had actively wanted to do what other people
*  who have actually launched coups have done,
*  he would have theoretically called the National Guard
*  not to put down the riot,
*  but to actually depose the sitting government
*  of the United States in the name of a specious legal theory.
*  He did not do that.
*  He did not attempt that.
*  Nobody working for him did that.
*  The most you can say, I think,
*  about what everybody was doing is that, you know,
*  and I want to say everybody.
*  We can talk about Trump,
*  because this is really about Trump.
*  He used a phrase that Trump was disseminating
*  knowingly false information.
*  The word that's carrying a lot of weight there
*  is the word knowingly.
*  So knowingly implies a nowhere.
*  Do I think the information he was disseminating was false?
*  Yes.
*  Do I think that Donald Trump has a unique capacity
*  to convince himself of nearly anything
*  that is to his own benefit?
*  Absolutely.
*  And I think that that's actually
*  what Donald Trump was doing there.
*  And the evidence of that is Donald Trump being a human
*  and all of us watching him for the last several years.
*  So, you know, the idea that he knew it to be false,
*  I'm not even sure those standards apply in any,
*  and just assessing him as a human,
*  which is really what we're being asked to do
*  because there's an intent element to this crime.
*  Does Donald Trump, do you think that today,
*  Donald Trump knows that he lost the election?
*  Absolutely.
*  So I don't, actually.
*  I think that-
*  So I'm glad that you have the attorney background.
*  When we are assessing mens rea,
*  when we're looking at certain criminal statutes
*  where intent is required,
*  it's a reasonable person standard, right?
*  Like would a reasonable person have known that they were-
*  No, it depends on the mens rea standard.
*  So it's not the same in every case.
*  If you have to establish individual intent,
*  it's not enough to say a reasonable person should have known.
*  That would be enough for a negligent statute.
*  Usually when you're talking about reasonable people,
*  person statutes, just legally speaking,
*  a reasonable person statute is,
*  should a reasonable person have known,
*  that's when you get to like manslaughter.
*  You can't do a reasonable person standard
*  on like first degree murder.
*  So you have to establish actual motive
*  in first degree murder.
*  But for first degree murder,
*  you don't need the statement of,
*  I plan to kill this person,
*  or I intend to kill this person.
*  We can prove that state of mind.
*  No, you need it, you need it.
*  You need circumstantial evidence.
*  Correct, yes, sure, you could prove it.
*  So I feel like my feeling for Donald Trump was,
*  I think there were all these people around him
*  that he trusted to investigate election fraud.
*  He trusted Barr and the DOJ.
*  He asked Pence, his vice president, to look into it.
*  He asked his chief of staff.
*  He asked his legal counsel.
*  He has so many people that ostensibly,
*  he trusts them if he's asking them to look into it.
*  And when all of them looked into it
*  and reported back to him, no, we found nothing.
*  Unless we're gonna literally make the concession
*  that Trump might actually be a delusional psycho man,
*  at that point, should he not have realized like,
*  well, okay, maybe that's not-
*  That's not a thing you should have realized
*  the day of the election, that he lost the election.
*  But that's not the question.
*  Sure, but I'm saying that like at that point,
*  should he not have known that for him to go
*  and propagate those claims that he'd asked
*  all of the people he trusted to research,
*  and then for him to take those claims to Michigan
*  and to Georgia and then publicly
*  and to try to convince people to throw out the election,
*  you don't think that-
*  But you're doing the same thing.
*  You're reverting to, should a reasonable person have known?
*  Yes, a reasonable person should have known.
*  Did Donald Trump know?
*  That's a different question.
*  And so conflating those two questions
*  is gonna get you into some mess.
*  By the way, this is why Jack Smith charged
*  the way Jack Smith charged.
*  Jack Smith did not charge conspiracy.
*  Jack Smith did not charge insurrection.
*  He did not charge seditious conspiracy, right?
*  The reason is because Jack Smith is a good lawyer.
*  What he's doing is he's actually broadly,
*  I would say pretty obviously expanding statutory coverage
*  in weird areas in order to cover a thing
*  that doesn't quite fit into any of these legal categories.
*  But the point that I'm making is that Jack Smith
*  is on my side of this.
*  He doesn't think that he can actually establish
*  the intent necessary to convict
*  under a seditious conspiracy or an insurrection of Trump.
*  I agree with that, but I think a lot
*  of the underlying facts though,
*  because he does bring up those calls
*  to Raffensperger in Georgia.
*  He does bring up in the indictments
*  that they were knowingly false information.
*  So it seems like that's gonna be part of the case,
*  maybe not to convict on any of the four particular charges
*  that he mentioned, but it seems like that's probably
*  going to be part of what he's gonna have to establish
*  in court to convict Trump.
*  So I wanna look at the actual text of the charges.
*  So I'm sorry that I don't have the memorization.
*  I believe one's a fraud charge
*  that generally does not apply to cases like this.
*  Generally the fraud charges like you're trying
*  to steal money from the government.
*  Sure, fraud has been used pretty broadly in the past though.
*  It doesn't have to just be,
*  because Smith has done oral arguments
*  in response to a lot of the claims by Trump's lawyers.
*  This was one of them, the infinite civil
*  and criminal immunity was another one of them
*  where he cites past cases where these types of things,
*  because I think it was to defraud of civil rights,
*  I think was the fourth charge.
*  Right, so the defraud of civil rights
*  is usually somebody standing in the actual
*  like voting house door and preventing you from voting,
*  not you have a specious legal theory that you espouse
*  in court about whether those votes should be thrown out.
*  Sure, although I don't like the,
*  when we say specious legal theory and novel application,
*  which I do agree some of these in some ways is novel,
*  I don't think we've ever also had a president
*  try to do this before.
*  It is a novel situation where somebody has resisted
*  the peaceful transfer of power
*  in this clear case in so many different ways.
*  Well, if you're talking about the legal cases,
*  I mean, that's not true, but Gore sued in 2000.
*  I mean, so like if you're talking about the legal cases.
*  If this is comparable to Gore,
*  if this is comparable to Gore, then-
*  I'm not saying it's comparable to Gore.
*  I'm saying that if the idea is that espousing
*  a legal theory in court amounts to de facto,
*  some form of election denial or interference in some way
*  that can't, that's not true.
*  As a general principle, it's over-inclusive.
*  Sure, Gore wasn't trying to decertify the vote though
*  for states, right?
*  They challenged their thing to the Supreme Court.
*  They lost their case in the Supreme Court
*  and then power transfer happened.
*  Right, and Donald Trump had a bunch of legal challenges
*  and then he had a rally and then there was a riot
*  and then he left power.
*  Yeah, but the Eastman theory of what Pence could do
*  in Congress is a far cry away.
*  A truly shitty theory.
*  I mean, make no mistake.
*  But not just shitty.
*  I think that if any Democrat had done this,
*  I think that I feel like we'd be looking at it
*  in a far different lens.
*  As in we would be using terms like attempted coup,
*  subversion of peaceful transfer of power.
*  If a Democrat vice president had tried to essentially say
*  that in Congress, they could throw away the vote.
*  So I think what I wanna get to here actually,
*  so we can be more specific,
*  is why are these terms important?
*  We agree on, largely speaking, what happened.
*  I think the characterization of the term,
*  are we kind of bouncing around
*  between two different categories?
*  And I wanna make sure we check.
*  We can dump the legal stuff.
*  Okay, okay, so we're just talking about.
*  We're not looking at insight,
*  because as you said, Jack Smith,
*  nobody's charging with incitement
*  and I don't believe insurrection is a part of that.
*  So we're dumping legal.
*  Just in terms of like a president that is trying
*  to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.
*  So we do call that a bloodless coup or a coup
*  or whatever contemporaneous term you wanna use.
*  Right, so prevent the peaceful transfer of power
*  with all means or using means that are inappropriate,
*  not quite the same thing.
*  Using means that are inappropriate or illegal.
*  Okay, inappropriate.
*  Okay, so illegal, I don't think so.
*  I don't think that these charges actually meet
*  the criteria for the various charges
*  and we can discuss each case if you want.
*  Sure.
*  As far as inappropriate, sure.
*  I think in terms of inappropriate stuff.
*  I mean, inappropriate seems not.
*  The reason why I don't like the word inappropriate though
*  is because then conservatives are very quick to say,
*  well, sure, he was inappropriate,
*  but everybody was inappropriate.
*  I mean, I'll concede that he's more inappropriate
*  than others, I just don't see that as.
*  Okay, see most inappropriate.
*  Sure.
*  Okay, that's important to me though.
*  Does that not bother you that like Donald Trump
*  sought through legal and extra legal
*  and Trump magical ways of trying to entrench his power
*  as president past when he should have been able to?
*  Is that not something that was incredibly troublesome?
*  I mean, the question to me is the bigger question
*  that I think the Democrats are trying to promote
*  in this election cycle, which is this means
*  he is a threat to democracy sufficient
*  that if he were to win the election,
*  there would not be another.
*  Is that not, but he tried to do that last time.
*  Could he not try it through next time?
*  I mean, he could try to do whatever he wants presumably
*  and he would fail the same way that he did last time.
*  Why do we think that?
*  Because he failed.
*  Because he failed once and never succeeded.
*  Because he failed once and never succeeded.
*  Yes.
*  Like let's say hypothetically,
*  good Lord, save me.
*  Let's say hypothetically, Giuliani was the next
*  head of the Department of Justice.
*  Giuliani was the next attorney general.
*  How would he be confirmed?
*  Well, I'm not entirely sure if,
*  because so much of the Republican Party,
*  despite feeling like they don't support Trump
*  when it comes time to actually back him in Congress.
*  Also I'd have to check whether he would be barred
*  by criminal conviction from holding,
*  I don't know the answer to that.
*  Sure, well yeah, especially with the 14th Amendment
*  we're figuring out a lot of this right now.
*  But I mean, like say if not Giuliani,
*  say if there are any other number of insane people
*  that Trump could theoretically put on his side
*  of the government that wouldn't tell him no next time.
*  Because there were a lot of people that rebuked him.
*  There were Republicans in a lot of the states, right?
*  Rappensperger is one of them.
*  There were Republicans in his own administration.
*  You've got Rosen, you've got Barr.
*  There was his own vice president.
*  But like theoretically next time,
*  and I feel like last time going in,
*  I'm gonna do a little bit of mind reading in macro.
*  Maybe you can maybe just,
*  I think that Trump kind of thought one,
*  I don't think Trump knows much at all
*  about how the government works.
*  I think we probably agree on that.
*  I think Trump probably thought that if he had people
*  that were like at least in his party and kind of camp,
*  that they'll basically do whatever needs to be done
*  to give him what he wants and with no respect for process.
*  But now that he sees that,
*  well, it's not enough to just have allies.
*  I need people that are fiercely allegiance to me.
*  Would we not be worried that a guy
*  that tried to essentially steal the election for real,
*  wouldn't try to pick people that would be more amenable
*  to his plans in the next administration?
*  I believe in the checks and balances
*  of American government.
*  I believe they worked on January 6th.
*  So if you're asking me,
*  do I think that Trump has bad intent
*  or could have bad intent with that sort of stuff?
*  Sure.
*  Do I believe that the guardrails held
*  and will continue to hold?
*  Also, sure.
*  So if somebody was running and they blatantly said,
*  like I don't wanna use the fascist word,
*  but if they said like, I wanna be an authoritarian,
*  I'm gonna abolish all elections,
*  you would say, sure, he's saying that,
*  but like, I don't think he can actually do it.
*  So it's okay if he runs for president.
*  You don't care at all as long as you feel
*  like the guardrails are there for president.
*  I mean, I might prefer other candidates,
*  but I think that also one of the things that you do
*  is that politicians, again,
*  this would be an exceptional circumstance,
*  but politicians constantly make promises
*  about the things that they are going to do
*  and then don't fulfill.
*  And we tend to take those out in the wash,
*  meaning that if I promise that day one,
*  as Donald Trump has pledged to do,
*  that he's going to deport literally
*  every illegal immigrant to the country,
*  do I think he's actually going to do that?
*  I mean, I really highly doubt
*  he didn't do it last time he was in office.
*  There are many examples of this.
*  I agree.
*  Do I think, here's my question.
*  Do you think the guardrails are going to fail to hold?
*  I'm not sure.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, because I think the issue is,
*  is one, when it's election time,
*  Republicans are spineless in office.
*  And I don't know how many congressmen would support
*  what he wants just because they want to win reelection
*  or because they think it's inevitable anyway.
*  Well, I mean, I think that one of the things
*  that happened in 2022 is Democrats ran directly
*  on this platform and a bunch of Republicans lost
*  were running on this platform.
*  Literally every secretary of state ran
*  on the Donald Trump, we should deny elections platform
*  lost in every state.
*  Sure, but other Republicans that have been-
*  A great way to lose local office is this.
*  Sure, but I mean, like look at what happened
*  with like a Kinzinger and Cheney, right?
*  Who were very like staunchly anti-Trump after J6
*  for that select committee, right?
*  Kinzinger didn't even run again and Cheney lost her election
*  by I think the widest margin
*  than anybody has ever lost an election ever.
*  Like all of US politics.
*  People who were not even born voted again.
*  Yeah, I guess it's just, it's a surprising position to me
*  for if we're looking at like principled stances
*  of government, the idea that a man who has,
*  and I think we both agree on this, that Donald Trump's,
*  Donald Trump's only allegiance is to Donald Trump, right?
*  We agree on that.
*  The only thing he cares about is Donald Trump.
*  I don't think it's the only thing he cares about.
*  I think it's certainly the largest thing he cares about.
*  It's the largest thing he cares about, right?
*  So you've got a man who only cares about himself.
*  Welcome to politics.
*  I mean, it may be more-
*  But that's not even-
*  It may be more with Trump,
*  but it's certainly not unique to Trump.
*  I think that the issue with Trump too though is,
*  I think he's even a threat to the Republican party
*  in which I think he would mostly agree with me,
*  maybe not overall, but on every individual point,
*  Trump picks bad candidates.
*  He has no concern for the future of the Republican party.
*  Like for instance, I think there is a chance,
*  I don't think it'll happen
*  because of the polling looks now,
*  but the nomination,
*  I think Trump would say,
*  screw it and run as an independent
*  because he thinks he can win or whatever, right?
*  I doubt that he would do that,
*  but theoretically he could.
*  It's possible, yeah.
*  I mean, again, Trump has,
*  he was really content to throw Georgia,
*  the two runoff elections under the bus
*  because Ravensburg didn't support him
*  for any election stuff.
*  What is all this in service of?
*  What's the generalized argument that you're making?
*  Do you believe, I'll go back to my question.
*  Do you think that if Trump wins,
*  there will be no more elections?
*  Is that like, what percentage on it?
*  What percentage do you think that that's a reality?
*  If Donald Trump wins,
*  I think there is a 100% chance
*  that he will try to prevent the peaceful transfer of power
*  in terms of would he succeed?
*  I can guarantee you he will not do that.
*  Why is that?
*  Because he's in the second term
*  and he's no longer eligible
*  and he will believe he won and he will leave.
*  Yeah, but hasn't Donald Trump himself
*  joked about running for a third term?
*  That's it.
*  I think that having a third term.
*  What has Donald Trump not joked about?
*  I mean, forget it.
*  I don't, okay, hold on.
*  If you want to prevent him from creating a revolution,
*  you probably should actually just appoint him president
*  and then he can't run again.
*  Here's another broad argument
*  that I don't like in favor of Trump.
*  And this was brought up earlier
*  we talk about not grading presidents on a curve,
*  but then earlier we said we take Biden to reddit.
*  Oh no, I totally agree.
*  I know I 100% grade presidents on a curve.
*  Are you kidding?
*  Oh, okay.
*  I grade pretty much everybody on a curve.
*  I don't treat my seven year old
*  the same way that I treat my nine year old.
*  Sure, but I don't like that it feels like
*  we're treating Donald Trump like a seven year old
*  or a nine year old.
*  I think we should treat him
*  like the president of the United States.
*  I don't think having a president
*  that has taken concrete steps
*  to prevent the transfer of power,
*  which he did with the electorate sham,
*  which he did with Pence,
*  and what he did with trying to capitalize
*  on the J-6 violence,
*  a president that's taken concrete steps
*  towards accruing the government essentially.
*  I don't know why that guy,
*  we'd say, well, you know,
*  it's Trump, he does Trump things.
*  The guardrails held,
*  we'll probably hold next time.
*  So let me throw him in.
*  Let me say we shouldn't.
*  Do you mean that he should be actually barred from office?
*  I'm just talking about support for him.
*  I don't even think Republicans should support Trump.
*  You lose your incumbent advantage.
*  The guy's obviously self-destructive.
*  He's destructive to the political party itself.
*  Like...
*  Do you think he should be on the ballot?
*  You think there's a case to be made
*  to remove him from the ballot?
*  I think there's a case to be made,
*  but man, the phrasing,
*  for as much as our governmental founding fathers,
*  everybody else wrote nice amendments
*  and wrote nice in the Constitution,
*  some of the phrasing is very, very, very blech.
*  And the section three,
*  not requiring any type of actual conviction,
*  I don't have a strong feeling on it.
*  I will say I'm very interested in reading
*  the majority opinion from the Supreme Court.
*  I seriously doubt the Supreme Court is going to uphold
*  that states should be able to decide
*  if they leave him off the ballot or not.
*  I think for the political future of the United States,
*  it's probably not healthy that the leading opposition
*  candidate is now going to be barred from the ballot.
*  It's probably not healthy for us.
*  Cause then what?
*  You're talking about threats to democracy.
*  That would be a pretty serious one,
*  applied across the board by the way.
*  It would be, however,
*  that threat to democracy was earned by Donald Trump
*  and the conservatives that supported him.
*  I think conservatives made a dangerous gamble
*  when they threw Trump into office.
*  And now, all of the fallout from that
*  is something that we all as Americans have to deal with.
*  I mean, I think that the unprecedented legal theory
*  that a state can simply bar somebody from the ballot
*  on the basis of in an informal way,
*  believing that he is quote unquote an insurrectionist
*  is pretty wild.
*  I mean, that's-
*  We can say it's pretty wild,
*  but there is an amendment in the constitution,
*  the 14th amendment that says that if they have engaged
*  in this, they shall not be, or you shall,
*  I don't remember the phrasing
*  cause it doesn't require conviction,
*  but it's a self-executing arguably thing.
*  If we're getting into constitutional law,
*  I mean, there are a number of provisions
*  that suggest that this is number one, not self-executing.
*  I mean, minority opinions
*  in the Colorado Supreme Court case are pretty thorough.
*  The number one contention,
*  which is that this is not self-executing
*  because other elements are not self-executing,
*  that ignores subsequent actual law that happened.
*  I mean, the Congress passed a law, for example,
*  in 1872 defining who was an insurrectionist,
*  who was not an insurrectionist
*  for purposes of elections.
*  In 1994, Congress passed a law
*  that specifically defined insurrection
*  as a criminal activity
*  so that somebody could theoretically be convicted
*  of insurrection and therefore ineligible to run for office.
*  It is unlike say the analogs that are used
*  by the majority opinion like age.
*  Obviously, this is not the same thing.
*  We can all tell what somebody's age is
*  by looking at their birth certificate.
*  I can't tell whether somebody is an insurrectionist
*  without any reference to a legal statute
*  or definition of the term.
*  I would also say be careful with that
*  because remember one of Trump's first big political actions
*  was challenging Obama's birth certificate.
*  Well, and I thought that was dumb at the time.
*  Sure.
*  I like that you both said 100% chance
*  that Trump will try to go for third term
*  and 0% chance, which statistically.
*  Third term, he's done, man.
*  Are you kidding?
*  He would want to.
*  Trump's gonna walk around, hands up high.
*  He's gonna be like, I'm a two-term president.
*  I'm the only president since Grover Cleveland.
*  Since Grover Cleveland, who served two non-consecutive terms,
*  I kicked Joe Biden out of office
*  and I kicked Hillary Clinton out of office.
*  Dude would be like, he'd be living large.
*  Are you kidding?
*  He doesn't want the presidency anymore after that.
*  I just think that the, I think it's scary
*  that like Donald Trump,
*  it feels like for all of the accusations
*  that are made sometimes against Democrats,
*  like Biden is ordering Garland
*  to investigate Donald Trump and blah, blah, blah.
*  It seems like Donald Trump would actually do that
*  with his DOJ, would give them orders.
*  He didn't, he didn't.
*  Well, he kind of did though, right?
*  So for instance, with Jeffrey Clark,
*  Jeffrey Clark went to Rosen and Donahue and said,
*  hey, listen, I need you guys to sign off on a letter
*  that we're gonna use essentially to bully states
*  into overturning their elections
*  by saying we found significant election fraud.
*  And part of that threat was Jeffrey Clark saying,
*  listen, if you're not gonna do it, Rosen,
*  Trump's gonna fire you and just make me
*  the acting attorney general.
*  That was the threat that he carried.
*  And I think Trump repeated that threat
*  in a meeting later on that was,
*  I only rebuked when I think like half the White House staff
*  said, if you do this, we're resigned.
*  Okay, so that's a slightly different topic
*  because now you're getting into all the election shenanigans
*  and all of this, but-
*  Trump is saying he threatened to fire
*  his acting attorney general
*  if he wouldn't carry the same platform essentially.
*  If Trump could order his DOJ to do something, would he?
*  It's not beyond the pale for him, right?
*  It's not beyond the pale for him to order them to do it.
*  And then it's not beyond the pale for them
*  to reject him doing that,
*  which is the story of his entire administration.
*  Whereas Joe Biden orders his DOJ to do things
*  and then they just do them.
*  Well, we can get into specifics there.
*  This is one of the big problems that I have with,
*  I mean, for example, all this talk about
*  Trump tyrant, Trump executive power.
*  I mean, Joe Biden has used executive power
*  in ways that far outstrip anything that-
*  Every president has been stretching and stretching
*  and stretching executive power.
*  Joe Biden is going like,
*  Joe Biden has gone well beyond anything Trump
*  even remotely attempted to maintain
*  via just pure executive power.
*  And actually Trump's use of executive power
*  is nowhere near even what Obama's was.
*  I mean, Trump inability to get border policy passed
*  literally had him using executive power
*  to march the military down to the border
*  to do border policy.
*  I mean-
*  I mean, Joe Biden literally used the Occupational Safety
*  and Hazard Administration to try to cram down
*  vax mandates on 80 million Americans.
*  That's insane.
*  He literally said,
*  I cannot relieve student loan debt
*  and then tried to relieve
*  hundreds of billions of dollars in student loan debt.
*  Yeah, but what happened to that?
*  It got struck down by the Supreme Court
*  and then they still did it.
*  They still did it.
*  Biden brags about it.
*  For what he was able to relieve,
*  which I think were related to particular types
*  of student loan debt.
*  But I'm just saying that like,
*  well, the guardrails are holding with Biden
*  as much as they're holding with Trump.
*  The only difference is that once Biden
*  exhausts his executive power,
*  he's not running around like lying to people
*  or trying to extort people
*  or trying to concoct insane schemes.
*  Well, I mean, here's the way I would think of this.
*  Think of the guardrails holding as the filter.
*  Okay? Sure.
*  Meaning like the coffee is in the filter.
*  Some of it's, you know,
*  what you want is gonna get through and all this stuff.
*  The guardrails prevent the other stuff from getting through.
*  Now the question becomes,
*  what liquid are you pouring into the filter?
*  Okay, meaning so if I'm,
*  if the filter exists, if the guardrails hold,
*  and if Donald Trump can't steal elections,
*  what's the policy that comes through
*  the other end of the filter?
*  The policy I get from Donald Trump
*  on the other end of the filter
*  is a bunch of stuff that I like.
*  The policy that I get from Joe Biden
*  on the other end of the filter
*  is a bunch of bullshit I don't.
*  So that's the basic calculation.
*  Okay, so then the idea is essentially that
*  Donald Trump's rhetoric is insane, but we don't care.
*  Donald Trump would probably try to steal an election
*  if he could, but he probably won't be able to.
*  He's not gonna do it again.
*  I told you.
*  He's not.
*  You don't think he has any, why not?
*  Because he won't be eligible to be on the ballot in,
*  I mean, by the way, you want to talk about 14th Amendment?
*  That's where the 14th Amendment applies.
*  Okay, that's where it actually applies,
*  meaning you cannot, he is not qualified to be on the ballot
*  in 2028 if he is the President of the United States.
*  States can literally, in self-executing fashion,
*  take him off the ballot.
*  Just like he's past the age of 35,
*  once you have been President two times,
*  you're no longer eligible to be President
*  of the United States.
*  Why do you think-
*  Then you actually have a strong little place
*  to keep him off the ballot.
*  Why would the 14th Amendment stop him
*  if he thought Vice President Pence
*  could unilaterally decide the outcome of the election?
*  When he's not on the ballot?
*  Now your theory is that he's gonna get re-elected,
*  and then in 2028, he's not even gonna be on the ballot,
*  and he's gonna direct his new Vice President,
*  Kerry Lake, to simply declare him President
*  of the United States when he has not been on a ballot?
*  I don't know what the scheme would be.
*  I think we can kind of laugh and say,
*  there's no scheme we could even concoct, but I think-
*  Macho Macho, with the machine gun,
*  he's gonna walk into the-
*  I think the issue, though, is that the idea
*  of electing another President that has tried
*  to circumvent the peaceful transfer of power
*  using extra-legal means, and then pretending
*  we can't concoct a single scheme
*  that he could try to circumvent other legal processes
*  to have a third term or to have a longer term
*  or to install who he wants as the next President.
*  I just, when a person has already shown you who they are,
*  and with every single person around him agrees with that,
*  when every single person that's worked with him,
*  save for the, what, Sidney Powell, Eastman, and Giuliani,
*  which I don't think even, I don't think anybody
*  would wanna throw their lot in with those three,
*  it just seems wild to me that we would say,
*  yeah, we're just gonna go ahead and trust this guy
*  with another term of President,
*  and then we'll be like, oh, he can't run for a third term,
*  so it's fine, when there's like 50 million other things-
*  And I'll make you the case that if you want him
*  not to make election trouble, you should elect him President
*  in the next election cycle,
*  and then he will be ineligible.
*  Okay, well, I find that to be a wholly unconvincing argument,
*  but okay.
*  Well, recently in the news, the Presidents of Harvard,
*  Penn, and MIT failed to fully denounce calls for genocide,
*  and that rose questions about the influence
*  of DEI programs at universities,
*  so maybe either looking at this,
*  or zooming out more broadly at identity politics
*  at universities or identity politics,
*  wokeism in our culture, how big of a threat is it
*  to our culture, to Western civilization, Penn?
*  So obviously I'm gonna say it's a huge threat.
*  The reason that I think there's a huge threat,
*  I wanna give a definition of wokeism
*  because people are very often accused
*  of not using wokeism properly,
*  or believing that it's sort of a catch-all phrase.
*  I don't think it's a catch-all term.
*  I think that wokeism has its roots in postmodernism,
*  which essentially suggests that every principle
*  is a reflection of underlying structures of power,
*  and that therefore any inequality that emerges
*  under such a system is a reflection, again,
*  of that structure of power.
*  That used to be applied in sort of Marxist ways,
*  the suggestion being that economic inequality
*  was the result of misallocation of power in the structure
*  preserved by an upper crust of people
*  who wanted to cram down exploitation on people.
*  That was sort of the Marxist version of postmodernism,
*  and that got transmuted into sort of a racial version
*  of postmodernism in which the systems of the United States
*  are white supremacist in orientation,
*  and are perpetuated by a group of people
*  who are in fact in favor of the preservation
*  of white power and white supremacy.
*  That is the generalized theory of critical race theory,
*  as proposed by, for example, Gene Stefanczyk
*  and Richard Delgado in their book on critical race theory.
*  That has taken a softer form that we refer to as DEI.
*  The key in DEI is the E, meaning equity.
*  So equity is a term that does not mean equality.
*  People mix it up.
*  Equality is the idea that we all ought to have equal rights,
*  that we all ought to be treated equally by the law.
*  Equity is the idea that if there is an inequality
*  that emerges from any system,
*  it is therefore due to discrimination.
*  And the best way to tell whether somebody has been victimized
*  is by dint of their race.
*  And we can tell whether you're a member
*  of an oppressed group or an oppressor group
*  by the intersectional identity that you carry,
*  and by the nature of your group's success or failure
*  predominantly along economic and power lines
*  in American life.
*  This means that if one group
*  is predominantly successful economically,
*  they must be a member of the victimizing class.
*  And the only corrective for that would be,
*  as Ibrahim X. Kennedy likes to suggest,
*  effectively anti-racist policies,
*  racism in the service of destroying racism,
*  that you're going to have to discriminate
*  on the basis of race in order to correct for discrimination
*  that's baked into the system.
*  That's incredibly dangerous.
*  It leads to a victim victimizer narrative
*  that is unhealthy for individuals
*  and terrible for societies.
*  It relieves people of individual responsibility,
*  and it destroys the very notion of an objective metric
*  by which we can decide meritocracy.
*  And meritocracy is the only system human beings
*  have ever devised that has positive externalities
*  in literally any area of life.
*  Every other distribution of wealth, power,
*  done along other lines that is not having to do with merit
*  has negative externalities.
*  Every system having to do with merit
*  has positive externalities because presumably
*  the most effective and useful people
*  are going to succeed under those systems.
*  That's the very basis of a meritocracy.
*  And the externalities of that mean
*  that other people benefit from the meritorious
*  and excellent performance of those people.
*  Maybe you'd be good to get your comments,
*  your old stomping ground Harvard.
*  Do you think the president of Harvard
*  should have been fired?
*  I mean, I think she should have been fired
*  not over the plagiarism allegations.
*  I think she should have been fired
*  based on her performance just at that congressional hearing.
*  If the word black had been substituted for Jew
*  in that statement by Elise Stefanik
*  that she was asking about, or trans,
*  or literally any other minority in America,
*  maybe with the exception of Asian,
*  then the answer would have been very different
*  coming from cloudy and gay.
*  With that said, I don't think the firing of cloudy and gay
*  really accomplishes very much.
*  Did she get what she deserved?
*  Sure.
*  Does that mean that the underlying DEI
*  equity-based system has been in any way severely damaged?
*  No, I think that this is a way for universities,
*  as truthful as McGillip Penn also,
*  to basically throw somebody overboard as the sacrifice
*  to maintain the underlying system
*  that continues to predominate at American universities
*  where they spend literally billions of dollars
*  every year on DEI initiatives and diversity hires
*  and diversity administrators and all of this.
*  One of the costs of education escalating
*  is in the massive administrative function
*  that is now undertaken by universities,
*  as opposed to teaching and cost of dorms and such.
*  You guys probably agree on a lot of this, right?
*  Kind of, maybe, yeah.
*  I don't know what makes things do this,
*  but it feels like we can never have a good thing
*  and then have it end as a good thing.
*  Things always get taken to their extreme,
*  and then we have to fight on those extremes.
*  I would argue that, back in my day,
*  we called it SJW, social justice warriors,
*  before it became woke, like 2013 onwards, whatever.
*  There are aspects to woke-ism that I think are good.
*  I like the additional representation
*  that we have in media now.
*  I like how, as much as people complain about the internet
*  and how it's regulated, that there are way more groups
*  that are represented on the internet,
*  whether we're talking ex the platform formerly known
*  as Twitter or Facebook or whatever,
*  I think in some ways, or whether we're pushing
*  women's achievements in school and in the wider workforce,
*  we're all good things.
*  The issue that you run into is,
*  people don't ever have a stopping point,
*  and I think people kind of get lost
*  in this woke-for-woke-sake thing,
*  where we start to see these very weird warpings
*  of these academic, I guess, arguments
*  that are used for really horrible things.
*  So, for instance, I think that you can talk about,
*  in the United States, things like white supremacy
*  or things like oppression or certain demographics,
*  especially with Jim Crow laws and pre-Jim Crow,
*  and you can even talk about effects from that.
*  And I think that's a weird world
*  where we've kind of warped these things
*  so that not only is white supremacy still as present today
*  as it ever has been, well, actually,
*  black people in other minorities can't even be racist.
*  They don't have the power to,
*  because we're gonna use a different definition of racism,
*  and we can only talk about punching up
*  as opposed to punching down,
*  and we're actually gonna say it's totally okay
*  for these people to say or do whatever they want,
*  and it's never bad, but white people
*  who have always been the oppressors,
*  even if you're a trailer park guy
*  whose family's addicted to meth,
*  you have all this privilege, et cetera, et cetera,
*  I think that you run into these issues
*  where woke-ism, it starts off as a really good idea,
*  has achieved really good things,
*  especially in regards to women's education and everything,
*  and then it just gets so academia-ized,
*  so there's a word there, academic, whatever,
*  where you take something and you put it in a school too much
*  and then it comes out as some Frankenstein cancer baby
*  of horrible things, such that today, when I'm reading stuff,
*  and I know Ben is the same way,
*  if I even hear somebody say the word anti-racism,
*  I'm probably ignoring every other thing you have to say.
*  If you utter the word colonial, anything,
*  I'm probably gonna say you probably don't have anything
*  good to say.
*  Yeah, a lot of it has just taken way too far,
*  but you know what I will blame on some of this
*  is I will blame conservatives for some of this,
*  because I think one issue that happens,
*  and I think Ben might even agree with me here too,
*  is I think there's two huge problems
*  that have happened in the United States,
*  I think broadly speaking,
*  is that one, we become more different than we ever have been,
*  and two, we become more similar than we ever have been,
*  and when I say this, what I mean is that
*  we're splitting off into these groups,
*  and then these groups are enforcing this insane homogeneity
*  between these two separate groups,
*  and I think one of these schisms has been
*  conservatives' reluctancy to participate
*  in things related to higher education.
*  So for a long time, conservatives are saying,
*  oh, the educational institutions are against us,
*  Rush Limbaugh talks about how evil the colleges are
*  and blah, blah, blah, and then what happens is
*  as conservatives are less and less willing
*  to engage in them, so then you get this scenario
*  or this environment where everybody that's engaged in
*  academia on the administrative side are fucking insane.
*  Even more so to, and I also wanna draw a distinction
*  between the administrators and the faculty,
*  because oftentimes when you're reading story after story
*  after story of all of these insane admins
*  that are pushing further and further left,
*  usually the faculty is fighting against it.
*  A lot of the tenure professors,
*  a lot of people in their departments are saying,
*  hold on, well, we actually don't agree with this,
*  but I feel like because conservatives for so long
*  have demonized these institutions,
*  rather than critically evaluated them
*  and tried to have honest critique and engagement
*  that they've just completely broken off,
*  and when you only have a bunch of lefties
*  or righties together, all they'll do is
*  they're veer off even more into their insane directions.
*  I feel like that's a big problem that we run into
*  in the country to where conservatives have totally
*  broken off some conversations, broken away from,
*  where they won't participate in them anymore,
*  and then the people that you have left
*  just run as far to the left as possible.
*  Certainly when you look at certain institutions,
*  I think that one of the things that people
*  on both sides of the aisle are constantly looking at
*  is has the institution suffered such capture
*  that there is just no capacity to fix it?
*  And when you talk about the universities,
*  I'm not gonna blame conservatives
*  for the failure of the universities
*  because they haven't been present in major positions
*  at universities since effectively the late 1960s.
*  You can go read Shelby Steele's work on this
*  where he talks about how he used to be,
*  he's now a conservative black person,
*  he was a liberal black person at the time,
*  and he was actually quite a radical black activist
*  at the time in the 60s, and he talks about walking
*  into the office of liberal administrators
*  who are largely on his side with regard to civil rights,
*  and being a radical, him claiming that the systems
*  of the university were inherently broken,
*  were inherently wrong, unfixable,
*  and he talks about this, it's a very evocative episode
*  where he's talking about how he's smoking,
*  and as he's smoking, the ash is growing more and more,
*  and the ash falls down on this very expensive carpet.
*  And the president of the university
*  who's listening to him rant and rave,
*  he said, Shelby Steele says,
*  I thought he was gonna say something about this,
*  I mean, I was wrecking like a thousand dollar carpet
*  in his office being a jackass,
*  and instead I could see him wilt inside,
*  I could see him collapse,
*  he didn't have the institutional credibility
*  or sort of the spiritual strength to just say,
*  listen, I agree with you on some of these things,
*  but you're acting like a jackass.
*  And what you see in the late 1960s and early 1970s
*  is in fact the collapse of these institutions
*  to the point where by the time I was going to college,
*  there was this radical disproportion
*  between conservatives and liberals,
*  and the problem is that when it comes to a system
*  like the universities, basically you have to separate
*  the universities off into two separate categories.
*  One is STEM, where the universities
*  are still pretty damn good.
*  Our American universities when it comes to STEM
*  are still leading universities in the world.
*  Harvard's main creations these days are coming
*  from actual hard science fields.
*  Then you have the liberal arts field
*  in which you basically have a self-perpetuating elite
*  because that's actually how dissertations work.
*  If you have somebody who's very far to the left
*  and you decide that you're gonna write a dissertation
*  on the history of American gun rights,
*  the chances that that is going to be approved
*  by your dissertation advisor are much lower
*  than if you happen to write something that tends to agree
*  with the political positions of your dissertation advisor.
*  Now, listen, I think there are open and tolerant professors
*  even in the liberal arts at these universities.
*  I went to these universities, right?
*  I went to UCLA, I went to Harvard Law School.
*  When I was at Harvard Law School,
*  one of my favorite professors was Lani Guinier.
*  Lani Guinier, they tried to appoint her,
*  I believe, Secretary of Labor under Clinton,
*  and she was too liberal and she got rejected.
*  So she was like a full-on communist.
*  By the time I went there, she was great.
*  We had debates every day, it was wonderful.
*  She used to write me recommendations
*  for my legal jobs after we left.
*  Randall Kennedy, I don't agree with him very much.
*  Randall Kennedy was terrific professor.
*  There are some professors who are like this.
*  Unfortunately, there tends to be in these echo chambers
*  more and more ideological conformity
*  that is rigorously enforced and it is by left on left.
*  So for example, when I was at Harvard Law School,
*  the president of the university was another president
*  who ended up being ousted, Larry Summers.
*  Larry Summers had been the Secretary of Treasury
*  under Bill Clinton and he made the critical error
*  of suggesting that perhaps the dearth of women
*  in hard sciences in prestigious positions
*  was due to possibly two factors
*  that people were refusing to talk about.
*  One was the possibility that women actually
*  didn't want to be in hard sciences
*  at nearly the rates that men do, which happens to be true.
*  And two was the distribution of STEM IQ, right?
*  Which is something that you certainly
*  were not allowed to talk about.
*  The idea that the men's bell curve when it comes to IQ,
*  particularly on STEM subjects,
*  tends to be shallower than women's bell curves.
*  When you get to the very end of the bell curve,
*  what you tend to see is a lot of really dumb guys
*  and a lot of really smart guys.
*  And so when you're talking about the top universities,
*  maybe that has something to do with the disproportion.
*  And he's trying to explain that to say
*  that our systems are not discriminating.
*  If we end up with more men than women,
*  maybe more men are applying and more men are qualified.
*  That's quite, he was ousted for that
*  by a left-wing faculty and general alum network
*  at Harvard University.
*  There's a lot to blame conservatives for
*  for surrendering the playing field.
*  I totally agree that conservatives should not have
*  surrendered the playing field in some institutions.
*  Colleges were surrendered a lot earlier than 20 years ago.
*  They were surrendered in the late 1960s, early 1970s.
*  Yeah, so I think that a couple of things.
*  So one of the big issues that I have with kind of like this,
*  I don't know if we call it error of Trumpism or populism,
*  is this total disregard for institutions
*  and this disconnect from participation in the system.
*  So it's one of the big things that I fight with progressives
*  about who cares, because they're all 20 years old,
*  they don't vote anyway.
*  But it's another thing that I noticed with a lot of people
*  that are Trump voters, Trump fans or whatever,
*  is this idea where we say this institution
*  is irrevocably destroyed.
*  It's irredeemable, it can't be saved.
*  Nothing that we do can fix it.
*  And I think that what that leads people to doing is one,
*  they disconnect further and then two,
*  there's a general hopelessness when it comes to how society
*  is like ran or structured, such that you fall into
*  that populist brain rot of the only person that can save me
*  is Donald Trump, I can't trust literally anything.
*  And I think that when you start driving people
*  into that direction, all it does is it further amplifies
*  all the problems that you're complaining about.
*  So that's one of the reasons why when we talk about
*  like conservative participation, I want there to be more
*  conservatives that are trying to participate in academia,
*  but I feel like the leading thought or the leading speaking
*  out against it is basically saying it's a waste of time,
*  it's completely lost.
*  So I think that the alternative to that is that
*  you are seeing on the right a growth of, for example,
*  alternative universities.
*  Yeah, but that's the worst thing.
*  No, I don't think so at all.
*  I think competition is a great way of incentivizing
*  some change on behalf of universities
*  that may have forgotten that there's an entire
*  another side of the aisle in the United States.
*  No, no shot.
*  I don't believe even, I don't think even you think that.
*  So first of all, let me make clear.
*  I think the entire educational system at the upper levels,
*  if you're not in STEM is a complete scam.
*  I think it's a complete waste of money.
*  I think it's a complete waste of time.
*  And I think that it's all it is is a formalized,
*  very expensive sorting mechanism for people of IQ.
*  That's all it is.
*  People take an SAT, you go to a good school,
*  you take four years of bullshit.
*  I know I did it at UCLA.
*  And then we analyze based on your degree,
*  where you should go to law school.
*  I could have gone directly from high school to law school
*  with maybe one year of training
*  and then done one year of law school and been done.
*  Okay, the reality is that this is a giant scam.
*  And this again, it's a bipartisan problem,
*  but it's just a generalized problem.
*  That we have, you wanna talk about things
*  that hurt the lower classes in the United States.
*  The bleeding of degrees up is so wild and crazy.
*  There's so many jobs in the United States
*  that should not require a college degree
*  that we now require a college degree to do.
*  Because there was this weird idea that came over Americans
*  where they mistook correlation for causation.
*  They would say, oh, look, people who go to college
*  are making more money than people who don't go to college.
*  Therefore, everyone should go to college.
*  Well, maybe the reason is because people
*  who are going to college were better qualified
*  for particular jobs because on average, not all the time,
*  but on average, a lot of those people were smarter
*  and making more money because of that.
*  And so all you've done is you've now created
*  these additional layers of stratification.
*  So a person who used to be able to get a job
*  with a college degree now has to have a postdoc degree
*  in order to go get that degree.
*  A person who used to be able to just graduate high school,
*  now it's de facto, you gotta go to JuCo
*  and then you gotta go to college
*  or nobody's even gonna look at your resume.
*  It's really, really terrible.
*  For people who can't afford all of that,
*  it's led to this massive increase in educational cost
*  that is inexplicable other than this particular
*  sort of bleed up and by the way, federal subsidies
*  for higher education.
*  Again, one of my problems with federal subsidies
*  for higher education, I'd love for everyone
*  to be able to go to college if qualified to do so
*  and if it is productive.
*  But one of the things I did when I went to law school
*  is I took loans because a bank said,
*  I was gonna get my money back
*  if I got a law degree from Harvard.
*  But you know when you're not gonna get your money back?
*  If you're a bank, you're not gonna lend to some dude
*  who wants to major in art theory
*  because is that a good bet?
*  There's no collateral, right?
*  If I give a loan for a house, I can go repossess the house.
*  How do I repossess your garbage college degree from UCLA?
*  There's no way to do that.
*  So this is a broader conversation
*  about education in general.
*  I think the educational system is cruising for a bruising
*  and I think all that's necessary
*  for it to completely collapse on the non-STEM side
*  where you actually learn things
*  is for people who employ to simply say,
*  give me your SAT score and I will hire you
*  for an apprenticeship directly out of high school.
*  That it would cut out so much of the middleman.
*  But as far as the general point
*  that you're making about institutions,
*  I may disagree on the education and how far it's gone.
*  In general, I agree with you.
*  So in general, I agree and I guess you use my favorite,
*  longest word in the English language here.
*  I would consider myself in many cases
*  an anti-disestablishmentarianist.
*  I like to drop that.
*  That's it, because if you're an establishmentarian,
*  that means you like the establishment.
*  Disestablishmentarianism, right.
*  Can you say that word, Justin?
*  That's the one we all learned growing up,
*  anti-disestablishmentarianism.
*  There you go.
*  Longest word in the dictionary.
*  And so he is also.
*  And then some candidate group would say,
*  what about supercalifragilisticexpialineuridine?
*  What about pneumo-ultra-recloscopiccy?
*  Yeah, or the science terms.
*  Or what about the 7,000 letter thing
*  that's from part of biochemistry?
*  I got my education in the Soviet Union,
*  so we just did math.
*  That's why you're a useful person.
*  Soviet Union math was that one plus one,
*  how to make that equal three?
*  We know long words, and he screams on the internet.
*  And I talk for a living.
*  So anyway, but the point is that I don't disagree
*  that there is a general populist tendency
*  on all sides of the aisle to look at the institutions
*  and then throw them overboard.
*  I think that some of that is earned
*  by people who are in positions of power at institutions
*  who have completely undermined the faith and credibility
*  of those institutions.
*  I think that you have to examine institution by institutions
*  which ones are salvageable and which ones are not.
*  So I'm not a full anti-disestablishmentarianism.
*  I'd be partially in that camp.
*  There are certain institutions like higher education
*  in the liberal arts that I think we may be better off without.
*  And then there are certain institutions,
*  like say participation in American government,
*  where when people talk about we need a revolution,
*  like no, we don't, that's not a thing.
*  We need an evolution, we need change,
*  we can use the system.
*  But I think you have to establish,
*  you have to look at it industry by industry,
*  institution by institution.
*  On that position of institutions,
*  do you think Biden or Trump would salvage you more?
*  As far as the institutions,
*  I think the institutions in the United States
*  at the governmental level are robust.
*  I think the social institutions are fit.
*  Yeah, but I'm just curious,
*  in your general view of institutions,
*  do you think Biden or Trump would salvage you more
*  on how you view them?
*  I mean, I think that in rhetoric, Biden would,
*  and then I think that he would tear out the face
*  of the institution and wear it around
*  like a mask like Hannibal Lector.
*  Even though he resisted some people's calls
*  to pack the court and...
*  Yes, because I think that his use of executive power
*  was greater than that of Donald Trump.
*  The power that he had, he used greater effect
*  than Donald Trump.
*  And he was crushed up against the sides of the box,
*  but could not get out of it.
*  Okay, for just on real quick,
*  because that answer went a lot further than the initial one.
*  Yeah, just on the real quick thing,
*  the reason why I, again, my main problem
*  that I feel like we have today in society
*  is people are getting into their own bubbles.
*  The idea of having conservative schools and liberal schools
*  seems like the saddest thing in the world to me.
*  I would want conservatives and liberals
*  going to school together,
*  because I think these people need to interact
*  with each other more, if for no other reason,
*  than to say that the other person
*  is not like an actual monstrous, horrible entity
*  I think a classically liberal idea for many schools
*  would not be a bad thing, I think it would be a good thing.
*  Just wonder if that's salvageable.
*  And if it's not salvageable,
*  then the answer to that is to actually
*  create alternative institutions.
*  I feel like the biggest issue that we have
*  is people are, they sort into these different
*  phantom worlds to where,
*  even if you live in the same city,
*  there are totally different worlds
*  that exist between liberals and conservatives.
*  And I feel like one of the big barriers
*  to people understanding the other side,
*  sometimes it's just a little bit of information
*  or a little bit of firsthand experience.
*  So in terms of information, I'm sure you saw,
*  I don't know if this is a full on study,
*  but they were talking about how some huge percentage
*  of students would change their mind on
*  from the river to the sea,
*  when you told them what from the river to the sea
*  actually meant. What the river was
*  and what the sea was, yeah.
*  Yeah, or when you said like,
*  yeah, what does a one state solution mean?
*  A lot of them, such that the numbers went from like 70%
*  to like 30% in terms of support would fall.
*  And it wasn't because you were doing
*  a radical redefining of their whole ideology,
*  you were just giving them a little bit more information.
*  And then something that I've seen on a firsthand level is
*  when I go and speak or do debates at universities,
*  sometimes I'm in very, very, very conservative areas.
*  Some of my fans are trans.
*  Having a trans person show up
*  and talk to conservatives for a little bit,
*  not like in a speech,
*  just like in like a bar or a setting,
*  like a lot of them walk away thinking like,
*  oh, not every trans person is like this insane lunatic
*  from Twitter that is fucking an actual crazy person.
*  And then for some of my fans,
*  when they hang out with conservatives,
*  they're like, oh, these guys are actually pretty friendly.
*  I thought they would have all been homophobic,
*  racist, transphobic and evil, but they're not.
*  They're just like normal people.
*  I feel like we need more of that.
*  I totally agree with that, certainly.
*  Yeah, and I feel like on our social media platforms,
*  on our algorithms, in our schools,
*  I feel like we're sorting harder and harder and harder.
*  And any type of rhetoric that encourages the sorting
*  is really bad and damaging.
*  We need to like continue to mix up.
*  And there's other things I wanna talk about,
*  but Lex is opening his mouth.
*  Destiny the Uniter, wow.
*  Like Biden.
*  Not like Trump.
*  As we approach the end,
*  let us descend into the meme further and further.
*  Ben, you're in a monogamous marriage.
*  Destiny, you've been mostly in an open marriage
*  until recently.
*  How foundational is marriage, monogamous marriage
*  to the United States of America?
*  Can open marriages work?
*  Are they harmful to society?
*  Ben.
*  Marriages are the single most important thing
*  that people can do in the United States
*  because the things within your control
*  are easier to control than the things outside your control.
*  People tend to think about big political change,
*  obviously about things they can do
*  to change the entire system.
*  But the reality is the thing that you can do,
*  the best change of society is to get married
*  and have kids and raise your kids responsibly.
*  That is the single best thing that you can do.
*  Can an open marriage work?
*  I mean, I think that it depends on your definition of work.
*  So in my version of work, the answer is no,
*  because what you actually need
*  in order to facilitate the healthy growing of a child
*  is a father and mother who are committed to each other.
*  All ideas about there being no emotional component
*  to sexual activity are completely specious.
*  That is true for men than it is for women,
*  but it's not true for either.
*  The idea of a full commitment to a human being
*  with whom you genetically create children,
*  which is typically how we've done it
*  throughout human existence,
*  is in fact the fundamental basis
*  for any functional civilization.
*  It allows for the transmission of culture and values.
*  It allows for the transmission of beliefs and responsibility.
*  And it gives the great lie to both the communitarian lie
*  and the atomistic individualist lie.
*  The communitarian lie is that you belong
*  to the giant community of man,
*  which is not true because you have a family,
*  and your allegiance should be and is naturally
*  to the members of your family first.
*  That's how we learn, and then we expound that out.
*  And it also is a lie to the notion
*  that we are all atomistic individuals
*  with no responsibilities.
*  We are born into a world of responsibilities.
*  Everyone is born into a world of responsibilities
*  and rules and roles, and those are good.
*  And if we do not actually socialize our children that way,
*  there will be, number one, no children.
*  Number one, there will be no healthy children.
*  Number two, there will be no healthy children.
*  Number three, there will be not the foundation
*  for either social fabric,
*  which is the real glue that holds together society,
*  or for a functional government.
*  So yes, yes, monogamous marriage.
*  I'm a fan.
*  15 years married, four kids, yes.
*  Destiny, what do you think?
*  I think that when we talk about relationships or marriage,
*  I think something that's really important is we have
*  to talk about whether or not children
*  are being discussed or not.
*  Because I think once you introduce the child aspect,
*  I think the style or the type of relationship that you do
*  is gonna become way more important
*  than whatever exists prior to that.
*  I would agree, for instance, in terms of what Ben is saying,
*  that there's probably going to be some structure
*  that is ideal for the care and the raising of a child.
*  I think that having a child gives you a much bigger buy-in
*  to society, because now all of a sudden,
*  you care about a lot of things
*  that you might not have before,
*  because not only do you exist in society,
*  you can't just run.
*  Now you've got a child that exists there,
*  and you've got to ensure that everything functions smoothly,
*  not just for you, but for that child as well.
*  And arguably, although we're getting into weird places,
*  I guess, in the world now,
*  like children are the primary conduit
*  for where you transmit cultural values and everything.
*  The one kind of weird thing that we're coming up against,
*  that we have been coming up against now
*  for some number of decades, and we'll continue to,
*  is as societies progress,
*  seems like people are having less children,
*  and I actually don't know 100%
*  what the answer is to that question.
*  I do.
*  Yeah, I'm sure you do, yeah.
*  I mean, an implementable answer that works,
*  that we know we can get everybody on board with,
*  it seems like, for a large part of human history,
*  having children, and it still is,
*  having children is awesome, and children are cool,
*  and children are magical and miraculous and all of this,
*  but you didn't really have much competing
*  for your attention to have a child, right?
*  When you hit a certain age and you started working,
*  especially if you're a woman,
*  I mean, childbirth is kind of the next step,
*  and then having a family raising your children,
*  and then doing that is kind of the next step.
*  Nowadays, especially with women being able to work,
*  especially women having access to birth control,
*  there's a lot available in the world
*  that's competing for the interest of people
*  that could otherwise be having children,
*  such that we've almost flipped it,
*  such that, as Ben brought up earlier,
*  like wealthy people tend to have less children
*  than not wealthy people.
*  Or unless you're part of particular religious communities
*  that push childbirth a lot.
*  I don't know if I would say there exists a moral imperative
*  on an individual to have children.
*  I think that there's a lot of interesting arguments
*  down that path.
*  I don't know if we're quite at the point yet
*  where we need to say like,
*  oh my God, we're running out of people,
*  we need to have more kids.
*  I don't think we're quite there yet,
*  but we are seeing weird demographic trends
*  that are having big impacts on how countries
*  are playing out.
*  For instance, the fact that we have
*  a disproportionately huge aging population
*  that needs to be taken care of with medical expenses
*  and everything, that vote in different ways
*  than our younger population,
*  and that when they die off,
*  like the way that society is gonna look
*  is gonna be a lot different.
*  Yeah, I don't actually have a,
*  I'm not entirely sure what the future's gonna look like
*  in terms of pushing people to have kids
*  when every single industrialized country,
*  as they become more industrialized,
*  have fewer and fewer and fewer children.
*  Rapid fire questions.
*  Ben, the answer, my answer was?
*  Go to church.
*  Religion, yeah, I figured.
*  Well, we could talk about religion,
*  but that's not rapid fire at all.
*  Let me ask, this is from the internet,
*  does body count matter?
*  Jesus Christ.
*  You're really bringing up the red pill stuff.
*  Are you avoiding answering?
*  I mean, it's totally, it depends on who you are.
*  If you're somebody that doesn't care about it, it doesn't.
*  If you're somebody that does care about it,
*  yeah, it does, of course.
*  Depends on the, the answer is yes.
*  Okay, should porn be banned?
*  No.
*  If you could do it, yes.
*  There is no benefit to pornography.
*  It's a waste of time and destructive to the human soul.
*  I can't believe I'm asking this question.
*  Is OnlyFans empowering or destructive for women?
*  Jesus, these are rapid fire?
*  Yeah, just, wow.
*  I mean, it's probably empowering for the ones
*  that are making a lot of money off it.
*  It probably feels disempowering for others
*  that feel affected by the cultural norms set by women
*  that do OnlyFans.
*  There's my rapid fire answer.
*  It's destructive to even the ones
*  who are making a lot of money,
*  because when you degrade yourself
*  to being just a set of human body characteristics
*  that other people jack off to,
*  it's bad for you and it's bad for them.
*  Is rap music?
*  Absolutely.
*  Have you evolved on this or?
*  Have I evolved on this?
*  So again, I'm gonna go to what's the definition of music.
*  My original argument about rap was that music involves
*  the following three elements, rhythm, melody, harmony.
*  Rap typically involves maybe one of those.
*  There may be a melody, maybe, sometimes.
*  So it depends on the kind of rap.
*  With that said, I could be convinced on this issue,
*  but listen, I'm a classical violinist.
*  I mean, that's how I was raised.
*  I listened to Beethoven and Brahms and Mozart,
*  like in the car with my kids.
*  So is it comparable, is it in the same category
*  as Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart?
*  I have a very hard time sticking it
*  in the same category as that.
*  All right, you're both world-class debaters,
*  even public intellectuals, if I can say that.
*  Jesus.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  I'm going real hard here.
*  I know.
*  You both care about the truth.
*  What is your process of arriving at the truth?
*  I think it's really important to,
*  everybody will say that they're objective
*  and that they are nonpartisan.
*  I think it's really important to have mental safeguards
*  for bad opinions.
*  So for instance, like a couple things that I'll ask myself
*  is for a particular debate that I'm having,
*  like can I argue convincingly both sides of the debate?
*  If I can't, I won't bother having the debate
*  because I realize that I'm probably too
*  partisanly dug in if I can't even represent
*  like an opposite argument here.
*  Another question that you might ask yourself is like,
*  well, what would it take to convince you
*  out of a certain position?
*  If you feel very strongly that Medicare for all
*  is a good system by which to run
*  the United States healthcare,
*  and somebody says, well, what would it take you
*  to convince you otherwise if you can't even fathom?
*  Like, well, what would it take to convince me otherwise?
*  You're probably too dug into a position.
*  So I think if you go through life saying like,
*  well, I try my best to be unbiased
*  rather than saying, I try my best to be aware of my biases
*  because the latter is more realistic
*  and the former is literally impossible
*  unless you're a computer.
*  Yeah, so I think having like actual mental practices
*  that you engage in to try to counter some of the biases
*  that you have is more important than trying to pretend
*  that you're free of all biases
*  and then consuming all your media from one source.
*  Ben?
*  So, I mean, I agree with a lot of that.
*  I think that the easiest practical guide
*  is read a bunch of different things
*  from a bunch of different sources
*  and where they cross is probably the set of fact
*  and then everything else is extrapolated opinion
*  from different premises.
*  That's sort of the short story.
*  So read the New York Times and Breitbart
*  and they're gonna disagree on a lot
*  but if the core of the story-
*  And the Daily Wire.
*  Certainly read the Daily Wire.
*  If you read the Daily Wire and you read the Washington Post
*  and there's a nexus of the same thing,
*  then you can pretty well guarantee that at least,
*  if we're all blind men feeling the elephant,
*  at least if we're all feeling the trunk,
*  we know that there's a trunk there, right?
*  You may not know what the elephant is.
*  And if you're feeling frisky, then watch Destiny as well.
*  Thanks.
*  You've talked about having a conversation debating Ben
*  for a long time.
*  What is your favorite thing about Ben Shapiro?
*  My favorite thing about Ben Shapiro
*  is at least when we're in election season,
*  he's very critical of his own party.
*  I appreciate that.
*  I feel like Ben generally tries to adhere more
*  to the fact-based arguments than other conservatives
*  that I listen to, which is something that I appreciate
*  because it's more fun to fight on kind of like
*  the factual grounds of discussing things
*  like foreign policy or whatever,
*  rather than people that only inhabit the idealistic
*  or philosophical grounds because they don't wanna learn
*  about any of the facts, so I appreciate that.
*  Ben, you've gotten a chance to talk to Destiny now.
*  What do you like about the guy?
*  A lot of the same sorts of things,
*  but it's really fun to see how you do your process.
*  That is a cool thing.
*  That is a cool thing and it's a gift to the audience
*  because honestly, doing what we do,
*  so much of what we do is sitting and reading
*  and being behind closed doors and educating yourself
*  and talking with people,
*  but getting to watch you do it in real time
*  is a really cool window into how people think
*  and how people learn.
*  It's a really neat thing.
*  Well, gentlemen, this was incredible.
*  It's an honor.
*  Thank you for doing this today.
*  Hey, thanks a lot.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  Thanks for listening to this debate
*  between Ben Shapiro and Destiny.

*  And now, let me leave you with some words from Aristotle.
*  The basis of a democratic state is liberty.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
*  Thank you.
