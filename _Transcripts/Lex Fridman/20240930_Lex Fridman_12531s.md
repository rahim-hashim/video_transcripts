# Ed Barnhart Maya, Aztec, Inca, and Lost Civilizations of South America  Lex Fridman Podcast #446
**Lex Fridman:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzzE7GOvYz8)
*  For the vast majority of human existence, we've been nomadic and we've done these kind of
*  wider or tighter nomadic circles depending on the geographic region, but they'd move.
*  So once humans figured out how to stay in a place, that's the initial trigger to what would become
*  civilization. I think you said beauty and blood went hand in hand for the Aztec. What I meant by
*  that is they were absolutely comfortable with human sacrifice and ripping people's hearts out.
*  They had this just grotesque violent bent, but in the same way, they also absolutely loved flower
*  gardens and poetry and music and dance. The same Aztec king who would order the hearts of a thousand
*  people extracted also would stand up at dinner parties to recite his own poetry, but they were
*  really just surgical about it. They'd use a thick obsidian knife where they could just break the
*  ribs right along the sternum and then push the sternum down, pull up and just-
*  While the person was alive?
*  Yep, while the person was alive.
*  The following is a conversation with Ed Barnhart, an archaeologist specializing
*  in ancient civilizations of South America, Mesoamerica, and North America. This is the
*  Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Ed Barnhart.
*  Do you think there are lost civilizations in the history of humans on Earth?
*  Which we don't know anything about.
*  Yes, I do. And in fact, we have found some civilizations that we had no idea about
*  just in my lifetime. We've got Gobekli Tepe, and we've got the stuff that's going on in the Amazon,
*  and there are some other less startling things that we had no idea existed and push our dates
*  back and give us whole new civilizations we had no idea about. So, yeah, it's happened and
*  I think it'll happen again.
*  Do you think there's a lost civilization in the Amazon that the Amazon jungle has eaten up
*  or is hiding the evidence of?
*  Yes, I do. And we're beginning to find it. There are these huge, what we call,
*  geoglyphs, these mound groups that are in geometric patterns. I think that the average Joe,
*  when they hear the word civilization, they think of something that looks like Rome.
*  And I don't think we're ever going to find anything that looks like Rome in the Amazon.
*  I think a lot of things there, I mean, wherever you are on the planet, you use your natural
*  resources. And in the Amazon, there's not a whole lot of stone. What stone is there is deep, deep,
*  so a lot of their things were built out of dirt and trees and feathers and textiles.
*  But is it possible that all that land that's not covered by trees is actually hiding
*  stone, for example, some architecture, some things that are just very difficult to find for
*  archaeologists?
*  I think at the base of the Andes, where the Amazon connects to the Andes, there's a lot
*  of potential there, because that's where the stone actually starts poking up. When you get down into
*  the basin, stone is meters and meters under the ground, except for a stray cliff here and there
*  where the river dug deep, and even then only in the dry season, because that river rises like
*  over 100 feet every year.
*  That's one of the things, having visited that area, just interacting with waterfalls and seeing
*  the water, I was humbled by the power of water to shape landscapes and probably erase history
*  in the context that we're talking about of civilizations. Water can just make everything
*  disappear over a period of centuries and millennia. And so if something existed a very long time ago,
*  thousands of years ago, it's very possible it was just eaten up by nature.
*  Absolutely. In fact, in my opinion, that's almost a certainty in a lot of places.
*  The Grand Canyon was dug by water. There's this wimpy little river in it right now, and you can't
*  possibly imagine that it dug that, but it did. The power of nature and geology is really kind of
*  magical. And when it comes to ancient civilizations that could be from a long time ago, there's
*  probably a lot that are just under the ocean, and just the wave action have destroyed them,
*  and what they haven't destroyed, buried deep.
*  Under the ocean? So you think Atlantis ever existed?
*  I don't think that Atlantis existed. I do think it was one of Plato's many parables talking about
*  putting it in an interesting story as a teaching device in his school. If
*  one did exist or a shadow of it, my money would be on Akrotiri. Akrotiri is what's left of a big
*  city that was on the island of Santorini. And when their volcano blew up, it blew up most of the city
*  and shot chunks of it so fast that 70 miles away in Crete, there are chunks of Santorini in their
*  cliff. So it blasted what was ever there, but what's left on the side of the crater,
*  Akrotiri is strangely advanced for its age. And so if there's anything that's a model for
*  Atlantis, as Plato explained it, it's Akrotiri. So Akrotiri, the ancient Greek city. So it says
*  the settlement was destroyed in the Theran eruption sometime in the 16th century BCE
*  and buried in volcanic ash, which preserved the remains of the frescoes and many objects and
*  artworks. So we don't know how advanced that civilization was. No, but we can walk around
*  the ruins and see that it's got streets, it's got plumbing, it's got little sconces for
*  torches at night. It was a vibrant city with a lot of, especially in terms of hydraulic engineering,
*  it's very advanced for being 3,500 years old. So if you check out here's an image of the
*  excavation, what a project. It's an amazing place. And you can tell that it's just part of it because
*  it's pretty close to where the crater began. So the city itself was probably much larger.
*  So in this case, there's a lot of evidence, but like we said, there could be civilizations that
*  there's very little evidence of because of the natural environment that destroys all the evidence.
*  Pete Slauson Right. And I think Akrotiri is actually a great example of that because here we have
*  the side that did preserve that looks amazing. But we know there was more of the city that was
*  completely obliterated. It was shot, chunks of that city are probably in the walls of Crete,
*  70 miles away. And you know, Plato says that it sunk, it was on an island and it sunk.
*  Well, that's exactly what happened to Akrotiri.
*  J.F. WOGAN I think this is what Plato was referring to.
*  Pete Slauson If it does exist, at least the model of it,
*  I think this is probably what he was talking about.
*  J.F. WOGAN And there could be other civilizations of which Plato has never written,
*  right? That we have no record of. And it's humbling to think that entire civilizations,
*  with all the dreams, the hope, the technological innovation, the wars, the conflicts, the political
*  tensions, all of that, the social interactions, the hierarchies, all of that. The art can be just
*  a story like that and forgotten completely, lost to ancient history.
*  Pete Slauson I reflect upon that often as an archaeologist. I think about this great country
*  that I live in and love and all the things we've achieved. But you know, we're a baby historically
*  speaking. We've been around 200 years. Heck, a lot of the cities I study in Central and South
*  America, they had a run of 800, 1000 years and now they're ruins. But we're barely getting started
*  in terms of historical civilizations. J.F. WOGAN So humans, homo sapiens evolved.
*  But they didn't start civilizations right away. There's a long period of time when they did not
*  form these complex societies. So how did we, let's say 300,000 years ago in Africa,
*  actually go from there to creating civilizations?
*  Pete Slauson I think that a lot of human evolution had to do with the pressures that
*  their environment put upon them. And a lot of things start changing right around 12,000 years
*  ago. And that's when our last ice age really ended. I think there was a whole lot of things
*  that just pressured them into especially finding new ways of subsistence. Here in the Americas,
*  a huge thing that happened was all the megafauna went away. When the climate changed enough,
*  the mammoths died out and the bison died out. And there was just, they had to come up with different
*  ways of doing things. We were hunters and gatherers and we had things we got from hunting
*  and we got things we got from gathering. And in the Americas, when the things that they were used
*  to hunting went away and they had to make do with rabbits, the gathering started to be a much more
*  important thing. And I think that led to figuring out, hey, we could actually grow certain things.
*  And gardens turned into crops, turned into intensive crops, and then people were allowed
*  to gather in bigger groups and survive in a single area. They didn't have to roam around anymore.
*  And that's where we get the first sedentary communities, which means they stayed in the
*  same place all year long. For the vast majority of human existence, we've been nomadic and we've done
*  these kind of wider or tighter nomadic circles, depending on the geographic region where they'd
*  know, okay, in the mountains, we'll be in the summer in the mountains because there's berries
*  and things. And then in the winter, we'll be down here and we'll hunt, but they'd move. So once humans
*  figured out how to stay in a place, I think that's the initial trigger to what would become
*  civilization. What do you think is, there's a lot of questions I want to ask here.
*  What do you think is the motivation for societies? Is it the carrot or the stick?
*  So you said like, is it like when resources run out, when the old way of life is no longer feeding
*  everybody, then you have to figure stuff out? Or is it more the carrot of like, there's always this
*  kind of human spirit that wants to explore, that wants to maybe impress the rest of the village or
*  something like this with the new discovery they made in venturing out and coming out with different
*  ideas or technological innovation, let's call it. Well, I have an explorer's heart, so I'm kind of,
*  I'm biased. I do think that we have an innate desire to see what's on the horizon
*  and to impress other people with our achievements, things like that. We're social beings.
*  That's really the edge that humans have is our ability to work together. So I think that
*  it's much more the carrot than the stick. When things get ugly, the stick comes out,
*  but usually the carrot does the job. The really interesting story is how the first people came to
*  the Americas. I mean, to me, that's pretty gangster to go from Asia all the way, potentially during
*  the ice age or maybe at the end of the ice age or during that whole period, not knowing what the
*  world looks like, going into the unknown. Can you talk through that process? How did the first people
*  come to the Americas? Well, first off, I agree with you. That was pretty gangster. I mean,
*  that's a hard place to live. I listened to some of your podcasts, that guy,
*  Jordan Jonas, cut the mustard, but I wouldn't have made it crossing there.
*  Well, there you go. The fact that those guys exist, that somebody like Jordan Jonas exists,
*  people that survive and thrive in these harsh conditions, that's an indication that it's
*  possible. But yeah, so when do you think and how did the first people come?
*  The traditional theories are still somewhat valid, or at least on the table, that when that land
*  bridge occurred, that nomadic hunters just followed the game like they always had and the
*  game went across there because there was no barrier and they followed them across.
*  The thing that has changed is how early that happened. DNA has been a total game changer
*  for archaeology. We get all these evolutionary tracks that we could never see before. When I
*  was a young archaeologist, I would have never dreamed we'd have the information we have now.
*  And that information, a lot of it's coming out of Texas A&M. We see the traditional, like,
*  12,500 years ago that there was a migration. But now we're seeing one that's almost certainly
*  happening closer to 30,000 years ago. And now the thing that seems like madness, but might be true,
*  is that it could have been as early as 60. A lot of the DNA things are suggesting that the very
*  first migration could have come across as early as 60. And when I was a younger archaeologist,
*  it was heresy to go beyond this 12,500. You were a wacko if you said that. But now it's really
*  very clear that they came over at least by 30,000. And the bridge opened and closed and opened and
*  closed. That's during the Ice Age. Right.
*  Right.
*  I mean, that's crazy, right? That is crazy.
*  Yeah. I mean, they didn't roll in and immediately make New York, but there were people. And there
*  were definitely not people here before that, which is fascinating. When the bridge closed,
*  DNA mutated. And so we have specific kinds of haplogroups that are here in the Americas that
*  don't exist otherwise. And that same haplogroup game has been showing us more and more that people
*  came across Siberia. It's not Africa. It's not Western Europe. Those are still, you know,
*  they've become kind of fringe theories, but they're not totally eradicated. I have...
*  DNA is developing science as well. And I think we all need to keep that in mind, that it's not like
*  they just cracked the code and now we know all the answers. And sometimes, like in any science,
*  a breakthrough puts us two steps backwards, not forwards. So I think, you know, we don't need to
*  have too much faith in the models that are now being created through DNA, but they are pointing
*  in the direction of everybody came across from Siberia, that all Native American people are of
*  Asiatic descent.
*  Do you think it was a gradual process? If it's like 30 to 60,000 years ago, was it
*  just gradual movement of these nomadic tribes as they follow the animals? Or was it like
*  one explorer that pushed the tribe to just go, go, go, go and go across maybe across 100 years,
*  travel all the way across maybe into North America, into North America, where Canada is now,
*  and then sort of like big leaps in movement versus gradual movement?
*  I think it was big leaps. Now, this is just, you know, mostly guess, I'll admit. But I think that
*  much in the way that a lot of our evolutionary models talk about punctuated equilibrium,
*  that there are big moments of change, and then it settles out into a more slow and steady pattern,
*  and then something big will happen again. I do think that the early people went as far as they
*  could go. And there were certain colonies that just got isolated for thousands of years.
*  One of the fascinating things that DNA is showing us, which actually blood types were showing us way
*  before that, is that the oldest people in the Americas are in South America. The ones that got
*  separated early and didn't mix their DNA like the people in the Amazon, most of those guys have
*  O blood type and their haplogroup D, which is the oldest one that entered the US.
*  And what are they doing down there? If I do believe they came across the Bering Strait,
*  we have no real evidence to say they came in mass across Oceania. So they made it probably by boat
*  along the coast all the way to South America. So there's some kind of cultural engine that drove
*  them to explore. So if you had to bet all your money, it happened like
*  tens of thousands of years ago, but at a very rapid pace, there's these explorers that went
*  all the way to South America, and there established their kind of more stable existence. And from there,
*  South America, Mesoamerica, North America was kind of gradually expanded into that area.
*  I think the next waves came down and did North America and Central America. And the very first
*  wave made it all the way down to South America and got isolated, and then mixed in with the
*  next groups that came. That's fascinating. There's an interesting correlate in Europe where today,
*  everybody feels like Celtic people are from Ireland. But actually, Celtic people started
*  in Eastern Europe, and it was the entire area. And when Rome kind of swept everything, and Rome
*  was now the ruler of the day, it was only that far edge of the Celtic world, Ireland, that they were
*  like, ah, we're not going to mess with those guys on that island. We'll leave them be. So now it
*  looks like that's the heart of Celtic tradition, but actually, it's the fringe. So if it is 60,000
*  years ago, these are really early humans. Yeah. And there were consistent things that have been
*  coming out for decades about very old carbon-14 dates in the Amazon and in the Andes area that
*  everybody just dismissed. It's now, you didn't get a date of 40,000 years. But I think we're
*  going to come back around to start readdressing some of these based on new evidence at hand.
*  And that's the interesting thing is the early humans spread throughout the world. And then,
*  like you said, perhaps they've gotten isolated, and then civilizations sprung from there.
*  And they all have similar elements, even though they were isolated. That's really interesting.
*  That's really interesting that there's multiple cradles of civilization, not just one. Like one
*  good idea. Those ideas naturally come up. Those structures naturally come up.
*  And I wonder whether the similarities that all those cradles have, it could be
*  a shared much deeper past that they all have. Or it could be a more kind of Star Trek thing,
*  where Captain Kirk was always talking about the theory of parallel human development,
*  that humans across the universe go through certain stages of development,
*  and that that could be the answer to it. Which one do you lean on? Which one do you lean towards?
*  I think it's a case by case thing. I think if we look globally, I'd lean much more towards the
*  human parallel development. But if I look just to the Americas, and we have a shorter time period
*  where the things that become major civilizations now, now I'll say up to 30,000 years ago,
*  which is still a blip in the time of humans. I think that there were shared things that those
*  people came over with from Asia. And that as they got separated, that they had core values
*  that then turned into things like religion and cultural customs that we can see. I'm a big
*  proponent that there are commonalities in all the cultures of the Americas that lead back to and
*  point to a single distant origin. You've spoken about the lost cradle civilization in South America.
*  So South America is not often talked about as one of the cradles of civilization. South America,
*  Mesoamerica, can you explain? Well, we have very early stuff in South America. You're right. I mean,
*  especially as an American, our country is so big and we are so far removed from these places.
*  We don't even think about it. But more and more, we're seeing things that predate the earliest
*  stuff that we like to talk about like Egypt and Mesopotamia. It's all on the Peruvian coast
*  that we have these cradles of civilization. Someday we might start talking about the
*  Amazon more and more. But right now, what we've got are things that date back into the 3000s BCE
*  along the coast of Peru. And there are big stone-built pyramids and temples.
*  And they're amazingly isolated, even now that we've found them. Some of them, like Kerala is one of
*  the most famous ones just north of Lima. We've known about it for a couple decades now, how old
*  it is. But every time I visit there, it's like I visited the moon. There's absolutely nobody there.
*  Not for miles. It's amazing how such a discovery was made and yet still nobody goes to see it.
*  It's not easy to get to. So you think there's a bunch of locations like that? Some may not have
*  been discovered in the Peru area. Oh, there are so many. Peru has tons. That desert gets really ugly
*  quick and it buries things completely. There are so many pyramids out there that are still completely
*  untouched. When people hear the name pyramids, they think of Egypt immediately. But Egypt has
*  got about 140 pyramids and we have pretty much found them all. Peru has thousands, thousands of
*  pyramids. And now they weren't built of a lot. Not all of them were built of stone. Some of them
*  were adobe bricks, which have weathered terribly. So now they're not exciting places to visit today.
*  Do you know what's funny too? We started off talking about whether I think there's a lost
*  civilization out there. There are definitely things that are still to be discovered, but there are
*  some things that were discovered 100 years ago and archaeologists or back then they called
*  themselves antiquarians just kind of passed over. Corral was one of these sites because the coast of
*  Peru has some of those pyramids that were made by the Moche are full of gold and beautiful ceramics
*  and things that you can sell for big money. But Corral was found a long time ago, but the
*  archaeologists was like, God, no gold, no ceramics. Forget about it. This place is no good. We can't
*  sell anything here. And then about the 1970s or 80s, somebody said, Hey, no ceramics? Is that
*  older than the invention of ceramics? Shit, we better go take another look at that place.
*  So what's the dating on Corral? Corral, I think starts at about 3200 BCE and it lasts as a major
*  civilization with a lot of other cities around it until about 1800 BCE.
*  So what's the story behind looking at some of these images? What's the story about constructions
*  like that? What was the idea? That thing. Isn't that amazing? Yeah. Oh, that, gosh, I mean,
*  it should be some sort of, I'll be a flaky archaeologist like, this is a place where
*  rituals took place. So many things we say are so just painfully vague and that's about what we
*  got. And a place like this, I know the one we're looking at here, I've been here a couple of times,
*  in the pyramid behind it, the rubble's built in a way where the building won't rock apart. This is a
*  very earthquake prone place, but the buildings haven't fallen because they make these net baskets
*  of rocks inside that all kind of wiggle around and don't allow the building to fall down.
*  And inside these, we've also found a couple of things that were
*  babies, that were human babies that were buried in there. And I don't think there's a lot of people
*  that see that and go, oh, look at that, they were sacrificing babies, these monsters.
*  I think a lot of the things that are interpreted as baby sacrifices, Corral's evidence being one of
*  them, I think it's more about the tragic nature of infant mortality. In the past, it was a lot more
*  common. There were cultures that didn't even really properly name their kid until they got to five,
*  because chances were they were going to die. And so I think a lot of these babies that we find in
*  these ceremonial contexts that are interpreted as sacrifices, I think they're putting them in
*  special places because they mourn the death of their kids. And it just happened a lot more
*  frequently then. One of the things you said that really surprised me is that pyramids were built
*  in Peru, possibly hundreds of years before they were built in Egypt. Is that true?
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. In fact, there's one that's now pushing 6,000 BCE.
*  Like, that's thousands of years before the stuff in Egypt. And that one's called Waka Prieta.
*  And it was not an Egyptian pyramid. But it was a pyramid, and it was thousands of years before.
*  What do you think is the motivation to build a pyramid? The fact that it can withstand the
*  elements structurally, that kind of thing? Why do humans build pyramids? And why do they build it
*  in all kinds of different locations in the world?
*  Well, my rude answer is pretty boring, really. A lot of people ask me, why are there pyramids
*  all over the planet? Is that a coincidence? I think that when people wanted to build a big building
*  without rebar or cement, you end up building something with a fat base that goes up to a
*  skinny top, and that turns into a pyramid. Any kid who's playing with blocks on the floor builds
*  a couple towers, and his brother knocks them down. And if he wants one that's going to stay and be
*  tall, he ends up making something with a fat base and a tiny top. And I think that building
*  something big and tall together is one of those human things. We built that. That will be here
*  after we're gone. People will remember who we were. If there's any human commonality, it's
*  fear of our own deaths and that we were nothing and no one will ever remember us. I think that
*  the first big monuments like that were probably a group of people saying,
*  we're going to do something that people will remember forever.
*  Now, that being said, remember we were just talking about Huaca Prieta and this one that's
*  almost 6,000 BC now is the first one? That one's a funny case. We just talked about all these lofty
*  goals, but actually I'm pretty sure that Huaca Prieta's first pyramid was about capping a smelly
*  pile of trash. I think everybody piled up their trash in the middle of town and it stunk. It's
*  on the coast. It stunk like fish. And somebody said, if we just bury this thing with dirt,
*  it won't smell anymore. And then it was a big mound where people could get up and talk to
*  everybody and then said, well, it's squishy. If we cap it with clay, then it will really not smell.
*  I really think that the very first pyramids in Peru were about trash management.
*  Talk about deflating, huh? Yeah. But then they probably saw it and they were impressed and
*  humbled by the enormity of the construction. And then they're like, oh, we should, maybe the
*  next guy thought maybe we should keep building these kinds of things. Yeah. Not to jump ahead,
*  but in North America, where they also made pyramids, there's this interesting evolution
*  where there were these piles of shells along rivers and along the coastlines. People
*  ate a lot of shells. That was an easy thing to collect and eat. So these piles of shells
*  would be near communities and they probably became landmarks. But eventually they started
*  burying their dead inside those too. Probably again, about stink and about, well, we don't want
*  the dogs to eat them. Maybe we'll put them in the middle of the shell pile. But then that all of a
*  sudden became this like, that's where my grandfather's body is. That's where great
*  grandfather's body is. And all of a sudden people started being attached to place,
*  not just for the resources, but for the shared memories of their ancestors. So when the very
*  first pyramid was built in Ohio area by the Adena people, it was built out of dirt, but it's full of
*  bodies. And I think it's an echo of a old thing where they used to be putting bodies in shell
*  mounds. So where and who were the first civilizations in South America, Mesoamerica? Well,
*  I think we're still piecing that together. Coming back to the first things we talked about, I think
*  we're still missing a lot of stuff, especially in South America. It just keeps getting older and
*  older. Part of the reason it's hard to answer that question is, at what point do we consider
*  people a civilization or a culture? We have in the Americas this long period of time that we call
*  the Paleo-Indian time, where they were hunting megafauna. And then when those went away,
*  we get into this even longer period of time called the archaic, where they're just hunters
*  and gatherers. Sometimes somebody's coming up with a cool different kind of arrowhead.
*  They go back and forth with different hunting tools, but really nothing changes for thousands
*  of years. And then finally, they start developing into these larger groups, which for the most part
*  has to do with agriculture. It used to be archaeology. That was just the end all be
*  all. Civilization starts with the invention of agriculture. And we can't have sedentary
*  communities until people learn how to farm. But that's been discounted. Peru was a big part of
*  that. That area of Corral, it's connected to another city on the coast called Aspero. And Aspero
*  starts about the same time, but they're all about fishing. They have no farming. And Corral,
*  who's upriver from them, is farming. But funny enough, they're not really farming food.
*  They're farming cotton, and they're making nets, and they're trading the nets with the
*  people on the coast for the fish. So it's not as simple as it's just agriculture anymore.
*  But it is, I think, still rooted in how can we feed more people than just our family? How can
*  we together create a food abundance so we're no longer scared about running out of food?
*  So is it possible, which is something you've argued, that civilization started in the Amazon,
*  in the jungle versus the coast?
*  I do think so. I think religion in South America began in the Amazon. I think there were people
*  there very old. There's actually the earliest pottery in all of the Americas, all these places
*  that we have civilizations that grew up. You know where the oldest pottery is? The middle of the
*  Amazon.
*  So there's interesting cultures developing in the Amazon. So religion, you would say, preceded
*  civilization.
*  In South America, the Corral and Aspero that I was just talking about, it's weird what a
*  dearth of art and any evidence of religion we have. We have those pyramids and things that
*  we call temples, but we don't really know what went on in there. And there's no hints of religious
*  iconography, ceremonies, nothing like that. The first stuff that we get is right when that culture
*  ends, about 1800 BCE, this culture called Chavín starts up. And their main temple is up in the
*  Andes in this place of least, path of least resistance between the Amazon and the coast.
*  It's about three days walk either way from this place where this temple is.
*  That's where we start seeing the very first religious iconography and it's all over the
*  temples. There are things that are definitely from the coast, but the iconography are all
*  jaguars and snakes and crocodiles. And those don't come from the coast.
*  All of those things are coming out of the Amazon.
*  I mean, religion is a really powerful idea. Religions are one of the most powerful ideas.
*  They're the strongest myths that tie people together. And to you, it's possible that this
*  powerful idea in South America started in the Amazon.
*  I do. I do think it did. And you're right. Ideas are more powerful than weapons,
*  but archaeology can't see them at all. Sometimes we can see ideas manifesting in the things they
*  create and lead to, but there's an interpretation problem. Are we right about what idea created
*  this? Those are things that archaeology just can't get at.
*  That's one of the challenges of archaeology and looking into ancient histories. You're trying to
*  not just understand what they were doing in terms of architecture, but understand what was going on
*  inside their mind. That's really what I'm in it for, trying to understand these people. And
*  it's real detective work. And we know we're dealing with a totally flawed record. We only have what
*  could preserve the test of time. If we look around this room here, if 2,000 years of weathering
*  happened in this room, what would be left? And what would we think happened here?
*  Right. But there's not in this room, but if you look at thousands of rooms like it,
*  maybe you can start to piece things together about the different ideologies that ruled the world,
*  the religions, the different ideas. Tell me about this Fang deity. One of your more controversial
*  ideas is that you believe that the religions, there's a thread that connects the different
*  civilizations, the societies of the Andean region. And the religion that practiced is more
*  monotheistic than is currently believed in the mainstream.
*  That is exactly what I think. And I think it's all about this Fang deity who somewhere,
*  thousands of years ago, crawled his way out of the Amazon up into the Andes and a religion took hold.
*  That could have been kind of a combination of ideas from the coast and the Amazon, but
*  he is the one creator deity, in my opinion, through all of these cultures. And the people
*  in the Amazon still talk about him there. His name is Vihomase in some groups, but they say that his
*  emissaries on earth are the Jaguars and that he is the creator deity.
*  Why is the current mainstream belief is that a lot of the religions are not monotheistic?
*  Well, there are bona fide pantheons. Greece had one, Egypt had one, Mesopotamia had one,
*  lots of the early religions of the old world were pantheons. And I think that was part of the
*  problem. The earliest archaeologists walked in there with a preconceived notion that ancient
*  cultures have pantheons. And so they went to the art looking for them. And they came up with things
*  like the shark god and the moon goddess and the sun god and all these things. But when I look at
*  the art, and I was trained by a person right here in Austin, Texas as an art historian,
*  you follow certain diagnostic traits through art to see the development over time. And when I look
*  at it and use that methodology, there's a single face with goggle eyes and fangs and claws on his
*  hands and feet and snakes coming off of his head and off of his belt. He's got really identifiable
*  traits. He also likes to sever people's heads off and carry them around. But he's the fanged
*  deity and he's there. He shows up in Chavín de Juantar, the capital of that Chavín culture.
*  And he keeps showing up through every culture, even thousands of miles away throughout the next
*  two millennium, right up to the Inca. The Inca have a creator deity, they call Viracocha. But
*  Viracocha is the fanged deity. When we do see him, by the time you get to Inca, they do this
*  kind of almost Islamic thing where they say, you can't understand the face of Viracocha. So,
*  when they do put him in a cosmogram, they'll make him just a blob. Like he's just unknowable,
*  but he's at the very top. I think we're misunderstanding a lot of things that we used to
*  say were deities as just supernatural beings. If we flip the mirror on Christianity and take
*  a look at it, which of course Christianity is monotheistic, right? It would be heresy to say
*  otherwise. But who are all these other characters? Who are all these angels and demons and, you know,
*  Jesus Christ? And I mean, I don't even know who the Holy Spirit is, but he's some sort of
*  supernatural being. But it's that monotheistic system has lots of things that have supernatural
*  powers that are not God. That's where I think the crux of us misunderstanding ancient Andean art is.
*  R. So, what is the process of analyzing art through time to try to figure out
*  what the important entities are for that culture? Do you just see what shows up over and over and
*  over and over? B. Well, certainly without the advent of writing,
*  depictions in art have all sorts of meanings encoded in them. And there are certain, you know,
*  what we call diagnostic elements. Like we can pull apart the same sort of thing in,
*  like in the Greek pantheon, you know, you know, by their dress and what they're holding,
*  what the different gods are. You can tell Hades from Zeus by the different things they're holding,
*  you know, lightning bolts or tridents or whatever it is. So, they all have these diagnostic
*  elements to them. So, that's how art history goes about analyzing art over time. Once we can put it
*  in a chronological sequence, then we can say, okay, here's a deity here in Chavín culture.
*  Now we move forward 500 years. Now we're in Moche and Nazca culture. You know, who are the
*  deities here? And what I see is that same guy with not just one or two traits, but a whole
*  package of them that shows up again and again and again for thousands of years in each one of these
*  cultures. He's got circular eyes. He's got a fanged mouth. He's got claws on his hands and feet.
*  He's a humanoid, but he also has snakes coming off of his head like hair and snakes coming off
*  of his belt. And then not so much in Chavín, but as it goes forward, he starts carting around
*  severed heads, human severed heads. So, in the old literature, the Moche will call him the decapitator
*  deity. But then they have these other like, oh, here's the crab deity and here's the fox deity.
*  But if you look at them, the crab deity is just that guy's face coming off of a crab and the fox
*  deity is that guy's face coming off of a fox. So, I think on that particular instance, I explain it
*  similar to what Zeus did. You know how Zeus was able to like, you know, turn into whatever animal
*  he wanted to get with the woman he wanted, and he showed up in all sorts of forms, but he was always
*  Zeus. I think that the fanged deity manifests himself through people and animals throughout the
*  art and that there are missing stories of mythology that we don't have anymore.
*  RG And across hundreds of years, thousands of years, from Chavín to Moche to Inca,
*  as you're saying.
*  JS Right. Wari has them too, Tiahuanaco, that's that famous place, Pumapunku, he's all over there.
*  RG I wonder how those ideas spread and morph of this fanged deity.
*  I think people walked and proselytized and places like Chavín, there's a later one in Inca times
*  called Pachacamac that are pilgrimage places where people come in to be healed if they're sick,
*  but also just to pay homage to the powers that be. So, Chavín was a place where people from the
*  Amazon and people from the coast were all coming together. In fact, we saw it in the archaeology
*  there. There's these interesting labyrinths under the pyramids with the fanged deity all over them
*  that have like one labyrinth they'll have all pottery. The next labyrinth will have a bunch
*  of animal bones. The next one will have a bunch of things made out of stone. So, people are showing
*  up and giving this tribute and they're learning and then they're going back to their communities.
*  So, I think it dispersed from certain pilgrimage spots and became just like pilgrimage spots do,
*  somebody goes back and they build a temple to the fanged deity.
*  Jared Sussman Do we know much about the relationship they had with the fanged deity
*  and like their conception of the powers of the fanged deity? Were they afraid of the fanged
*  deities and all-knowing God? Is it something that brings joy and harvest or is it something that
*  you're supposed to be afraid of and sacrifice animals and humans too to keep at bay?
*  Pete Slauson I think he had two sides of the coin. Like a lot of the Hindu gods are, you know,
*  one aspect is terrible, the other aspect is lovely. I think he had that same sorts of qualities
*  because we do see him as a fierce warrior taking people's heads off and he is a jaguar,
*  which in and of itself implies a certain power and ferocity. But then there are other funny
*  things about him. Like he is definitely involved in a lot of healing ceremonies and a lot of those
*  healing ceremonies are involved with sex acts when it comes to the moche. There's this whole group of
*  sexual pottery where priests are having sex with women or men and some of them show their faces
*  transforming into that fanged deity. Like he is acting through them. But the thing that
*  most cracks me up that shows his softer side is the fanged deity has a little puppy. He has a puppy
*  that's like just dancing around his feet and like jumping up on him in various scenes. They see him
*  again and again. Sometimes he's in these healing sex scenes. In fact, I tracked that puppy from
*  other contexts to these sex scenes where a priest was having sex with somebody in a house
*  and there's a fanged deity and there's a puppy just scratching at the door like, hey,
*  you forgot me. And then finally, one day I found one with the puppy having sex with the woman
*  instead of the fanged deity. I was like, oh, he really is very involved in this. What is this
*  weird puppy? So yeah, he likes to take heads off, but he also has a puppy he adores.
*  This actually, this is awesomely makes sense now because I saw the opening of a paper you wrote
*  30 years ago on shamanism and the Mocha civilization. It reads,
*  the Mocha of the major focus of this paper, sex, puppies and headhunting will be shown to be related
*  to ancient Mocha shamanism. So now I understand. I was like, well, the puppies.
*  Puppies, yeah, it's true.
*  And the headhunting, that's the decapitator.
*  And I've added rock and roll to that list since actually. Rock and roll,
*  music is also a big part of it. They call spirits down. There's this whole spirit world.
*  There's the ancestors and the people that drink San Pedro cactus juice kind of,
*  they don't talk about the fanged deity anymore. I think Christianity in 500 years has somewhat put
*  him in the back. It was unpopular to have a pagan deity. So they don't talk about him much anymore
*  that we still around. They're in like around Trujillo. They call him Iopec. But music playing
*  in the Amazon, they play flute, sometimes a chorus of women sing. And that's supposed to bring the
*  spirits down into the ceremony. There's a spirit that's hurting the person that's sick. And then
*  the priest or the shaman or the corundero, whatever you want to call them, has his own posse of
*  spirits that are going to help him figure out what's going on. So when the music starts,
*  that's bringing those spirits in. And people don't see them unless they've imbibed the
*  San Pedro cactus juice, which is the Solucinogen, which is in the Amazon side, it was Ayahuasca.
*  On the coast, it was San Pedro cactus. But that's what allows you to actually see that other world.
*  Yeah, I went to the Amazon recently and did Ayahuasca, a very high dose of it.
*  Bold move.
*  When in Rome, how far back does that go?
*  Oh, I think longer than anybody can remember. But I mean, it's a natural plant that's been there
*  forever. I think that it's thousands and thousands of years. That's another thing,
*  Chavín de Juantar I was talking about, where I think the things came, the religion came from the
*  Amazon. There's this wall on the backside that faces the Amazon side. So if you're entering
*  the city from the Amazon path, you see this wall first. And it's a bunch of faces that some of
*  them are human, some of them are total jaguar, and some of them are transforming in between.
*  But there's a group of them that are midway through transformation,
*  and they show their nostrils leaking out this snot that's coming down their face.
*  San Pedro doesn't do that to you, but Ayahuasca does.
*  Ayahuasca, traditionally, they'd take a blowgun and just shoot it up your nose, or up your ass.
*  But a lot of times, up your nose. And when it shoots up your nose, the first thing that happens
*  is just this gush of snot comes out of you. And there are stone depictions of people
*  uncontrollably snotting on the backside of this temple from 3,000 years ago.
*  Jared Ranere So that, you think, could have been a big component of the development of religion
*  and shamanism. San Pedro I think that hallucinogens opened the mind then like they opened the mind now.
*  Do you think that, you know, the stone ape theory, do you think that actually could have been an
*  actual catalyst for the formation of civilization?
*  Jared Ranere In the Americas, yes, I do. Though, you know,
*  hallucinogens are not part of every ancient tradition in the world. In fact, strangely,
*  the majority of plants that are actually psychotropic, not just mood-altering,
*  are from here in the Americas. There are very few drugs that will make you hallucinate
*  outside of the Americas. Of course, now they're global, and, you know, they can be grown all over
*  the place. But originally speaking, very, very few were outside of the Americas. So, they were
*  part of the experience here in a way that they just couldn't be in other places.
*  I wonder to what degree they were just part of a ritual and the creative force behind sort of art
*  versus like literally the method by which you come up with ideas that define a civilization.
*  It's like the degree to which they had a role in the formation of civilizations. It's kind of fun
*  to think about psychedelics being like a critical role in the formation of civilizations.
*  I think in terms of South America, they probably really were. In North America,
*  where we're in a more northern climb here and there are less of them, not so much,
*  at least in terms of psychedelics, things like tobacco was always a big part of it.
*  But a lot of the, you know, there's more than one way to reach a hallucinatory state.
*  The hard way is starvation, sleep deprivation. And for the Maya, for example, would go
*  sleep deprivation, starvation, and then they'd cut themselves very badly. And that loss of blood,
*  we believe, triggered hallucinations and visions. Nothing to do with drugs. I much prefer the drugs
*  route. It's the result, not the, the tools aren't the thing that creates insight. It's the result.
*  Hallucinogens are poisoning us. They're killing us. It's a near death state and people of the
*  Americas believed sleeping was entering that other world, death, you entered this other world,
*  and that when you took this mighty dose of poison, it was helping you enter that other
*  world for a period of time. Yeah. As Tom Wade said in that one song,
*  I like my town with a little drop of poison. So maybe that poison is a good catalyst for invention.
*  So who were the early first sort of mother cultures, mother civilizations in South America?
*  What is, if we look chronologically, is there a label we can put on the first peoples that emerged?
*  That picture is evolving. I mean, forever, it was just the Chavine people that we've been talking
*  about. The ones with all the first depictions of religious art were the mother culture. And they
*  certainly did transmit a lot of stuff, but then all of a sudden we find a coral. The next one
*  that we've barely even begun looking at, but it's probably older than
*  coral, is Sachin culture. I was just poking around there last year and just from the bus
*  on the highway, I could see like, that's a pyramid out there. Oh, there's another one.
*  And I know how old the stuff we have studied there is. It's again, 3000 BC. We're just barely
*  beginning to understand them. Corral frustrates me to no end, the lack of art there. We've got
*  stones and bones and not even ceramics to go on. And they didn't have the courtesy to leave me a
*  bunch of art I can interpret. So I don't know what those people believed.
*  Right. So one of the ways to understand what people believe is looking at the art,
*  the stories told through the art, and then hopefully deciphering if they were doing any
*  kind of writing. That's our most fruitful place to try to get at this elusive ideas.
*  Yeah. And it sucks when they don't have art. If we just go back to the Amazon,
*  you've mentioned that it's possible that there's a lost civilization that exists in the Amazon.
*  So it's carried a lot of names, lost city of Z or El Dorado. Do you think it's possible it existed?
*  Well, city of Z and El Dorado are in pretty different places. El Dorado, the ideas of where
*  it is kind of center around towards Columbia. And the city of Z is named after a region of
*  Brazil called the Xingu. And so those are an America worth of distance apart. People don't
*  really think about it on the map, but the entire United States would fit inside the Amazon. That's
*  how big that place is. And these two are on either end, but both of them have evidence of
*  civilizations. It's lowland and it floods all the time. So what they did is they'd make these big
*  mounds and then they'd make huge causeways between mounds so they could walk through their cities
*  while they were seasonally inundated. And a bunch of that stuff has been found in the Xingu area,
*  like huge areas that would support tens of thousands of people. Again, it's not stone built
*  and it's been under the forest forever. So it's very torn up, but it's there. Now, Brazil is big
*  on cattle farming more than ever now. And a thing that I think is completed now is Brazil and
*  Bolivia partnered together and built a highway all the way across and opened up a whole bunch
*  more land, which has found more of these, what we call like geometric earthworks. So there's more
*  and more evidence of these civilizations. It's not a, it's not a could be there. It's there, for sure.
*  By the way, the people who are trying to protect the rainforest really hate the highway. One of
*  the things I learned is if you build a road, loggers will come. And then we'll start cutting
*  stuff down. Now, from an archeology perspective, if you cut down trees, you get to discover things.
*  But from a sort of protective, very precious rainforest perspective, it's obviously the
*  opposite way. But it is interesting. I've seen where loggers cut through the forest and then
*  they, and when they leave, the forest heals itself very quickly. So quickly. And you just think that
*  across decades, you expand that to centuries and it's like, you could see how a civilization could
*  be completely swallowed up by the rainforest. And it happened for sure in the Amazon. One of the ways
*  that we're trying to push the frontier of where people were in the Amazon, because yes, the trees
*  and just the biomass have eaten so much evidence. But they're finding more and more of these places
*  that they call terra preta, which is black earth. And they're huge swaths of it. So I guess the
*  anthropology term is anthropogenic landscapes. And what they're saying is that that really dark
*  earth couldn't have just got that way through natural forest processes. That sometime in the
*  distant past, that forest wasn't there and there was major farming and human activity to the point
*  where they totally turned the soil black and it's much more enriched. And when I took a trip into
*  the Amazon, I went from Manaus up the river, the Black River a couple of days and went and met some
*  different communities. And I asked them about this black earth and they were like, yeah, that's why
*  we're here. Sometimes we move our village, but when we move, we look for the terra preta and that's
*  where we're going to put our village because that's a place that all of our gardens work.
*  The other places they don't. One of the things you talked about literally just asked, you have to ask
*  the right question. And the stories, all the secrets are carried by the people and they will
*  tell you. Yeah, there's so many of them. A thing that excites the world about archaeology right now
*  is Gobekli Tepe. And this 10,000 now Koran Tepe is 11,000. The whole area is called the Tos Tepler.
*  We only founded a couple of decades ago, but it was just archaeologists rowing through the area
*  and ask a sheep herder, hey, you know, you guys know where anything ancient is? Oh yeah, let me
*  show you this. And then all of a sudden we've got a lost civilization and the shepherds always knew
*  where it was, just nobody asked them. So speaking of Gobekli Tepe, what do you think about the work
*  of Graham Hancock, who also believes that there's a lost civilization in the Amazon? Well, I've met
*  Graham and personally I like him. He's a nice guy, got a nice sense of humor and I think he's smart.
*  And I also think he is a very good researcher. He and I are working on the same set of facts.
*  The differences are interpretations. I do not believe Graham's idea that a single
*  now lost ancient civilization seeded the rest of them. I just don't see that on a number of levels,
*  artifact-wise, technology-wise, art historical analysis. So I think his research is great.
*  I think that he's very well read. In fact, better read than a lot of my colleagues. But his conclusions
*  I disagree with. And he and I have talked about this and had a very civil and normal
*  conversation about it and agreed to disagree without spitting any venom at any point in the
*  conversation. That would be a fun argument to be a fly on the wall for. So he believes he's proposed
*  as possible that the Amazon jungle is sort of a man-made garden. So it was planted there by
*  advanced ancient civilization. Is there any degree to which that could be possible?
*  Frankly, I agree with him. I mean, it's just like what I was just talking about.
*  It's the conclusion part that we differ from. But the facts that he's basing that on are that
*  terra preta, are the huge geometric earthworks, are the ever-increasing evidence of them. They
*  are now from the bottom of Bolivia to Guyana. They're everywhere. Every time we open up the
*  jungle, we find these big works. So yes, there was a vast civilization that was there. How advanced
*  they were is a question and also a perspective thing. Graham really focuses in on what we don't
*  know and what could be. What's the key idea that he's proposing that you disagree with?
*  Is it the level of advancement that the civilization was or how large and centralized it was?
*  My main point of disagreement is that his ideas evolved like everybody's. No scientist or
*  researcher in anything has an idea at the beginning of their career and holds it till the day they die.
*  His ideas are evolving, but his ideas remain, a core of them are, that there was a very advanced
*  single ancient civilization that was utterly destroyed by climactic conditions. And the
*  younger Dryas hypothesis is part of that most recently. He used to not say that. Now he's into
*  this meteor thing. But he believes that that civilization was destroyed, but that
*  members of it escaped this cataclysm and then spread out all over the world to seed all of
*  the world civilizations for the next revival. There's where I disagree with him. I think these
*  were independent civilizations that grew up in their own ways, that they were not seeded by some
*  more advanced civilization from the past and that they all hold things in common because they have
*  this common ancestry of a, you know, in his early books, he suggested it's Atlantis. I don't think
*  he suggests that anymore, but he still hangs on to the single advanced now completely lost civilization.
*  And, you know, archaeology, we don't have, you know, all of our ideas are theories. Very few of
*  them are facts. And we're not, you know, we could have the story wrong, but one thing we're real
*  good at is finding stuff. I mean, we find fish scales. So I find it just too big a pill to swallow
*  that there was a civilization that was that technologically advanced and that large that we
*  can't even find a pot sherd from. Yeah. And of course it is a compelling story that there's a
*  single civilization from which all of this came from. Because the alternative is, you know, the
*  idea that we came across the Bering Strait from Asia, went all the way down to South America
*  and got isolated and created all these marvelous, sophisticated civilizations and ideas,
*  including religious ideas that look similar to other, you know, everybody has a flood myth.
*  Right. Right. So like there's a lot of similarities, everybody building pyramids.
*  Yeah.
*  But there could be a lot of other explanations. And for even if it's a simple,
*  compelling explanation, there has to be evidence for it, right? Now, what would that evidence look?
*  That's the bottom line. I mean, everything's theories were, and as responsible scientists,
*  we're trying to disprove our theories. We are not supposed to be trying to prove our theories.
*  That's one more foot out of the science box that archaeology often steps. We're supposed to be
*  disproving what we think is happening, not proving it. Yeah. You don't want to lean into the mystery
*  too much. I mean, most of it's such a weird discipline because you're operating in a,
*  it's like really in a dark room. You're feeling around a dark room. So it's mostly mystery.
*  I would say a lot of sciences operate in a mostly well lit room. It's like a dark corner
*  and you're kind of figuring out a way to light it. But in archaeology, most of it is a mystery,
*  right? Yes. It's job security. I like that part. You know, but I do also try to always remind myself
*  that every paradigm shifting idea that humans have ever had began as heresy and lunacy. You
*  know, that guy was crazy up to the second he was brilliant. And so we got to keep our minds open to
*  the things that sound outlandish because one of them eventually is going to lead us to the big
*  paradigm shift. And if we, you know, if we're busy burning books of ideas that we don't like,
*  that's where we close our minds to the possibility of advancing things.
*  I really love that. And I really appreciate that you're saying that. One of the fascinating things
*  about just the Amazon to me is that there's still a large number of uncontacted tribes.
*  To rewind back into ancient history, you can imagine all of these tribes that existed
*  in the Amazon that were isolated, very sort of distinct from each other. Can you speak to this,
*  your understanding of these tribes and their history? They're still here today.
*  Well, a lot of them are these, you know, by uncontacted, we mean, we don't know anything
*  about these guys. We know roughly where they are, but places like Ecuador have very responsible
*  policies where no one's allowed to go contact them. So we have a dearth of information. If
*  they walk out of the jungle and talk to us, that's one thing, but we don't go out there looking for
*  them. But they do seem frozen in time. And I don't think any of us have a good estimation of how long
*  they've been like that. But, you know, we were saying earlier that, you know, humans change
*  based on pressures of their environment. You know, it's a mother necessity is oftentimes
*  how we invent things or why we change its pressure. And one thing the Amazon is, once you,
*  you know, figure out how not to die in it, it's a paradise of food. Food's fallen from the sky
*  all the time there. And if once you learn to adapt to that environment, you've got very little need,
*  there's no pressure to make anything else. Things are working.
*  So for the modern humans that come across these uncontacted tribes,
*  one of the things they document and notice is the propensity of these tribes for violence.
*  So they get very aggressive in attacking whoever they come across.
*  And not just foreigners, they attack each other. The Yanomamo are famous for just having
*  never-ending feuds with each other.
*  What do you think is the philosophy behind that?
*  I don't, you know, I'm a relatively peaceful person, but I've got, you know, I've got the
*  monster in me like everybody does. And I think that these, you know, it's cultural norms that
*  become institutionalized. For the Yanomamo, they really, part of the right of passage to be a man
*  is to go kill or maim somebody from an outer village. And they go in there, they oftentimes,
*  the way they don't let inbreeding set in and ruin everybody, not that they think of it scientifically,
*  but they typically go and steal women from far off communities. And that starts a big fight.
*  Another thing that starts fights that when nobody even fought is illness.
*  Illness in the Amazon and all of the ancient Americas wasn't seen as a biological thing,
*  it was a spiritual thing. So if somebody in your village gets sick, the question is asked, well,
*  what spirit is menacing him and who called it out on him? And then the rumor starts, well,
*  I bet you it was Joe over there in that other community, he still passed off for that time
*  when we stole his daughter. And we ought to go over there and kill Joe, and then he'll get better.
*  And so this round of never ending violence, like Hatfields and McCoys had that thing, and the
*  people of New Guinea also do that. So it's not, there are certain areas,
*  mostly wooded areas now that I think about it, where people just hide out and they attack each
*  other as a cultural institution. It's such a tricky thing to do to study an uncontacted tribe
*  without obviously contacting them to figure out their language, their philosophy of mind,
*  how they communicate, the hierarchy they operate under. And yeah, you know, there was a fascinating
*  story in Peru, I guess it was probably like eight years ago or something, but there was a
*  ranger from one of the biology stations who just in the by and by of protecting his area,
*  met one of these uncontacted tribes and befriended someone, not the whole tribe,
*  but he made some friends who would meet him in the woods, not in their community.
*  And he started to learn their language over a couple of years. And so he was this kind of
*  important guy who actually could be the first translator to talk to these people. And one day,
*  a couple of them just came out of the woods and just plugged him with arrows and just killed him.
*  And then they went back in the woods. Like that's the one guy who understands what we're saying.
*  We should kill him and move our village. So those folks really lean into the, as you said,
*  the monster versus the puppy. You know, everybody's got it. I think, I think, you know, we,
*  we need to listen to our better angels because if we don't, we, we, we as a human species
*  can easily devolve into just using violence and against others to get what we want. We,
*  it's a, it's a daily choice we make not to be savages.
*  RG Which is a fascinating thing to remember. We're kind of thinking civilized society,
*  we've moved past all that, but it can, it can be summoned. Like in 1984, the two minutes of hate
*  with the right words, that primal thing can be summoned and directed and lead to a lot of
*  destruction. AC And you know, our, our sports are really based on taking those kinds of urges and
*  channeling them positive where somebody's not dead at the end of it.
*  RG Yep. So at which point did what we now call the Maya civilization arise?
*  AC Ah, that's a, that's another complicated one, another group living mostly in a jungle
*  that we have barely begun to explore. You know, the truth is a lot of the questions in the Amazon
*  and what we're talking about now is the Patan and the mountains there. Those aren't places
*  archaeologists want to live. They're horrible. I mean, I've been there. I don't want to live in a
*  tent and eat rations. I want to live in a nice town. So a lot of the places where the answers are,
*  we still really haven't gotten there because it takes a special person to be educated enough to
*  know what they're looking at and tough enough to want to be there. I've done my tour of duty. I'm
*  now in a nice little podcast studio. But seriously, the Maya, the first hint that we see people who
*  are culturally Maya, very close to where the time period for that Chavin culture is about 1800 BCE.
*  There's a culture that some call the Mochaia, not Maya, but they're on the Pacific coast
*  where Guatemala and Mexico connect. It's called the Soconusco. And those are the first people that
*  are really going to be culturally Maya. And they're interacting with the culture that has
*  traditionally been seen as Mexico's mother culture, which is the Olmec. They're kind of the same thing
*  as we were talking about in South America, where the original Maya, there's not a whole lot to
*  indicate that they have a religion. But the Olmec have this religion they develop and they start
*  exporting it. And you see the Maya become more and more involved in the religion that's being
*  created by the Olmec who are to the north of them in the swamps of what we call the Isthmus of
*  Tehuantepec. I have a lot of questions to ask here about just natural stupid confusion I have.
*  So first, did the Maya or the Olmec come first? And are they distinct groups? Like, how do you
*  maintain a distinct civilization when you're so close together?
*  I just finished filming a whole thing on the Olmecs and their interaction with the Maya for
*  the great courses. I'm thrilled for it to come out next spring. I think they co-evolved.
*  Archaeology in this regard is the worst enemy of this. We put these names on cultures. We talk
*  about how they evolve from one to another. We draw these lines where there aren't any. We make these
*  time periods that a culture magically transforms into somebody with another name, where I'm pretty
*  sure they didn't care about any of those names. But the Maya and the Olmec are two parts of a larger
*  interaction sphere that's happening in Mesoamerica, a very dynamic time. The Olmec are
*  really bringing the religion part, but the other areas are bringing technology, ceramic technology,
*  making hematite mirrors, making tools out of obsidian and other stone types. So you've got
*  the Olmec in the middle where Mexico gets skinny and it gets swampy down there. That's called the
*  Isthmus of Tehuantepec. That's where the Olmec are. Then you've got the Maya to the east of them.
*  Then you have the Valley of Oaxaca where the people called the Zapotecs, they're rising up.
*  And then you have the Valley of Mexico, which will eventually become the Aztecs, but not for
*  millennia. All those areas are interacting with each other.
*  Can we just also draw some more lines?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  So what is Mesoamerica and what is South America? And what you just said to Olmecs and the Maya,
*  can we just linger on the geography that we're talking about here in the, what is this, like
*  a thousand BC? Yeah, the time period we're talking about where the Olmec are there, a thousand BC is
*  a great midpoint of it. I'd say it starts about 1800 BCE and by 500 BCE, the Olmec are gone.
*  And a whole new wave of civilization and population increase happen.
*  In terms of Mesoamerica, looking at your map here, I'd say about halfway through the Chihuahua
*  Desert up there in the top left, that's about the boundary of Mesoamerica. There's this big
*  desert where almost nobody lives. And once you get north enough, you get into the ancestral Pueblo
*  people of what's now America, the Four Corners area. They're not Mesoamerican. They have different
*  lives. Where does modern Mexico end? Modern Mexico ends, right? You see the name Maya there
*  with the white line around it? That's Guatemala. So Guatemala cuts off most of Mexico from Central
*  America. Got it. But Mesoamerica only goes about halfway through Honduras. And then it's really
*  kind of a no man's land. Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, they really, they're neither. They're not
*  Mesoamerica, they're not South America. They're more South America because they've got some gold
*  there. But then basically you get on the other side of Panama and you're fully in South America.
*  With two distinct groups too. You've got the guys that are on the Andes, on the west coast,
*  and then you have the Amazon. So the west, the Andes and the Amazon are very distinct. So when
*  you say, when you refer to the Andean region, is that referring to the Andes and the Amazon
*  or just the Andes? Just the Andes and the coast to the Pacific there. That's Andean civilization.
*  So did Maya make it to the Andes, the Andean region? Not that archaeology can prove, but
*  it's almost certain that they interacted with each other. Number one, it's just, you know,
*  it's biased to think that these people couldn't travel as widely as people on the other side of
*  the planet did. But there's all sorts of hints, like that first ceramics I was talking about that
*  the Maya made. They show up strangely sophisticated technologically already. And down in Ecuador,
*  they had them for a thousand years before. So a lot of people, myself included, think that
*  the idea of ceramics actually came from South America to the Maya.
*  LW – Did the Maya get seeded by the second wave across the Bering Strait? Or did that initial wave
*  of people that came and populated South America, were they the ancestors of the Maya? Like how did
*  the migration happen here? Do we understand that?
*  KM – We're still piecing it together. I don't think, you know, I'd be lying if I told you I had
*  the answers. But we do have evidence of Maya stature people. They're a small people. Generally
*  speaking, people that grow up in the forest are smaller and people that grow up in the open plains
*  are taller, probably about, you know, just generations of people that hit their head on a branch or not.
*  LW – You're joking, but you know, there could be something to that.
*  KM – I think there's some truth to it. I mean, the Pygmies are small and the people on the plains
*  in Africa are big. The North American Indians are tall and the Maya are small. There's definitely
*  a pattern of smaller people in the forests. But anyway, there's a cave in the Yucatan called
*  Lowltun Cave that has handprints in the cave. It's somebody who put their hand on the cave and spit
*  charcoal around their hand like a negative print. We can date that charcoal and it comes from 10,000
*  years ago. And the hands are all small. It's, you know, typical old Mexico. I walked right up to
*  these things and could put my hand, I didn't mess with them, but I put my hand next to these hands
*  and they're all smaller than my Northern European hand. And so either it was a bunch of kids
*  who were in this cave 10,000 years ago or it was people of Maya stature who did it.
*  KM – It's so cool that you can date the charcoal. And it's so cool that 10,000 years ago there were
*  people leaving. KM – And actually we have one that's I think 2,000 years older now. Just a couple
*  years ago, again in Yucatan in a cave, they found a woman they named Naya now. And she's like 12,000
*  years old. KM – So the best guess maybe that you have is it goes across the Bering Strait
*  to South America, possibly the Amazon, develop a lot of cool ideas in the Amazon and start
*  drifting back up into Mesoamerica. KM – It was kind of a co-evolution. The technology of
*  ceramics I think got there through an interaction with… KM – Got it. See, the interesting thing is that the
*  Maya didn't really have religion, didn't have as a vibrant religious set of ideas,
*  and they borrowed it from the Olmec. AC – I've been doing a deep dive on this for this Olmec
*  course that I just did. And it really does seem like these other cultures that have jade and
*  hematite and obsidian, the Olmec had none of that stuff. They were living in a swamp and building
*  things out of dirt. But they were importing those materials from those areas, carving them into all
*  sorts of religious iconography, and then exporting them back to them. KM – And still the Fang deity?
*  AC – No, the Fang deity is nowhere in Central America and Mesoamerica. That's why there's
*  jaguars, there's jaguar iconography, but it's not the same thing. This whole jaguar transformer
*  deity does not exist there. They do have a pantheon. KM – So the Maya, the Olmecs are
*  the interesting peoples of the regions. What was their… I'd love to ask questions about who were
*  they. So one question I'm curious about, what was their sense when they looked up at the stars?
*  What was their conception of the cosmos? AC – That's a question I've spent my entire career
*  trying to answer. I think that they saw it as proof of the cyclical nature of life.
*  Certainly they saw like every ancient group did, like are those the gods? Why are those things so
*  far away? But I think that the Maya especially looked at it with a much more mathematical mind
*  than most did. And so they watched these things move every night. And if you do that even today,
*  you notice that all the stars move in tandem. They're just this blanket. They're like this
*  curtain behind me. They're the stage upon which some very important players are dancing.
*  And that's the moon, the sun, and the planets. There's five planets we can see visibly. So they
*  started watching like why are just those seven moving differently than the rest? And those are
*  the things that they keyed on mathematically. The sun of course was also involved in the
*  agricultural cycle. So that was important in and of itself. But the planets we can see them
*  coming up with ideas, definitely doing the math and seeing that there is a repeated cycle
*  and then coming up with mythology around them. Like Venus for them was associated with war.
*  And they had very ritualized times to go to war that had something to do with Venus.
*  Sometimes in the classic period Maya, it was the first appearance of Venus as the morning star.
*  That was a good time to go to battle with your neighbors. And when it became the post-classic
*  with like Chichen Itza being the capital of the Yucatan, then it looks like if you watch Venus day
*  after day, it goes slowly up every day. And then when it hits its highest point as morning star in
*  the morning, it goes down to the earth like three times as fast. All of a sudden it just shoots down
*  and hits the earth. And so the people of post-classic Maya civilization saw that as the gods
*  shooting a spear into the earth. And that was a good time to attack your neighbors. That was
*  like war time when the spear is going to hit the earth. All right. So this is fascinating.
*  They just had at the foundation a sense that life existence at the various timescales is cyclical.
*  Yeah. That's the starting point. And then you just look out there and if you're extremely precise,
*  which is fascinating how precise they were, you can just measure the cycles.
*  Yeah. And they did it really well. Now, of course, they are the only ones to develop a fully
*  elaborated writing system in all of the Americas. South America had the Kipu, but it's so different
*  than our writing. We're still trying to figure out what the heck it is. We know there's math there
*  too. But they had the ability to take a lifetime worth of measurements and hand it to the next
*  generation who would then do it more and do it more. That's how they figured out kind of the
*  holy grail of ancient astronomy. How good were they? Was whether they could see the procession
*  of the equinoxes. The fact that we're just barely wobbling and there's a 26,000 year period where
*  the stars as that backdrop will spin all the way around and come back. It's 26,000 years.
*  But the Maya were able to figure out, wait, it's moving one degree every 72 years and did a
*  calculation based on where it should be in the ancient past. And they're using constellations.
*  They're showing us they know by saying like, this planet's in this constellation right now
*  and 33,000 years ago, it would be in this constellation.
*  It's just fascinating that they were able to figure this out. I would love to sort of understand
*  the details of the scientific community, if you can call it that.
*  I think we absolutely could. And that's actually one of the things that I'm
*  hoping to move the needle on in my generation with my career is to give these cultures the
*  respect they deserve as standing toe to toe with the rest of our ancient civilizations we respect.
*  There are things that should be called science that are not being called science at the moment.
*  Their math is incredible. Their hydraulic engineering is incredible. Their chemistry
*  is incredible. And so I hope to talk about these things differently as a way to get people to
*  recognize the achievements in a different way. Yeah, I mean, unquestionably incredible
*  scientific work in the astronomy sense, especially here. Can you speak to all the
*  sophisticated aspects of the Mayan calendar that they've developed?
*  I know you got another five hours.
*  Yes, I should say that you also gave me the 2024 Mayan calendar.
*  Yeah, I do this just to show the world that that calendar system is evergreen. It can go
*  into the future or the past for billions of years in the system they made, just like our system is.
*  So can you speak to the three components here as I'm reading the Tzolk'in,
*  the hab, and the long count? What are these fascinating components of the calendar?
*  It's neat how obsessed they were. They were really math nerds. It wasn't good enough for
*  them to just make one cycle to describe time. They had all these cycles that interlocked into
*  each other like cogs in a machine, though they never thought of it like that. But the Tzolk'in
*  is their oldest one and the one that still endures today. There are millions of Maya people
*  that are living their lives based on a 260-day count. No weeks, no months. It's just 13 numbers
*  combined with 20-day names for a total of 260 days, and then it goes again.
*  Everybody in the highlands knows what their birthday is in that calendar,
*  knows what it means about their personality and the kind of jobs that they're supposed to do.
*  Each one of those days has their own spirit and what's supposed to happen in those days.
*  The Maya collectively call them the mom, the grandmother-grandfather spirits,
*  and they talk to each one of those days and they pray to them. There's now an association of some
*  8,000 people that are called A'ki, that are daykeepers who are keeping the days,
*  and they're also like community psychologists almost. People come to them and say,
*  my life is mixed up. What's wrong here? Well, let's ask the mom. Okay, well, it looks like
*  you're not doing this or that or you know what? You're an accountant. You're not supposed to be
*  an accountant. You're supposed to be a midwife. What are you doing? You're living your life wrong.
*  You're a Kib. You need to start being a Kib person.
*  They take extremely seriously the day on which you're born, what that means,
*  the spirit that embodies that day. Right. I'm Kib. I'm 13 Kib and it says,
*  it's funny how accurate a lot of them are. Mine is basically, I'm an irresponsible
*  husband and parent, but people like me, so my family still prospers.
*  Like, oh, God, that's horribly accurate. I mean, some of it is also the chicken or the egg,
*  if you truly believe. So if you've structured society where this calendar is truly sacred,
*  then it kind of like, you manifest a lot of the, the spirit does manifest itself in the life of
*  the people that is born on that spirit's day. Absolutely. It's interesting. And the Maya really
*  feel this in this system. So that's the core system. This 260 day calendar was the very first
*  calendar they made thousands of years ago. And it's the one that's most important today.
*  Why 260 days, by the way? Is there a reasoning behind it?
*  From most Maya agree with this today. And, you know, who knows what the original architects
*  thousands of years ago were thinking, but it's nine months. It's the human gestation period.
*  So if you, if you conceived on the day 13 monkey, chances are your kids coming out on or near 13
*  monkey. And I think it's beautiful. I mean, if that's right, that means the Maya and the people
*  of Mesoamerica, we'll all share it together. When they thought about we need, we need a count of
*  time that's for us. They didn't look up into the heavens. They looked like into their bodies. What's
*  the first cycle that we actually go through as humans? And they picked this nine month thing.
*  It really is our cycle and no other culture on the planet looked inside themselves to create
*  their calendar like that. So that's the oldest one and the sacred one that still carries through to
*  today. What's the second one, the hob? The hob is the solar calendar, the one that everybody
*  on the planet eventually comes up with. We know it's second though, because when they start talking
*  about it, they use all the symbols and the numbers from the 260 one. They say, well,
*  we need a solar one too. Let's just keep counting this another 105 days and we'll get to 365.
*  Oh, interesting. They kind of carry the same. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. And that's useful
*  because for all the sort of agriculture, all those kinds of reasons, right? Though interestingly,
*  they never put a leap year in. The hob is also called the vague year because it's just 365,
*  which means every year they're off a quarter of a day and eventually it starts really adding up.
*  In fact, it's even caused modern problems. In this calendar here, I just do the straight math
*  from a thousand years ago. And so I place the beginning of the solar year differently than some
*  Maya groups do, especially the guys in the highlands of Eastern Guatemala. They write me
*  nasty emails saying, I don't know what time the year is, but their relatives changed it in the
*  1950s because their agricultural cycle was so far off. They moved it 60 days back to make it in the
*  spring again, but it drifts, which is strange because it's not a very good thing for the
*  agricultural cycle. It's one of these mysteries we still don't have an explanation for.
*  So that's the hob. And then what's the long count?
*  The long counts, they're really mysterious, cool one because it's a linear count of days,
*  which are not like them. It's a bunch of cycles like ours. Our weeks are a cycle, our months are
*  a cycle. But it's weird in that its estimation of the year in the long count system is only
*  360 days. So it's miserably off a solar year. They count in base 20. So they count like we count in
*  tens where decimal, they count in base 20, but decimal. And so it should be, there's ones,
*  there's 20s, there's 400s, there's 8,000s, there's 160,000s. It goes just like our tens,
*  hundreds, thousands, 10,000s, but it's times 20. So they have days, months of 20 days,
*  and then they have these years that should be by their math 400, but it's only 360. And that
*  throws the whole thing out of whack going further up. Then they have a 20-year period
*  and a 400-year period. 400 years to their calendar, but by that time, it's only 396
*  years in our reckoning. So it's mysterious that it's, why did they tweak it at the year to be
*  only 360 days? That doesn't follow any astronomy, that's not the human cycle.
*  Yeah, but they're, I mean, it's interesting that they build up towards
*  thinking about very long periods of time, like Boktoons is 144,000 days.
*  Right. Or a Boktoon is 400 of the long counts years. So it's kind of like our millennium.
*  You know, we think it's a big deal when we hit a millennium or a century. They have a 20-year
*  period that they do a lot of celebrations on called a Katoon, and then they have the 400 Boktoon,
*  which is the big one. That's like their millennium. And 13 of those Boktoons
*  occurred in the creation before us. They also think that we're in, that the world has had
*  multiple creations. They're not alone in that. There's lots of ancient civilizations who say
*  that, but we're technically in the fourth creation. And they have a creation story called
*  the Popol Vuh. And the Popol Vuh is clear as day that the third creation ends with the help of these
*  heroes called the hero twins, and the fourth creation begins. And so on the Maya monuments,
*  we see them doing the math through the long count. And we can calculate it back very exactly. It
*  happened. The fourth creation started on August 11th, 3114 BC. And it says, it doesn't say it's
*  day one. It says it's the last day of the 13th Boktoon of the third creation, which leads us to
*  believe that a creation is only 13 Boktoons long. Right. So, and this would be the fourth creation.
*  The calendar starts. This is the fourth creation. But if you do the math going from 3114 BC
*  and count 13 Boktoons forward, you get to 2012. And hence the very popular notion that 2012,
*  whenever that was, December, December 21st, 2012, will be the end of the world.
*  Right.
*  Can you explain this?
*  Those were very fruitful years for me. I had so many lectures around the country that was,
*  it's like Garrett Morris in Saturday Night Live. The apocalypse was betty betty good to me.
*  I mean, but that is pretty interesting. So that's, that will be, so technically would be in the fifth.
*  No.
*  Yeah. Technically we'd be in the fifth. Though my argument was that actually,
*  if you look through all the corpus of Maya mathematics and calendars,
*  they never say anything like that. In fact, there's a handful of dates that tell us
*  that the fourth creation does continue farther on. That that Boktoon place should have
*  20 Boktoons in it. Like their counting system would dictate, not 13. And there's a place in
*  Palenque, there's a place in the Dresden Codex, and one other place I'm forgetting that
*  all talk about time after 2012. So how does that happen? It's a conflict.
*  Is there supposed to be an overlap of the, of the, of the 13, so it's like 13 is the core of it and
*  it's 20 long? They love the number 13. It's all over the place. It's a magic number to them.
*  My explanation, which I admit is, is not very solid, but I think that
*  the magical deeds of the hero twins in their creation story at the end of the third
*  creation hit the magical reset button and that it just restarted time right there because of
*  their magic. But that was not to say that the natural Boktoon cycle should be 13.
*  And there are certain texts that, that go way forward in time or way backward in time. And
*  whenever they want to do that, there are higher increments than just the Boktoon. Above that,
*  there's the Pictoon, then there's the Kalabatoon, then there's Alawatoon, and it goes on and on.
*  And these are like, you know, 160,000 years. Huge increments of time. Whenever they want to do that
*  and they talk about a long period of time, they start putting 13s in all of those increments,
*  those higher increments. And I think what they're saying is they're making an esoteric statement
*  about the never-ending nature of time. That's what I think they're telling us in those texts,
*  that time goes on forever, magically. But they still had a conception that it didn't go
*  on forever before, right? That there was other civilizations that came before in their,
*  this is the fourth creation. This is the fourth creation. And the gods made everybody. The first
*  ones were made of mud and they melted. The second ones were made of sticks, but they were jerks to
*  the animals. The third ones were like us, but flawed in some other way. And then we're finally
*  made of the blood of the gods and corn. We're made out of corn. So we're perfect. And as it explains
*  to us, the Pope of Voodoo does, we got it right this time. There's no reason to believe that this
*  creation has a set duration. One of the weird things is that the Aztecs, who we talked to a
*  lot at Contact, they also had the concept of multiple creations before us, but they were
*  real clear to the Spanish that they weren't all the same time element. Some of them were
*  in the 300s of years. Some of them were in the 700s of years, but they were not the same time
*  period. So our mathematical logic that if the third creation was 13, this one must be 13,
*  or also be 13. It's in direct opposition to what the Aztecs told us about the nature of creations.
*  They're different time periods.
*  What do you think there was the myth of the previous creations? Did they have some kind of
*  long, multi-generational memory of prior civilizations?
*  It may have had some echo in the flood myths.
*  It's the same kind of major myths carried through long periods of time.
*  There's a lot of different opinions about it. If they were all 13, if we have five creations,
*  like the Aztecs said, and they were all 13, they would come up to roughly 25,000 something years,
*  which is very close to that processional cycle. So some people are like, they designed it all to be
*  one completion of the procession of the equinoxes.
*  I don't believe that one, but that one sure sounds good, doesn't it? That's going to get a
*  lot of internet hits. One of the things I do obviously wonder about is why the flood myth
*  is part of most societies and most religions. I think that one's pretty easy. It's the end
*  of the ice age when the bathtub filled back up. It's just the ice age. It's the seas filling back
*  up. Without really understanding what happened, they just carried that story. Everybody knows that
*  everybody's nice coastal village went underwater and they had to seek higher ground.
*  And then just like people like talking about the weather, everybody was talking about the weather
*  for many generations as the sea level was going up. And then that myth carried.
*  Why do we live here, grandpa? Well, we used to live over there, but then the water came.
*  And then many grandpas later, it just permeates every idea.
*  It becomes mythology, but global mythology. So that one, there's a lot of things I don't
*  have a reasonable explanation for, but the flood myth is almost certainly the rise in sea level.
*  So this idea that every day represents that it carries a spirit, there's modern day astrology.
*  Most people kind of consider astrology this maybe a bit unscientific, woo-woo type of
*  set of beliefs. But do you think there's some wisdom that astrology carries
*  from your scholarship of the Maya calendar? Do you think if we carry that to the astrological
*  perspective on the world, do you think there's some wisdom there?
*  I don't know. I have a woo-woo part of me. I would like to believe that stuff, but I don't
*  think as a scientist, I cannot come up with a biological scientific reason why we're here.
*  Why that would be true. And when you look at it objectively, I mean,
*  really is everybody born with the sign Scorpio a moody person? That's just objectively not true.
*  But it is funny how oftentimes these Maya horoscopes, for lack of a better word,
*  do hit the mark. There was some student who surveyed like 300 people with the app I made
*  and asked them about their Greek sign and their Maya sign. And his conclusion for his term paper
*  was that the Maya one was working way better, which that's fascinating. At least that's fun.
*  But no, I think I'm too much of a scientist to believe that I just don't have any foundation
*  in science that would allow us to believe that the month in which we were born in a cycle
*  sets our personality and destiny.
*  I agree. And yet there's so much mystery all around us that what I do like is the inbuilt
*  humility to that worldview. That there's this whole, you can call it a spiritual world, but
*  a world that we don't quite understand. And then you can wonder about what is the wisdom that that
*  world carries. And then you can construct all kinds of systems to try to interpret that.
*  And then there is where the human hubris can come in. But it's good to be humbled by how little we
*  know, I suppose. I do love the mysteries of the world. And I would love to find an ancient
*  civilization, but I don't want to solve the mysteries of the world. I think they're one
*  of the things that make life worth living. That's true. That's true. You mentioned the
*  Maya writing system. What are some interesting aspects of their language
*  that they've used and the written language that they used?
*  Well, one of the things that confound me as a guy who's spent a better portion of my life
*  studying it, I had the honor of being the student of Linda Shealy right here at the
*  University of Texas at Austin. She got the group together who broke the Maya code of
*  hieroglyphics in the 1970s. So I learned from the best and loved every minute of it. I miss Linda.
*  Can you speak to that code actually, the hieroglyphic code and what it takes to break it?
*  Oh, boy. I mean, what a thing. We had kind of a Rosetta Stone. We had a page out of Diego
*  de Landa's book, a priest who was converting the Maya in Yucatan, asked his informants about
*  their writing system and what every sound meant. And he was convinced they had an alphabet like we
*  do. So he got this Maya guy sat down in Spanish and he said, okay, you're going to write all the
*  symbols right here in my book, right? Write an a here, write a be here, write a se here.
*  And that guy just wrote all of the sounds that the priest told him to write. They were actually
*  syllables. They were vowel consonant combinations. They weren't an alphabet, but that turned into our
*  Rosetta Stone of sorts. The big key is that the Maya still speak that same language. There are
*  millions of Maya people who are speaking a version of Maya. Now, there's where I get confused,
*  that we've got a single writing system that is intelligible. We've broken the code. So we know
*  that it's basically the same writing system from the top of the Yucatan into Guatemala and El
*  Salvador. But we have 33 Maya languages today that are mutually unintelligible.
*  And we backwards project the language of what they spoke back then that the glyphs are in to
*  something called Chol-T, which is a combination of Chort-T and Chol, two of those languages.
*  But it doesn't work for me at all. How did, if there was one language, maybe two back then,
*  how did it flower into 33 mutually unintelligible languages in just 500 years during
*  acculturation and horrible infectious diseases that killed 90% of the population?
*  How did that happen? So we're missing something huge here. I think it's more like Chinese,
*  where Chinese letters, writing can be read in multiple languages and still understood.
*  I don't know exactly the mechanics of how that would happen, but it just seems impossible that
*  there are more languages, not less languages in the Maya area after the last 500 years that
*  they've been through. So you think that there's some kind of process of either rapidly generating
*  dialects or there always has been these dialects, or I should say, their distinct languages,
*  even though there's a common writing system. There must have been a way that multiple languages
*  understood the same writing system. Or maybe there was something like Latin,
*  how there was a period in Europe where most people were illiterate and there was this
*  priesthood who all understood Latin and they wrote in Latin. Maybe the hieroglyphs represent a kind of
*  Latin in the ancient Maya world.
*  But we don't really know, and there's not clear evidence to fill in the gaps of how it's possible
*  to have that.
*  Right. But we did realize it was actually a Russian scholar named Yuri Konorosov who broke the code.
*  The Americans and the Europeans were absolutely sure that the written language was a dead language.
*  But Yuri, not knowing any of that, not being filled with all of those thoughts from America
*  and Europe, went about it in the way that he was taught in his grad school in Moscow and just
*  went to the dictionaries. He looked at Yucatec language that they're speaking today,
*  and he applied it to the symbol system. He knew that there were certain sounds. He used
*  Lambda's alphabet. His two key examples were a picture of a dog with a symbol over it and a
*  picture of a turkey with a symbol over it. A dog in Yucatec is tsuul. He saw two symbols and he
*  said, this one's probably tsuul and this one's uul. Then the turkey was kuts. It would be ku,
*  ending in tsu. He showed how, look, this is tsuuts, this is tsuul. Those two things that
*  should be tsuul are the same symbol. That began this process of unraveling the syllables that
*  we're still working on today. That's fascinating. Just that decoding process is fascinating.
*  How do you even figure that out? Are you aware of any written languages that haven't been decoded
*  yet? Yeah. There's a number of them. There's Easter Island script. I was just talking to,
*  we've apparently made a few advances there now. It's called Rongo Rongo.
*  We only have about maybe 25 examples of texts, but we're beginning to break that.
*  The big one is Harappan. Harappan, for a long time, we used to say there were five independent
*  scripts on the planet. Those were Chinese, cuneiform, which is Mesopotamian, Egyptian,
*  Maya, and then Harappan, which is from Northern India. That's the only one that we've never
*  cracked. Now all the epigraphers, the people, that's the term, epigraphy is translating these
*  languages. They're all ganging up on Harappan and want to kick it off the list because we
*  can't break it. It had a big enough symbol set, but no one's been able to crack it. Now they're
*  saying it's just an elaborate symbol set and doesn't reflect the spoken word. That's a hypothesis,
*  which would explain why it's so difficult to break. We could just be faced with a quitter
*  generation. Maybe somebody will pick up the baton next generation. Kids these days with their...
*  The other one that fascinates me is from the Americas. It's the khipu.
*  The Inca had the khipu, this knotted string records, but it was definitely encoding more
*  than just math. We know the math. I can do the math khipus and figure out what they're
*  totaling and things. Yeah, there's a khipu right there.
*  Khipu are recording devices fashioned from strings historically used by a number of
*  cultures in the region of Andean South America. A khipu usually consists of cotton or
*  combed fiber strings. There's a set of strings and they're supposed to what? To be saying
*  something? There's one long string that the little ones dangle off of and each one of the
*  dangling strings have sets of knots on them. The knots, some of them are mathematical khipus and
*  those we can just do the math. We can prove that it's math. They also encoded language in there.
*  They had entire libraries in Cusco where Spanish conquistadors were brought through and the
*  caretakers of the libraries would just put, they'd say, pull that one down, read that one to me,
*  and he'd pull it out and just read a history of something that happened 200 years earlier.
*  So it was definitely writing. But in the 1570s, one head of the church there had all of the people
*  that could read them called khipu kamayaks gathered up, had them read all of their khipus and
*  transcribed them into Spanish books, and then had the khipus burned and those people murdered.
*  Well, there you go. And so we can't break the code still today, but we know it was absolutely
*  a written language. Though it wasn't written, it was weaved or knotted. And there's still some
*  khipus available that could be- There's, I think now we've just crossed the 1,000 mark.
*  So we have 1,000 khipus. There's enough to break the code. And I think this generation might be
*  the one that does it. It's sad that so few have survived. I mean, 1,000 is good, but it's-
*  But see, Peru has barely scratched the surface with archaeology. There's so much out there.
*  There was a priest I read about named Diego de Pores, who was one of the early people in Peru
*  converting communities. And his chronicle is real clear that he wanted to teach this community of
*  3,000 people all the Spanish prayers, the important ones for them to be converted into Christianity.
*  And he had the communities, khipu kamayaks, not khipus for each person that told them that
*  they could read them out and memorize the prayers. And if they were caught without their khipu in town,
*  they were flogged. So he had 3,000 of the same khipu made and handed out to this community.
*  If we find that community and find its cemetery, there is a Rosetta Stone.
*  You know, it is probably the case that there is somebody in Peru, and maybe a large community,
*  that knows this language, that understands. And you just have to show up and ask them.
*  And it's like, they're like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  There are some communities that are using them. There's a couple of them that we had high hopes
*  for, and then it was apparent that they were just making shit up. They didn't actually know how to
*  read it. They just knew it used to be read. So they made a bunch of stuff about what it says,
*  and they bring it out, and they act like they can read it. But then when you ask them the details,
*  they don't know. But then on a much simpler level, there's llama herders who keep a string
*  in their pocket, and they've got the knots equaling how many llamas they have. And then
*  they have subcategories of information like this one's sick, we've lost these ones, this one's
*  pregnant. So they have these more simple and more mathematical khipus, but they're using them to
*  effect as a record.
*  RG Is it possible through archaeology to know what
*  the social organization of the Maya was? Like what, maybe if there was a hierarchy,
*  maybe what the political structure was, if there was a leader, different roles, priests, or
*  who had the power, who was powerless, who had certain kinds of roles. Is it possible to know that?
*  Actually, because of hieroglyphs, yeah, we know a whole lot. There's basic things that archaeology,
*  which is a very blunt tool, can figure out. Like this guy lives in a rich house, this guy lives in
*  a poor house. But the hieroglyphs tell us specific stuff about who can rule, that it was hereditary,
*  that that hereditary rule was based on royal blood that could be burned and connect to the
*  ancestors that lived up in the sky versus the one that's lived in the underworld.
*  It also told us things about hierarchy, like that there were councils of lords underneath the king
*  who each represented clans who had their own neighborhoods and that there were revolving
*  positions of authority. There was the site that I mapped for my dissertation and spent
*  years in the jungle there, Palenque, had a lord's title named Fire Lord. That was one of the
*  generals of their army. And we could tell that position changed over time. So there was one guy
*  named Chakzuts, who was the Fire Lord for the early part of a reign of a king called the Kalmonob.
*  And then by the time he carves this other panel, there's another guy in the position of
*  Kak Ahal, which was the Fire Lord. And so he had-
*  Got promoted?
*  It was, well, he could have been killed, I mean, in the case of that. But then we have the
*  interesting case of, in the post-classic, they shed the idea of kings. They don't like kings anymore.
*  That's probably a big part of why the classic disappearance and the abandonment of all those
*  cities happened. People just got sick of kings. And so they turned into this more council system
*  at Chichen Itza. But then when Chichen Itza falls, there's a new city that's architecture looks a
*  lot like Chichen Itza. It's called Mayapon, but it has what is called the League of Mayapon.
*  And it has a council of representatives from the communities from all around the Yucatan.
*  And it is basically a democracy. It is a Maya democracy that happens. The individuals from
*  all around the Yucatan are there. Each family has their own council house at Mayapon, though
*  they live back at their place. It's kind of like a Maya Congress.
*  A representative of democracy.
*  It really was. And this happens in, I guess, 1250 AD, that this Maya democracy happens. And we know
*  the names of them. We know the families. And of course, they were humans. So eventually,
*  they screwed it all up. One family murdered another family and the whole city burned.
*  And of course, it's probably some fascinating corruption, which is hard to discover through.
*  Part of it was the Aztecs screwing things up. The Aztecs came down with all sorts of, like,
*  we'll buy everything you're making. And then eventually they were like, could we maybe buy
*  some humans? And then one family was like, no. And the other family was like, I don't know,
*  they're making us a lot of money. So then they murdered each other and the water supply got
*  polluted and then the city burned. It seems like slavery, murder, and disease
*  is a large component of the story of humans. You mentioned different periods in the Maya,
*  the classic, the post-classic, the pre-classic, the archaic. Can you just speak to that? So archaic
*  is before there was really a civilization. Yeah, archaic is pretty much when everybody's hunter
*  gatherers. So the classic period was the Golden Age. And then the pre-classic is the interesting
*  time that we were talking about. And the post-classic is when the democracy came about.
*  Well, midway through it. Yeah. Reverted back to council systems. The Maya loved to be part of
*  councils. So yeah, we have, pre-classic is like the origins of civilization. They're starting to
*  build cities. They're starting to create their calendar. They're starting to create these
*  wonderful works of art. And the classic period, if you look at 10 different textbooks for the Maya,
*  you'll get 10 different dates that wiggle around in there. But basically that's the age of kings
*  to me. That's when these cities decide that they're going to organize themselves around
*  elite royal families that have this magical blood that can contact their ancestors that are
*  directly in contact with the gods. The Maya never contact their gods directly. They contact
*  their ancestors who were up there who act like liaisons to the gods. And so the Maya age of kings
*  has these dynasties sprouting up where these people have basically snowed the rest of the people,
*  that they've got a special quality of their blood and only their offspring can do the same trick
*  and talk to the gods. Where everybody, every Joe Maya can let their blood and burn it and
*  contact their ancestor. But Joe Maya's dad is just a corn farmer who lives down below and he's got no
*  influence over the gods. But the rulers, their spirits go down briefly, but then they go up into
*  the heavens and reside where the gods are and can act as liaisons. So that's the validation for this
*  kingship that happens for about 400 years. I know we say 250 to 900, which is kind of the
*  encompassing edges of it, but it's interesting that it's actually specifically the ninth
*  Bakhtun of their history. The ninth Bakhtun begins in like 426 and it ends in like 829.
*  So it's a 400 year period of time. And before that there were no kings. And after that,
*  there really aren't kings. They're heads of councils. So it's, I call it the age of kings,
*  where everybody's following the directives of basically a despot. And for a while, that's great.
*  I mean, cities build up, populations happening. I see it as kind of a cult of personality moment,
*  to strong, charismatic leaders inspire people to do great things together. But eventually,
*  like happens all the time with power, too much power corrupts. All of a sudden there's this
*  unwieldy, huge elite class that has to be treated special by everybody else. And they start saying,
*  well, I think we should fight with those guys and you guys should go take these things.
*  And people eventually get sick of it and they walk away from these cities. And that's how we get
*  the mysterious Maya collapse where all these cities are just gone.
*  RG That's one of the great mysteries of the Maya civilization is that over a very short period of
*  time, what, like a hundred years, it seems to have declined very rapidly. It collapsed. What do you
*  think explains that? What happened? AC I think it's a failing of archaeology to properly see what
*  was happening. I think that most of those cities populations moved no more than 20 to 40 kilometers
*  out and started their own farm. And they lived in perishable houses and all archaeology's signature
*  sees is that nobody lives in the city center anymore. We don't see a bunch of mass bodies.
*  There's no evidence of people getting sick. There are certain cities that fought with each other
*  at the end. And we see that signature plain as day. We see, we know when a city was attacked and
*  burned, mostly that didn't happen. People moved and migrated. And it seems like right there around
*  like between 800 and 900, a lot of the elites that were on top in the, most of it was in the
*  rainforests of Northern Guatemala. They move, they move in two directions. Some of them move
*  into the highlands of Guatemala and some of them move up into the Yucatan. The city of Chichen Itza
*  becomes the next big capital in Yucatan. But the word eats is actually a word describing
*  the people who lived around Lake P10 eats in Northern Guatemala. And all of the Maya are
*  super clear about that, that the eats that came in as immigrants with these new ideas and created
*  Chichen Itza. So the, the elites who were no longer welcome in their cities, just moved and set up shop
*  somewhere else. So why was there a decline? What was maybe the catalyst? Was there a specific kind
*  of events that started this? Was this an idea that kind of transformed the society? We are still
*  debating that. We, I don't think there is a single reason. I think humans are complicated. I think a
*  lot of things led to this. One thing we can see archeologically is that every one of the cities
*  became overpopulated. They were too popular. And we think that they pushed the limits of their
*  capacity to feed and house people. We see it in lots of the cities at the end of the classic period
*  that people are seasonally starving. I remember really stark evidence in Copán, Honduras. Copán
*  was this beautiful city lineage of 17 Kings, but the last Kings and the last elite burials that we
*  dig from the city center, the teeth are the telling part. They get this thing when you're growing up
*  and you're not getting enough food seasonally, it shows up in the enamel of your teeth. It's
*  called dental hypoplasia. And if somebody is seasonally starving, it gets these lines in their
*  teeth. And that last generation of Maya before they left Copán, even the rich people are seasonally
*  starving. So there's a problem there for sure. But I also think it's a weird thing. It was not an
*  empire. It was a group of independent city states like Greece. Some of them were allied,
*  some of them were enemies. There was a huge civil war that settled out about the end of the classic
*  period. So if it was Europe, the victors would have taken over, the losers would have beat it
*  and gone wherever they went. But when they abandoned these cities that were independent still,
*  they all left, both the guys that won and the guys that lost the war. So it couldn't be just
*  as simple as spoils go to the victor. It's such a wide area. Not everybody was starving like the
*  people in the Copán Valley. So I personally think it was calendrically timed. It is interesting to
*  note that that ninth period, that ninth 400-year period ends right then. And I think a lot of
*  people, I can't prove it archaeologically, but I think a lot of people said, we're coming to the
*  end of a great cycle and we need to renew. We need to change what we're doing. When you talk to the
*  Maya today, like at the end of this 2012 thing, if you actually talk to Maya, say, you know,
*  what happens at the end of a big cycle here? They say cycles are a time of renewal and transformation,
*  that it is all of our obligation to change our lives at the end of cycles, that change is coming.
*  We can either be part of it or we can get steamrolled by it. The Aztecs did this neat
*  thing called the New Fire Ceremony. Every 52 years, which was the biggest their calendar would go,
*  they'd burn down perfectly good temples and they'd burn down their houses sometimes. And they would
*  just, everybody in society would perform this, what they called the New Fire Ceremony, and they
*  would renew the world. So I think my personal theory is that the Maya decided at the end of
*  the 9th Bakhtun that it was time to renew the world. I think this theory makes sense because
*  they really internalized the calendar. I mean, it was a really big part of their culture, the
*  sense of the cyclical nature of civilization. That's what I think. I think that they created
*  that calendar to perceive the cycle and to harmonize with it.
*  Yeah. You mentioned the Aztec. What was the origin of the Aztec? Where did these people come from,
*  what time and how? You know, almost every one of the cultures we're talking about now,
*  we have two different versions of the answer to that question. We have the archaeology version
*  and we have the Aztecs themselves. The Aztecs have this wonderful migration story where they say
*  that they came from a place well to the north called Aslan and that they had this migration
*  that went through kind of a hero's journey where they go to this snake mountain place and they
*  encounter the birth of the war god that they'll worship after this and how they stepped into the
*  Valley of Mexico as the last, the lost brothers of everyone in the Valley of Mexico. They said that
*  they all came from the north near Aslan as a place, a cave with seven different passages called
*  Chiquimostoc and that all the people who spoke the language Nahuatl came from the cave and most of
*  them went early to the Valley of Mexico and in the Aztecs story, they were just the lost tribe.
*  They were the last brothers to come in. But then they show up late game and they become mercenaries.
*  They just start working for communities in the Valley of Mexico and this takes place
*  in the 1300s. So about 200 years before Cortez shows up, the Aztecs show up to the Valley of Mexico
*  and they make themselves this indispensable group of mercenaries. They do the dirty work.
*  All the civilized communities around Lake Texcoco, which is now Mexico City, it's all tried up.
*  But those guys were too civilized to fight with each other, but they could hire the Aztecs to do
*  their dirty stuff. So the Aztecs did that and really changed the politics in the game of the
*  Valley of Mexico. The dirty stuff, so they're the muscle. Yeah. They'd go in and they'd kill
*  whoever you wanted killed and now you're the king of this area. So one of these kings that
*  they were working for really liked them and decided, I'm going to make the Aztecs part of our
*  ancestry. I'm going to give them my daughter to marry the head of the Aztecs.
*  And the Aztecs sacrificed her and that really pissed that guy off. So he took like his whole
*  army and ran the Aztecs out for a while. They say they live in this horrible desert section,
*  eating lizards. But then one of their priests say, we're going to walk around the lake. And
*  my visions say that where we see an eagle sitting on a cactus with a snake in its mouth is where we
*  will build our capital. And they see that, but it's out on an island in the lake. And he said,
*  well, I don't know, that's the place. So they build up an island, they go to that island,
*  and then they just start piling up Lake Muck until they make a whole city there in the middle of the
*  island. They make, or the lake, they make an island city. And all of this occurs in about
*  a hundred years. So they show up about 1300. The capital of Tenochtitlan, as they called it,
*  is really established. And from there, they quickly take over the entire valley.
*  They make what they call the Triple Alliance, which is the two other big communities of the
*  lake are now their allies, but they're not really allies. The Aztecs were brutal. They were just,
*  those guys agreed to shut up and let the Aztecs run the show.
*  And then the Aztecs spread like a wildfire all the way down into the Maya area. Everywhere they go,
*  they rename everybody's towns and make them pay tribute. Pretty short lasting civilization,
*  spread extremely quickly, famous. What are some defining qualities that explain that?
*  I think they were very much like, they had an attitude like Attila the Hun. They just had no
*  problem ripping your skin off. Everybody else had become too comfortable and too civilized.
*  And the Aztecs were just mercenary. They told everybody, you know, we can either rip your heart
*  out or you can work for us. And if you work for us, you'll be just fine. They'd go to every town
*  they'd go to. The first thing they'd do is they'd show up with a bunch of merchants. There was a
*  merchant class who were also military. They were really the people who assessed where they were
*  going to attack next. They'd go in with a bunch of Aztec products and say, we'd like to trade with
*  you. But all the time they were assessing their military prowess, what products they had that
*  they could take. And then soon after the Pochteka were there would come the military with the
*  reconnaissance. So the Aztec had a huge warrior class, as you're saying. So what was there just,
*  can you linger on their whole relationship with war and violence?
*  They worshiped a war deity. Their main temple was the Templo Mayor. It had two temples up on top.
*  One was Tlaloc the rain god, who liked a lot of sacrifice himself. But then the other one was
*  Weesilaposhle. That translates the hummingbird on the left. But he's the war god. I love that
*  he's a hummingbird. Maybe he's fast and he comes from the magical side or something.
*  Then right next to the temple on either side were the two temples of the warriors. One was
*  the Eagle Warrior clan. The other one was the Jaguar Warrior clan. And they were symbolically
*  in competition with each other, though a unified force. I guess probably an analogy between the
*  Navy and the Air Force. They had a good-natured competition of who was better, but they were the
*  same force. So those were their symbolic warriors dressed up in all of their finery.
*  And they would come at people with these two forces. And it was very unlike
*  anything that had happened before in Mesoamerica. Again, I think I could draw a parallel to what
*  happened in Europe. The famous Henry V moment in Agincourt where his kind of
*  ragtag army wipes out half of France's aristocracy with the longbow. Up until that moment,
*  Europe had a very wars for the elite classes kind of attitude. And then after France lost half their
*  aristocracy, then I was like, maybe we should be hiring from the villages. The same sort of thing
*  happened with the Aztec that there was a... Mesoamerica really didn't have huge standing armies,
*  but the Aztec put this army together and they intimidated people. They didn't actually have to
*  use it a lot. It was used to great effect in the Valley of Mexico. And for the rest of Mesoamerica,
*  it was mostly the fear factor. But there also seemed to be a celebration of violence. I think you said
*  that beauty and blood went hand in hand for the Aztec. Maybe like the Roman Empire, they just had
*  a different relationship with violence, where that stood in the purpose of life,
*  purpose of existence. Is that fair to say? I would hypothesize so. I think it's one of the
*  wonderful things about studying these ancient cultures, knowing what our human capacity is.
*  And the Aztecs, when I said that statement, what I meant by that is there were
*  what I meant by that is they were absolutely comfortable with human sacrifice and ripping
*  people's hearts out. They had this just grotesque violent bent, but in the same way, they also
*  absolutely loved flower gardens and poetry and music and dance. The same Aztec king who would
*  order the hearts of a thousand people extracted also would stand up at dinner parties to recite
*  his own poetry or the poetry of famous statesmen that had come before him. And they spent money on
*  things like flower gardens. All of the causeways leading to the Aztec capital had beautiful flower
*  gardens. And they had a museum and they had an aquarium and a zoo and they had an opera and they
*  had a ballet. And these things existed together. There was not in the Aztec mind any conflict
*  between witnessing someone's heart getting ripped out one moment and the evening we'd go to the ballet.
*  How does that contrast the relationship with war and violence with the other civilizations of
*  Mesoamerica and South America, maybe the Maya? What was their relationship like with war?
*  The Maya were certainly influenced by the Aztec at the end. So we get a skewed perspective from
*  the contact period accounts because the Maya were much more violent and sacrifice oriented in their
*  post-classic rendition. But in the classic period, it was mostly the priests and the king who were
*  doing the sacrificing of themselves. We know that the Maya kings would cut their penises and then
*  bleed that blood onto paper. And the paper would burn and become the smoke through which they'd
*  commune with their ancestors. But they'd actually tie this paper onto their penis, cut it,
*  and then dance. So the blood splattered. But it was them cutting themselves. It was different than
*  killing a bunch of other people for it. It was an auto-sacrifice, we call it. Still very macabre,
*  but very different than deciding a whole bunch of other people should die. It was a self-sacrifice
*  thing. Can you speak to sacrifice a bit more? Animal sacrifice, human sacrifice. What role did
*  that play in the Maya, for the Aztec, for the different cultures here? Was that religious in
*  nature? It was absolutely religious in nature. And the Aztecs were of the opinion that the war god
*  demanded people were captured and sacrificed. And it had to be valuable people. There was a lot of,
*  before they made that big standing army, they had just ritual battles that they would have,
*  and they'd take captives. In fact, all around Mesoamerica, they wanted captives so that they
*  could bring them back and sacrifice them for the gods. And the Aztecs deciding to specifically
*  follow the war god did this more than anybody. They did it so much and so successfully that they
*  didn't have any enemies nearby. So they decided this one poor sucker group, not that far away,
*  called the Tlaxcalans, that they were never going to make peace with them so that they could go
*  close by every year and just have a little symbolic war with the Tlaxcalans and haul them back
*  for a sacrifice. Cortes met those guys and he was like, here are people who hate their guts.
*  I'll just use these guys. So we say, oh, Cortes took over the Aztec world. It was Cortes and 20,000
*  super pissed off Tlaxcalans. And they actually sacrifice what? So there would be these ritual
*  battles or is it chopping off people's heads? Is there some interesting rituals around the sacrifice?
*  It's mostly heart extraction, sometimes heads, but they bring them up on top of the temple so
*  everybody can see it. And they had a specific stone where they would bend them over so their
*  rib cage would come out. And they'd use a thick obsidian knife and they had a really just
*  tried and true way to do it. They'd stab it in a certain place close and then they'd push down on
*  the sternum as they ripped up on the rib cage. So they just make a place where they could just
*  rip it right out. With their hand. Yeah, with their hand. But they were really just surgical
*  about it. They'd use a thick obsidian knife where they could just break the ribs right along the
*  sternum and then push the sternum down, pull up and just. While the person was alive?
*  Yep. While the person was alive. And the Aztecs had this idea, like there was a horrible drought
*  that went on that almost ruined the entire valley. And they came to this conclusion that
*  it's because we haven't been killing enough people. We've got to bump this up. And then when
*  they did and they decided they really took it out on the Tlaxcalaans, it rained again. So it was
*  proof positive that they should just keep doing that. And they ate people as well. They really did.
*  As part of the sacrifice or is this? After the sacrifice, then they would eat them. And this was
*  part of the drought and the famine thing that started. But then it was just kind of the thing
*  to do. When Cortez got there, they were still having certain special feasts that involved humans.
*  And it really upset the Spanish that they would be like tricked into eating human. Like,
*  hey, you liking dinner? That was a human. So the idea, was it actually
*  having a taste for human flesh or is it just these kinds of ideas of like if you eat a person's heart
*  that you can get their spirit and their strength? In the case of the Aztecs, it seemed like they just
*  liked it. This guy Sahagun, who was a very responsible chronicler, was pretty specific.
*  There was a distribution thing. The elites got butts. The butts were the best part.
*  So the butt cheeks, those are the best parts to eat. And then it went down the chain until
*  some people just got like fingers and toes. Literally bought taste for the Aztecs.
*  They really did. They really did. In fact, that's what caused the, have you heard of the Noche
*  Trieste, the sad night? The night that the Aztecs really go nuts on the Spanish and kick them out.
*  It's all triggered by this one guy, Pedro de Alvarado, who's left in charge by Cortez.
*  As Cortez goes to the coast and tries to talk to the new force, talk them into being for him,
*  which he does. But Pedro Alvarado is left back in town in charge and they're doing another one of
*  these huge Aztec buffets and parties to honor them. And it happens. The guy says, you know,
*  hey, do you like dinner? Like, oh yeah, it's a nice dinner. Well, it's humans. You're eating
*  humans. See, I told you they were good. And Alvarado just freaks out and he has the guards
*  close the doors and he murders everyone in the party. Women, children, nobody has weapons.
*  He just murders everyone. And that's what spazzes the Aztecs out to eventually murder Montezuma,
*  who was their captive, and then try to murder all of them. And it was all Pedro Alvarado's fault for
*  freaking out about eating humans. Just a little practical joke.
*  Yeah, it was just, they thought it was funny. He did not.
*  That's fascinating. I didn't realize it. So I kind of assume that some level of
*  cannibalism would have to do with, you know, eating the heart to gain the spirit of the person or
*  something like this. In certain like, you know, deer hunting rituals things for sure. But the
*  Aztecs, no, they just liked eating humans. It was part of the fear factor too. I mean,
*  they could walk into a new town and be like, you guys could either send us, you know, a number of
*  Quetzal feathers every month, or we could eat you. So that's psychological warfare and actual warfare.
*  It worked. And that's how they spread. And they were just about to take over the
*  Maya when the Spanish came and messed everything up. They had the Maya surrounded and they were
*  about to take over the whole Yucatan. So you think without the Spanish,
*  there would be this Aztec empire that would last for a very long time?
*  I think there would have been an Aztec empire. I think they would have finished dominating
*  everybody, but they did it through hate. And everybody hated the Aztecs. So it wouldn't
*  have lasted forever. They did not, they were not ruling justly. They were ruling by force. And that
*  can only go on so long before revolution happens. The Inca empire, I think that would have gone on
*  forever because they were really community oriented. Once the Inca took over, like no one
*  in the Inca empire starved. They built architecture. Everyone was safe. It was a society that could have
*  lasted a long time. What was the origin of the Inca empire? Well, it was bloody at first, like
*  most of them are. But once they started taking over, what they did is they empire built.
*  Everybody else had just raided their neighbors to get the resources, but everybody they raided,
*  they turned them into the Inca empire and they created this incredible
*  metas system where you took turns working. And they created the road system so they could get
*  groups of workers back and forth. So a town of let's say 5,000 people, the Inca would roll up
*  with an army of 100, 200,000 people and say, you know, would you guys like to be part of the empire
*  or would you like us to escort you to the edge of the empire? And if your mayor here agrees,
*  then he can have a town, he can have a house in Cusco. But then the very next month, a big work
*  crew would show up and they'd start building agricultural terraces and storage units. And
*  every month with the agricultural excess, they would have big parties and everybody would eat.
*  So people lived well in the Inca empire. It was a rough beginning, but everybody who agreed to be
*  part of it immediately had access to a whole bunch of resources and security they never had.
*  So they started in South America and Peru and Cusco. Cusco was like the center of it.
*  Cusco in their language, Quechua, it means naval or belly button. And it's up in the mountains.
*  But there's four quarters that they called their empire Tiwantinsuyu, the land of four quarters.
*  And the center of those four quarters was Cusco. It sprung to life in like 1200 AD.
*  Yeah, we backwards project what it was, but it was probably
*  mid 1200s when the first Sapa Inca, the first ruler came in. But it was the,
*  I think it's the ninth one is Pachacute, who really started being an empire builder.
*  And part of that, I mean, what really defined the empire? As you said,
*  roads, they build a massive road network.
*  Roads and in the same way that the Roman strategy of building roads and infrastructure,
*  and then every place they took over, they'd create certain key pieces of Roman architecture
*  that kind of made that city Roman and they'd rename it something. The Inca did the same thing.
*  They had certain signature Inca architecture that they would build in as the administrative
*  part. They'd send the Kipu Kamaik, the guys who would weave the, or not the Kipus,
*  as accountants. And they would go through and say what everybody did, okay, you're a good farmer,
*  you're going to farm. You are a good weaver, you're going to weave. All the men here are going to take
*  a turn at being part of the army. And they sent independent Kipu Kamaiks to that. Every community
*  had like five or six that were not allowed to work with each other and they all had to independently
*  send their Kipus back to Cusco. And if there were accounting discrepancies, they were called to
*  Cusco to figure out who was lying about what. So there's like a super sophisticated record
*  keeping system. Yeah. And that was the Kipu. And the Spanish recorded what they could and then
*  burned them all. But that's an interesting development for an empire because that allows
*  you to really expand and have some kind of management, some level of control. Yeah,
*  they couldn't. At the end, they were at least 10 million people and there was just no way to do
*  that without some sort of sophisticated record keeping system. If the Inca had to face Aztec,
*  Kuens. Inca? Inca. I mean, the Aztecs were psychotic, but the Inca had just reserves for
*  miles. And they had that essential hearts and minds. There was only one thing that everybody
*  got pissed off about when they joined the Inca empire. For some reason, everything was owned
*  communally except the llamas. The llamas were the kings. And so that was one thing that like,
*  some of them would stay in town just to be work llamas, but you don't own your llama anymore.
*  And people are really attached to their llamas. To this day, they are like family members. So it
*  would be like everybody walked in and said, everybody's family dog is now mine. It really
*  upset people on an emotional level. Well, I mean, so llamas got domesticated at some point,
*  probably early. I don't even know when, but early on.
*  We have rock art that progresses to make it see like a progression from people depicted hunting
*  them to people depicted standing next to pregnant ones. So it was still in that archaic period,
*  at least that they became friends. Yeah, but if you roll in and you own them, that's...
*  Yeah, that pissed everybody off. For some reason, the Inca owned everybody's llama instantly,
*  and he would take anything he wanted. A lot of them would just get carted away that day,
*  just sent to Cusco. They'd also take their mummies. That was a weird thing. Everybody
*  mourns they're dead, but the Inca just like ceased to accept it. They would just, the mummies were
*  still there. Okay, he's dead, but look, he's still got clothes. He's at the party. Let's put a beer
*  in front of him. They just kept people as mummies. And so the ancestral mummies of every town,
*  part of the being absorbed into the empire was, okay, your most important mummies are now gonna
*  have their own beautiful house in Cusco, but they would physically bring those mummies to Cusco
*  to make now Cusco the spiritual heart of their belief system.
*  I mean, I can see how that would piss people off, but it's also a pretty powerful way to
*  say like the ancestors that you idolize, that you respect are now in the capital.
*  They've been elevated. We didn't steal them. We have given them a new place of honor, and you're
*  welcome to come visit them all the time. And they did. They have these festivals where everyone from
*  all corners of the Inca world would come to Cusco. And which of the civilizations mummified people?
*  Is it? The Incas for sure mummified people and even did some of that kind of like Egyptian-esque
*  taking out of organs and preparing the body. They'd put like straw inside the cavity and mummify them.
*  But the Maya didn't do it at all. The Maya, in fact, on purpose would flood tombs with water
*  so that the skin would float off the skeletons faster. And then they'd get back in there.
*  It was jungly, so I think the bugs probably had part of it too. But then they would get back in
*  there to get the bones. They'd open it back up and take the bones out and paint them with red cinnabar.
*  The one that I was in in Copan, we had evidence that they had gone in there four different times.
*  And the last couple of times they only took the skull out and repainted it and then put it back
*  in, articulated on the skeleton. But they didn't mummify. They on purpose would like grossly float
*  the bodies so they could get the skin off faster and get to the bones. But would they keep the
*  bones? Yeah, they'd keep the bones. And they'd pull the bones out occasionally and do rituals
*  to them or commune with them and then put them back in. So there's still a deep connection to
*  the ancestors through the physical manifestation of the ancestors then, whether mummified or bone.
*  And to this day, if you do an excavation here in the United States, Native American people don't
*  like it. They don't like their graves, which is fine enough. I wouldn't want somebody digging up
*  my grandma either. But the Maya, they love it. Every Maya person, if we find a grave, they're like,
*  yeah, look at that, bones, cool, can I touch? Yeah, great. They're not spooked about it at all. They
*  think it's exciting. I one time helped out a physical anthropologist in town in Copan
*  to get an osteology collection together of various animals. So if we got bones from
*  an excavation, we could see what kind of animal it was based on the collection.
*  And this family said, well, our family dog died last year and buried him in the backyard. You go
*  dig him up. And so we were like, okay, yeah, I mean, we do need a dog. We'll go dig up your dog.
*  They were like, but the kids really want to help you. So their kids came out. And this was like
*  their puppy. And it died less than a year ago when we got to it. One of them just
*  grabbed up a bone and he was like, way, see, see, see, those like little bitty bones. Yeah.
*  Like, what a weird attitude. That's your dead dog there. But they just, they have a different
*  relationship with the dead. It's some sense. That's a beautiful attitude, right? Yeah. Why
*  pretend like we're not mortal and there's not this is just the process of it. And it's kind of,
*  as you say it now, kind of will be cool. That's what Day of the Dead is all about. And I love
*  Day of the Dead. You know, Halloween's this creepy thing where they're all monsters,
*  but Day of the Dead is this beautiful time where we remember our ancestors. I convinced my kids
*  after the movie Coco came out. Now we have an altar with all of our great grandparents on the
*  altar and we talk about who they were and how they lived. And we put things on the altar that
*  mattered in their life. And we remember them on that day. And it's turned something that was a
*  weird eat too much candy and wear a monster mask thing into something beautiful where we discuss
*  where we came from. I have to ask about the giant stones that Inca has been able to somehow move
*  and fit together perfectly. Do you understand? Is it understood how they were able to do that so well?
*  No.
*  The moving of it, I think that we have reasonable theories. There are ways to pivot large weights.
*  There's a great guy named Wally Wallington, a retired contractor here in the US,
*  who built Stonehenge in his backyard in Minnesota single-handedly, showing how
*  you can move big stones. So I think Wally's already figured out how to move them. It's the
*  perfectly fit, so carefully fit together that you couldn't even put a dime in between the stones.
*  That's the one that I think still has people baffled. The common archaeological wisdom that
*  you'd find out of a textbook is that they just kept packing away at it with hammer stones and
*  setting them and resetting them until they were perfect, which has to be bullshit. That is,
*  there is no way that they just were that meticulous. I mean, everybody's got a hammer
*  stone. I personally think it's acids. I think they melted them together. And there are weird
*  places when you really look at closely to these stones, which I've done a number of times. I'm
*  going back next month to Machu Picchu and especially Cusco. I walk around in the alleys where these
*  500 to 1,000 year old walls are still there. And I see things like the crystals in the Andesite
*  are almost stitched together along the seams. The Andesite around it is melted and the crystals
*  haven't. And there are other places where there are weird wipes on the wall. It's just melted
*  like somebody took a rag and wiped it while it was soft. Lots of talk about soft stones turning hard
*  to. I haven't been able to prove it. This is one of these end of my archaeological career chapters.
*  I'm either going to prove myself wrong or prove it. But I think they used acids. My dad's a chemist
*  and he told me a long time ago that there's no way, there's no naturally occurring acids.
*  But my current theory, actually I got the idea initially from the show Breaking Bad. I don't
*  know if you ever saw that show, but there's a point in which they're trying to dissolve a body
*  and they're using hydrofluoric acid and it goes right through the ceiling.
*  That hydrofluoric acid is so fascinating. It won't go through plastic and you can also bring it
*  in inert parts and then combine it. The Inca made tons of jewelry out of fluorite. Fluorite is big
*  in the Andes and they also mined a lot of things for gold and silver and the byproduct of that
*  mining is sulfuric acid. You put sulfuric acid and fluorite together and it's hydrofluoric acid
*  and that will burn through andesite or anything. If you learned how to do it judiciously and you
*  didn't care whether servants lost an arm or two, then you could actually use them to fuse
*  these together. I think they're fused together. I asked the city of Cusco if I could take some
*  core samples and they said, go away gringo, don't touch our walls.
*  So this actually, this next time I'm going to go try to talk to the
*  more Quechua authorities in a place called Olayun-Taitambo and maybe I can convince them.
*  But right now they just think I'm a weird-ass gringo who wants to put holes in their walls.
*  It's a fascinating theory. How could you get to the bottom of that?
*  So getting core samples and see if there's some kind of trace?
*  Chemists I'm working with say that if there was hydrofluoric acid in between these,
*  a core sample right along the seam, they can separate out the elements in there and detect
*  whether there was actually elements of hydrofluoric acid. I wanted to go straight to burning rocks,
*  but they were like, no, we already know that's true. Yeah, we can burn some rocks, but
*  it would happen. That's just chemistry. We got to prove that it would happen in the walls. So go get
*  us samples. That was before COVID and all sorts of, you know how it is. You probably are the same guy
*  where you've got a thousand ideas and the ones that are fruitful you run with and the other ones
*  you'll get back to. That would be fascinating if true and I hope you do show that it's true or
*  follow either one. I'll try to disprove it. I wonder if we discount how much amazing stuff
*  a collection of humans can do. Because it just feels like if a large number of humans are just
*  working a little bit, chipping away at stuff at scale, they can do miraculous things. So the
*  question is how can a large number of humans be motivated to do a thing? Because when we think
*  about like Stonehenge or some very challenging architectural construction, we don't think about
*  a large number of humans working together. Well, you know, that large number of humans
*  are motivated to work together by a small number of administrators who are dynamic and convincing
*  in some way or another. One of my favorite quotes is, and I'm probably going to misquote it here,
*  but I think it's Margaret Mead who said, never underestimate the power of small groups working
*  together. And the truth is that those are the only people that have ever changed the world.
*  That small dedicated groups of people are what change the world.
*  And they inspire big groups of people to embrace their vision.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I think we sometimes underestimate how much humans can do across time.
*  And we are way less capable than we used to be. I mean, the average human had all sorts of skills
*  that at least I personally do not. You know, I'm wearing a shirt, but I can't make a shirt.
*  That's for somebody else to do.
*  You've also lectured about, which I really enjoyed, about North America, and also helped teach me that
*  there was a lot more complex societies going on here for a long period of time. So maybe
*  can we start at the beginning, who were the early humans in North America?
*  Well, we go through that Paleo-Indian and archaic period for thousands of years. As we started
*  this conversation, probably 30,000 years as a conservative now, humans first entered the Americas.
*  But the first cultures we get here are mound builders around the Mississippi into the East,
*  and then also a totally separate group in what we call the American Southwest now,
*  the Four Corners, who will develop into mostly the people we call the Pueblo people,
*  who are still there today, like Zuni and Hopi people. So we've got these two clusters.
*  The very first major community in North America is in the most unlikely place. It's in Northern
*  Louisiana. People think I'm crazy when I say this, but there is a pyramid in Northern Louisiana,
*  a big one at a site called Poverty Point, that is 3500 years old. So it's the same age as the
*  pyramids in Egypt. And it is a giant thing just poking out of the bayous of Louisiana.
*  And people don't believe me when I say it, but it's there.
*  The mound builders. What was that society like in comparison to everything else we've been talking
*  about in Mesoamerica? They evolved over thousands of years. We call them mound builders. This is
*  something I object to. I think we should have a better... The last version of them we call the
*  Mississippians now. But generally speaking, we call all these guys mound builders. But what they
*  built were pyramids. They look like mounds now. And they didn't build them out of stone. That's
*  kind of our just inherent Western bias. Something that's built out of stone is sophisticated, and
*  something that's built out of dirt is rudimentary. But in their full living form, they did have cores
*  of dirt, but then they also had kind of clay caps. So they had terraces. They had whole complexes of
*  buildings up on top. There were kings that lived up there. The biggest of the Mississippian cities
*  is called Cahokia. And it's right outside of St. Louis. And it was huge. It had a population
*  of 20,000 people and pyramids all over the place, a huge palisade wall around it. It was absolutely
*  gigantic, a thriving metropolis. And we in America have kind of a collective amnesia. We never hear
*  about these massive civilizations. Cahokia was the big first city, but then it spread
*  from the Mississippi all the way to the Atlantic. There were hundreds and hundreds of these big
*  cities that had five to 10,000 people each. Were they their own thing, or is there some kind of
*  thread connecting all of them? They had a unified religion and culture. They were, again, not an
*  empire. So they were warring city states. They were kind of territories that were owned by big
*  kings. And then the cities around them were kind of the subsidiary lords and kings. And then one
*  kingdom could either ally with a neighbor or have a fight. So they were kind of countries,
*  I think, for, yeah, we could safely say there were different countries within this patchwork
*  that was eastern United States. And it's so weird that we don't know this because
*  it was clearly documented by the Spanish. I'm not talking about just archaeology. We find them in
*  archaeology now. But Hernando de Soto landed in Florida and went for three years from, he went
*  up into the Carolinas and over down into Alabama and Louisiana. And he's the first one to see the
*  Mississippi up there. But for three years, he went through city after city after city, unfortunately
*  decimating them, eating all their corn, giving them diseases. But the documentation is clearly
*  there. He met collectively millions of people in a very sophisticated and uniform civilization.
*  So it was disease and stealing of resources, but was there like explicit murdering going on?
*  Unfortunately, yeah. He was a murderer and a psycho and a liar. He snowed them that he was some kind
*  of deity, actually learned a trick from the Inca who he was with Pizarro in his first run and
*  went back to Spain, was rich, had a wife, a castle. Then he got bored and he decided to
*  have a reign of terror on Northern America for three years. But he had people burned at the stake.
*  He had his dogs rip them apart. He was very, very brutal. He ruled that area through fear and had
*  absolutely no respect for anybody. He made promises and broke them all the time. He was really,
*  he was a brutal man.
*  So this whole period when Christopher Columbus came, how did that change everything?
*  Well, you know, there's a great anthropological body of literature. It's called the Colombian
*  Exchange based on Columbus, but it's all this trade back and forth between the New World and
*  the Old World. And the Old World got just wonderful stuff. All of a sudden their diet didn't suck.
*  All these vegetables came in. The New World got herd animals. It got pigs and cows and goats that
*  it didn't have, but it also got 13 infectious diseases. Europe had had wave after wave and
*  kind of had herd immunity on a lot of things, but it didn't actually go away. It just couldn't
*  spread like a wildfire through the community. So when they arrived to the Americas, all of a sudden
*  these just, a pile of horrible diseases hit people. I think in the first 20, 30 years,
*  there were people who had contracted multiple deadly diseases at once and died of them. But
*  the numbers, you know, it's a shameful part of history and it wasn't something that Europe
*  perpetrated on them. The medical science at that time was still the Four Humors theory,
*  that people were made of yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm. And we did things like,
*  well, you've got to bleed him. He'll feel better then. So we had no idea what an infectious disease
*  was, but the reality was that this horde of diseases hit everyone. And the numbers are now
*  saying in the first 50 years that 90% of everybody was dead and that the number of people has
*  increased as well. As far as our estimates, we're thinking it's somewhere around 150 million people.
*  And 90% of them died. And with them all their knowledge, just, I mean, imagine the moment where,
*  you know, who dies when things get bad? It's the young and the old. So all the knowledge keepers
*  die suddenly. The children die. This next generation that's half taught and now completely
*  demoralized thinking that this is a spiritual attack, that their gods hate them, that the only
*  way out of it is to accept this new Christianity. But they, you know, they don't have bring kids
*  into this world where everybody's dying. And even if they do, they can't teach them what the old
*  people were going to teach them because the old people are gone and didn't finish the transmission.
*  So in a single terrible moment in human history, you know, the generation loses all their knowledge.
*  So a lot of the things that these people knew just blipped out. But with that also just the
*  wisdom of the entire civilizations. So much of what they knew was just lost at that moment.
*  We have the Maya who had those hieroglyphs and that we've learned a lot from that. Yeah,
*  but not a significant integration of that wisdom into. So it wasn't when the Europeans came,
*  it wasn't like the cultures were integrated. It was a story of domination over race share.
*  In North America, there's a new term in the literature that I like. We call it the
*  Mississippian Shatter Zone. That Mississippian civilization was millions of people, but they
*  got spread out all over the place over the next centuries. And now we have this Shatter Zone where
*  we have ruins and the people that were actually from those ruins are somewhere else on a
*  reservation far away. And I'm just about to talk to a Cherokee man who listened to some of the
*  things I had to say and says, all those Ho-Chunk things you were saying from that Ho-Chunk culture,
*  my grandparents talk about this sort of thing too. Can I talk to you by phone and tell you
*  about these things? So we've got this Shatter Zone where we're going to try to put the piece
*  the puzzle back together, especially in terms of Mississippian religion. I really think we're
*  making headway in this generation and it's exciting to be part of piecing this old religion and its
*  mythology back together. Just as a lot of people kind of refer to Christopher Columbus as the
*  person who discovered America, I read that the Vikings reached North America much earlier in
*  1000 CE. And why do you think they didn't expand and colonize?
*  Because they got their ass kicked. It's the truth. It is absolutely true that the Vikings were here.
*  There's a great site in Nova Scotia called Lensoul Meadows, which definitely has what's left of a
*  Viking colony. It was Leif Erikson and his father, Eric the Red, who they got kind of kicked out of
*  Europe because they apparently couldn't stop murdering people. And so they went to Greenland
*  and then kind of island hopped over to Canada. But I think the culture that was in that area
*  was named the Dorset, but they would have nothing to do with the Vikings. They attacked the Viking
*  settlement every day and did not give them an inch until they decided it was just worthless
*  and they left it. The Vikings attacked Ireland and they just found a bunch of monasteries full
*  of gold with a bunch of guys going, we're men of God, we don't fight. And the Vikings were like,
*  this is great. That's great. This will be easy then. We'll just loot all these Easter eggs.
*  But the Native Americans in Canada were like not having it. They kicked their ass. In fact,
*  Leif Erikson's brother, Thor, died there. The natives killed him. He was supposed to be in
*  charge of expanding the settlement, but they just killed him. So a lot of the Native American
*  cultures were also, I mean, they're sophisticated warring cultures also. Yes, they fought,
*  especially the Mississippians. Boy, they were tough. And so were the Five Nations, the Mohawk,
*  the Huron. The ones that kicked the Vikings' ass up there, they were probably Algonquin
*  speakers, but they were connected just above the Great Lakes. But they were all very tough people.
*  RG When you think about the Spaniards and the Portuguese and the over 100 million people that
*  were killed, do you see that as a tragedy of history or is it just the way of history?
*  I think that the epidemics, I consider it a tragedy. That did not have to happen.
*  And that was not a fair fight. Nobody knew what to do about it. There was just a tragic,
*  perfect storm of events. I think that the Spanish and the Portuguese get unfairly maligned in what's
*  been called the black legend that they just marched into America and murdered everyone.
*  That's not the fact. It was the diseases that murdered everyone. In fact, there was a really
*  poignant story I read of a Spanish priest in the Amazon, in the Brazilian northern part of the
*  Amazon where he made this utopian community and he was bringing people in that were getting sick.
*  He wrote, you know, I'm baptizing everyone. I have baptized 10,000 people a day,
*  and yet God's still killing them. Why is he doing this to them? They're doing everything
*  that I asked them to do. They are submitting to the will of God. But this guy doesn't realize
*  that the same bowl of holy water that he's baptizing them in, he's just wiping the disease
*  on everybody's faces. He's accelerating it when he doesn't even realize. He thinks he's saving them,
*  but he's actually killing them. That's a tragedy. That's not just like spoils go to the victor
*  stuff. That's just straight up tragedy. Yeah. But that one is hard to know what to do with
*  black death. Infections, they don't operate on normal human terms. They just go through
*  entire populations. Back to wild ideas. All right. Just by style.
*  I mean, we didn't really talk about how life originated on earth or how humans have evolved.
*  We did talk about that there could be just a lot of stuff in ancient history we haven't even
*  uncovered yet. Do you think it's possible that other intelligent civilizations from outside of
*  earth, aliens, ever visited? You had me right until the ever visited thing. That one I'm not
*  entirely sure about. I'm not sure whether we have any, we certainly have no archeological proof that
*  I would cite or contemplate as the evidence of such. But the guys that discovered DNA,
*  Watson and Crick, Watson, who actually habitually used hallucinogens to invigorate his thinking,
*  he said that he thought that DNA on this planet was way too complex to have developed over the
*  time period that it had at its disposal and that his guess was that our DNA was somehow seeded from
*  outside of our planet. Take that for what it is, but the guy who we respect on many other levels
*  also said that. So that's interesting. But in terms of aliens visiting us, I don't know. It does
*  smack of a kind of human hubris that we think were important enough for some advanced species
*  to give a shit about us. Statistically speaking, the universe is way too big. We can't be the only
*  sentient beings. There's got to be somebody else out there. Whether they care about us,
*  that's a question. I've been on ancient aliens a number of times. I show up and I'm an educator.
*  Refusing to be part of the conversations, an immediate fail in my book.
*  But there was one time where they asked me at the end, do you have anything else
*  that you want to say? And I said, well, you know,
*  y'all's premise is that aliens came down a long time ago and they gave humanity these wonderful
*  gifts of science and medicine, engineering, all these things. Today, we also have a lot of
*  uh, stories of the aliens coming down, but now all they're doing is mutilating cows and
*  sodomizing rednecks. Like whatever we did, we super pissed them off apparently.
*  The quality of the gifts has decreased rapidly. Um, what it's an interesting thought you've
*  mentioned. What archeologically would you have to see to be like, this might be an alien?
*  Technology that doesn't belong there. First and foremost, I mean, you know, we got to,
*  if we just run with the premise that somebody was capable of making a vehicle
*  that could get them from somewhere far away to here, that was almost certainly mechanical.
*  Now I, you know, I love the aliens thing where, you know, biomechanical is something that,
*  that certainly could be, and that would, you know, that, that would disintegrate. We wouldn't see
*  that at all, but I would expect some kind of, uh, technology that, that showed up out of the blue
*  and changed things. That would be something. Um, but, but I would think, you know, mechanical
*  or, you know, a substance that's not from here. But of course we would only see the results of
*  that mechanical, you mean like literally a mechanical thing, right? Some sort of thing
*  like that. Uh, the typical thing people say is like, you know, how did they move these
*  giant stones? Right. But, you know, just, just look at that on the face for a second.
*  Aliens come from across the universe to meet humans. And the thing they tell them is how to
*  move rocks. Are you fucking kidding me? I mean, you know, like, give them, give them antibiotics
*  or a combustion engine or something. You're going to, they should, they came across the universe and
*  they showed them how to move big rocks. I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
*  That just doesn't make any sense. What do you think earth will look like
*  10,000 years from now? That's an interesting question.
*  I think it will be a lot more automated or, or it'll be a smoldering pile. I mean,
*  there is a possibility we could end ourselves. There's always that possibility that we've really
*  opened Pandora's box in some regards. I did listen to one of your podcast guests with the,
*  what would happen in the case of nuclear war. That was chilling. Her opinion was certainly
*  we would burn everything to a crisp within minutes, apparently. So we have that capacity.
*  That's scary. That's a possible future for us, but I'm an optimist. I, you know,
*  I'd like to think that guys like you are going to make friendly robots who make my job better.
*  But a thousand, 10,000 years is a long time and technology is improving and becoming more advanced
*  rapidly. And the rate of that improvement is increasing ever more. So that,
*  that's the part that frightens me actually. I don't know. Does that frighten you?
*  Yes. Terrifying.
*  You know, I, I, I heard somebody say, I forget who it was, but you know,
*  systems of any kind, human systems, biological systems can be put on a graph that's change over
*  time. And any graph that the change is way faster than the time and the, and the,
*  the line starts going straight up. That is a system in crisis in almost any biological system
*  that has that fast a change over that little a time. You would, any, any other thing,
*  you'd describe it as a crisis. When you apply that chart to technologies change, it's a crisis.
*  From that perspective, absolutely. But I also have a faith in human ingenuity that we humans
*  like to create a really difficult situation and then come up with ways to get out of that difficult
*  situation. And in so doing innovate and create a lot of awesome stuff and sometimes cause a lot
*  of suffering, but on the whole, an average, make a better world. But yeah, if it, you know,
*  with nuclear weapons, the bad stuff might actually lead to the death of everybody.
*  I guess there's always that, that chance, but I am an optimist. I, you know, I think you're an
*  optimist too. I think exactly as you just said, I think that the greatest capacity of humans is our
*  ability to innovate and we are never more innovative than when we're under distress.
*  I think that a lot of the developments of humans over the last thousands of years have been about,
*  you know, we didn't, we didn't change the world when we were comfortable.
*  It was when we were in crisis, mother necessity is the mother of invention. And I think we'll be
*  all right. I think that this impending climate crisis is real and happening. I actually
*  personally think that I'm going to, I'm going to answer a question that you didn't even ask me.
*  I think we're wasting our time thinking that we can reverse this.
*  We're delusional. I'm all for electric cars and, you know, being good stewards of the environment,
*  but we are wasting our time, not technologically adapting to what's about to happen.
*  We're spending too much time pretending, you know, the average American thinks if we all just drive
*  electric cars, we'll be okay. That's bullshit. That's not going to happen. We need to start
*  making technologies that desalinize water, that a host of things that, that we need to use our
*  technological capacity to accept it and adapt instead of Pollyanna thinking we can make it go
*  away. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of accept that the world will change and a lot of big problems will arise
*  and just develop technology that addresses them. I think you have some,
*  some guys that have their finger on the pulse there. We need to start thinking about how we're
*  going to survive this, not that we're going to make it go away. And that just arrived, thrive.
*  Again, we're pretty innovative in that regard, but if some catastrophic thing happens,
*  or we just leave this planet, what, what do you think would be found by
*  aforementioned alien civilizations when they visit the anthropologist, the grad student
*  anthropologist that visit earth and study how much of what we now have and love and think of
*  as human civilization will be lost, do you think? Well, you know, time moves on and things that are
*  perishable perish. So, you know, you didn't put a time element in there, but I would say that,
*  you know, everything that can perish will and whoever shows up here will be stuck with only
*  the things that didn't perish. So we'll have, you know, buildings, plaques, but they won't have any
*  books. They won't have any, you know, billboards. They'll have the incomplete record I have.
*  I one time did a talk in Sioux Falls and I said, you know, I drove in here and there was a big
*  obelisk in front of the town and everywhere I go, I see the names Lewis and Clark. And a thousand
*  years from now, if I was an archeologist investigating this place, I would think that
*  it was founded by the Egyptians and their kings were named Lewis and Clark. But the truth is,
*  you know, Lewis and Clark stayed one night here, but it's just a big deal. So I would be so wrong
*  about what I thought about your town based on what preserved.
*  It's so beautiful as a thought experiment. Like what would archeologists be really wrong about
*  and what would they could possibly be right about?
*  Washington DC was clearly made by a combination of the Egyptians and the Greeks and the Romans
*  because that's what all the architecture is.
*  Yeah. And would they be able to reconstruct the important empires,
*  the powerful empires and the warring empires?
*  For that matter, have me and my colleagues done that at all? I'm almost certain that the Maya
*  would just gut laugh at what I think I know what they were.
*  I wonder, do you ever think about like what we just as a human civilization are wrong about
*  the most like mainstream archeology? Just like a suspicion, what could we get completely wrong?
*  Well, one way to get something wrong is totally like lost civilization, like an obviously gigantic
*  civilization that was there along with the Maya or something like this in the 10,000 years ago.
*  There's certainly that there could be things that were either wiped away or still hiding
*  under the oceans that would completely change the way we think about things.
*  And everybody knew they existed and everybody interact with them.
*  I think it's our estimation of their motivations that we're probably most wrong on.
*  My teacher, Shealy, a long time ago said, I've come up with all sorts of theories. I was always
*  thinking about stuff. And she looked at me and she said, if you don't stop thinking like a
*  Western European and start trying to put yourself in the mindset of these people, you will never
*  understand any of it, which I've always taken to heart. I mean, I really do. When I approach
*  these things, I try to step out of my cultural assumptions, try to think like they would think
*  is the best I could. And it's very different. I mean, this whole, the Maya are cyclical.
*  The whole sacrifice, we're so obsessed with that. But that wasn't an austere actual sacrifice on
*  their part. They weren't just, hey, let's all get together and kill that guy that's pissing us off.
*  They were like giving the best of them. There was a different mentality. This was not brutal. This
*  was a bona fide sacrifice on their part, a loss. Plus the whole mystery of the puppy that eventually
*  starts having sex with his... I tell you, that one, I'm going to unweave that one one of these days.
*  Now, that puppy appeared on Pottery. All over Pottery. He's everywhere. I got to write this
*  book. This next year is the year I'm going to write my Fang Deity book and I will have a whole
*  chapter dedicated to the puppy. Thank you. The mystery solved. I mean, it could just be the
*  birth of memes of humor. I don't know. I mean, again, humor, you don't know what the nature of
*  their humor, of what their jokes are. Oh, that's a neat one too. And that's so human. I'll tell you
*  a little side story here that when I worked with the Maya people in Palenque, I spent three years
*  making this map of the city and hiking through the jungle every day. They would talk to each
*  other in their own language. It was... Seltal was the group I was working with. But I noticed
*  after a while, they were big jokers. They loved to make jokes and they would laugh at jokes,
*  but then they would also, one of them would say something and the other ones would go,
*  hoo hoo. And I eventually asked, you know, what is that? Why do you guys always make that hoo hoo
*  noise? And they said, that's cause he made a really smart pun. It was like he said three
*  different things at once. It was a turn of phrase that was smart. And they didn't make laughs at
*  that. It was there, they had a noise for when somebody said something just super clever.
*  So there's also that, like, you know, just clever turn of speech.
*  Yeah, wit.
*  And I think about that when I'm a hieroglyphic translator. Like, here's a beautiful thing that's
*  gonna be like a poem or a political statement. And I'm just ploddingly looking in a dictionary
*  of what that word means. There's probably double, triple, untandres all through this text. And the
*  real meaning is the subtext. And I'm thinking they're talking about corn and they're talking
*  about the nature of life. Yeah, it could be satire. It could be, you know, as it was in the
*  Soviet Union, when there's a dictator, maybe there's an overpowering king, you're not allowed to
*  actually speak. You have to hide the thing you're actually trying to say in the subtext. So, and all
*  of that. There was a funny Maya ceramic that had the ceramics are neat because they don't, the
*  the monuments can be kind of broken records. I'm the king. I was born this time. I beat these
*  people up. I married this woman. I died. But the ceramics will tell us, like, things out of
*  mythology stories. And there was this one with a rabbit looking at the merchant god,
*  and nobody could translate the text. And finally, this Eastern European, actually a Ukrainian guy,
*  Ukrainian guy, translated it. And the rabbit saying to the merchant god, bend over and smell my ass.
*  It's like, oh, man, we were expecting this wonderful piece of mythology. But no,
*  it translates bend over and smell my ass. That's great. That's human.
*  As we mentioned previously, human nature does not change. You mentioned applying can mapping it.
*  It's just out of curiosity. What is that process like? It seems fascinating.
*  Oh, it was a it was a great adventure. I loved it. But it was it was difficult. I woke up every
*  morning thinking I will be hurt today. Somehow. I don't know how. I don't know how badly where
*  on my body it will occur. But it's going to happen because it was the jungle.
*  So in the jungle, what's what's the process like? What do you have to do to map it?
*  Well, it was tricky, too, because it was also a national forest. So the forestry department
*  didn't want us to cut down anything more than we had to. So we basically just cut tunnels through
*  the foliage. And I would we'd map everything twice. The first thing we do is I'd go in,
*  find a building, draw it on a piece of graph paper. And I'd say like, you know, you guys go north,
*  you guys go east, west, find other buildings. And when you find them, pace back to this one.
*  And so I'd start making a map and I'd make the whole one piece of graph paper was enough to then
*  we bring the machine in. We bring the laser theodolite and get really accurate information. But
*  on that piece of paper, I would write like, don't bring the machine this way, there's a tree fall
*  or stand on top of this building and you'll see four different buildings at once from this one.
*  And all of this is in dense jungle.
*  Right. And the deeper we got off the road, the deeper it was. Sometimes it would clear out,
*  but certain places if it was low, it would be such thick vegetation and it would grow back so fast.
*  Sometimes we would cut just tunnels through tall grass and we'd come back like five days later
*  and they were gone. Like we couldn't even find where our trails were. They would grow back that
*  fast. But you see the building so you could see. Right. And that was the fun part. I mean,
*  sometimes it would just be like a little neighborhood with little low buildings,
*  no bigger than this table. But sometimes, just five more meters in and I'm standing under a
*  pyramid that nobody had ever mapped. Like, wow, I've just found another one. And some days,
*  on good days, we'd find three pyramids. And I felt that's such a more exciting job than the typical
*  excavations. My buddies were all just in a hole for the whole week in the middle of the city and
*  where I'm dancing around through the jungle. I could find 10 buildings today. I might find a
*  pyramid today. Who knows? What's that feel like to find like a pyramid or buildings that you're one
*  of the only humans that are not from that civilization to ever see this thing? What's that feel like?
*  It's great. I love that feeling. I'm an explorer at heart. So, finding something like that.
*  When I was 25 years old, I found a whole Maya city. I got to name it. Its name is Moshnah. It's
*  off in the Belizean jungle. And that was just outrageous. I mean, it almost had that one,
*  almost depressed me. I had this great life ambition that I would find a lost city.
*  And then I did it at 25. And I was like, God, now what do I do? I thought that was supposed
*  to take me my whole life. I actually wrote a bunch of letters to NASA trying to get them to let me
*  be the first archeologist on Mars. I never got a single reply back. I'm sure I'm on NASA's list,
*  as some weirdo. How'd you find a Mayan city? I used a topography map of the area and I played
*  the game. If I was a Maya, where would my favorite place to live in this big area be? I looked for
*  the biggest mountain because they call all of their pyramids, tun, wheat, stone mountains.
*  I knew they loved mountains. And when I found that mountain, there were two others right next to it
*  that made a triangle. And they love those triads and there were rivers in between them. And I
*  thought, that's it. That's where I would build the city. And I hiked out there over two seasons
*  with students. The other grad students were like, he's just having his students just wander in the
*  jungle all day. But I came back with the city. So given that you've looked into the deep past
*  of humanity, what gives you hope about our future? Maybe our deep future of this human civilization?
*  That's a good one. And I do have hope. I do have hope. I believe in the spirit of humankind. I,
*  as a person who have studied history, I kind of feel like history does kind of a sine wave. There's
*  highs and there's lows, but no matter how low we go, we get up again and we climb. And I think that
*  humanity will continue that. We will rise to the challenges. Now, some of the challenges may be
*  created by ourselves as well, but we will adapt and overcome. That's what we do.
*  Yeah. Humans find a way, right? That's the thing you see with history. When the
*  empires collapse, the humans that come out of that, they pick themselves up and find another way.
*  They build a new thing. And the people I study believe in the cyclical nature of life, that you
*  really can't, life can't continue without death being part of the cycle. We get our lows, we get
*  our highs, but the cycle continues forever. I should mention that you have a lot of great lectures
*  on the great courses, but you have also an amazing podcast, RKO Ed. If people want to listen to it,
*  this is a tough question, but what would you recommend, what episodes should they listen to?
*  What's the answer? Oh, that is a tough question. What is the sampling? You know, it's like asking
*  a chef, like, what's the best stuff on the menu? Well, different strokes for different folks. You
*  know, I do two different things on that podcast. Sometimes I just teach about cultures that you've
*  never heard about. I love, I start off by saying it's my podcast and I'll talk about whatever the
*  heck I want to talk about. Sometimes I talk about really specific things like a tool type or an
*  animal type, but my favorite ones have become when I just tell my stories of my adventures.
*  I've got a lot of weird adventure stories and it's been fun and they've been very well received.
*  I've got, you know, I can put my humor in there and I can talk about, you know, the things that
*  went right, the things that went wrong, the adventures that I had are all part of this
*  RKO Ed thing. And RKO Ed is kind of a double entendre. It's me, I'm just Ed, but it's also
*  education. You know, what I'm really trying to do with this too, it's specifically the Americas.
*  I want to be part of the reawakening that there were these great civilizations here,
*  especially North America. I think that we have a group amnesia that there was no great civilizations
*  here before Europe showed up. That's simply not true. I think it should be part of our
*  history books. In fact, I have a program called Before the Americas that would introduce as part
*  of American history, the part before European contact. And I think that kids in the K through
*  12 levels should grow up not being told this fallacy that no one was here before we showed up in
*  1492. And one of these days, I'm going to find a funder to help us put together Before the Americas
*  and we're going to make it part of the curriculum for every kid in the US to know the full history
*  of this country. That's a great project. Ed, thank you so much. Thank you for talking today.
*  Thank you for all the fascinating ideas that you put out into the world. And I can't wait to hear
*  your new course. Thank you so much, Lex. It was a real pleasure. Thanks for listening to this
*  conversation with Ed Barnhart. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the
*  description. And now let me leave you with some words from Joseph Campbell. Life is but a mask,
*  worn on the face of death. And is death then but another mask? How many can say, asks the Aztec
*  poet, that there is or is not a truth beyond? Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
