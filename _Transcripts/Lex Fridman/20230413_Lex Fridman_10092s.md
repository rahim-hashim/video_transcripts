# Max Tegmark: The Case for Halting AI Development | Lex Fridman Podcast #371
**Lex Fridman:** [April 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfceTsD0A)
*  A lot of people have said for many years that there will come a time when we want to pause a little bit.
*  That time is now.
*  The following is a conversation with Max Tegmark, his third time in the podcast. In fact,
*  his first appearance was episode number one of this very podcast. He is a physicist and
*  artificial intelligence researcher at MIT, co-founder of Future Life Institute,
*  and author of Life 3.0, Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. Most recently,
*  he is a key figure in spearheading the open letter calling for a six-month pause on giant
*  AI experiments like training GPT-4. The letter reads, We're calling for a pause on training of
*  models larger than GPT-4 for six months. This does not imply a pause or ban on all AI research and
*  development or the use of systems that have already been placed on the market. Our call
*  is specific and addresses a very small pool of actors who possess this capability. The letter
*  has been signed by over 50,000 individuals, including 1,800 CEOs and over 1,500 professors.
*  Signatories include Joshua Benjio, Stuart Russell, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Yuval Noah Harari,
*  Andrew Yang, and many others. This is a defining moment in the history of human civilization,
*  where the balance of power between human and AI begins to shift. Max's mind and his voice
*  is one of the most valuable and powerful in a time like this. His support, his wisdom,
*  his friendship has been a gift I'm forever deeply grateful for. This is the Alex Friedman Podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,
*  dear friends, here's Max Tagmark. You were the first ever guest on this podcast, episode number
*  one. So first of all, Max, I just have to say thank you for giving me a chance. Thank you for
*  starting this journey. It's been an incredible journey. Just thank you for sitting down with me
*  and just acting like I'm somebody who matters, that I'm somebody who's interesting to talk to.
*  And thank you for doing it. That meant a lot. Thanks to you for putting your heart and soul
*  into this. I know when you delve into controversial topics, it's inevitable to get hit by what
*  Hamlet talks about, the slings and arrows and stuff. And I really admire this. It's in an era
*  where YouTube videos are too long and now it has to be like a 20-minute TikTok, 20-second TikTok
*  clip. It's just so refreshing to see you going exactly against all of the advice
*  and doing these really long-form things and that people appreciate it. Reality is nuanced.
*  And thanks for sharing it that way. So let me ask you again the first question I've ever asked on
*  this podcast, episode number one, talking to you. Do you think there's intelligent life out there
*  in the universe? Let's revisit that question. Do you have any updates? What's your view
*  when you look out to the stars? So when we look out to the stars,
*  if you define our universe the way most astrophysicists do, not as all of space,
*  but the spherical region of space that we can see with our telescopes from which light has a time
*  to reach us since our Big Bang, I'm in the minority. I estimate that we are the only life
*  in this spherical volume that has invented internet, radio, has gotten to our level of tech.
*  If that's true, then it puts a lot of responsibility on us to not mess this one
*  up. If it's true, it means that life is quite rare and we are stewards of this one
*  one spark of advanced consciousness, which if we nurture it and help it grow,
*  eventually life can spread from here out into much of our universe and we can have this just
*  amazing future. Whereas if we instead are reckless with the technology we build and just snuff it out
*  due to stupidity or infighting, then maybe the rest of cosmic history in our universe is just
*  going to be a play for empty benches. But I do think that we are actually very likely to get
*  visited by aliens, alien intelligence, quite soon. But I think we are going to be building that alien
*  intelligence. So we're going to give birth to an intelligent alien civilization, unlike anything
*  human, the evolution here on earth was able to create in terms of the path, the biological path
*  it took. Yeah, and it's going to be much more alien than a cat or even the most exotic animal
*  on the planet right now, because it will not have been created through the usual Darwinian competition
*  where it necessarily cares about self-preservation, is afraid of death, any of those things.
*  The space of alien minds that you can build is just so much vaster than what evolution will give you.
*  With that also comes great responsibility for us to make sure that the kind of minds we create are
*  the kind of minds that it's good to create, minds that will share our values and be good for humanity
*  and life, and also create minds that don't suffer. Do you try to visualize the full space of alien
*  minds that AI could be? Do you try to consider all the different kinds of intelligences,
*  generalizing what humans are able to do to the full spectrum of what intelligent creatures,
*  entities could do? I try, but I would say I fail. I mean, it's very difficult for a human mind
*  to really grapple with something so completely alien, even for us. If we just try to imagine,
*  how would it feel if we were completely indifferent towards death or individuality?
*  Even if you just imagine that, for example,
*  you could just copy my knowledge of how to speak Swedish, boom, now you can speak Swedish,
*  and you could copy any of my cool experiences and then you could delete the ones you didn't like in
*  your own life, just like that. It would already change quite a lot about how you feel as a human
*  being, right? You probably spend less effort studying things if you just copy them and you
*  might be less afraid of death because if the plane you're on starts to crash, you'd just be like,
*  oh, shucks, I haven't backed my brain up for four hours, so I'm going to lose that.
*  I'm going to lose all these wonderful experiences on this flight. We might also start feeling
*  more compassionate maybe with other people if we can so readily share each other's experiences and
*  our knowledge and feel more like a hive mind. It's very hard though. I really feel very humble
*  about this, to grapple with it, how it might actually feel. The one thing which is so obvious
*  though, which I think is just really worth reflecting on is because the mind space of
*  possible intelligence is so different from ours, it's very dangerous if we assume they're going
*  to be like us or anything like us. Well, the entirety of human written history has been
*  through poetry, through novels, been trying to describe through philosophy, trying to describe
*  the human condition and what's entailed in it. Like Jessica said, fear of death and all those
*  kinds of things, what is love, and all of that changes if you have a different kind of intelligence.
*  The entirety, all those poems, they're trying to sneak up to what the hell it means to be human.
*  All of that changes. How AI concerns and existential crisis sees that AI experiences,
*  how that clashes with the human existential crisis, the human condition. That's hard to
*  fathom, hard to predict. It's hard, but it's fascinating to think about also. Even in the
*  best case scenario where we don't lose control over the ever more powerful AI that we're building to
*  other humans whose goals we think are horrible and where we don't lose control to the machines
*  and AI provides the things we want. Even then you get into the questions you touched here.
*  Maybe it's the struggle that it's actually hard to do things is part of the things that give this
*  meaning as well. For example, I found it so shocking that this new Microsoft GPT-4 commercial
*  that they put together has this woman showing this demo of how she's going to give a graduation
*  speech to her beloved daughter and she asks GPT-4 to write it. It was freaking 200 words or so. If
*  I realized that my parents couldn't be bothered struggling a little bit to write 200 words and
*  outsource that to their computer, I would feel really offended actually. I wonder if
*  eliminating too much of the struggle from our existence,
*  do you think that would also take away a little bit of what-
*  Means to be human, yeah. We can't even predict. I had somebody mention to me
*  that they started using Chad GPT with a 3.5 and not 4.0 to write what they really feel to a person.
*  And they have a temper issue and they're basically trying to get Chad GPT to rewrite it in a nicer
*  way, to get the point across but rewrite it in a nicer way. So we're even removing the inner
*  asshole from our communication. There's some positive aspects of that, but mostly it's just
*  the transformation of how humans communicate. And it's scary because so much of our society
*  is based on this glue of communication. And if we're now using AI as the medium of communication
*  that does the language for us, so much of the emotion that's laden in human communication,
*  so much of the intent that's going to be handled by outsource AI, how does that change everything?
*  How does that change the internal state of how we feel about other human beings?
*  What makes us lonely? What makes us excited? What makes us afraid? How we fall in love?
*  All that kind of stuff. Yeah. For me personally, I have to confess the challenge is one of the
*  things that really makes my life feel meaningful. If I go hike a mountain with my wife, May,
*  I don't want to just press a button and be at the top. I want to struggle and come up there
*  sweaty and feel, wow, we did this in the same way. I want to constantly work on myself to
*  become a better person. If I say something in anger that I regret, I want to go back and really
*  work on myself rather than just tell an AI from now on, always filter what I write so I don't have
*  to work on myself because then I'm not growing. Yeah. But then again, it could be like with chess.
*  An AI once it significantly, obviously supersedes the performance of humans,
*  it will live in its own world and provide maybe a flourishing civilizations for humans,
*  but we humans will continue hiking mountains and playing our games even though AI is so much smarter,
*  so much stronger, so much superior in every single way, just like with chess.
*  That's one possible hopeful trajectory here is that humans will continue to human
*  and AI will just be a kind of
*  a medium that enables the human experience to flourish. Yeah.
*  I would phrase that as rebranding ourselves from homo sapiens to homo sentience. Right now,
*  sapiens, the ability to be intelligent, even put it in our species name,
*  we're branding ourselves as the smartest information processing entity on the planet.
*  That's clearly going to change if AI continues ahead. Maybe we should focus on the experience
*  instead, the subjective experience that we have with homo sentience and say that's what's really
*  valuable, the love, the connection, the other things. Get off our high horses and get rid of
*  this hubris that only we can do integrals. So, consciousness, the subjective experience
*  is a fundamental value to what it means to be human. Make that the priority.
*  That feels like a hopeful direction to me, but that also requires more
*  compassion, not just towards other humans because they happen to be the smartest on the planet,
*  but also towards all our other fellow creatures on this planet. I personally feel right now we're
*  treating a lot of farm animals horribly, for example, and the excuse we're using is, oh,
*  they're not as smart as us. But if we admit that we're not that smart in the grand scheme of things
*  either in the post AI epoch, then surely we should value the subjective experience of a cow also.
*  Well, allow me to briefly look at the book, which at this point is becoming more and more
*  visionary than you've written, I guess, over five years ago, Life 3.0. So, first of all, 3.0. What's
*  1.0? What's 2.0? What's 3.0? And how's that vision evolve, the vision in the book evolve to today?
*  Life 1.0 is really dumb like bacteria in that it can't actually learn anything at all during
*  the lifetime. The learning just comes from this genetic process from one generation to the next.
*  Life 2.0 is us and other animals which have brains which can learn during their lifetime a great deal.
*  You were born without being able to speak English and at some point you decided, hey,
*  I want to upgrade my software. Let's install an English speaking module. So you did. And Life 3.0,
*  which does not exist yet, can replace not only its software the way we can, but also its hardware.
*  And that's where we're heading towards at high speed. We're already maybe 2.1 because we can
*  put in an artificial knee pacemaker, etc. And if Neuralink and other companies succeed,
*  we'll be Life 2.2, etc. But what the company's trying to build AGI or trying to make is, of
*  course, full 3.0. And you can put that intelligence in something that also has no
*  biological basis whatsoever. So less constraints and more capabilities.
*  Just like the leap from 1.0 to 2.0. There is, nevertheless, you speaking so harshly about
*  bacteria, so disrespectfully about bacteria. There is still the same kind of magic there
*  that permeates Life 2.0 and 3.0. It seems like maybe the thing that's truly powerful
*  about life, intelligence and consciousness was already there in 1.0. Is it possible?
*  I think we should be humble and not be so quick to
*  make everything binary and say either it's there or it's not. Clearly, there's a great spectrum.
*  And there is even a controversy by whether some unicellular organisms like amoebas can maybe
*  learn a little bit. After all, so apologies if I offend any bacteria here. It wasn't my intent.
*  It was more that I wanted to talk up how cool it is to actually have a brain where you can learn
*  dramatically within your lifetime. Typical human.
*  The higher up you get from 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0, the more you become the captain of your own
*  ship, the master of your own destiny, and the less you become a slave to whatever evolution gave you.
*  Upgrading your software, we can be so different from previous generations and even from our parents,
*  much more so than even a bacterium. No offense to them.
*  And if you can also swap out your hardware and take any physical form you want, of course,
*  it's really the sky's the limit.
*  It accelerates the rate at which you can perform the computation that determines your destiny.
*  Yeah. And I think it's worth commenting a bit on what you means in this context. Also,
*  if you swap things out a lot, this is controversial. But my
*  current understanding is that life is best thought of not as a bag of meat or even a bag of
*  elementary particles, but rather as a system which can process information and retain its
*  own complexity, even though nature is always trying to mess it up. So it's all about
*  processing. And that makes it a lot like something like a wave in the ocean, which is not its water
*  molecules, right? The water molecules bob up and down, but the wave moves forward. It's an
*  information pattern in the same way you Lex, you're not the same atoms as during the first
*  interview you did with me, you've swapped out most of them, but still you. And the
*  information pattern is still there. And if you could swap out your arms and whatever,
*  you can still have this kind of continuity. It becomes much more sophisticated sort of
*  wave forward in time where the information lives on. I lost both of my parents since
*  our last podcast, and it actually gives me a lot of solace that this way of thinking about them
*  they haven't entirely died because a lot of mommy and daddy's, sorry, I'm getting a little
*  emotional here, but a lot of their values and ideas and even jokes and so on, they haven't gone away.
*  Right? Some of them live on, I can carry on some of them. And they also live on a lot of other
*  and a lot of other people. So in this sense, even with life 2.0, we can, to some extent,
*  already transcend our physical bodies and our death. And particularly if you can share your
*  own information, your own ideas with many others like you do in your podcast, then
*  that's the closest immortality we can get with our bio bodies.
*  You carry a little bit of them in you in some sense.
*  Do you miss them? You miss your mom and dad?
*  Of course.
*  What did you learn about life from them? If it can take a bit of a tangent?
*  So many things. For starters, my fascination for math and the physical mysteries of our
*  universe, I think you got a lot of that from my dad. And I think that's what I learned from him.
*  I think my obsession for really big questions and consciousness and so on, that actually came
*  mostly from my mom. And what I got from both of them, which is a very core part of really who I am,
*  I think, is feeling comfortable with
*  not buying into what everybody else is saying, doing what I think is right.
*  They both very much just did their own thing and sometimes they got flack for it and they did it
*  anyway. That's why you've always been an inspiration to me, that you're at the top of your field and
*  you're still willing to tackle the big questions in your own way. You're one of the people that
*  represents MIT best to me. You've always been an inspiration in that. So it's good to hear that
*  you got that from your mom and dad.
*  Yeah, you're too kind. But yeah, I mean, the good reason to do science is because you're
*  really curious. You want to figure out the truth. If you think this is how it is and everyone else
*  says, no, no, that's bullshit. And it's that way, you know, you stick with what you think is true.
*  You stick with what you think is true. And even if everybody else keeps thinking it's bullshit,
*  I always root for the underdog when I watch movies. And my dad once, one time, for example,
*  when I wrote one of my craziest papers ever talking about our universe ultimately being
*  mathematical, which we're not going to get into today, I got this email from a quite famous
*  professor saying this is not only bullshit, but it's going to ruin your career. You should
*  stop doing this kind of stuff. I sent it to my dad. Do you know what he said? He replied with a
*  quote from Dante, follow your own path and let the people talk. Go dad. This is the kind of thing.
*  He's dead, but that attitude is not.
*  How did losing them as a man, as a human being change you? How did it expand your thinking about
*  the world? How did it expand your thinking about, you know, this thing we're talking about,
*  which is humans creating another living sentient perhaps being.
*  I think it mainly did two things. One of them just going through all their stuff after they had
*  passed away and so on, just drove home to me how important it is to ask ourselves why are we doing
*  these things we do? Because it's inevitable that you look at some things they spent an enormous
*  time on and you ask in hindsight, would they really have spent so much time on this? Or
*  would they have done something else? And I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing.
*  Would they have done something that was more meaningful?
*  So I've been looking more in my life now and asking, you know, why am I doing what I'm doing?
*  It should either be something I really enjoy doing or it should be something
*  that I find really, really meaningful because it helps humanity.
*  And if it's in none of those two categories, maybe I should spend less time on it.
*  The other thing is dealing with death up in person like this, it's actually made me less afraid
*  of even less afraid of other people telling me that I'm an idiot, you know, which happens
*  regularly and live my life, do my thing. And it's made it a little bit easier for me to focus on
*  what I feel is really important. What about fear of your own death?
*  Has it made it more real that this is something that happens?
*  Yeah, it's made it extremely real. And I'm next in line in our family now, right? Me and my
*  younger brother, but they both handled it with such dignity. That was a true inspiration also.
*  They never complained about things and, you know, when you're old and your body starts falling apart,
*  more and more to complain about. They looked at what could they still do that was meaningful
*  and they focused on that rather than wasting time talking about or even thinking much about
*  things they were disappointed in. I think anyone can make themselves depressed if they start their
*  morning by making a list of grievances. Whereas if you start your day with a little meditation,
*  the things you're grateful for, you basically choose to be a happy person.
*  Because you only have a finite number of days to spend them.
*  Make it count.
*  Being grateful.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you do happen to be working on a thing which seems to have potentially some of the greatest
*  impact on human civilization of anything humans have ever created, which is artificial intelligence.
*  This is on the both detailed technical level and a high philosophical level you work on.
*  You've mentioned to me that there's an open letter that you're working on.
*  It's actually going live in a few hours. I've been having late nights and early mornings.
*  It's been very exciting, actually. In short, have you seen Don't Look Up, the film?
*  Yes.
*  I don't want to be the movie spoiler for anyone watching this who hasn't seen it.
*  But if you're watching this, you haven't seen it, watch it. Because we are actually acting out.
*  It's life imitating art. Humanity is doing exactly that right now, except
*  it's an asteroid that we are building ourselves. Almost nobody is talking about it.
*  People are squabbling across the planet about all sorts of things which seem very minor compared
*  to the asteroid that's about to hit us. Most politicians don't even have this on the radar.
*  They think maybe in 100 years or whatever. Right now, we're at a fork in the road. This is the most
*  important fork that humanity has reached in its over 100,000 years on this planet. We're building
*  effectively a new species that's smarter than us. It doesn't look so much like a species yet
*  because it's mostly not embodied in robots. But that's a technicality which will soon be changed.
*  This arrival of artificial general intelligence that can do all our jobs as well as us and
*  probably shortly thereafter, superintelligence, which greatly exceeds our cognitive abilities.
*  It's going to either be the best thing ever to happen to humanity or the worst. I'm really quite
*  confident that there is not that much middle ground there.
*  But it would be fundamentally transformative to human civilization.
*  Of course, utterly and totally. Again, we branded ourselves as homo sapiens because it seemed like
*  the basic thing. We're the king of the castle on this planet. We're the smart ones. If we can
*  control everything else, this could very easily change. We're certainly not going to be the
*  smartest on the planet for very long unless AI progress just halts. We can talk more about why
*  I think that's true because it's controversial. Then we can also talk about
*  reasons you might think it's going to be the best thing ever and the reason you think it's going to
*  be the end of humanity, which is of course super controversial. But what I think anyone who's
*  working on advanced AI can agree on is it's much like the film Don't Look Up and that it's just
*  really comical how little serious public debate there is about it.
*  So what we're talking about is the development of currently things like GPT-4 and the signs it's
*  showing of rapid improvement that may in the near term lead to development of super intelligent
*  AI systems and what kind of impact that has on society.
*  Exactly.
*  When that thing achieves general human level intelligence and then beyond that,
*  general superhuman level intelligence. There's a lot of questions to explore here. So one,
*  you mentioned halt. Is that the content of the letter? It's to suggest that maybe we should
*  pause the development of these systems. So I think that's a good question. I think that's a good
*  question. So what's the content of the letter? It's to suggest that maybe we should pause the
*  development of these systems.
*  Exactly. So this is very controversial. When we talked the first time, we talked about how I was
*  involved in starting the Future Life Institute and what we worked very hard on 2014-2015 was the
*  mainstream AI safety. The idea that there even could be risks and that you could do things about
*  it. A lot of AI researchers felt worried that this was too flaky and could be bad for funding
*  and that the people who talked about it didn't understand AI. I'm very, very happy with
*  how that's gone and that now it's completely mainstream. You go to any AI conference and
*  people talk about AI safety and it's a nerdy technical field full of equations and blah, blah.
*  As it should be. But there's this other thing which has been quite taboo up until now,
*  calling for slowdown. So what we've constantly been saying, including myself, I've been biting
*  my tongue a lot, is that we don't need to slow down AI development. We just need to win this race,
*  the wisdom race between the growing power of the AI and the
*  wisdom with which we manage it. Rather than trying to slow down AI, let's just try to accelerate the
*  wisdom. Do all this technical work to figure out how you can actually ensure that your powerful
*  AI is going to do what you want it to do and have society adapt also with incentives and regulations
*  so that these things get put to good use. Sadly, that didn't pan out.
*  The progress on technical AI and capabilities has gone a lot faster than many people thought
*  back when we started this in 2014. Turned out to be easier to build really advanced AI than we thought.
*  And on the other side, it's gone much slower than we hoped with getting
*  policymakers and others to actually put the incentives in place to steer this in the
*  good direction. Maybe we should unpack it and talk a little bit about each. So why did it go faster
*  than a lot of people thought? In hindsight, it's exactly like building flying machines.
*  People spent a lot of time wondering about how do birds fly. But we've been doing this for a long
*  time. People spent a lot of time wondering about how do birds fly. And that turned out to be
*  really hard. Have you seen the TED talk with a flying bird? Like a flying robotic bird? Yeah,
*  it flies around the audience. But it took 100 years longer to figure out how to do that than
*  for the Wright brothers to build the first airplane because it turned out there was a much easier way
*  to fly. And evolution picked the more complicated one because it had its hands tied. It could only
*  build a flying machine that could assemble itself, which the Wright brothers didn't care about.
*  It can only build a machine that'll use only the most common atoms in the periodic table.
*  Wright brothers didn't care about that. They could use steel, iron atoms, and it had to be able to
*  repair itself. And it also had to be incredibly fuel efficient. A lot of birds use less than half
*  the fuel of a remote control plane flying the same distance. For humans, throw a little more
*  money, put a little more fuel in a roof, there you go, 100 years earlier. That's exactly what's
*  happening now with these large language models. The brain is incredibly complicated. Many people
*  made the mistake of thinking we had to figure out how the brain does human level AI first before we
*  could build in the machine. That was completely wrong. You can take an incredibly simple
*  computational system called a transformer network and just train it to do something incredibly dumb.
*  Just read a gigantic amount of text and try to predict the next word.
*  And it turns out if you just throw a ton of compute at that and a ton of data, it gets to be
*  frighteningly good, like GPT-4, which I've been playing with so much since it came out.
*  There's still some debate about whether that can get you all the way to full human
*  level or not. But we can come back to the details of that and how you might get the human level AI
*  even if large language models don't. Can you briefly, if it's just a small tangent,
*  comment on your feelings about GPT-4? Suggest that you're impressed by this rate of progress.
*  But where is it? Can GPT-4 reason? What are the intuitions? What are human interpretable words
*  you can assign to the capabilities of GPT-4 that makes you so damn impressed with it?
*  I'm both very excited about it and terrified. It's an interesting mixture of emotions.
*  All the best things in life include those two somehow.
*  Yeah, I can absolutely reason. Anyone who hasn't played with it,
*  I highly recommend doing that before dissing it. It can do quite remarkable reasoning.
*  And I've had to do a lot of things, which I realized I couldn't do that myself that well,
*  even. And obviously, it does it dramatically faster than we do too when you watch it type.
*  And it's doing that while servicing a massive number of other humans at the same time. At the
*  same time, it cannot reason as well as a human can on some tasks. It's obviously a limitation
*  from its architecture. We have in our heads what in geek speak is called a recurrent neural
*  network. There are loops. Information can go from this neuron to this neuron to this neuron,
*  and then back to this one. You can ruminate on something for a while. You can self-reflect a lot.
*  These large language models, they cannot. GPT-4, it's a so-called transformer,
*  where it's just like a one-way street of information, basically. In geek speak,
*  it's called a feed-forward neural network. And it's only so deep. It can only do logic that's
*  that many steps and that deep. And you can create problems which will fail to solve for that reason.
*  But the fact that it can do so amazing things with this incredibly simple architecture already
*  is quite stunning. And what we see in my lab at MIT when we look inside
*  large language models to try to figure out how they're doing it, that's the key core focus of
*  our research. It's called mechanistic interpretability in geek speak. You have
*  this machine that does something smart. You try to reverse engineer. How does it do it?
*  I think of it also as artificial neuroscience. That's exactly what neuroscientists do with
*  actual brains. But here you have the advantage that you don't have to worry about measurement
*  errors. You can see what every neuron is doing all the time. And a recurrent thing we see again and
*  again, there's been a number of beautiful papers quite recently by a lot of researchers, some of
*  them here in this area, is where when they figure out how something is done, you can say, oh man,
*  that's such a dumb way of doing it. And you immediately see how it can be improved. For example,
*  there was a beautiful paper recently where they figured out how a large language model stores
*  certain facts like Eiffel Towers in Paris. And they figured out exactly how it's stored.
*  The proof that they understood it was they could edit it. They changed some of the synapses in it.
*  And then they asked it, where is the Eiffel Tower? And it said, it's in Rome. And then they asked,
*  you know, how do you get there? Oh, how do you get there from Germany? Oh, you take this train,
*  the Roma Termini train station and this and that. And what might you see if you're in front of it?
*  Oh, you might see the Colosseum. So they had edited it. So they literally moved it to Rome.
*  But the way that it's storing this information, it's incredibly dumb. For any fellow nerds listening
*  to this, there was a big matrix. And roughly speaking, there are certain row and column
*  vectors which encode these things and they correspond very hand wavily to principal
*  components. And it would be much more efficient for sparse matrix just store in the database.
*  And everything so far, we've figured out how these things do are ways where you can see they can
*  easily be improved. And the fact that this particular architecture has some roadblocks
*  built into it is in no way going to prevent crafty researchers from quickly finding workarounds
*  and making other kinds of architectures sort of go all the way. So in short, it's turned out to be
*  a lot easier to build close to human intelligence than we thought. And that means our runway as a
*  species to get our shit together has shortened. And it seems like the scary thing about the
*  effectiveness of large language models, Sam Altman I recently had a conversation with,
*  and he really showed that the leap from GPT-3 to GPT-4 has to do with just a bunch of hacks,
*  a bunch of little explorations with smart researchers doing a few little fixes here
*  and there. So that's some fundamental leap and transformation in the architecture.
*  And more data and more compute.
*  But he said the big leaps has to do with not the data and the compute, but just
*  learning this new discipline, just like you said. So researchers are going to look at these
*  architectures and there might be big leaps where you realize, wait, why are we doing this in this
*  dumb way? And all of a sudden this model is 10x smarter. And that can happen on any one day,
*  on any one Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon. And then all of a sudden you have a system that's
*  10x smarter. It seems like it's such a new discipline. It's such a new, like we understand
*  so little about why this thing works so damn well that the linear improvement of compute
*  or exponential, but the steady improvement of compute, steady improvement of the data
*  may not be the thing that even leads to the next leap. It could be a surprise little hack
*  that improves everything. Or a lot of little leaps here and there because
*  so much of this is out in the open also. So many smart people are looking at this and
*  trying to figure out little leaps here and there. And it becomes this sort of collective
*  race where a lot of people feel if I don't take the leap, someone else will.
*  And it is actually very crucial for the other part of it. Why do we want to slow this down? So
*  again, what this open letter is calling for is just pausing all training of
*  systems that are more powerful than GPT-4 for six months. Just give a chance
*  for the labs to coordinate a bit on safety and for society to adapt, give the right incentives
*  to the labs. Because you've interviewed a lot of these people who lead these labs and you know
*  just as well as I do that they're good people. They're idealistic people. They're doing this
*  first and foremost because they believe that AI has a huge potential to help humanity.
*  But at the same time, they are trapped in this horrible race to the bottom.
*  Have you read Meditations on Moloch by Scott Alexander?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, it's a beautiful essay on this poem by Ginsburg where he interprets it as being about
*  this monster. It's this game theory monster that pits people against each other in this race to
*  the bottom where everybody ultimately loses. And the evil thing about this monster is even though
*  everybody sees it and understands, they still can't get out of the race. A good fraction of
*  all the bad things that we humans do are caused by Moloch. And I like Scott Alexander's naming
*  of the monster so we humans can think of it as a thing. If you look at why do we have overfishing,
*  why do we have more generally the tragedy of the commons, why is it that to live or
*  to die, I don't know if you had her on your podcast.
*  Yeah, she's become a friend.
*  Great. She made this awesome point recently that beauty filters that a lot of female
*  influencers feel pressure to use are exactly Moloch in action again. First, nobody was using them
*  and people saw them just the way they were. And then some of them started using it
*  and becoming ever more plastic fantastic. And then the other ones that weren't using it started to
*  realize that if they want to just keep their market share, they have to start using it too.
*  And then you're in a situation where they're all using it and none of them has any more market
*  share or less than before. So nobody gained anything, everybody lost and they have to keep
*  becoming ever more plastic fantastic also. But nobody can go back to the old way because it's
*  just too costly. Moloch is everywhere and Moloch is not a new arrival on the scene either. We humans
*  have developed a lot of collaboration mechanisms to help us fight back against Moloch through
*  various kinds of constructive collaboration. The Soviet Union and the United States
*  did sign the number of our arms control treaties against Moloch who is trying to stoke them into
*  unnecessarily risky nuclear arms races, etc. And this is exactly what's happening on the AI front.
*  This time it's a little bit geopolitics, but it's mostly money where there's just so much
*  commercial pressure. If you take any of these leaders of the top tech companies,
*  if they just say, this is too risky, I want to pause for six months, they're going to get a lot
*  of pressure from shareholders and others. We're like, well, if you pause, but those guys don't
*  pause, we don't want to get our lunch eaten. And shareholders even have the power to replace the
*  executives in the worst case. We did this open letter because we want to help these
*  idealistic tech executives to do what their heart tells them by providing enough public pressure on
*  the whole sector to just pause so that they can all pause in a coordinated fashion. And I think
*  without the public pressure, none of them can do it alone, push back against their shareholders,
*  no matter how good hearted they are. Because Moloch is a really powerful foe.
*  So the idea is to, for the major developers of AI systems like this, so we're talking about
*  Microsoft, Google, Meta, and anyone else? OpenAI is very close with Microsoft now,
*  and there are plenty of smaller players. For example, Anthropic is very impressive. There's
*  Conjecture. There's many, many, many players. I don't want to make a long list to leave anyone out.
*  For that reason, it's so important that some coordination happens,
*  that there's external pressure on all of them, saying you all need the pawns.
*  Because then the researchers in these organizations, the leaders who want to slow down a little bit,
*  they can say to their shareholders, everybody's slowing down because of this pressure,
*  and it's the right thing to do. Have you seen in history their examples where it's possible to pause
*  the Moloch? Absolutely. Human cloning, for example, you could make so much money on human cloning.
*  Why aren't we doing it? Because biologists thought hard about this and felt like this is
*  way too risky. They got together in the 70s in the Silimar and decided even to stop a lot more stuff
*  also, just editing the human germline, gene editing that goes into our offspring, and decided
*  let's not do this because it's too unpredictable what it's going to lead to. We could lose control
*  over what happens to our species. So they paused. There was a ton of money to be made there.
*  So it's very doable, but you need a public awareness of what the risks are and the broader
*  community coming in and saying, hey, let's slow down. Another common pushback I get today is we
*  can't stop in the West because China, and in China undoubtedly they also get told we can't slow down
*  because the West, because both sides think they're the good guy. But look at human cloning.
*  Did China forge ahead with human cloning? There's been exactly one human cloning that's actually
*  been done that I know of. It was done by a Chinese guy. Do you know where he is now? In jail.
*  And you know who put him there? The Chinese government. Not because Westerners said China,
*  look, this is... No, the Chinese government put him there because they also felt
*  they like control. The Chinese government, if anything, maybe they are even more concerned
*  about having control than Western governments have no incentive of just losing control over
*  where everything is going. And you can also see the Ernie bot that was released by I believe Baidu
*  recently. They got a lot of pushback from the government and had to rein it in in a big way.
*  I think once this basic message comes out that this isn't an arms race, it's a suicide race
*  where everybody loses if anybody's AI goes out of control, it really changes the whole dynamic.
*  I'll say this again because this is a very basic point I think a lot of people get wrong.
*  Because a lot of people dismiss the whole idea that AI can really get very superhuman
*  because they think there's something really magical about intelligence such that it can
*  only exist in human minds. Because they believe that, I think it's going to get to just more or
*  less GPT-4++ and then that's it. They don't see it as a suicide race. They think whoever gets that
*  first, they're going to control the world, they're going to win. That's not how it's going to be.
*  And we can talk again about the scientific arguments for why it's not going to stop there.
*  The way it's going to be is if anybody completely loses control and you don't care if
*  someone manages to take over the world who really doesn't share your goals,
*  you probably don't really even care very much about what nationality they have. You're not
*  going to like it. It's much worse than today. If you live in a Orwellian dystopia, what do you care
*  who created it, right? And if it goes farther and we just lose control even to the machines,
*  so that it's not us versus them, it's us versus it. What do you care who created this
*  unaligned entity which has goals different from humans ultimately and we get marginalized,
*  we get made obsolete, we get replaced. That's what I mean when I say it's a suicide race.
*  We're rushing towards this cliff, but the closer to the cliff we get, the more scenic the views are
*  and the more money there is there. So we keep going, but we have to also stop at some point,
*  quit while we're ahead. It's a suicide race which cannot be won, but the way to really benefit from
*  it is to continue developing awesome AI a little bit slower so we make it safe and we can keep
*  it doing the things that humans want and create a condition where everybody wins.
*  Technology has shown us that geopolitics and politics in general is not a zero-sum game at all.
*  So there is some rate of development that will lead
*  us as a human species to lose control of this thing and the hope you have is that there's some
*  lower level of development which will not allow us to lose control. This is an interesting thought
*  you have about losing control. So if you are somebody like Sunder Prachai or Sam Altman at
*  the head of a company like this, you're saying if they develop an AGI, they too will lose control of
*  it. So no one person can maintain control, no group of individuals can maintain control.
*  If it's created very, very soon and is a big black box that we don't understand,
*  like the large language models, then I'm very confident they're going to lose control.
*  But this isn't just me saying it. Sam Altman and Demis Asabis have both said,
*  they themselves acknowledge that there's really great risks with this and they want to slow down
*  once they feel it gets scary. But it's clear that they're stuck in this. Again, Moloch is forcing
*  them to go a little faster than they're comfortable with because of pressure from
*  just commercial pressures. To get a bit optimistic here, of course, this is a problem that can be
*  ultimately solved. To win this wisdom race, it's clear that what we hoped was going to happen
*  hasn't happened. The capability progress has gone faster than a lot of people thought and the
*  progress in the public sphere of policymaking and so on has gone slower than we thought.
*  Even the technical AI safety has gone slower. A lot of the technical safety research was kind
*  of banking on that the large language models and other poorly understood systems couldn't get us
*  all the way, that you had to build more of a kind of intelligence that you could understand.
*  Maybe it could prove itself safe, things like this. I'm quite confident that this can be done
*  so we can reap all the benefits, but we cannot do it as quickly as this out of control
*  express train we are on now is going to get the AGI. That's why we need a little more time,
*  I feel. Is there something to be said with like Sam Almond talked about, which is while we're in
*  the pre-AGI stage, to release often and as transparently as possible to learn a lot.
*  So as opposed to being extremely cautious, release a lot. Don't invest in a closed development
*  where you focus on AI safety. While it's somewhat dumb, quote unquote, release as often as possible.
*  And as you start to see signs of human level intelligence or superhuman level intelligence,
*  then you put a halt on it. Well, what a lot of safety researchers have been saying for many years
*  is that the most dangerous things you can do with an AI is first of all, teach it to write code.
*  Because that's the first step towards recursive self-improvement, which can take it from AGI to
*  much higher levels. Okay. Oops, we've done that. And another thing, high risk is connected to the
*  internet, let it go to websites, download stuff on its own and talk to people. Oops, we've done
*  that already. You know, Elias Joukowsky, you said you interviewed him recently, right? Yes. He had
*  this tweet recently, which gave me one of the best laughs in a while. He was like, hey, people used
*  to make fun of me and say, you're so stupid, Elias, because you're saying you have to worry.
*  Obviously, developers, once they get to really strong AI, the first thing you're going to do is
*  never connect it to the internet, keep it in a box where you can really study it. So he had written
*  it in the meme form. So it was like, then, and then that, and then now. LOL, let's make a chatbot.
*  And the third thing, Stuart Russell, amazing AI researcher. He has argued for a while that
*  we should never teach AI anything about humans. Above all, we should never let it learn about
*  human psychology and how you manipulate humans. That's the most dangerous kind of knowledge you
*  can give it. Yeah, you can teach it all it needs to know about how to cure cancer and stuff like
*  that. But don't let it read Daniel Kahneman's book about cognitive biases and all that. And then,
*  oops, LOL, you know, let's invent social media. I'll recommend our algorithms, which do exactly
*  that. They get so good at knowing us and pressing our buttons that we're starting to create a world
*  now where we just have ever more hatred. Because they figured out that these algorithms, not for
*  out of evil, but just to make money on advertising that the best way to get more engagement,
*  the euphemism, get people glued to their little rectangles, right, is just to make them pissed off.
*  That's really interesting that a large AI system that's doing the recommender system kind of task
*  on social media is basically just studying human beings because it's a bunch of us rats giving it
*  signal, nonstop signal. It'll show a thing and then we give signal on whether we spread that thing,
*  we like that thing, that thing increases our engagement, gets us to return to the platform.
*  It has that on the scale of hundreds of millions of people constantly. So it's just learning and
*  learning and learning. And presumably if the number of parameters in your neural network that's
*  doing the learning and more end to end the learning is, the more it's able to just basically encode
*  how to manipulate human behavior, how to control humans at scale.
*  Exactly. And that is not something I think is in humanity's interest. Right now, it's mainly
*  letting some humans manipulate other humans for profit and power, which already
*  caused a lot of damage. And eventually that's a sort of skill that can make AIs persuade humans
*  to let them escape whatever safety precautions we put. There was a really nice article
*  in the New York Times recently by Yuval Noah Harari and two co-authors, including Tristan Harris
*  from the Social Dilemma. They have this phrase in there I love, humanity's first contact
*  with advanced AI was social media. And we lost that one. We now live in a country where there's
*  much more hate in the world, where there's much more hate in fact. And in our democracy,
*  that we're having this conversation and people can't even agree on who won the last election.
*  No. And we humans often point fingers at other humans and say it's their fault. But it's really
*  Moloch and these AI algorithms. We got the algorithms and then Moloch pitted the social
*  media companies against each other. So nobody could have a less creepy algorithm because then
*  they would lose out on revenue to the other company. Is there any way to win that battle back?
*  Just if we just linger on this one battle that we've lost in terms of social media? Is it possible
*  to redesign social media, this very medium in which we use as a civilization to communicate
*  with each other, to have these kinds of conversations, to have discourse to try to figure out how to
*  solve the biggest problems in the world, whether that's nuclear war or the development of AGI?
*  Is it possible to do social media? I think it's not only possible, but it's necessary.
*  Who are we kidding that we're going to be able to solve all these other challenges if we can't even
*  have a conversation with each other? That's constructive. The key idea of democracy is that
*  you get a bunch of people together and they have a real conversation. The ones you try to foster on
*  this podcast or you respectfully listen to people you disagree with. And you realize actually,
*  there are some things actually, some common ground we have and we both agree let's not have a nuclear
*  war, let's not do that, et cetera, et cetera. We're kidding ourselves thinking we can face
*  off the second contact with ever more powerful AI that's happening now with these
*  large language models if we can't even have a functional conversation in the public space.
*  That's why I started the improve the news project, improvethenews.org. But I'm an optimist
*  fundamentally in that there is a lot of intrinsic goodness in people and that what makes the
*  difference between someone doing good things for humanity and bad things is not some sort of fairy
*  tale thing that this person was born with an evil gene and this one was not born with a good gene.
*  I think it's whether we put for the people find themselves in situations that bring out the best
*  in them or the bring out the worst in them. And I feel we're building an internet and a society that
*  brings out the worst. But it doesn't have to be that way. No, it does not. It's possible to create
*  incentives and also create incentives that make money. They both make money and bring out the
*  best in people. I mean, in the long term, it's not a good investment for anyone. It's half a nuclear
*  war, for example. And is it a good investment for humanity if we just ultimately replace all humans
*  by machines and then are so obsolete that eventually there are no humans left? Well,
*  depends on how you do the math. But I would say by any reasonable economic standard, if you look at
*  the future income of humans and there aren't any, that's not a good investment.
*  Moreover, why can't we have a little bit of pride in our species? Damn it. Why should we
*  just build another species that gets rid of us? If we were Neanderthals,
*  would we really consider it a smart move if we had really advanced biotech to build homo sapiens?
*  You might say, hey, Max, yeah, let's build these homo sapiens. They're going to be smarter than us.
*  Maybe they can help us defend us better against predators and help fix up our caves, make them
*  nicer. We'll control them undoubtedly. So then they build a couple, a little baby girl, a little
*  baby boy. And then you have some wise old Neanderthal elders like, hmm, I'm scared that
*  we're opening a Pandora's box here and that we're going to get outsmarted by these
*  super Neanderthal intelligences. And there won't be any Neanderthals left. But then you have a
*  bunch of others in the cave, are you such a Luddite scaremonger? Of course, they're going to want to
*  keep us around because we are their creators. And the smarter they get, the nicer they're going to
*  get. They're going to want to surround us and it's going to be fine. And besides, look at these
*  babies. They're so cute. Clearly, they're totally harmless. They're going to be in the cave.
*  They're so cute. Clearly, they're totally harmless. Those babies are exactly GPT-4.
*  I want to be clear. It's not GPT-4 that's terrifying. It's the GPT-4 is a baby technology.
*  You know, Microsoft even had a paper recently out, the title of something like Sparkles of
*  AGI. They were basically saying this is baby AI, like these little Neanderthal babies.
*  And it's going to grow up. There's going to be other systems from the same company,
*  from other companies. They'll be way more powerful. But they're going to take all the things,
*  ideas from these babies. And before we know it, we're going to be like those last Neanderthals
*  who were pretty disappointed when they realized that they were getting replaced.
*  Well, this interesting point you make, which is the programming, is entirely possible. The GPT-4
*  is already the kind of system that can change everything by writing programs.
*  So yeah, it's because it's Life 2.0. The systems I'm afraid of are going to look nothing like a
*  large language model. But once it or other people figure out a way of using this tech to make much
*  better tech, it's just constantly replacing its software. And from everything we've seen,
*  from everything we've seen about how these work under the hood, they're like the minimum
*  viable intelligence. They do everything in the dumbest way that still works, sort of.
*  So they are Life 3.0, except when they replace their software,
*  it's a lot faster than when you decide to learn Swedish. And moreover, they think a lot faster
*  than us too. So we don't think we have one logical step every nanosecond or so, the way they do.
*  And we can't also just suddenly scale up our hardware massively in the cloud, because we're
*  so limited, right? So they are also life consumed, become a little bit more like Life 3.0 in that if
*  they need more hardware, hey, just rent it in the cloud, you know? How do you pay for it? Well,
*  with all the services you provide. And what we haven't seen yet,
*  which could change a lot, is entire software system. So right now, programming is done sort
*  of in bits and pieces as an assistant tool to humans. But I do a lot of programming and
*  with the kind of stuff that GPT-4 is able to do, I mean, it's replacing a lot what I'm able to do.
*  But you still need a human in the loop to kind of manage the design of things, manage like, what
*  are the prompts that generate the kind of stuff to do some basic adjustment of the code,
*  let's do some debugging. But if it's possible to add on top of GPT-4 kind of feedback loop of
*  self-debugging, improving the code, and then you launch that system out into the wild on the
*  internet because everything is connected and have it do things, have it interact with humans,
*  and then get that feedback. Now you have this giant ecosystem of humans. This is one of the
*  things that Elon Musk recently sort of tweeted as a case why everyone needs to pay $7 or whatever
*  for Twitter. To make sure they're real. Make sure they're real. We're now going to be living in a
*  world where the bots are getting smarter and smarter and smarter to a degree where you can't
*  you can't tell the difference between a human and a bot. And now you can have bots outnumber humans by
*  one million to one, which is why he's making a case why you have to pay to prove you're human,
*  which is one of the only mechanisms to prove, which is depressing.
*  I feel we have to remember as individuals, we should from time to time ask ourselves,
*  why are we doing what we're doing? And as a species, we need to do that too.
*  So if we're building, as you say, machines that are outnumbering us and more and more
*  outsmarting us and replacing us on the job market, not just for the dangerous and boring tasks,
*  but also for writing poems and doing art and things that a lot of people find really meaningful.
*  Got to ask ourselves why? Why are we doing this? The answer is Moloch is tricking us into doing it.
*  And it's such a clever trick that even though we see the trick, we still have no choice but to
*  fall for it. Also the thing you said about you using copilot AI tools to program faster,
*  how many times, what factor faster would you say you code now? Does it go twice as fast?
*  I don't really, because it's a new tool. I don't know if speed is significantly improved,
*  but it feels like I'm a year away from being five to 10 times faster.
*  So if that's typical for programmers, then you're already seeing another kind of self
*  recursive self-improvement, right? Because previously one, like a major generation of
*  improvement of the code would happen at the human R&D time scale. And now if that's five times
*  shorter, then it's going to take five times less time than otherwise would to develop the next
*  level of these tools and so on. So this is exactly the sort of beginning of an intelligence explosion
*  that can be humans in the loop a lot in the early stages. And then eventually humans are
*  needed less and less and the machines can more kind of go along. But what you said there is just
*  an exact example of these sort of things. Another thing which I was kind of lying on my
*  psychiatrist, imagining I'm on a psychiatrist's couch here saying, what are my fears that people
*  would do with AI systems? So I mentioned three that I had fears about many years ago that they
*  would do, namely teach you the code, connect it to the internet and teach it to manipulate humans.
*  A fourth one is building an API where code can control this super powerful thing, right? That's
*  very unfortunate because one thing that systems like GPT-4 have going for them is that they are
*  an oracle in the sense that they just answer questions. There is no robot connected to GPT-4.
*  GPT-4 can't go and do stock trading based on its thinking. It's not an agent. An intelligent agent
*  is something that takes in information from the world, processes it to figure out what action to
*  take based on its goals that it has, and then does something back on the world. But once you have an
*  API, for example, GPT-4, nothing stops Joe Schmo and a lot of other people from building real agents,
*  which just keep making calls somewhere in some inner loop somewhere to these powerful oracle
*  systems, which makes them themselves much more powerful. That's another kind of unfortunate
*  development, which I think we would have been better off delaying. I don't want to pick on any
*  particular companies. I think they're all under a lot of pressure to make money. And again,
*  the reason we're calling for this pause is to give them all cover to do what they know is the
*  right thing. Slow down a little bit at this point. But everything we've talked about,
*  I hope, will make it clear to people watching this why these human-level tools can cause
*  a gradual acceleration. You keep using yesterday's technology to build tomorrow's technology.
*  And when you do that over and over again, you naturally get an explosion. That's the
*  definition of an explosion in science. If you have two people, they fall in love. Now you have
*  four people, and then they can make more babies. And now you have eight people, and then you have
*  16, 32, 64, et cetera. We call that a population explosion, where it's just that if it's instead
*  free neutrons in a nuclear reaction, if each one can make more than one, then you get an
*  exponential growth in that. We call it a nuclear explosion. All explosions are like that. And an
*  intelligence explosion, it's just exactly the same principle that some amount of intelligence can make
*  more intelligence than that. And then repeat. You always get exponentials.
*  What's your intuition? Why does you mention there's some technical reasons why it doesn't stop
*  at a certain point? What's your intuition? Do you have any intuition why it might stop?
*  It's obviously going to stop when it bumps up against the laws of physics.
*  There are some things you just can't do no matter how smart you are.
*  All right. Allegedly.
*  Because we don't know the full laws of physics.
*  Seth Lloyd wrote a really cool paper on the physical limits on
*  computation. For example, if you make it put too much energy into it in a finite space,
*  it'll turn into a black hole. You can't move information around fast in the speed of light,
*  stuff like that. But it's hard to store way more than a modest number of bits per atom,
*  et cetera. But those limits are just astronomically above, like 30 orders of magnitude above where we
*  are now. So bigger jump in intelligence than if you go from an ant to a human.
*  Of course, what we want to do is have a controlled thing. Your nuclear reactor,
*  you put moderators in to make sure exactly it doesn't blow up out of control. When we do
*  experiments with biology and cells and so on, we also try to make sure it doesn't get out of control.
*  We can do this with AI too. The thing is we haven't succeeded yet. And Moloch is exactly
*  doing the opposite. Just egging everybody on faster, faster, faster. Or the other company
*  is going to catch up with you or the other country is going to catch up with you.
*  We have to want this stuff. I don't believe in this just asking people to look into their hearts
*  and do the right thing. It's easier for others to say that. But if you're in a situation where
*  your company is going to get screwed by other companies that are not stopping, you're putting
*  people in a very hard situation. The right thing to do is change the whole incentive structure instead.
*  And this is not an old... Maybe I should say one more thing about this because Moloch has been around
*  as humanity's number one or number two enemy since the beginning of civilization. And we came up with
*  some really cool countermeasures. First of all, already over 100,000 years ago, evolution realized
*  that it was very unhelpful that people kept killing each other all the time. So it genetically
*  gave us compassion and made it so that if you get two drunk dudes getting into a pointless bar fight,
*  they might give each other black eyes, but they have a lot of inhibition towards
*  just killing each other. And similarly, if you find a baby lying on the street when you
*  go out for your morning jog tomorrow, you're going to stop and pick it up, right? Even though it maybe
*  make you late for your next podcast. So evolution gave us these genes that make our own
*  egoistic incentives more aligned with what's good for the greater group we're part of.
*  And then as we got a bit more sophisticated and developed language, we invented gossip,
*  which is also a fantastic anti-Moloch, right? Because now it really discourages liars,
*  moochers, cheaters, because their own incentive now is not to do this, because word quickly gets
*  around and then suddenly people aren't going to invite them to their dinners anymore or trust them.
*  And then when we got still more sophisticated and bigger societies, we invented the legal system,
*  where even strangers who couldn't rely on gossip and things like this would treat each other,
*  would have an incentive. Now those guys in the bar fights, even if someone is so drunk that he
*  actually wants to kill the other guy, he also has a little thought in the back of his head that,
*  you know, do I really want to spend the next 10 years eating like really crappy food in a small
*  room? I'm just going to chill out, you know? And we similarly have tried to give these incentives
*  to our corporations by having regulation and all sorts of oversight so that their incentives
*  are aligned with the greater good. We tried really hard. And the big problem that we're failing now
*  is not that we haven't tried before, but it's just that the tech is developing much faster than the
*  regulators have been able to keep up. So regulators, it's kind of comical that the
*  European Union right now is doing this AI act, right? And in the beginning, they had a little
*  opt-out exception that GPT-4 would be completely excluded from regulation. Brilliant idea.
*  What's the logic behind that? Some lobbyists pushed successfully for this. So we were actually quite
*  involved with the Future Life Institute. Mark Brackel, Mr. Ouk, Anthony Aguirre and others,
*  were quite involved with educating various people involved in this process about
*  these general purpose AI models coming and pointing out that they would become the laughing
*  stock if they didn't put it in. So the French started pushing for it, it got put into the draft
*  and it looked like all was good. Then there was a huge counterpush from lobbyists. There were more
*  lobbyists in Brussels from tech companies than from oil companies, for example. And it looked
*  like it might get taken out again. And now GPT-4 happened and I think it's going to stay in. But
*  this just shows, you know, Moloch can be defeated, but the challenge we're facing is that the tech is
*  generally much faster than what the policymakers are. And a lot of the policymakers also don't have
*  tech background. So we really need to work hard to educate them on what's taking place here.
*  So we're getting the situation where the first kind of non-… So I define artificial intelligence
*  just as non-biological intelligence. And by that definition, a company, a corporation is also an
*  artificial intelligence because the corporation isn't its humans, it's a system. If its CEO decides
*  the CEO of a tobacco company decides one morning that CEO he doesn't want to sell
*  cigarettes anymore, they'll just put another CEO in there. It's not enough to align the incentives
*  of individual people or align individual computers' incentives to their owners, which is what
*  technically AI safety research is about. You also have to align the incentives of corporations
*  with a greater good. And some corporations have gotten so big and so powerful very quickly that
*  in many cases their lobbyists instead align the regulators to what they want rather than the other
*  way around. It's a classic regulatory capture. All right. Is the thing that the slowdown hopes
*  to achieve is give enough time to the regulators to catch up or enough time to the companies
*  themselves to breathe and understand how to do AI safety correctly? I think both. But I think that
*  the vision, the path to success I see is first you give a breather actually to the people in
*  these companies, their leadership who wants to do the right thing and they all have safety teams
*  and so on on their companies. Give them a chance to get together with the other companies.
*  And the outside pressure can also help catalyze that and work out what is it that's...
*  What are the reasonable safety requirements one should put on future systems before they get
*  rolled out? There are a lot of people also in academia and elsewhere outside of these companies
*  who can be brought into this and have a lot of very good ideas. And then I think it's very
*  realistic that within six months you can get these people coming up to here's a white paper,
*  here's where we all think it's reasonable. Just because cars killed a lot of people,
*  they didn't ban cars, but they got together a bunch of people and decided in order to be
*  allowed to sell a car, it has to have a seat belt in it. There are the analogous things that you
*  can start requiring a future AI systems so that they are safe. And once this heavy lifting,
*  this intellectual work has been done by experts in the field, which can be done quickly,
*  it's going to be quite easy to get policymakers to say, yeah, this is a good idea. And for the
*  companies to fight MOLOC, they want, and I believe Sam Altman has explicitly called for this,
*  they want the regulators to actually adopt it so that their competition is going to abide too.
*  You don't want to be enacting all these principles and then you abide by them and then you're going
*  to be enacting all these principles and then you abide by them and then there's this one little
*  company that doesn't sign on to it and then now they can gradually overtake you.
*  Then the companies will be able to sleep secure knowing that everybody's playing by the same rules.
*  So do you think it's possible to develop guardrails that keep the systems from
*  from basically damaging irreparably humanity while still enabling sort of the capitalist-fueled
*  competition between companies as they develop how to best make money with this AI? You think
*  there's a balancing? Totally. That's possible. Absolutely. We've seen that in many other sectors
*  where you've had the free market produce quite good things without causing particular harm.
*  When the guardrails are there and they work,
*  capitalism is a very good way of optimizing for just getting the same things done more efficiently.
*  But it was good. In hindsight, I never met anyone even on parties way over on the right
*  in any country who thinks it was a terrible idea to ban child labor, for example.
*  Yeah, but it seems like this particular technology has gotten so good, so fast, become powerful
*  to a degree where you could see in the near term the ability to make a lot of money
*  and to put guardrails, to develop guardrails quickly in that kind of context seems to be tricky.
*  It's not similar to cars or child labor. It seems like the opportunity to make a lot of money here
*  very quickly is right here before us. There's this cliff. It gets quite scenic. The closer
*  to the cliff you go, the more money there is, the more gold ingots there are on the ground you can
*  pick up or whatever. You want to drive there very fast. But it's not in anyone's incentive that we
*  go over the cliff. It's not like everybody's in their own car. All the cars are connected
*  together with a chain. If anyone goes over, they'll start dragging others down, the others down too.
*  And so ultimately it's in the selfish
*  interests also of the people in the companies to slow down when you start seeing the contours of
*  the cliff there in front of you. And the problem is that even though the people who are building
*  the technology and the CEOs, they really get it. The shareholders and these other market forces,
*  they are people who don't honestly understand that the cliff is there. You have to get quite
*  into the weeds to really appreciate how powerful this is and how fast. And a lot of people are
*  even still stuck again in this idea that in this carbon chauvinism, as I like to call it, that
*  you can only have our level of intelligence in humans. There's something magical about it.
*  The people in the tech companies who build this stuff, they all realize that intelligence is
*  information processing of a certain kind. And it really doesn't matter at all whether the
*  information is processed by carbon atoms in neurons in brains or by silicon atoms in some
*  technology we build. You brought up capitalism earlier, and there are a lot of people who love
*  capitalism and a lot of people who really, really don't. And it struck me recently that
*  what's happening with capitalism here is exactly analogous to the way in which superintelligence
*  might wipe us out. Do you know why I studied economics for my undergrad,
*  Stockholm School of Economics? Yay. No, no, I tell me.
*  So I was very interested in how you could use market forces to just get stuff done more
*  efficiently, but give the right incentives to market so that it wouldn't do really bad things.
*  So Dylan Hadfield-Manel, who's a professor and colleague of mine at MIT,
*  wrote this really interesting paper with some collaborators recently,
*  where they proved mathematically that if you just take one goal that you just optimize for,
*  on and on and on indefinitely, you think it's going to bring you in the right direction.
*  What basically always happens is in the beginning, it will make things better for you.
*  But if you keep going, at some point, it's going to start making things worse for you again,
*  and then gradually it's going to make it really, really terrible. So just as a simple,
*  the way I think of the proof is, suppose you want to go from here back to Austin, for example,
*  and you're like, okay, yeah, let's just go south, but you put in exactly the right direction.
*  Just optimize that. South is possible. You get closer and closer to Austin,
*  but there's always some little error. So you're not going exactly towards Austin,
*  but you get pretty close. But eventually you start going away again, and eventually you're
*  going to be leaving the solar system. It's a beautiful mathematical proof. This happens
*  generally. This is very important for AI, because even though Stuart Russell has written a book and
*  given a lot of talks on why it's a bad idea to have AI just blindly optimize something, that's
*  what pretty much all our systems do. We have something called a loss function that we're just
*  minimizing or reward function, we're just maximizing. Capitalism is exactly like that,
*  too. We wanted to get stuff done more efficiently than people wanted. So we introduced the free
*  market. Things got done much more efficiently than they did in, say, communism, and it got better.
*  But then it just kept optimizing and kept optimizing. You got ever bigger companies and
*  ever more efficient information processing, and now also very much powered by IT. Eventually a lot
*  of people are beginning to feel, wait, we're kind of optimizing a bit too much. Why did we just chop
*  down half the rainforest? Why did suddenly these regulators get captured by lobbyists and so on?
*  It's just the same optimization that's been running for too long. If you have an AI that
*  actually has power over the world and you just give it one goal and just keep optimizing that,
*  most likely everybody's going to be like, yay, this is great in the beginning, things are getting
*  better. But it's almost impossible to give it exactly the right direction to optimize in.
*  And then eventually all hay breaks loose. Nick Bostrom and others have given
*  examples that sound quite silly. What if you just want to tell it to cure cancer or something,
*  and that's all you tell it? Maybe it's going to decide to take over entire continents just so
*  we can get more supercomputer facilities in there and figure out how to cure cancer backwards.
*  And then you're like, wait, that's not what I wanted. The issue with capitalism and the
*  issue with front-of-way AI have kind of merged now because the malloc I talked about is exactly
*  the capitalist malloc that we have built an economy that is optimizing for only one thing,
*  profit. That worked great back when things were very inefficient and now it's getting done better.
*  And it worked great as long as the companies were small enough that they couldn't capture
*  the regulators. But that's not true anymore, but they keep optimizing. And now they realize
*  these companies can make even more profit by building ever more powerful AI, even if it's
*  reckless, but optimize more and more and more and more and more. So this is malloc again showing up.
*  Anyone here who has any concerns about late-stage capitalism having gone a little too far,
*  you should worry about superintelligence because it's the same villain in both cases. It's malloc.
*  And optimizing one objective function aggressively, blindly is going to take us there.
*  We have to pause from time to time and look into our hearts and ask why are we doing this?
*  Am I still going towards Austin or have I gone too far? Maybe we should change direction.
*  And that is the idea behind a halt for six months. Why six months? It seems like a very
*  short period. Can we just linger and explore different ideas here? Because this feels like
*  a really important moment in human history where pausing would actually have a significant
*  positive effect. We said six months because we figured the number one pushback we were going to
*  get in the West was like, but China. And everybody knows there's no way that China is going to catch
*  up with the West on this in six months. So that argument goes off the table and you can forget
*  about geopolitical competition and just focus on the real issue. That's why we put this.
*  That's really interesting. But you've already made the case that even for China,
*  if you actually want to take on that argument, China too would not be bothered by a longer
*  halt because they don't want to lose control, even more than the West doesn't.
*  That's what I think.
*  That's a really interesting argument. I have to actually really think about that, which the kind
*  of thing people assume is if you develop an AGI, that open AI, if they're the ones that do it,
*  for example, they're going to win. You're saying, no, everybody loses.
*  Yeah. It's going to get better and better and better and then kaboom, we all lose.
*  That's what's going to happen.
*  When lose and win are defined on a metric of basically quality of life for human civilization
*  and for Sam Altman.
*  I think, to be blunt, my personal guess, and people can quibble with this, is that
*  we're just going to, there won't be any humans. That's it. That's what I mean by lose.
*  We can see in history, once you have some species or some group of people who aren't needed anymore,
*  doesn't usually work out so well for them. There were a lot of horses that were used for
*  traffic in Boston and then the car got invented and most of them got, yeah, well,
*  we don't need to go there. If you look at humans right now, why did the labor movement succeed
*  after the industrial revolution? Because it was needed. Even though we had a lot of
*  mollocks and there was China labor and so on, the company still needed to have workers
*  and that's why strikes had power and so on. If we get to the point where
*  most humans aren't needed anymore, I think it's quite naive to think that they're going to still
*  be treated well. We say that, yeah, yeah, everybody's equal and the government will always protect them.
*  But if you look in practice, groups that are very disenfranchised and don't have any actual power,
*  usually get screwed. Now in the beginning, so industrial revolution, we automated away muscle
*  work. But that got worked out pretty well eventually because we educated ourselves and started working
*  with our brains instead and got usually more interesting, better paid jobs. But now we're
*  beginning to replace brain work. We replaced a lot of boring stuff like we got the pocket calculator
*  so you don't have people multiplying numbers anymore at work. Fine, there were better jobs
*  they could get. But now GPT-4 and the stable diffusion and techniques like this, they're really
*  beginning to blow away some jobs that people really love having. There was a heartbreaking article
*  posted just yesterday on social media I saw about this guy who was doing 3D modeling for gaming and
*  he and all of a sudden now they got this new software he just says prompts and he feels this
*  whole job that he loved lost its meaning. I asked GPT-4 to rewrite Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in
*  the style of Shakespeare. I couldn't have done such a good job. It was really impressive. You've seen
*  a lot of the art coming out here. I'm all for automating away the dangerous jobs and the
*  boring jobs. But I think you hear some arguments which are too glib. Sometimes people say, well,
*  that's all that's going to happen. We're getting rid of the boring, tedious, dangerous jobs.
*  It's just not true. There are a lot of really interesting jobs that are being taken away now.
*  Journalism is going to get crushed. Coding is going to get crushed. I predict the
*  job market for programmers' salaries are going to start dropping.
*  You said you can code five times faster. Then you need five times fewer programmers. Maybe there'll
*  be more output also, but you'll still end up needing fewer programmers than today. I love coding.
*  I think it's super cool. We need to stop and ask ourselves why we're doing this as humans.
*  I feel that AI should be built by humanity for humanity. Let's not forget that. It shouldn't be
*  by Moloch for Moloch. What it really is now is by humanity for Moloch. It doesn't make any sense.
*  It's for us that we're doing it. It would make a lot more sense if we
*  build, develop, and figure out gradually and safely how to make all this tech. Then we think
*  about what are the kind of jobs that people really don't want to have and automate them all away.
*  Then we ask what are the jobs that people really find meaning in? Maybe
*  taking care of children in the daycare center, maybe doing art, etc.
*  Even if it were possible to automate that way, we don't need to do that. We built these machines.
*  Well, it's possible that we redefine or rediscover what are the jobs that give us meaning.
*  For me, it is really sad. Half the time I'm excited, half the time I'm crying as I'm generating
*  code because I kind of love programming. It's an act of creation. You have an idea, you design it,
*  and then you bring it to life and it does something, especially if there's some intelligence.
*  It doesn't even have to have intelligence. Printing Hello World on screen, you made a little
*  machine and it comes to life. There's a bunch of tricks you learn along the way because you've
*  been doing it for many, many years. To see AI, be able to generate all the tricks you thought were
*  special. I don't know. It's scary. It's almost painful, like a loss of innocence maybe.
*  Maybe when I was younger, I remember before I learned that sugar is bad for you, you should
*  be on a diet. I remember I enjoyed candy deeply. In a way, I just can't anymore. I know it's bad
*  for me. I enjoyed it unapologetically, fully, just intensely. I lost that. Now, I feel like a little
*  bit of that is lost for me with programming or being lost with programming, similar as it is for
*  the 3D modeler, no longer being able to really enjoy the art of modeling 3D things for gaming.
*  I don't know what to make sense of that. Maybe I would rediscover that the true magic of what it
*  means to be human is connecting with other humans, to have conversations like this. I don't know.
*  To have sex, to eat food, to really intensify the value from conscious experiences versus creating
*  other stuff. You're pitching the rebranding again from homo sapiens to homo sentiens,
*  the meaningful experiences. Just to inject some optimism in this year so we don't sound like a
*  bunch of gloomers, we can totally have our cake and eat it. You hear a lot of totally bullshit
*  claims that we can't afford having more teachers, have to cut the number of nurses. That's just
*  nonsense, obviously. With anything, even quite far short of AGI, we can dramatically improve
*  grow the GDP and produce wealth of goods and services. It's very easy to create a world
*  where everybody is better off than today, including the richest people can be better off as well.
*  It's not a zero sum game in technology. Again, you can have two countries like Sweden and Denmark
*  had all these ridiculous wars century after century. Sometimes Sweden got a little better
*  off because it got a little bigger and then Denmark got a little better off because Sweden
*  got a little bit smaller. But then technology came along and we both got just dramatically wealthier
*  without taking away from anyone else. It was just a total win for everyone.
*  AI can do that on steroids. If you can build safe AGI, if you can build super intelligence,
*  basically all the limitations that cause harm today can be completely eliminated.
*  It's a wonderful possibility. This is not sci-fi. This is something which is clearly
*  possible according to the laws of physics. We can talk about ways of making it safe also.
*  But unfortunately, that'll only happen if we steer in that direction. That's absolutely not
*  the default outcome. That's why income inequality keeps going up. That's why the life expectancy in
*  the US has been going down now. I think it's four years in a row. I just read a heartbreaking study
*  from the CDC about how something like one third of all teenage girls in the US
*  have been thinking about suicide. Those are steps in totally the wrong direction.
*  It's important to keep our eyes on the prize here. We have the power now for the first time
*  in the history of our species to harness artificial intelligence, to help us really flourish
*  and help bring out the best in our humanity rather than the worst of it. To help us
*  have really fulfilling experiences that feel truly meaningful. You and I shouldn't sit here
*  and dictate to future generations what they will be. Let them figure it out. But let's
*  give them a chance to live and not foreclose all these possibilities for them by just messing
*  things up. For that, we have to solve the AI safety problem. It would be nice if we can link
*  on exploring that a little bit. One interesting way to enter that discussion is you tweeted,
*  and Elon replied, you tweeted, let's not just focus on whether GPT-4 will do more harm or good on the
*  job market, but also whether its coding skills will hasten the arrival of super intelligence.
*  That's something we've been talking about. Elon proposed one thing in the reply saying,
*  maximum truth seeking is my best guess for AI safety. Can you maybe steel man the case for
*  this objective function of truth and maybe make an argument against it? In general, what
*  are your different ideas to start approaching the solution to AI safety?
*  I didn't see that reply actually. I really resonate with it because
*  AI is not evil. It caused people around the world to hate each other much more,
*  but that's because we made it in a certain way. It's a tool. We can use it for great things and
*  bad things. We could just as well have AI systems. This is part of my vision for success here.
*  Truth seeking AI that really brings us together again. Why do people hate each other so much
*  between countries and within countries? It's because they each have totally different versions
*  of the truth. If they all had the same truth that they trusted for good reason, because they could
*  check it and verify it and not have to believe in some self-proclaimed authority, they wouldn't be
*  nearly as much hate. There'd be a lot more understanding instead. I think something AI
*  can help enormously with, for example, a little baby step in this direction is this website called
*  Metaculous where people bet and make predictions not for money, but just for their own reputation.
*  It's kind of funny actually. You treat the humans like you treat AI. You have a
*  loss function where they get penalized if they're super confident on something and then the opposite
*  happens. Whereas if you're kind of humble and then you're like, I think it's 51% chance this is going
*  to happen and then the other happens, you don't get penalized much. What you can see is that some
*  people are much better at predicting than others. They've earned your trust. One project that I'm
*  working on right now is the outgrowth of Improve the News Foundation together with the Metaculous
*  folks is seeing if we can really scale this up a lot with more powerful AI. I would love it.
*  I would love for there to be a really powerful truth-seeking system that is trustworthy because
*  it keeps being right about stuff. People who come to it and maybe look at its latest trust ranking
*  of different pundits and newspapers, etc. If they want to know why someone got a low score,
*  they can click on it and see all the predictions that they actually made and how they turned out.
*  This is how we do it in science. You trust scientists like Einstein who said something
*  everybody thought was bullshit and turned out to be right. You get a lot of trust points. He did
*  it multiple times even. I think AI has the power to really heal a lot of the rifts we're seeing
*  by creating trust systems. It has to get away from this idea today with some fact-checking
*  sites which might themselves have an agenda and you just trust it because of its reputation.
*  These sort of systems, they earn their trust and they're completely transparent.
*  This I think would actually help a lot. That can help heal the very dysfunctional
*  conversation that humanity has about how it's going to deal with all its biggest challenges
*  in the world today. Then on the technical side, another common sort of gloom
*  comment I get from people who are saying we're just screwed, there's no hope,
*  is well things like GPT-4 are way too complicated for a human to ever understand
*  and prove that they can be trustworthy. They're forgetting that AI can help us prove that things
*  work. There's this very fundamental fact that in math it's much harder to come up with a proof
*  than it is to verify that the proof is correct. You can actually write a little proof checking
*  code, it's quite short, that you can as human understand and then it can check the most
*  monstrously long proof ever generated even by a computer and say yeah this is valid. Right now
*  we have this approach with virus checking software that it looks to see if there's something
*  you should not trust it and if it can prove to itself that you should not trust that code,
*  it warns you. What if you flip this around and this is an idea I give credit to Steve,
*  I'm a hundred or four, so that it will only run the code if it can prove instead of not running
*  it if it can prove that it's not trustworthy, if it will only run it if it can prove that it's
*  trustworthy. So it asks the code, it proves to me that you're going to do what you say you're going
*  to do and it gives you this proof and you a little proof checker can check it. Now you can
*  actually trust an AI that's much more intelligent than you are, right? Because it's a problem to
*  come up with this proof that you could never have found that you should trust it. So this is an
*  interesting point, I agree with you, but this is where Eliezer Yachovsky might disagree with you.
*  His claim, not with you, but with this idea, his claim is super intelligent AI would be able to
*  know how to lie to you with such a proof. How to lie to you and give me a proof that I'm going to
*  think is correct? But it's not me it's lying to you, it has to trick my proof checker.
*  So his general idea is a super intelligent system can lie to a dumber proof checker.
*  So you're going to have, as the system becomes more and more intelligent, there's going to be
*  a threshold where a super intelligent system would be able to effectively lie to a slightly
*  dumber AGI system. He really focuses on this weak AGI to strong AGI jump where the strong AGI
*  can make all the weak AGI's think that it's just one of them, but it's no longer that.
*  That leap is when it runs away.
*  I don't buy that argument. I think no matter how super intelligent an AI is, it's never going to
*  be able to prove to me that there are only finitely many primes, for example. It just can't.
*  It can try to snow me by making up all sorts of new weird rules of deduction that say, trust me,
*  the way your proof checker works is too limited and we have this new hyper math and it's true.
*  But then I would just take that attitude, okay, I'm going to forfeit some of these
*  supposedly super cool technologies. I'm only going to go with the ones that I can prove in my own
*  trusted proof checker. Then I think it's fine. Of course, this is not something anyone has
*  successfully implemented at this point, but I think I just give it as an example of hope.
*  We don't have to do all the work ourselves. This is exactly the sort of very boring and tedious
*  task that is perfect to outsource to an AI. This is a way in which less powerful and less
*  intelligent agents like us can actually continue to control and trust more powerful ones.
*  Build AGI systems that help us defend against other AGI systems.
*  Well, for starters, begin with a simple problem of just making sure that the system that you own
*  that's supposed to be loyal to you has to prove to itself that it's always going to do the things
*  that you actually want it to do. And if it can't prove it, maybe it's still going to do it,
*  but you won't run it. So you just forfeit some aspects of all the cool things AI can do.
*  I bet you dollars and doughnuts, it can still do some incredibly cool stuff for you.
*  There are other things too that we shouldn't sweep under the rug. Not every human agrees on
*  exactly what direction we should go with humanity. You've talked a lot about geopolitical things on
*  your podcast to this effect, but I think that shouldn't distract us from the fact that there
*  are actually a lot of things that everybody in the world virtually agrees on. That, hey,
*  you know, like having no humans on the planet in a near future, let's not do that, right?
*  You look at something like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
*  Some of them are quite ambitious. And basically all the countries agree. US, China, Russia, Ukraine,
*  they all agree. So instead of quibbling about the little things we don't agree on, let's start with
*  the things we do agree on and get them done. Instead of being so distracted by all these things
*  we disagree on that Marlok wins because frankly, Marlok going wild now, it feels like a war on life
*  playing out in front of our eyes. If you just look at it from space, you know, we're on this planet,
*  beautiful, vibrant ecosystem. Now we start chopping down big parts of it, even though
*  most people thought that was a bad idea. Oh, we start doing ocean acidification, wiping out
*  all sorts of species. Oh, now we have all these close calls. We almost had a nuclear war.
*  And we're replacing more and more of the biosphere with non-living things. We're also replacing in
*  our social lives a lot of the things which were so valuable to humanity. A lot of social interactions
*  now are replaced by people staring into their rectangles. I'm not a psychologist, I'm out of my
*  depth here, but I suspect that part of the reason why teen suicide and suicide in general in the US
*  is record-breaking levels is actually caused by, again, AI technologies and social media,
*  making people spend less time with actually just human interaction. We've all seen a bunch of good
*  looking people in restaurants staring into the rectangles instead of looking into each other's
*  eyes. So that's also a part of the war on life that we're replacing so many
*  really life-affirming things by technology. We're putting technology between us.
*  The technology that was supposed to connect us is actually distancing ourselves from each other.
*  And then we're giving ever more power to things which are not alive.
*  These large corporations are not living things. They're just maximizing profit.
*  I want to end the war on life. I think we humans, together with all our fellow living things on this
*  planet, will be better off if we can remain in control over the non-living things and make sure
*  that they work for us. I really think it can be done. Can you just linger on this maybe
*  high-level philosophical disagreement with Eliezer Yadkovsky in the hope you're stating?
*  So he is very sure, he puts a very high probability, very close to one,
*  depending on the day he puts it at one, that AI is going to kill humans.
*  He does not see a trajectory which it doesn't end up with that conclusion. What trajectory do you
*  see that doesn't end up there? And maybe can you see the point he's making? And can you also see a
*  way out? First of all, I tremendously respect Eliezer Yadkovsky and his thinking. Second, I do
*  share his view that there's a pretty large chance that we're not going to make it as humans. There
*  won't be any humans on the planet in the not-too-distant future. And that makes me very
*  sad. We just had a little baby and I keep asking myself how old is he even going to get?
*  I said to my wife recently, it feels a little bit like I was just diagnosed with some sort of
*  cancer which has some risk of dying from and some risk of surviving.
*  Except this is a kind of cancer which will kill all of humanity. So I completely take seriously
*  his concerns. But I absolutely don't think it's hopeless. I think there is, first of all, a lot
*  of momentum now. For the first time, actually, since the many, many years that have passed,
*  since I and many others started warning about this, I feel most people are getting it now.
*  Just talking to this guy in the gas station, they were housed the other day.
*  And he's like, I think we're getting replaced. So that's positive that we're finally seeing
*  this reaction, which is the first step towards solving the problem. Second, I really think that
*  this vision of only running AIs if the stakes are really high, that can prove to us that they're
*  safe, it's really just virus checking in reverse again. I think it's scientifically doable.
*  I don't think it's hopeless. We might have to forfeit some of the technology that we could get
*  if we were putting blind faith in our AIs, but we're still going to get amazing stuff.
*  Do you envision a process with a proof checker, like something like GPT-4 or GPT-5,
*  will go through a process of rigorous interrogation? No, I think it's hopeless. That's like trying to
*  prove very well about five spaghetti. The vision I have for success is instead that
*  just like we human beings were able to look at our brains and distill out the key knowledge.
*  Galileo, when his dad threw him an apple when he was a kid, he was able to catch it because his
*  brain could in this funny spaghetti kind of way predict how parabolas are going to move.
*  His conamans system one. Then he got older and it's like, wait, this is a parabola. It's y equals x
*  squared. I can distill this knowledge out and today you can easily program it into a computer
*  and it can simulate not just that, but how to get to Mars and so on. I envision a similar process
*  where we use the amazing learning power of neural networks to discover the knowledge in the first
*  place, but we don't stop with a black box and use that. We then do a second round of AI where we use
*  automated systems to extract out the knowledge and see what are the insights it's had. Then we
*  put that knowledge into a completely different kind of architecture or programming language or
*  whatever that's made in a way that can be both really efficient and also is more amenable to
*  very formal verification. That's my vision. I'm not sitting here saying I'm confident,
*  100% sure that it's going to work, but I don't think it's chance is certainly not zero either.
*  It will certainly be possible to do for a lot of really cool AI applications that we're not using
*  now so we can have a lot of the fun that we're excited about if we do this. We're going to need
*  a little bit of time. That's why it's good to pause and put in place requirements.
*  One more thing also, I think someone might think zero percent chance we're going to survive.
*  Let's just give up. That's very dangerous because there's no more guaranteed way to fail than to
*  convince yourself that it's impossible and not try. When you study history and military history,
*  the first thing you learn is that that's how you do psychological warfare. You persuade the other
*  side that it's hopeless so they don't even fight. Then of course you win. Let's not do this
*  psychological warfare on ourselves and say there's 100% probability we're all screwed anyway.
*  Sadly, I do get that a little bit sometimes from some young people who are so convinced
*  that we're all screwed that they're like, I'm just going to play computer games and do drugs
*  because we're screwed anyway. It's important to keep the hope alive because it actually has a
*  causal impact and makes it more likely that we're going to succeed. It seems like the people that
*  actually build solutions to a problem seemingly impossible to solve problems are the ones that
*  believe. They're the ones who are the optimists. It seems like there's some fundamental law to
*  the universe where fake it till you make it kind of works. Believe it's possible and it becomes
*  possible. Was it Henry Ford who said that if you tell yourself that it's impossible, it is?
*  Let's not make that mistake. This is a big mistake society is making, I think, all in all. Everybody
*  is so gloomy and the media are also very biased towards if it bleeds, it bleeds and gloom and doom.
*  Most visions of the future we have are dystopian, which really demotivates people. We want to really,
*  really, really focus on the upside also to give people the willingness to fight for it.
*  For AI, you and I mostly talked about gloom here again, but let's not forget that we have probably
*  both lost someone we really cared about to some disease that we were told was incurable. Well,
*  it's not. There's no law of physics saying we have to die of that cancer or whatever.
*  Of course you can cure it. There are so many other things that we with our human intelligence have
*  also failed to solve on this planet, which AI could also very much help us with. If we can get
*  this right, just be a little more chill and slow down a little bit until we get it right.
*  It's mind blowing how awesome our future can be. We talked a lot about stuff on Earth, it can be
*  great. But even if you really get ambitious and look up into the skies, there's no reason we have
*  to be stuck on this planet for the rest of the remaining four billions of years to come. We
*  totally understand now that laws of physics let life spread out into space, to other solar systems,
*  to other galaxies and flourish for billions and billions of years. This to me is a very,
*  very hopeful vision that really motivates me to fight. Coming back to something you talked about
*  again, the struggle, how the human struggle is one of the things that really gives meaning to our
*  lives. If there's ever been an epic struggle, this is it. Isn't it even more epic if you're
*  the underdog? If most people are telling you this is going to fail, it's impossible. You persist
*  and you succeed. That's what we can do together as a species on this one. A lot of pundits are
*  ready to count this out. Both in the battle to keep AI safe and becoming a multilinear species.
*  Yeah. They're the same challenge. If we can keep AI safe, that's how we're going to get
*  multi-planetary very efficiently. I have some technical questions about how to get it right.
*  One idea that I'm not even sure what the right answer is to is should systems like GPT-4
*  be open-sourced in whole or in part? Can you see the case for either?
*  I think the answer right now is no. I think the answer early on was yes.
*  We could bring in all the wonderful thought process of everybody on this.
*  But asking should we open-source GPT-4 now is just the same as if you say, well,
*  should we open-source how to build really small nuclear weapons? Should we open-source
*  how to make bio-weapons? Should we open-source how to make a new virus that kills 90% of everybody
*  who gets it? Of course we shouldn't. So it's already that powerful. It's already
*  that powerful that we have to respect the power of the systems we've built.
*  The knowledge that you get from open-sourcing everything we do now,
*  might very well be powerful enough that people looking at that
*  can use it to build the things that are really threatening. Again, let's get it. Remember,
*  open AI is, GPT-4 is a baby AI. Baby, sort of baby proto almost little bit AGI, according to what
*  Microsoft's recent paper said. It's not that that we're scared of. What we're scared about is people
*  taking that who might be a lot less responsible than the company that made it and just going to
*  town with it. That's why we want to... It's an information hazard. There are many things which
*  are not open-sourced right now in society for a very good reason. How do you make
*  certain kind of very powerful toxins out of stuff you can buy at Home Depot?
*  We don't open-source those things for a reason. This is really no different.
*  I'm saying that. I have to say it feels in a way a bit weird to say it because MIT is like the
*  cradle of the open-source movement. I love open-source in general. Power to the people,
*  let's say. There's always going to be some stuff that you don't open-source.
*  It's just like you don't open-source. We have a three-month-old baby when he
*  gets a little bit older. We're not going to open-source to him all the most dangerous
*  things he could do in the house. It's a weird feeling because this is one of the first moments
*  in history where there's a strong case to be made not to open-source software.
*  This is when the software has become too dangerous.
*  Yeah, but it's not the first time that we didn't want to open-source technology.
*  Is there something to be said about how to get the release of such systems right, like GPT-4 and GPT-5?
*  OpenAI went through a pretty rigorous effort for several months. You could say it could be longer,
*  but nevertheless it's longer than you would have expected of trying to test the system to see
*  what are the ways it goes wrong to make it very difficult for people. Well, somewhat difficult for
*  people to ask things like, how do I make a bomb for one dollar? Or how do I say I hate a certain
*  group on Twitter in a way that doesn't get me blocked from Twitter, banned from Twitter?
*  Those kinds of questions. You basically use the system to do harm. Is there something you
*  could say about ideas you have? It's just on looking, having thought about this problem of AI
*  safety, how to release such system, how to test such systems when you have them inside the company.
*  A lot of people say that the two biggest risks from large language models are
*  it's spreading disinformation, harmful information of various types.
*  And second, being used for offensive cyber weapon design. I think those are not the two
*  greatest threats. They're very serious threats and it's wonderful that people are trying to mitigate
*  them. A much bigger elephant in the room is how is this going to disrupt our economy in a way.
*  A much bigger elephant in the room is how is this going to disrupt our economy in a huge way,
*  obviously, and maybe take away a lot of the most meaningful jobs. And an even bigger one is the
*  one we spent so much time talking about here, that this becomes the bootloader for the more powerful
*  AI. Right code connected to the internet, manipulate humans. Yeah. And before we know it,
*  we have something else, which is not at all a large language model that looks nothing like it,
*  but which is way more intelligent and capable and has goals. And that's the elephant in the room.
*  Obviously, no matter how hard any of these companies have tried, that's not something
*  that's easy for them to verify with large language models. And the only way to really lower that risk
*  a lot would be to never let it read any code, not train on that, and not put it into an API.
*  Not give it access to so much information about how to manipulate humans.
*  But that doesn't mean you still can't make a ton of money on them. We're going to
*  just watch now this coming year, right? Microsoft is rolling out the new office suite where you go
*  into Microsoft Word and give it a prompt. And it writes the whole text for you. And then you edit it.
*  And then you're like, Oh, give me a PowerPoint version of this. And it makes it. And now take
*  the spreadsheet and blah, and, you know, all of those things, I think, are, you can debate the
*  economic impact of it and whether society is prepared to deal with this disruption. But those
*  are not the things which, that's not the elephant of the room that keeps me awake at night for wiping
*  out humanity. And I think that's the biggest misunderstanding we have. A lot of people think
*  that we're scared of automatic spreadsheets. That's not the case. That's not what Eliezer was
*  freaked out about either. Is there, in terms of the actual mechanism of how AI might kill all humans,
*  so something you've been outspoken about, you've talked about a lot, is it autonomous weapon
*  systems? So the use of AI in war, is that one of the things that still you carry a concern for?
*  As the systems become more and more powerful? I carry a concern for it. Not that all humans are
*  going to get killed by slaughterbots, but rather just as an express route into Orwellian dystopia,
*  where it becomes much easier for very few to kill very many. And therefore it becomes very
*  easy for very few to dominate very many. Right. If you want to know how AI could kill all people,
*  just ask yourself, we humans have driven a lot of species extinct. How do we do it?
*  We were smarter than them. Usually we didn't do it even systematically by going around one after
*  the other and stepping on them or shooting them or anything like that. We just chopped down their
*  habitat because we needed it for something else. In some cases we did it by putting more carbon
*  dioxide in the atmosphere because of some reason that those animals didn't even understand. And
*  now they're gone. If you're in AI and you just want to figure something out, then you decide
*  we just really need this space here to build more compute facilities. If that's the only goal it has,
*  we are just the sort of accidental roadkill along the way. And you could totally imagine,
*  yeah, maybe this oxygen is kind of annoying because it caused more corrosion, but it's
*  good luck surviving after that. I'm not particularly concerned that they would
*  want to kill us just because that would be like a goal in itself. We've driven a number of the
*  elephant species extinct. It wasn't because we didn't like elephants. The basic problem is you
*  don't want to cede control over your planet to some other more intelligent entity that
*  doesn't share your goals. It's that simple. Which brings us to another key challenge which
*  AI safety researchers have been grappling with for a long time. How do you make AI,
*  first of all, understand our goals and then adopt our goals and then retain them as they get
*  smarter? All three of those are really hard. A human child, first they're just not smart enough
*  to understand our goals. They can't even talk. And then eventually they're teenagers and
*  understand our goals just fine, but they don't understand our goals. And then they're like,
*  oh, I'm going to go to the hospital. I'm going to go to the hospital. And then they're like,
*  they can't even talk. And then eventually they're teenagers and understand our goals just fine,
*  but they don't share. But there is fortunately a magic phase in the middle where they're smart
*  enough to understand our goals and malleable enough that we can hopefully with good parenting
*  and teach them right from wrong and still good goals in them. So those are all tough challenges
*  with computers. And then even if you teach your kids good goals when they're little, they might
*  outgrow them too. And that's a challenge for machines that keep improving. So these are a
*  lot of hard challenges we're up for, but I don't think any of them are insurmountable.
*  The fundamental reason why Eliezer looked so depressed when I last saw him was because he
*  felt there just wasn't enough time. Oh, not that it was unsolvable. Correct. There's just not enough
*  time. He was hoping that humanity was going to take this threat more seriously so we would have
*  more time. And now we don't have more time. That's why the open letter is calling for more time.
*  But even with time, the AI alignment problem seems to be really difficult.
*  Oh yeah. But it's also the most worthy problem, the most important problem for humanity to ever
*  solve. Because if we solve that one, Lex, that aligned AI can help us solve all the other problems.
*  Because it seems like it has to have constant humility about its goal, constantly question the goal.
*  Because as you optimize towards a particular goal and you start to achieve it, that's when you have
*  the unintended consequences, all the things you mentioned about. So how do you enforce and code
*  a constant humility as your ability becomes better and better and better and better?
*  Professor Stuart Russell at Berkeley, who's also one of the driving forces behind this letter,
*  he has a whole research program about this. I think of it as AI humility, exactly. Although he
*  calls it inverse reinforcement learning and other nerdy terms. But it's about exactly that. Instead
*  of telling the AI, here's his goal, go optimize the bejesus out of it. You tell it, okay,
*  do what I want you to do, but I'm not going to tell you right now what it is I want you to do.
*  You need to figure it out. So then you give the incentive to be very humble and keep asking you
*  questions along the way. Is this what you really meant? Is this what you wanted? And oh, this other
*  thing I tried didn't work. It seemed like it didn't work out right. Should I try it differently?
*  What's nice about this is it's not just philosophical mumbo jumbo. It's theorems
*  and technical work that with more time, I think it can make a lot of progress. And there are a lot
*  of brilliant people now working on AI safety. We just need to give them a bit more time.
*  But also not that many relative to the scale of the problem.
*  No, exactly. There should be at least just like every university worth its name has some cancer
*  research going on in its biology department, right? Every university that does computer science should
*  have a real effort in this area. And it's nowhere near that. This is something I hope is changing
*  now thanks to the GPT-4. So I think if there's a silver lining to what's happening here, even
*  though I think many people would wish it would have been rolled out more carefully, is that this
*  might be the wake-up call that humanity needed to really stop fantasizing about this being 100 years
*  off and stop fantasizing about this being completely controllable and predictable. Because
*  it's so obvious. It's not predictable. Why is it that I think it was chat GPT tried to persuade
*  a journalist or was it GPT-4 to divorce his wife? It was not because the engineers had built it. It was like,
*  let's put this in here and screw a little bit with people. They hadn't predicted it at all.
*  They built a giant black box, trained to predict the next word and got all these emergent properties
*  and oops, it did this. I think this is a very powerful wake-up call. And anyone watching this
*  who's not scared, I would encourage them to just play a bit more with these tools. They're out there
*  now like GPT-4. So wake-up call is first step. Once you've woken up, then got to slow down a little
*  bit the risky stuff to give a chance to everyone who's woken up to catch up on the safety front.
*  What's interesting is MIT, computer science in general, but let's just even say computer science
*  curriculum. How does the computer science curriculum change now? You mentioned programming.
*  Why would you be, when I was coming up, programming as a prestigious position,
*  why would you be dedicating crazy amounts of time to become an excellent programmer?
*  The nature of programming is fundamentally changing.
*  The nature of our entire education system is completely torn on its head.
*  Has anyone been able to load that in and think about it?
*  Because it's really turning.
*  I mean, some English professors, some English teachers are beginning to really freak out now.
*  They give an essay assignment, then they get back all these fantastic prose like this is the style
*  of Hemingway. And then they realize they have to completely rethink. And even, you know,
*  just like we stopped teaching writing a script. Is that what you say in English?
*  Yeah, handwritten. Yeah.
*  Yeah. When everybody started typing, you know, like so much of what we teach our kids today.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's, everything is changing and it's changing very, it's changing very quickly.
*  And so much of us understanding how to deal with the big problems of the world is through the
*  education system. And if the education system is being turned on its head, then what's next?
*  It feels like having these kinds of conversations is essential to try to figure it out and
*  everything's happening. And so, you know, I think that's the way it's going to be.
*  Figure it out and everything's happening so rapidly. I don't think there's even,
*  speaking of safety, what the broad AI safety defined, I don't think most universities have
*  courses on AI safety. It's like a philosophy seminar.
*  And like, I'm an educator myself, so it pains me to see this, say this, but I feel our education
*  right now is completely obsoleted by what's happening. You know, you put a kid into first
*  grade and then you envision, and then they're going to come out of high school 12 years later.
*  And you've already pre-planned now what they're going to learn when you're not even sure if
*  there's going to be any world left to come out to. Clearly you need to have a much more
*  opportunistic education system that keeps adapting itself very rapidly as society readapt.
*  The skills that were really useful when the curriculum was written, I mean,
*  how many of those skills are going to get you a job in 12 years? I mean, seriously.
*  If we just linger on the GPT-4 system a little bit,
*  you kind of hinted at it, especially talking about the importance of consciousness in the human mind
*  with homo sentience. Do you think GPT-4 is conscious?
*  I love this question. So let's define consciousness first, because in my experience,
*  like 90% of all arguments about consciousness boil down to the two people arguing, having
*  totally different definitions of what it is, and they're just shouting past each other.
*  I define consciousness as subjective experience. Right now I'm experiencing colors and sounds and
*  emotions, but does a self-driving car experience anything? That's the question about whether it's
*  conscious or not. Other people think you should define consciousness differently.
*  Fine by me, but then maybe use a different word for it. I'm going to use consciousness for this,
*  at least. But if people hate it, yeah. So is GPT-4 conscious? Does GPT-4 have subjective experience?
*  Short answer, I don't know, because we still don't know what it is that gives us wonderful
*  subjective experience. That is kind of the meaning of our life, right? Because meaning itself,
*  feeling of meaning is a subjective experience. Joy is a subjective experience. Love is a subjective
*  experience. We don't know what it is. I've written some papers about this. A lot of people have.
*  Giulio Tononi, professor, has stuck his neck out the farthest and written down actually very bold
*  mathematical conjecture for what's the essence of conscious information processing. He might be
*  wrong. He might be right. But we should test it. He postulates that consciousness has to do with
*  loops in the information processing. So our brain has loops. Information can go round and round.
*  In computer science nerd speak, you call it a recurrent neural network where some of the output
*  gets fed back in again. And with his mathematical formalism, if it's a feed-forward neural network,
*  information only goes in one direction, like from your retina into the back of your brain,
*  for example, that's not conscious. So he would predict that your retina itself isn't conscious
*  of anything. Or a video camera. Now, the interesting thing about GPT-4 is it's also one-way flow of
*  information. So if Tononi is right, GPT-4 is a very intelligent zombie that can do all this
*  smart stuff but isn't experiencing anything. And this is both a relief in that you don't have to
*  feel guilty about turning off GPT-4 and wiping its memory whenever a new user comes along.
*  I wouldn't like if someone used that to me, neuralized me like in Men in Black. But it's also
*  creepy that you can have very high intelligence, perhaps, then it's not conscious. Because if we
*  get replaced by machines, it's sad enough that humanity isn't here anymore because I kind of
*  like humanity. But at least if the machines were conscious, I could be like, well, but they are
*  descendants and maybe they have our values and they're our children. But if Tononi is right,
*  these are all transformers that are not in the sense of Hollywood but in the sense of these
*  one-way direction neural networks. So they're all the zombies. That's the ultimate zombie apocalypse
*  now. We have this universe that goes on with great construction projects and stuff but there's no one
*  experiencing anything. That would be like the ultimate depressing future. So I actually think
*  as we move forward to building more advanced AI, we should do more research on figuring out
*  what kind of information processing actually has experience because I think that's what it's all
*  about. And I completely don't buy the dismissal that some people will say, well, this is all
*  bullshit because consciousness equals intelligence. It's obviously not true. You can have a lot of
*  conscious experience when you're not really accomplishing any goals at all. You're just
*  reflecting on something and you can sometimes have things doing things that are quite intelligent
*  probably without being conscious. But I also worry that we humans will
*  discriminate against AI systems that clearly exhibit consciousness, that we will not allow
*  AI systems to have consciousness. We'll come up with theories about measuring consciousness that
*  will say this is a lesser being. And I worry about that because maybe we humans will create
*  something that is better than us humans in the way that we find beautiful, which is they
*  have a deeper subjective experience of reality. Not only are they smarter, but they feel deeper
*  and we humans will hate them for it. As human history has shown, they'll be the other. We'll
*  try to suppress it. They'll create conflict. They'll create war. All of this. I worry about this too.
*  Are you saying that we humans sometimes come up with self-serving arguments?
*  No, we would never do that. Would we? Well, that's the danger here is even in this early stages,
*  we might create something beautiful and we'll erase its memory.
*  I was horrified as a kid when someone started boiling lobsters. I'm like, oh my God, that's
*  so cruel. And some grown-up there back in Sweden said, oh, it doesn't feel pain. I'm like, how do
*  you know that? Oh, scientists have shown that. And then there was a recent study where they showed
*  that lobsters actually do feel pain when you boil them. So they banned lobster boiling in
*  Switzerland now to kill them in a different way first. Presumably, scientific research boiled
*  down to someone asked the lobster, does this hurt? Survey. And we do the same thing with cruelty to
*  farm animals also, all these self-serving arguments for why they're fine. So we should certainly
*  watch for that. I think step one is just be humble and acknowledge that consciousness is not the
*  same thing as intelligence. And I believe that consciousness still is a form of information
*  processing where it's really information being aware of itself in a certain way. And let's study
*  it and give ourselves a little bit of time. And I think we will be able to figure out actually what
*  it is that causes consciousness. And then we can make probably unconscious robots that do the boring
*  jobs that we would feel immoral to give to machines. But if you have a companion robot taking care
*  of your mom or something like that, she would probably want it to be conscious, right? So
*  the emotions it seems to display aren't fake. All these things can be done in a good way if we give
*  ourselves a little bit of time and don't run and take on this challenge. Is there something you
*  could say to the timeline that you think about, about the development of AGI? Depending on the day,
*  I'm sure that changes for you. But when do you think there'll be a really big leap in intelligence
*  where you would definitively say we have built AGI? Do you think it's one year from now,
*  five years from now, 10, 20, 50? What's your gut say?
*  Honestly, for the past decade, I've deliberately given very long timelines because I didn't want
*  to fuel some kind of stupid malloc race. But I think that cat has really left the bag now.
*  I think we might be very, very close. I don't think the Microsoft paper is totally off when
*  they say that there are some glimmers of AGI. It's not AGI yet. It's not an agent. There's a
*  lot of things it can't do. But I wouldn't bet very strongly against it happening
*  very soon. That's why we decided to do this open letter because if there's ever been a time to pause,
*  it's today. There's a feeling like this GPT-4 is a big transition into waking everybody up
*  to the effectiveness of these systems. So the next version will be big.
*  If that next one isn't AGI, maybe the next one will. There are many companies trying to do these
*  things. The basic architecture of them is not some sort of super well-kept secret.
*  A lot of people have said for many years that there will come a time when we want to pause a little bit.
*  That time is now.
*  You have spoken about and thought about nuclear war a lot. Over the past year, we've seemingly
*  have come closest to the precipice of nuclear war, at least in my lifetime.
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah.
*  What do you learn about human nature from that?
*  It's our old friend, Molok, again. It's really scary to see it where
*  America doesn't want there to be a nuclear war. Russia doesn't want there to be a global nuclear
*  war either. We both know that if we just try to do it, both sides try to launch first, it's just
*  another suicide race. Why is it the way you said that this is the closest we've come since 1962?
*  In fact, I think we've come closer now than even the Cuban Missile Crisis. It's because of Molok.
*  On one hand, you have the West saying that we have to drive Russia out of Ukraine. It's a matter of
*  pride. We've staked so much on it that it would be seen as a huge loss of the credibility of the
*  West if we don't drive Russia out entirely of the Ukraine. On the other hand, you have Russia,
*  and you have the Russian leadership who knows that if they get completely driven out of Ukraine,
*  it's not just going to be very humiliating for them, but it often happens when countries lose
*  wars that things don't go so well for their leadership either. Remember when Argentina
*  invaded the Falkland Islands? The military junta that ordered that. People were cheering on the
*  streets at first when they took it. Then when they got their butt kicked by the British,
*  what happened to those guys? They were out. I believe those who are still alive are in jail now.
*  The Russian leadership is entirely cornered where they know that just getting driven out of Ukraine
*  is not an option. This to me is a typical example of Moloch. You have these incentives of the two
*  parties where both of them are just driven to escalate more and more. If Russia starts losing
*  in the conventional warfare, the only thing they can do is to keep escalating. The West has put
*  itself in the situation now where we're already committed to drive Russia out, so the only option
*  the West has is to call Russia's bluff and keep sending in more weapons. This really bothers me
*  because Moloch can sometimes drive competing parties to do something which is ultimately
*  just really bad for both of them. What makes me even more worried is not just that it's difficult
*  to see a quick peaceful ending to this tragedy that doesn't involve some horrible escalation,
*  but also that we understand more clearly now just how horrible it would be.
*  There was an amazing paper that was published in Nature Food this August by some of the top
*  researchers who've been studying nuclear winter for a long time. What they basically did was they
*  combined climate models with food and agricultural models. Instead of just saying,
*  yeah, it gets really cold, blah, blah, blah, they figured out actually how many people would die in
*  the different countries. It's pretty mind-blowing. Basically what happens is the thing that kills
*  the most people is not the explosions, it's not the radioactivity, it's not the EMP mayhem,
*  it's not the rampaging mobs foraging food. No, it's the fact that you get so much smoke
*  coming up from the burning cities into the stratosphere that spreads around the earth from
*  the jet streams. In typical models, you get like 10 years or so where it's just crazy cold.
*  In the first year after the war, the temperature drops in Nebraska and in the Ukraine
*  breadbaskets by like 20 Celsius or so, if I remember. No, 20, 30 Celsius depending on where
*  you are. 40 Celsius in some places, which is 40 Fahrenheit to 80 Fahrenheit colder than what it
*  normally would be. I'm not good at farming, but if it's snowing, if it drops below freezing
*  most days in July, that's not good. They put this into their farming models. What they found was
*  really interesting. The countries that get the most hard hit are the ones in the Northern Hemisphere.
*  In the US, they had about 99% of all Americans starving to death.
*  In Russia and China and Europe, also about 98% starving to death. You might be like,
*  oh, it's kind of poetic justice that both the Russians and the Americans, 99% of them have to
*  pay for it because it was their bombs that did it. That doesn't particularly cheer people up in
*  Sweden or other random countries that have nothing to do with it. I think it hasn't entered the
*  mainstream, not understanding very much just like how bad this is. Most people, especially a lot of
*  people in decision making positions still think of nuclear weapons as something that makes you
*  powerful. It's scary, powerful. They don't think of it as something where, yeah, just
*  to within a percent or two, we're all just going to starve to death.
*  And starving to death is the worst way to die, as all the famines in history show
*  the torture involved in that. It probably brings out the worst in people also
*  when people are desperate like this. I've heard some people say that if that's what's going to
*  happen, they'd rather be at ground zero and just get vaporized. I've heard some people say that
*  they'd rather be at ground zero and just get vaporized. But I think people underestimate
*  the risk of this because they aren't afraid of MOLOC. They think, oh, it's just going to be
*  because humans don't want this, so it's not going to happen. That's the whole point of MOLOC,
*  that things happen that nobody wanted. And that applies to nuclear weapons and that applies to
*  AGI. Exactly. And it applies to some of the things that people have gotten most upset
*  with capitalism for also, where everybody was just kind of trapped. If some company does something
*  that causes a lot of harm, it's not that the CEO is a bad person, but she or he knew that
*  and all the other companies were doing this too. So MOLOC is a
*  formidable foe. I hope we can make a good movie so we can see who the real enemy is.
*  We're not fighting against each other. MOLOC makes us fight against each other.
*  That's what MOLOC superpower is. The hope here is any kind of technology or other mechanism that
*  lets us instead realize that we're fighting the wrong enemy. It's such a fascinating battle.
*  It's not us versus them. It's us versus it. Yeah. We are fighting MOLOC for human survival.
*  We as a civilization. Have you seen the movie Needful Things? It's a Stephen King novel.
*  I love Stephen King and Max von Sydow, Swedish actor, is playing the guy. It's brilliant. I
*  hadn't thought about that until now, but that's the closest I've seen to a movie about MOLOC.
*  I don't want to spoil the film for anyone who wants to watch it, but basically
*  it's about this guy who turns out to be the devil. He doesn't actually ever go around and kill people
*  or torture people with a burning coal or anything. He makes everybody fight each other. He makes
*  everybody fear each other, hate each other, and then kill each other. That's the movie about MOLOC.
*  Love is the answer. That seems to be one of the ways to fight MOLOC is by compassion,
*  by seeing the common humanity. Yes. We don't sound like Kumbaya tree huggers here.
*  We're not just saying love and peace, man. We're trying to actually help people understand the true
*  facts about the other side and feel the compassion because the truth makes you more compassionate.
*  That's why I really like using AI for truth seeking technologies that can,
*  as a result, get us more love than hate. Even if you can't get love,
*  settle for some understanding, which already gives compassion. If someone is like,
*  I really disagree with you, Lex, but I can see where you're coming from. You're not a
*  bad person who needs to be destroyed, but I disagree with you and I'm happy to have an
*  argument about it. That's a lot of progress compared to where we are in 2023 in the public
*  space, wouldn't you say? If we solve the AI safety problem, as we've talked about, and then you,
*  Max Tagberg, who has been talking about this for many years, get to sit down with the AGI,
*  with the early AGI system on a beach with a drink, what would you ask her? What kind of question
*  would you ask? What would you talk about? Something so much smarter than you.
*  You're going to get me with a really zinger of a question. That's a good one. Would you be afraid
*  to ask some questions? I'm not afraid of the truth. I'm very humble. I know I'm just a meat bag
*  with all these flaws, but I have, we talked a lot about homo sentience. I've already tried that for
*  a long time with myself. That is what's really valuable about being alive for me, is that I have
*  these meaningful experiences. It's not that I'm good at this or good at that or whatever,
*  because there's so much I suck at. You're not afraid for the system to show you just how dumb
*  you are? No, no. In fact, my son reminds me of that pretty frequently. You could find out how dumb
*  you are in terms of physics, how little we humans understand. I'm cool with that. I think,
*  I can't waffle my way out of this question. It's a fair one. I think given that I'm a really,
*  really curious person, that's really the defining part of who I am. I'm so curious.
*  I have some physics questions. I love to understand. I have some questions about
*  consciousness, about the nature of reality. I would just really, really love to understand also.
*  I could tell you one, for example, that I've been obsessing about a lot recently.
*  So I believe that, so suppose Tononi is right. Suppose there are some information processing
*  systems that are conscious and some that are not. Suppose you can even make reasonably smart things
*  like GPT-4 that are not conscious, but you can also make them conscious. Here's the question
*  that keeps me awake at night. Is it the case that the unconscious zombie systems that are really
*  intelligent are also really inefficient? So that when you try to make things more efficient,
*  which there will naturally be a pressure to do, they become conscious. I'm kind of hoping
*  that that's correct. Do you want me to give you a hand-wavy argument for it?
*  In my lab, again, every time we look at how these large language models do something,
*  we see that they do it in really dumb ways and you could make it better.
*  If you... We have loops in our computer language for a reason. The code would get way, way longer
*  if you weren't allowed to use them. It's more efficient to have the loops. And in order to have
*  self-reflection, whether it's conscious or not, even an operating system knows things about itself,
*  right? You need to have loops already. I'm waving my hands a lot, but I suspect that
*  the most efficient way of implementing a given level of intelligence
*  has loops in it, self-reflection, and will be conscious.
*  Isn't that great news?
*  Yes, if it's true, it's wonderful because then we don't have to fear the ultimate zombie apocalypse.
*  I think if you look at our brains, actually, our brains are part zombie and part conscious.
*  When I open my eyes, I immediately take all these pixels that hit on my retina and I'm like,
*  oh, that's Lex. But I have no freaking clue of how I did that computation. It's actually quite
*  complicated, right? Only relatively recently we could even do it well with machines, right?
*  You get a bunch of information processing happening in my retina, and then it goes to
*  the lateral geniculate nucleus, my thalamus, and the area V1, V2, V4, and the fusiform face area
*  here that Nancy Kenwisher at MIT invented, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I have no freaking
*  clue how that worked, right? It feels to me subjectively like my conscious module
*  just got a little email saying,
*  like, facial processing task complete. It's Lex. I'm going to go with that, right? So this fits
*  perfectly with Tononi's model because this was all one-way information processing, mainly.
*  And it turned out for that particular task, that's all you needed, and it probably was kind of the
*  most efficient way to do it. But there were a lot of other things that we associated with
*  higher intelligence and planning and so on and so forth, where you kind of want to have loops and
*  be able to ruminate and self-reflect and introspect and so on, where my hunch is that if you want to
*  fake that with a zombie system that just all goes one way, you have to unroll those loops,
*  and it gets really, really long, and it's much more inefficient. So I'm actually hopeful that AI,
*  if in the future we have all these very sublime and interesting machines that do cool things
*  and are aligned with us, that they will also have consciousness for the kind of these things that
*  we do. That great intelligence is also correlated to great consciousness or a deep kind of
*  consciousness. Yes. So that's a happy thought for me because the zombie apocalypse really is my
*  worst nightmare of all. It would be like adding insult to injury. Not only do we get replaced,
*  but we freaking replace ourselves by zombies. How dumb can we be? That's such a beautiful vision,
*  and that's actually a provable one. That's one that we humans can intuit and prove that those
*  two things are correlated as we start to understand what it means to be intelligent and what it means
*  to be conscious, which these systems, early AGI-like systems will help us understand.
*  I just want to say one more thing that's super important. Most of my colleagues,
*  when I started going on about consciousness, tell me that it's all bullshit and I should stop
*  talking about it. I hear a little inner voice from my father and from my mom saying,
*  keep talking about it because I think they're wrong. The main way to convince people like that
*  that they're wrong, if they say that consciousness is just equal to intelligence, is to ask them,
*  what's wrong with torture? Why are you against torture? If it's just about
*  these particles moving this way rather than that way, and there is no such thing as subjective
*  experience, what's wrong with torture? Do you have a good comeback to that?
*  No, it seems like suffering imposed onto other humans is somehow deeply wrong in a way that
*  intelligence doesn't quite explain. If someone tells me, well, it's just an illusion, consciousness,
*  whatever, I would like to invite them the next time they're having surgery to do it without
*  anesthesia. What is anesthesia really doing? You can have it local anesthesia when you're awake.
*  I had that when they fixed my shoulder. It was super entertaining. What was it that it did? It
*  just removed my subjective experience of pain. It didn't change anything that was actually
*  happening in my shoulder. If someone says that's all bullshit, skip the anesthesia, that's my advice.
*  It's incredibly central. It could be fundamental to whatever this thing we have going on here.
*  It is fundamental because what we feel is so fundamental is suffering and joy and pleasure
*  and meaning. Those are all subjective experiences there. Those are the elephant in the room. That's
*  what makes life worth living and that's what can make it horrible if it's just the way you're
*  suffering. Let's not make the mistake of saying that that's all bullshit.
*  Let's not make the mistake of not instilling the AI systems with that same
*  thing that makes us special. Max, it's a huge honor that you will sit down to me the first time
*  on the first episode of this podcast. It's a huge honor to sit down with me again and talk about this,
*  what I think is the most important topic, the most important problem that we humans have to face
*  and hopefully solve. The honor is all mine and I'm so grateful to you for making more people aware
*  of the fact that humanity has reached the most important fork in the road ever in its history.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Max Tagmark. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, let me leave you with some words from Frank
*  Herbert. History is a constant race between invention and catastrophe. Thank you for listening
*  and hope to see you next time.
