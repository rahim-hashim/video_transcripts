# Michael Malice and Yaron Brook: Ayn Rand, Human Nature, and Anarchy | Lex Fridman Podcast #178
**Lex Fridman:** [April 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl3x4GINtBQ)
*  The following is a conversation with Michael Malus and Yaron Brook, Michael's third time on
*  this podcast and Yaron's second, but together for the first time. Michael is an anarchist,
*  political thinker, host of a podcast called Your Welcome, and author of Dear Reader,
*  The New Right and two upcoming books, Anarchist Handbook and The White Pill.
*  Yaron is an objectivist philosopher, chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute, host of the Yaron Brook show,
*  and co-author of The Free Market Revolution and Equal is Unfair.
*  Quick mention of our sponsors, Ground News, Public Goods, Athletic Greens, Brave, and Four Sigmatic.
*  Check them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that this
*  conversation is a kind of experiment. Both Michael and Yaron are thoughtful and passionate,
*  united in part by an interest in the history and philosophy of Ayn Rand, but they are also very
*  different in style. Good conversation, like good food, is often made delicious by pairing of
*  contrasting elements. For example, someone suggested I try a peanut butter, bacon, and banana
*  sandwich, which apparently is very good. Among the three of us, I don't know who's the peanut
*  butter, who's the bacon, and who's the banana. I'm guessing it's probably me. I'm the banana.
*  But I hope the final result, the final dish, if you will, is equally delicious. We talk through,
*  I think, a lot of interesting ideas, sometimes disagreeing, sometimes even in rare cases,
*  saying something humorous, including dark humor, especially in Michael's case. All three of us are
*  sensitive to the suffering in the world today and throughout human history. We think about it,
*  we talk about it, and we deal with it in different ways. Be patient with us. Whether you agree,
*  disagree, enjoy, or dislike the result, I hope you feel listened, you're a wiser person on the other
*  end of it. I know I was. Mostly, I really enjoyed this conversation because no matter what Michael
*  and Yaron believe, underneath it all, they're genuine, kind human beings that I'm lucky to be
*  able to hang out with and learn from. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here's my conversation
*  with Michael Malus and Yaron Brook. I've been a huge fan of the two of you for the longest time.
*  Are we recording? Is it starting? Or are you just talking? I'm not recording at all. He's not going
*  to compliment us if it's not part of the show. Yes, he does. All the time. He speaks very highly
*  of me. You, I don't know. Maybe he's being charitable. I'm not sure. He only does this to me on the show.
*  Objectivists are like charity, so don't compliment him. He won't think it's sincere. There you go.
*  So it's an incredible honor that the both of you would show up here.
*  Let me just ask the sort of profound philosophical question. How well do you think we would get along
*  if we were stuck in a desert island together? What would life be like? I thought the original
*  question you had that you sent us this question was how long would it take for us to murder one
*  another or something like that. There was murder in the question, if I remember. Listen, he sent
*  us homework, right? All these questions. I ignored it. I didn't spend four years at Patrick Henry
*  University to do homework. To answer your question, I think it would be very easy for us to live
*  together in a desert island in terms of interpersonal. I say this because I know a lot of people who have
*  been the show's survivor, and I know a little bit about the dynamics. So when you have people who
*  are intelligent who are going to have the same goals, and there's space to go away if I'm annoyed
*  at you, I don't think it would be that hard at all. What's our goals in a desert island? Food,
*  shelter. Survival. Survival, basically. Survival and getting out of there, right? You don't want
*  to stay on the desert island. So yeah, I think that's true of any three semi-rational people who
*  basically share the goal that they want to survive, they want to thrive, they want to get out of the
*  island. Why would there be conflict? I mean, there would be conflict, and there can be conflict, but
*  they'd find ways to deal with it. I don't have this negative view of human beings, particularly
*  not as individuals. It's when they get into mobs and groups and collectives that ideology can really
*  motivate them to do horrible things. One of the things that really drives me crazy is how sinister
*  an impact the book Lord of the Flies has had on our culture. I read it in high school. It's a
*  superb book. That's not even a question, but it's not accurate. We see in many situations where
*  people are trapped together under difficult circumstances—obviously that book's about
*  children—that very quickly it is not about conflict. It very quickly becomes about cooperation.
*  Let's work together. We all have the same goal. This is not a time to worry about other things.
*  The animal instinct that kicks in is the social animal, and I'm going to shut up and go over there
*  and have a fight. Stop my feet instead of arguing with your own because we're really trapped in the
*  situation and we need to make it work. Well, to the extent that they're bad people, bad people are
*  dealt with. This is true of all of—how did we survive as a species? How have we survived as a
*  species? We've been on a desert island in a sense as a species forever. Tribes survive. They survive
*  by cooperation. They survive by dealing with bad people. Civilization is created by people cooperating
*  and working together and allowing individuals to thrive within the group. When bad people arise,
*  they deal with them. Sometimes these groups get captured by bad people and bad ideas. Probably
*  from day one that was going on, the whole tribe is probably a bad idea to begin with.
*  But underneath it all, the fact is that to survive as a species, we need to think. We need to be
*  rational. If we don't have any respect for reason, then we would all die. We would die off.
*  That's a hopeful message, but where does that go wrong? With three people, we might get along.
*  We would focus on the basics of life. We have similar goals.
*  Once women are introduced, they're incessant irrationalism.
*  No, no. And also their hormones. We're SOL.
*  Look, three of us on a desert island would be nice, but without women, it wouldn't be fun.
*  I'm going to edit out half the things Michael said.
*  As you know, I used to run the Ayn Rand Institute. She was a woman last time I looked.
*  Wait a minute. You know exactly what I'm going to say. When Ludwig von Mises or Hazlitt,
*  I don't know who it was, was praising Ayn Rand and I think it was Hazlitt who said it to her.
*  He said, Ludwig von Mises said, you're the smartest man I've ever met. And Ayn Rand said,
*  did he say man? Right? No, she viewed as a compliment.
*  Right, but she wanted to be clear that he said man. She was excited.
*  Absolutely. But she was.
*  I took it as her perceiving him as seeing her as a full equal.
*  Oh, I think that's right. I think that's right. Plus, I think the perception out there,
*  the perception and the culture of man as being rational, was a compliment to her because that
*  was affirming that he viewed her as a rational. Yeah, because Mises is old school. He's an older
*  Eastern European guy, so he would definitely have these rigid views. Like his wife, I read her
*  autobiography, Marguerite von Mises, and basically he made her his secretary to the point where if
*  he's typing something or he had something handwritten, she had to type it out. And if
*  she made a typo, he would tear up the page. He had to start from the beginning. But it's like,
*  this is the role of the man, this is the role of the woman. So for him to regard her, this was kind
*  of a breakthrough moment, not that she was secretly misogynist.
*  So I think we go wrong when people try to understand the world around them and come up with
*  wrong ideas. And it's natural that they would come up with wrong ideas because it's hard to
*  figure out what's right. So we start with trying to come up with mystical explanations for the
*  existence of the things around us. And that I think very quickly leads to some people being able
*  to communicate with the mystical stuff out there and some people not being able to communicate and
*  some people wanting to control other people and using those pseudo explanations as a way to
*  control. So you always have Rand called it Attila and the witch doctor. You always have a witch doctor,
*  the mystic, the philosopher, the intellectual, the philosopher, you know, king is a unity of
*  them. And you have an Attila, you have somebody who wants to control other people, who's willing
*  to force the control of the people. And when those two get together, that's when things go bad.
*  And unfortunately, 95, 98% of human history is when those two are together. And so the not having
*  them together, having the right ideas and the right ideas are ones that are not exclusive
*  to those guys and where we don't allow Attila to have that kind of physical power over us.
*  That's an exception and that's rare and that's what needs to be defended.
*  Stalin's not personally killing people. Hitler's not personally killing people.
*  Charles Manson's not personally killing people. They need their goons.
*  They need their goons, but also they don't have original ideas. Nothing Stalin says is original
*  to him. He needs a Marx, even Lenin. They all need a Marx. And Marx needs a particular line
*  of thinkers that come before him that set him up for these kinds of ideas. So Stalin both needs
*  his goons, even though he's somewhat of a goon, particularly Stalin. He has a bank robber. Yeah.
*  And then so take Lenin. Lenin, I think, is a better example because Lenin's more
*  intellectual, if you will. But Lenin needs his goons. He needs his Stalin's. But Lenin also needs
*  his Marx. And we don't want to let Marx off the hook because Marx knows, I think, implicitly,
*  that his ideas have to lead to Lenin and Stalin. His ideas are not neutral.
*  I don't think it's implicit at all. I think Marx very much glorified revolution, blood and terror.
*  This is not implicit in the slightest. No, absolutely. I mean, there are letters
*  between him and Engels where they talk about which peoples will have to be eliminated
*  because they don't have that proletarian thing. So I think certain peoples in Southern Europe
*  are not appropriate for the utopia to come and will have to be gone.
*  And Marx also had this concept, which we still see today in garbled ways, of polylogism, which is if
*  you're a capitalist and I'm bourgeois or I'm a worker, your logic is different than mine.
*  It's literally going to be impossible for us to communicate. And at a certain point, you're going
*  to have to be liquidated. And they pretend that doesn't mean murdered, but it means murdered.
*  And very quickly, everyone becomes a capitalist or bourgeois. And then you have the Halle de
*  Morin and things like this. No, he knows exactly where it's going to lead. And this is why
*  people say, oh, Marx is not evil. He just wrote books. No, it's the people who write books
*  who are responsible for the way history evolves. And they know, the bad guys certainly know
*  the consequence of their ideas. And they need to bear the moral responsibility for what happens
*  when the ideas are implemented. Wait, can I ask a question?
*  Yeah. Because I think I know more about Rand than Yaron does. So let's see.
*  The gauntlet's been thrown down. Who did Ayn Rand say is the most evil man
*  who ever lived? Emanuel Kant.
*  That's right. Correct. No, that I know. I mean, it's a big deal that Emanuel Kant is. And
*  most people don't understand why. Because if you read Kant, there's certain passages in Kant that
*  sound pretty liberal. They sound pretty, he's for the individual. It sounds like he's for the
*  individual. He sounds like he's for the American Revolution, things like that. But when you actually
*  read his philosophy and what he's trying to defend and what he's trying to undermine,
*  he's trying to undermine the foundations that make the revolution possible, that make freedom
*  and individualism possible. He's trying to destroy the enlightenment. And the enlightenment is,
*  are those ideas that make freedom, individualism feasible. He's trying to undermine reason. And
*  without reason, we're nothing. We can't survive as a species. And that's why she thought he was the
*  most evil person, because his ideas undermine the very foundations of what it requires to be
*  a human being. Reason and individualism. Those are the things he's trying to eviscerate.
*  I know you've talked about Hoffman before. So Hoffman is a modern day attempt to...
*  Donald Hoffman? Donald Hoffman. Donald Hoffman is the University of California,
*  Irvine neurologist, neuroscientist, something like that. So I met him once and we were at
*  one of these conferences where you do a quick intro. His introduction was,
*  I've just written a book that proves that evolution has conditioned us not to see reality.
*  Okay, that is very Kantian. Yeah. And he is basically just presenting pseudoscience
*  to defend Kant's position about epistemology and about metaphysics. And there's nothing
*  original there. And he puts up a bunch of equations and he says, I ran a simulation
*  and it proves I'm right. So Yaron is a little bit frustrated with Donald Hoffman's work.
*  Frustrated. I just think it's completely wrong and it's anti-life, anti-mind, anti-evolution.
*  I think he's an anti-evolutionist at the end. And I think it... Anytime you say... Look,
*  here's the important point. Anytime you say reality doesn't exist. Or that you can't perceive it.
*  Well, who are you? What do you mean by reality? What do any of your words mean? What does anything
*  you say even mean if it doesn't refer to something that's actually out there in reality?
*  Let me try to defend this point of view because in a certain kind of sense, I hear it as being
*  humble in the face of the uncertainty that's around us. When you speak with the confidence
*  of Ayn Rand and yourself that reason can be like this weapon that cuts through all the
*  bullshit of the world and makes us have an ethical, moral life and all those kinds of things.
*  You kind of assume that reason is a superpower that has no limits.
*  Wait, hold on. Hold on. I got this one.
*  See, this is already leading to murder by words. Yeah. And we've been only talking for 20 minutes.
*  It wouldn't get together. It wouldn't get along together on an island.
*  We just make him our slave. We're all going to get along. He's just going to do the work.
*  But I'm afraid I cannot provide any value as a slave. So this is not going to end well for me.
*  We could provide value as dinner. That's the problem I'm trying to get to.
*  That's a solution.
*  Okay. But Donald Hoffman says that there is like, he makes an argument that the exactly as you said,
*  that what we perceive is very, very far from actual physical reality. In fact,
*  we're not able to perceive the physical reality at all. And he also makes the bigger claim that
*  evolution prefers beings who are not attached to reality. So like evolution created creatures
*  that are basically functioning way outside of what the physical reality is.
*  I got this. I got this. Okay. Because there's a lot to unpack here and I hate all of it.
*  Okay. First of all, no, no, I'm serious. First of all, when you were making that comment about how
*  reason is a superpower beyond limit, you're being ironic, but it's true. And I'll give you one
*  example, which is astronomy. If you look at the physical size of the universe, it's literally in
*  one sense incomprehensible. So he's right in the sense that I do not understand and none of us
*  understand what it means for 93 million miles away for the sun to be. It's a number on a screen.
*  Right? That said, the fact that my mind, and I'm not one of the great thinkers of all time,
*  is capable of appreciating what the sun means, what heliocentrism means. The fact that we can,
*  you're a math person, that you could look at galaxies and reduce it to 10 to the 64th power
*  in terms of distance, that shows the unlimited capacity of the human mind and reason, number one.
*  Number two is if he says that evolution favors those who are not in touch with reality,
*  and I don't know in what context he's saying that because that sentence could mean a lot
*  of different things. Reality is what guides evolution. Evolution works because you are
*  fitted to the reality of the situation around you. It's not that someone is sitting down and
*  says, well, I'm going to add a fin to this animal and that fin helps it swim. I engineered a check
*  mark. It's that mutations occur. The vast majority of mutations are against reality. They do not
*  further this animal's life or this plant's life or this fungus's life, but the ones that are in
*  touch with reality such as, okay, it's really cold here. There's no predators here. If I could
*  figure out, and I'm using that term very loosely, a way where I could survive in the cold, I don't
*  have predation. It's really great. The fact that unconsciously and mindlessly this process can force
*  the mutation and evolution of the form precisely means that they're in touch with reality. Now,
*  if he means the consciousness is not in touch with reality, that's another thing that I really
*  hate. You're referring to the reality as the biological reality of evolution, but all of that
*  is based on many other layers of abstraction that ultimately has quantum mechanics underneath it all.
*  He's saying somewhere along the layers, you start to lose more and more and more attachment to the
*  actual- Hold on. Can I add one more sentence? Sure. Sure. I do not, I despise the idea.
*  I say despise. I'm not using this. I'm not joking. The idea that the reality we don't live in is
*  somehow more real than this. That is a very dangerous idea to say, well, quantum works in
*  this way, and I'm sure he's correct and none of us disagree with that. What we perceive, macro,
*  works in a different way. Well, that's the real reality and this is fake. Bullshit. This is the
*  real reality. That is a different type of sub subset, but no one's living there. Humanity is
*  the starting point. It's a subset set that has to integrate with this world. There isn't two worlds,
*  one in the quantum world and one here. They're integrated. Now, we might not have the scientific
*  knowledge to know how they're integrated, but so what? We know that there's only one reality
*  and that's this one. He has this difference. He says evolution matches up to fitness, not to reality,
*  and he creates this dichotomy between fitness and reality, but that's complete nonsense. There is
*  no such thing as a concept of fitness outside of fitness to what? To reality. Fitness and reality
*  are the same thing. They're not separate things. So the whole way he sets this up intellectually
*  is wrong, I think, to some extent, dishonest and suddenly philosophically corrupt. It's Kantian.
*  Again, he's accepted Kant's ideas and everybody pretty much has accepted Kant's ideas for the last
*  200 years. They give it a different facade and he's giving it an evolutionary facade,
*  but it's just a facade for the same idea and that is that somehow because we have eyes,
*  we cannot see because the light waves are going through a medium and that medium
*  necessarily distorted. The medium changes the resolution at which you see. If I take off my
*  glasses, I'm seeing it a little differently, but the thing is still there and the thing is still
*  there in the way I see it because the handle, I'm grasping the handle and lifting the cup.
*  That's not an illusion. That is a real cup. So do you think some things are more real than others?
*  For example, money. There's a bunch of things that seem real. This is not an animal farm reference.
*  Is this going to be about love? There's nothing as real as love, right, Lex?
*  Love is a fundamental part of the quantum mechanics. Yes. No. No. Is there some things that
*  have become reality because we humans in a collective sense believe it?
*  You can't believe something collectively. Now, it doesn't become real.
*  What does it mean to say something is real? That is you can. So love, for example,
*  love is a good example, right? Love is an abstraction, right? It's not something I can
*  touch. It's not something I can see, but it's certainly something you could feel.
*  Not something you could hit. We love differently.
*  I don't think that's true. I think at the store, honest about it.
*  You can't hit love. Love is an abstraction. So is love real? Yes, it's real because I feel it.
*  It's an existent, but it's not existent in the same sense as this cup is.
*  So, you know, abstractions are real, but at the end of the day, all abstractions have to be able to
*  be reduced to actual concrete so you can either see it.
*  I really don't like criticizing someone whose work I haven't read secondhand. So I want to
*  take this away from speaking about him personally because I'm not familiar with his work.
*  He is a nice guy. That makes him like him less.
*  I think there's disingenuousness when we talk about the word real in terms of ideas are real
*  versus the cup is real and you try to switch back into between those two meanings and it's a little
*  bit of linguistic wordplay that is trying to force a point that's not accurate, in my opinion.
*  Well, I think the issue is what he's challenging is and what Kant is challenging is,
*  do we know reality? And I think the answer is yes, we do. We know reality. We observe it.
*  Now, do we know everything about reality? No, we can't, for example, sense what a bat
*  senses as reality. A bat observes reality through, what is it? Sonar. Sound waves, right? Through
*  sonar. So it has a different sense, but it's the same reality. It's still a table.
*  The bat's spatial relationship to the table is different than ours, but the object is still the
*  same object. But how do you know that's true? Are you not just hoping that's true? Or assuming that's
*  true? That's what no means. No means I have identified an aspect of reality. That's literally
*  definition of knowledge. Now, if you say, how are you certain? Well, that's a whole other question,
*  but one of the reasons I know it was certain is because this happens. And I know this is going to
*  happen. And if I tell you, if you go downstairs, you're going to see Mr. Jones and you walk
*  downstairs and I see Mr. Jones, at the very least, something's going on there. So what about all the
*  things that mess with our perception? For example, we've talked about psychedelics before, talked
*  about in dreams where you're detached from this. I mean, there's certain things that happen to your
*  brain to where you're not able to perceive. So you're not perceiving reality. That's right. So
*  your brain is creating a different reality. It's not real. How do you know it's not real?
*  How do you know the elves will meet in the… Because I need to take a drug in order to do it,
*  because I'm asleep when I'm dreaming. It's not reality. That is clearly a creation of a mind.
*  It's not a creature. Hold on. The drug is real. The drug is real. If you are… I think you're going
*  to be thinking I'm joking a lot more than I am this episode. I'm going to be the humanist
*  objectivist. He could be the court jester. In terms of psychedelic, when people are perceiving
*  these elves, these machine elves, these other entities, whether they could either be real or
*  not, I don't know. But the point is that doesn't go to his broader point, because if these beings
*  exist and the only way to perceive them is to take a drug, they still exist. This is just… For example,
*  if I'm walking outside in the woods at night and there's a deer and I can't see it, but if I put
*  on night vision goggles, I can see it. That deer was there the entire time. It's not that the night
*  vision goggles caused the deer to appear. You can recreate it not only using night vision goggles,
*  but you can then use sonar. You can use other mechanisms to prove that the deer is there.
*  The thing with psychedelics is that… Now, I don't know, because maybe I'm the least
*  experienced with psychedelics here probably. My guess is every time you take the psychedelic,
*  you have exactly the same experience of the deer. No. Second, are there other mechanisms,
*  other scientific mechanisms by which I can find the deer out there other than the psychedelics?
*  We don't know yet. Well, we don't know yet.
*  Well, but this is Occam's razor. The simplest explanation here is the most likely, and that is
*  that you've taken something that's messing with the chemists on their brains. Something is being…
*  Your brain can project. We dream. Nobody's arguing that the dream is real and reality is not,
*  or if they are, I think they're nuts. The dream is a dream. Your brain is creating an image
*  of telling you a story. Psychedelics are simulating the same thing. That's probably
*  what's going on until there's evidence of the contrary. Well, hold on. I'm going to disagree
*  with you a little bit because let's take Adderall, for example. No one here disagrees.
*  That's something much more simpler and less out of this world. I think what he might be speaking
*  to, I know Joe Rogan talks about this and other people in this space, is that when you take certain
*  drugs, it changes your perception. It doesn't have to be otherworldly. It changes your perception of
*  what's around you. As an example, what they talk about is the three of us are talking,
*  there's lots of other stuff in the room. We're only aware of it vaguely on a personal level.
*  So it changes the… Hold on. Let me finish.
*  No, I don't do that. I'm Israeli. You're about to start.
*  This is back to the desert island murder. We just resolved it within three seconds.
*  There's no conk. He's trying to get us.
*  Yeah, it's not going to happen. I'm trying to create murder.
*  No one has asthma. It's going to be fine. Because if the two of you murder each other,
*  there's more food for me. Just saying.
*  There's no… You're all… You eat…
*  Well, ratings would go up. …robuncy alcohol.
*  Ratings would go up. Viewership would go up. Yeah, it's good for the ratings. Yeah.
*  But if you take, for example, Adderall or Speed, people, you focus on things,
*  you perceive things that aren't there, but that doesn't mean those things weren't there to begin
*  with. There are absolutely ways to change human perception chemically, through glasses,
*  through getting drunk. None of that changes the fact that the reality underneath it is real and
*  is causing this effect. Absolutely. And it has a particular nature,
*  right? And all it's doing is changing the focus, right? So if I take off my glasses,
*  I'm seeing the same thing. I'm just seeing something's out of focus. And maybe in the
*  distance, I can't see something. It's just gone. And then I put it on. There it is.
*  That thing was always there. It's just the sensitivity I have to it has changed.
*  And it's absolutely, you're not sensitive to everything equally. And drugs can change
*  the relative sensitivities. It doesn't change reality. It changes our ability to focus on reality.
*  Let me give you one great example. The microscope. I forget who it was. His name was with an L. The
*  scientist who discovered it. He had a drop of water and he's seeing monsters, the protozoa,
*  in this drop of water. For him, it must have been, it is like a drug experience. Wait a minute,
*  I'm drinking this and there's alien beings whose shapes are completely crazy in this water. Those
*  beings were always there. Those beings were there before any of us were here. They've been there for
*  billions of years. But because he had this apparatus, now he's able to see protozoa. No
*  one's arguing protozoa are extradimensional. No one's arguing the supernatural. Amoebas are well
*  studied, paramecia, all the other lots. So if these elves, the machine elves are real, and the
*  only way to perceive them is through DMT or something like that, that doesn't contradict the
*  broader point that they've always been there and this is the mechanism for perceiving them.
*  So here's the word I was looking for. It's a word actually Greg taught me this. So Greg Silimiri.
*  So it's resolution, right? So it's resolution. My resolution changes with the glasses. My resolution
*  gets finer with the microscope. So there's probably some bacteria here on the table.
*  100%.
*  Right? There's no doubt about it. I can't see them. So I need a microscope to see them, but they're
*  either there or they're not there. And I have the tools to discover whether they are there
*  or they're not there. And that's called a microscope. Now they could be even smaller
*  beings that even with a microscope I won't be able to define. But that's completely arbitrary
*  to claim that they're there until I find a tool to be able to discover it. The same with what you
*  see if you're seeing other beings when you're taking psychedelics. Unless you find another tool
*  to be able to see them with, the simplest assumption is probably the truest assumption.
*  But even the not simplest assumption doesn't contradict the broader point.
*  No.
*  Which is again, if it turns out that there are these creatures that you can only see with
*  psychedelics and there are these creatures that you can only see with psychedelics and
*  our resolution while we're not on psychedelics is not fine enough to observe them. So what?
*  That doesn't change the fact that we evolved to survive in reality as it is.
*  What do you do with the possibility that our resolution as it currently stands is really,
*  really crappy? That basically...
*  Well it's not.
*  No, but you don't know that.
*  No, we know it completely.
*  Compared to who?
*  Compared to the future possibilities like artificial intelligence.
*  It is true.
*  Or us hundreds of years ahead of the future.
*  But that's not relevant.
*  But much, much. Or just the magnitude of crap here.
*  Here I'll use the standard that Hoffman uses, evolution, right? The reason I know that our
*  resolution is phenomenal, it's phenomenally good, right? Look at us. We're sitting here
*  comfortably in an apartment with air conditioning in warm Austin with microphones and it can't...
*  Where did all this stuff... We're really good at survival and changing environment. Indeed,
*  if you look at the species that we know of, there's not a species that come anywhere close
*  to our ability to deal with reality, to observe reality, to understand reality, and to shape it.
*  Now in the future, wow, we'll come up with machines that can figure out stuff that we have
*  no clue about today. That's only because we're so well suited to reality that can we create those.
*  And I promise you, in the future it's going to be much more what you're saying.
*  That's how it's going to happen.
*  No, but the thing is when the creatures from the future look back to the things we're saying now,
*  what Ayn Rand is saying, what you're saying with certainty, do you think they'll laugh at the
*  level of how much confusion there was, how much inaccuracies...
*  Did you... No.
*  Let me get this one. You know what they're going to do?
*  They're going to do what you do when any of us read Aristotle or read any of these great geniuses
*  of the past. It's like these people didn't have electricity. They didn't have warm clothes or
*  anything, and they're able to figure out the diameter of the earth. The creativity to be...
*  And to get it within a few miles, the creativity... And to figure out the speed of light when you
*  don't even have a stopwatch. When you look back, a lot of it's nonsense. But at the same... It's
*  like when you're talking to a kid. You disregard the nonsense, and when they get something right,
*  it's all... So it's never a numbers game, right? So it's the few that validate and justify the rest.
*  So when you look at Aristotle, he's talking about the... There was one of those causes,
*  which is like time travel, and it doesn't really make sense. But you look at the rest of his stuff,
*  or even Plato or any of these greats, it's like, oh my... This is an amazing miracle. I wouldn't
*  say literally miracle. I got you, Erwin. But at the same time, yeah, a lot of these other people
*  had stupid ideas. You don't care. You care about those great, great minds and how they moved us
*  all forward. To this day, we still study Pythagoras. Of course. And it's not even just the sciences and
*  the math. Think about the philosophy. I mean, how much is there to learn from reading Aristotle?
*  Oh, Plato, Socrates, when you disagree with him. I mean, how many giants have there been in all of
*  human history that have had the minds of a Socrates, a Plato, and an Aristotle?
*  A thousand years, will they look back at Plato and Aristotle and admire them? Absolutely.
*  Will they find certain things that are wrong? Yes, but certain things that Aristotle discovered
*  are absolutely right and will always be right. Certain things that I ran discovered will always
*  be right. I think a lot of what he came up with, will some things be discovered to be wrong? Yeah.
*  But you know, that wouldn't shock me. But the genius and the truth that we know today
*  is amazing. It's stunning to be pessimistic about us because in the future we'll know more.
*  Not pessimistic, but more humble. There's no reason to be humble. I mean,
*  I really think humility is a vice, not a virtue. What's there to be humble about? Look at life.
*  This is amazing. But the word humble has different meanings. No, I know. I was going to get it.
*  I mean, humility in a sense of not appreciating the genius and the ability and the success and
*  all the stuff that we as individuals, I think, in our lives, but as a culture, as a movement,
*  if you think about movement in terms of those of us who respect reason have achieved in spite of
*  the odds, we should be proud of that and pride as the virtue. Humility in the sense of, yeah,
*  I know there's more to know. I know there's a lot more to know and in the future we'll know more.
*  Sure, but I don't think that's the way. See, I take humility as the way the Christians use it,
*  which is the other way. And I think it's a real vice. It's don't think of yourself too much just
*  because you can think, you know, that's not a big deal, or just because you can create this stuff.
*  It is a big deal. Your achievements are a big deal and you should take credit for them.
*  So, be careful with the word humility because the real meaning is the Christian meaning,
*  which is a very, very bad meaning. Hold on, let me be a little pedantic
*  because there's no such thing as real meaning, right? So, there's different meanings. Okay,
*  hold on. This is semantics, but here's another real meaning that you're not going to disagree
*  with, which is the smartest person on earth is ignorant of 99.9% of knowledge, right? So,
*  if I meet someone who is less intelligent than me and less informed than me, it is still certain
*  that this person has things to teach me. If I go to a mechanic and maybe this guy is dumb as rocks,
*  I don't know anything about cars. What he tells me about that car is that I could take it to the
*  bank. He's going to be in a position to inform me. So, one of the reasons humility is extremely
*  important is very often you have people, and you see this very much in academia, who think,
*  you know exactly where I'm going, Yaron, who think they're know-it-alls. And they think,
*  oh, I have this degree, you're a layman, you've never been formally educated, therefore,
*  not only are you dumb and uneducated, and you're wrong. And it's like, this person might have,
*  one great example of this, and this is an example Yaron might not like, is a lot of times you have
*  these native populations and they'll have a better understanding of the animals around them, the
*  plants, the fruits, whatever, and you'd have these scientists and be like, oh, they're talking about
*  this monster in the woods, yeah, whatever, this giant ape. But it was real, it was the gorilla.
*  But you dismiss them because, oh, these are stupid, ignorant, whatever people. That's kind
*  of changed to some extent, but that is an aspect of humility that I think behooves especially highly
*  intelligent people because there is such a presumption to be dismissive of people who you
*  regard as less than, but they're often right. So, I agree with all of the concrete examples.
*  I just think we should come up with a better word than humility. And I don't have one because I'm
*  not a wood smith, this is not my strength. But humility is a word from the Christian
*  ethics, and it means something very specific in the field of ethics, and it means the opposite
*  of what I think virtue requires. It's demeaning, it's to put you down, it's to resist pride,
*  and I think pride is a very important thing. I don't know, Yaron. But again, you have to define
*  your terms properly. Hating myself has been quite useful for me.
*  Well, but that's because you're Russian and Jewish. So, by...
*  What? This changes everything.
*  This is what happens, right? We're brought up to feel exactly that way.
*  Alex has been a good Russian boy, so we got him. What is this?
*  What is this? Gematogen. What is this?
*  Gematogen? Is that what it says?
*  Yeah, it's gematogen. I can't, I'm blind.
*  This is for you. Yeah, but...
*  As long as you're a good Russian man, we have candy for you.
*  But is it kosher? Did you check if it's kosher?
*  This is Ukrainian, my friend. Oh!
*  Oh my God. That is a sin. How dare you?
*  That is really simple. You know me, it's a sin.
*  I were born in the same town. I'm kidding. My dad is Ukrainian,
*  don't get mad. So, I don't think... How do you define it?
*  Self-hate? Yeah. I think self-hate is quite destructive.
*  Speak for yourself, Yaron. I think that humility is quite
*  destructive. Humility in the sense of, I'm no big deal.
*  No. I mean, if you've achieved something in life, you are a big deal. You are a big deal because,
*  look, you got the two of us to fly into town just to sit down here and have a conversation with you.
*  You're a big deal. That says more about you than me.
*  We're just lonely. We're lonely to pray.
*  I'm not lonely. I might be desperate.
*  I'm starting to question your ability to reason with the decisions you're making.
*  I should mention that The Idiot by Dostoevsky is one of my favorite novels.
*  There is a Christian ethic that runs through that.
*  I hate to bring this up, but particularly Russians and particularly Russian Jews,
*  and particularly Eastern European Jews, are incredibly Christian. There's a real Christian
*  theme in Judaism that's about guilt. There's no guilt in Judaism. King David doesn't feel
*  any guilt. Solomon doesn't. There's no guilt in the Old Testament. Plenty of guilt once Christianity
*  has an impact on Judaism. We're raised to feel this way. We're raised to be humble. We're raised
*  not to feel special. We're raised to think we're no big deal and our mothers put us down
*  and use that against us and try to inflict guilt on us. They raise us up and then they knock us
*  down. It's a mechanism, but it's a cultural mechanism and I think it's very destructive
*  to self-esteem and to happiness. He's absolutely right with what he just said.
*  I disagree. Why is he right?
*  Because my family, for example, still doesn't really understand how I could pay the rent
*  because I don't go into an office. When I started out trying to be a writer,
*  the immediate reaction isn't, which a lot of times I talk to kids and they have these aspirations,
*  and I'll tell them, go for it while you're young. If you fail, you'll go to your grave with,
*  like, I tried my best. I didn't make it happen. Whereas if you don't try and never achieve,
*  you are going to feel horrible for the rest of your life. This is the example I use all the time.
*  I bring up many times. I go, go to any bookstore and look at all those terrible, terrible books
*  on the shelves that you wonder, how is this a book? That could be you. You could be that
*  crappy writer. But the thing is, in that culture that Yaron was talking about, you tell your family,
*  I'm going to be a writer. Who do you think you are? Why do you think you're going to be?
*  You're no Stephen King. And it's like, why do you have to be Stephen King? Why can't you just be a
*  mediocre, crappy writer making the rent? The best that you can be.
*  But even that is an amazing accomplishment. Yeah, absolutely.
*  If I don't have to go to an office and I write books that not that many people read,
*  this is a story of my life, at the same time, I do have pride because I made this happen.
*  You can be the best version. I mean, this is a cliché, but you can be the best version of yourself.
*  It's not a competition. And yet, our Jewish mothers, that's not what they aspire us to be.
*  They aspire us to be the best version of what they imagine, what the culture imagines,
*  you know, what society imagined, not what it's not about you in their minds.
*  And I've seen it. I see it all around me. People putting their kids down, putting themselves down.
*  It's not healthy. I've never told the story. I'm going to tell it now.
*  When I graduated college, I was a temp for a while because I didn't know what I wanted to do.
*  Right? And when you're a temp, it's like playing roulette. You're going to have jobs that pay well,
*  that suck, and pay well that are great, or that are great that don't pay well, and suck, and pay
*  poorly. But when you're 21, you have that kind of space. And my grandmother was talking to her
*  brother, you know, he's talking about his kids, she's talking about me, she's, you know, from Odessa,
*  and she told me she lied to him about how much money I was making. And that's something I've
*  never brought up and it still hurts me because it's like, your approval of me should be a function
*  of my character, my happiness, and the fact that you feel ashamed over how much money I'm making,
*  especially at this point in my life, I thought was very, really misplaced priorities.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I don't know. I don't know what to make of that. I think there's a huge benefit to the humility,
*  terms aside, for believing that others can teach you a lot. Everybody can teach you a lot.
*  I think we all agree on that.
*  I just mentioned that, the mechanic.
*  Exactly. Exactly. The point. But for that, I do believe you have to not constantly sort of
*  break your ego apart and constantly question whether you know anything about this world.
*  And sort of there's a negativity with it that I think is very useful and it's also very fulfilling,
*  just constantly. I don't know.
*  It's the other way around. I find that the more, the more I know, the more I know, I know,
*  the easier it is for me to learn from other people. The broader context I have, the more curious I
*  become, the more areas I know. It's true that the more you know, the more areas you know you don't
*  know. And the more I find myself attracted to people who can teach me something about things
*  I don't know. Whereas if I was ignorant, if I truly believed I didn't know anything,
*  I don't know how I would live. It would really completely challenge everything
*  about life for me. Where would I even start? You wouldn't know where to start. So no, I think,
*  and if you don't recognize what you know, you don't have a full appreciation of yourself.
*  So really building a recognition of what do I know? Right? And how much do I know? It's
*  really crucial to living.
*  And I'll tell you something else that furthers my life enormously is when you reach a certain
*  point in your career in your life and you're talking to people who are a lot younger,
*  and they might be smart, driven, intelligent, they lack data. When you're 23, you don't know
*  how to speak corporate, you don't know what the code words are. So if I am in a position to sit
*  down with this kid and be like, do X, Y, and Z, and here's why I'm coming to this conclusion,
*  this is the information that released me this conclusion, and I can save them from some of the
*  suffering I went through, that is very gratifying. It's making the world a better place. And it's
*  also the opposite in a sense of humility because like in this context, I'm an expert, or at least
*  knowledgeable enough that I'm comfortable giving you advice.
*  Yeah. And look, everything I do is about me knowing stuff that other people don't.
*  And I know a lot of stuff other people don't, and I do. And it's fun. I'm a teacher. I'm a teacher
*  at heart, always happy. It turns out I didn't know that early on. But I like becoming an expert and
*  then trying to teach people. It doesn't mean I know everything. Quite the contrary. Again,
*  the more I know, the more I know that the certain things I don't know and the certain areas of
*  expertise I don't have. But look, pride is a broader concept than that. Pride is about,
*  and humility is the opposite of pride, and Christianity has that right. Pride is about
*  taking your life seriously. Pride is about wanting to be really good at living, wanting to have the
*  knowledge. And I think what you're describing is I'm constantly learning. Sometimes I have to
*  challenge myself. I have to question what I believed in order to gain new knowledge.
*  That's all good, but that is a drive that is driven by pride. You want to know. There are lots
*  of people out there that don't want to know because they don't have that pride. They don't
*  have that commitment to live, the commitment to achieving something. And I'm going to say something
*  else that I think is crucial. Humility is extremely important when it comes to politics.
*  Because if you feel comfortable telling someone you've never met how to live their life,
*  that is a complete lack of humility. Well, I lack it, obviously, because I tell people how
*  to live all the time. Not through force. Not through force. That's what I'm saying. And of
*  course, not in the concrete. I don't tell them, you know, move to Austin. But I don't tell them,
*  this is what you do as a profession. But I give them the principles because I think the
*  principles are how to live. They're making the choice. That's my point. Politically, what I'm
*  saying is it shows a lack of humility to be like, I've never met this person. This is how I'm going
*  to take money from him. I'm going to... See, but I don't see that as humility. There's nothing...
*  No, it's the lack of humility. No, but it's not even a lack of humility because it's...
*  Who am I to tell them how to live? That's lack of humility.
*  No, who are you to tell them how to live is an issue of... It's an issue of force and rights and
*  a bunch of different things. I don't think it's a lack of humility there. I think it's a lack of
*  being a human being. It could be both. Sure. I think it's... Who gives you the right to dictate
*  somebody else how to live their lives? Yeah, but that's a lack of humility if
*  you think you have that right. Again, we're using humility in a very different way.
*  No, we're using the same way. I don't think it's a good...
*  Because the person who feels comfortable, they think, I know, I know better than you
*  how you should live your life to the point where I'm a couple forcing you because I know it's going
*  to be best for you in the long run. And the answer is you don't know.
*  Right, but that's a lack of humility. I think in your mind, Yaron, humility is somehow tied to the
*  Christian concept of humility, and so you're kind of allergic to the word...
*  Well, absolutely, because it's part of... If you look at the cardinal virtues and cardinal sins
*  in Christianity, pride is a cardinal sin and humility is a cardinal virtue. But they
*  don't mean it in the sense because they're happy to tell you how to live,
*  they're happy to be philosopher kings over your life, and they believe that's being humble.
*  And you should be humble, by the way, in listening to the Pope or listening to God,
*  because what do you know? You know nothing. God knows everything, so you should shut up
*  and do what you're told. That's the sense in which I don't think you should be humble.
*  I mean, it's a sense in which I always use the example of Abraham, right? God comes to
*  Abraham and says, go kill your eldest son, your only son, right? Your only son, go kill him.
*  And what does Abraham do? He says, yes, sir. And he's a moral hero for Judaism, Christianity,
*  and Islam. He's a moral hero because he follows orders, because he's humble.
*  I would tell God to go to hell. Screw you, I'm not killing my son. There's no way.
*  I mean, he killed his son, so it's only fair.
*  Well, this is before he killed his son, so I didn't know that. But no, part of the evil,
*  part of the evil of Christianity is that he's killed his son in the most
*  torturous form of death possible. I mean, the whole story of Jesus is one of the most immoral,
*  unjust stories ever told, and that Christians elevate this to a position of—I'd love to have
*  this conversation with Jordan Peterson. That'll never happen.
*  No, it won't. But elevating Jesus, exactly, elevating Jesus to a superhero status for one
*  of the most immoral acts in human history is horrific. So yeah, I mean, I'm opposed to God
*  sacrificing his own son, never mind my son. Let him go do it to his own son.
*  But he didn't kill Isaac, he killed the goat.
*  The story's about Abraham, not about God. First of all, God is mean, right, to put Abraham through
*  that. But Abraham has to assume that he's going to kill his son, and he lifts his—he's going to do it.
*  And he stopped. So the whole point is obedience. That's what humility leads to. It leads to the
*  opposite of the story you were telling. It leads to people saying, yes, I should be told what to do.
*  Where's the authority who actually knows something? Because I don't know anything.
*  No, I know a lot, and I know a lot about my life. So you stay away from my life because I have pride
*  in my life. The science is settled, right? Look at these experts. Who am I to argue with these
*  experts? They tell me to drink dog pee. I'm going to drink—what am I, not drink dog pee?
*  Yes. Let's go back to the island.
*  We're on island again? We're back to the island.
*  Manhattan. And let's go to the island.
*  I live on an island. Everything is an island in some
*  context. Like Earth is an island. This universe is an island in a multiverse.
*  There's no multiverses. There's only one universe.
*  All right. So let's invite Jordan Peterson to this island.
*  You wish. Hold on. Hold on a sec. Hey, girl. Whatcha doing? Lex. Lex Friedman? Look him up.
*  Lex who?
*  I don't know. Lex says something. It's big of a following almost as Jordan does.
*  I know Jordan. I know his family actually through Jim Keller, who is his relative. He's an engineer.
*  And I just talked to Sam, who is perhaps a little bit aligned in some sense on your perspective on
*  religion and so on. So let me ask, is there— Religion, yes, but—
*  Other things, no. Sam Harris.
*  Sam Harris, yeah. Oh, sorry. Sam Harris.
*  He's on first name relations with these guys. Look at this. It's like baseball.
*  I just talked to Sam. Let's talk about humility. Let's talk about humility like,
*  my buddy Sam. I was talking to Barack. You might know him.
*  I simply— Humility went out the window.
*  I'm just a natural language processing model that I assume that once I mentioned Jordan Peterson,
*  it becomes an obvious statement what Sam means. This is how neural networks think.
*  This is how robots think, Michael. You should know this. I thought by now you'd be a scholar.
*  For the sake of the audience. Humility. Everything can teach you
*  something, even a robot. Okay. So do you think there's value in religion or broader— Do you
*  think there's value in myth? And as we've been talking about the value of reason, do you think
*  it's possible to argue in society as we grow the population of our little island that there's some
*  value of common myths, of common stories, of common religion?
*  There was value. There is no value today. So human beings need explanations. They need a philosophy
*  to guide their life. They need ethics. They need some explanation of what's going on in the world.
*  It's no accident that the early religions had a river god and they had a sun god and a moon god,
*  because everything they didn't understand, they made god, right? So they had multiple gods
*  because they didn't understand very much. As human understanding evolved, increased, as we knew
*  reality more, we came to the conclusion of, you know, this is very inefficient to have all these
*  gods. This is a genius of Judaism, right? Let's just have one bucket to put all the stuff we don't
*  know in and we'll call it one god. And then as we gain new knowledge, we can just take it out of the
*  bucket that's god and put it into the bucket of science. At some point though, at some point,
*  and that point suddenly came during the scientific revolution, I think, we could come to the conclusion
*  that no, we don't need this bucket that's called god to explain the things that we don't know.
*  We can say we don't know and we're learning. And slowly our knowledge is increasing and yet
*  there's a lot more that we don't know, but we don't need to throw it into some bucket that's
*  called god in order to have it. And I think that's true for morality and it's true for everything
*  else, right? As we gain the tools to understand what morality requires, we don't need a set of
*  commandments. We can figure out morality from human nature and from reality. So I don't think
*  we need religion anymore. I think religion needed to die probably about 200 years ago
*  and was dying, I think, up until Kant. It seemed to be dying. And one of Kant's missions,
*  as he says, is to revive religion against the attack of reason and enlightenment.
*  Now mythology is a little different because it depends what you mean by mythology. Certainly
*  we need stories and certainly we need art. Art is a, and Rand writes about this a lot. And you know,
*  she's an artist and she writes, I'm a huge fan of the Romantic Manifesto, which I think is one of
*  her underappreciated masterpieces. Oh, I hate it. Okay. Yeah. So I think we have a real need,
*  right? As a conceptual being, we have a need for aesthetic experiences. We have a need to concretize
*  abstractions, to concretize abstract ideas, to concretize the complex nature of the world out
*  there. And that's what painting sculpture, to an extent music, but painting sculpture literature
*  does for us. So to the extent that mythology serves that purpose, it's just art, right? To
*  the extent that it serves another purpose, that is that it's a way for the gods to communicate with
*  us or it fits some kind of pre-existing mental construct that we have, again, kind of a Kantian
*  perspective, right? That we have these categorical imperatives and this mythology links up to that.
*  Then I think it's false. It's not helpful and destructive. So I believe religion today
*  is a destructive force on planet Earth. I think it's always been a destructive force.
*  It was just a necessary force, right? You needed an explanation. People needed something to believe
*  in. Once you get philosophy and once you get philosophy that starts explaining real life,
*  real world, you don't need religion anymore. And indeed, it becomes a destructive force. And
*  you look around the world today, it's an unbelievably destructive force. Everywhere it touches is
*  bad for life. Again, mythology depends. Art is essential, very, very crucial to human existence.
*  I mean, I'd love to hear what you think, but you don't see religion and philosophy and
*  mythology as just a continuous spectrum? Yeah. So religion is a primitive form of philosophy.
*  But I don't think- It's pre-philosophical.
*  Where I thought Rand, where I thought Yaron was going to go and he didn't go, was that I think,
*  I agree with what he's going to say. Rand was a mythologizer. In certain specific contexts,
*  Atlas Shrugged is a myth. It's one thing to sit down and say, these are the people who move us
*  forward. These are the values that are important. When you experience it through a story, through a
*  movie, through a TV show, a poem, a painting, it affects you in a very visceral, very different
*  way. Talk about American history. You have the founding fathers, then you have the myth of the
*  founding fathers. Now, unfortunately, the term myth often means lie, but it could mean, in a useful
*  sense, an abstraction to help you systematize and concretize ideas. So you have the myth of Reagan,
*  you have the myth of Thatcher. The reality often falls very short. But when you look at how these
*  different figures are mythologized, not only is it very inspirational on a personal level, very
*  motivating on a personal level, it's also a great way to concretize ideas because just how humans
*  think. It's one thing to think about ideas, but when you see someone who embodies these ideas,
*  Miss America, you know, I was saying earlier, I had an asterisk on my show, these people may be
*  jerks. But when you look at them one specific aspect of their life and you extrapolate it,
*  that can be, to anyone, very motivating. And it's very important for people to have the belief
*  that happiness and achievement is possible. Because it's very hard to keep that in mind,
*  especially if you're depressed, if you're anxious, you're unemployed, you don't have a girlfriend,
*  you think it's going to be like this forever. And then you look at someone's story and they're like,
*  you know what, that astronaut I interviewed, Clayton Anderson, he applied 13 times, didn't get a
*  callback, applied the 14th time, got a callback, didn't get the job, 15th time he get the job. He
*  talks to kids and he goes, listen, apply 13 times. Even if you don't get the callback, you'll still
*  feel I'm doing something. And having heard him and the myth of Clayton Anderson, this is going
*  to tell people, yeah, you know what, that could be me. Absolutely. And it's not just happiness,
*  it's the fact that virtue works, that integrity, I mean, what's the power of the fountainhead? I
*  know you love the fountainhead. Part of the power of the fountainhead is Howard Rock's absolute
*  commitment to integrity. He is committed to integrity and he's happy, right? And it's
*  very rare in life to see that, to actually see a concrete of that. And it's very hard to hold it
*  in your mind. Yes, I'm going to be stuck in the quarry or I'm going to be stuck doing this horrible
*  job. But if I stick to my principles, I'm going to be Howard Rock. Now I've got that concrete. I know
*  I can immediately relate to that success. So I think art is essential. And I think in a sense,
*  what we do to Thatcher and Reagan is art. You have to be careful in true stories,
*  not to diverge too far from reality because then when you discover the reality, you don't want to
*  whitewash it. And particularly when it has political implications and then it's really bad. So
*  particularly with Reagan and Thatcher, you have to be careful because they warn anyone you're as good
*  as people try to make them out to be. But these are powerful, powerful, powerful stories. And people
*  are moved by it. And the integration of emotion with reason is crucial. One of the goals to be
*  happy is to bring your emotions in line with your thinking. And I think that stories and arts more
*  broadly, and when I go and see Michelangelo's David, it does the same thing to me. I can stand
*  up to anybody because he did. And look, he succeeded. And it makes sense that he could.
*  So this is a really interesting idea of bringing your emotion in line with your thinking,
*  with your reasoning. So Ben Shapiro famously has this saying, how do you like that transition,
*  Michael? You gave me props. I know you do. He's not Ben, it's Ben Shapiro.
*  Yeah. Someone is not taking your calls. Benny. I guess it's the daily, don't take the caller.
*  Back to the island with the murder. I think we know who would be committing the murder.
*  I have the suit for it. So he has the saying of facts don't care about your feelings.
*  I've always felt badly about that statement somehow. It was incomplete. So it's interesting
*  too that you mentioned bringing your emotions in line with your thinking. What do you think
*  about that statement? I got this one. What Ben is doing, Ben, what he's doing in a loose way
*  is attacking Kantianism. Because Kant, it's almost impossible for Westerners who aren't
*  schooled in this to understand the idea of philosophical idealism because it sounds so
*  crazy that you're like, these great minds of all time can't really be saying this. I must be missing
*  something. So when we hear idealism, we think John F. Kennedy, right? He's a good example.
*  You aspire things. You think life can be better than it is. That's not what it means in a
*  philosophical sense. In philosophical idealism, it means ideas are more real than reality.
*  That I have this idea, then this comes along. It's the reality that isn't correct. My idea is
*  still correct. A good example of this that you see all the time on the internet is when they refer
*  to Mitt Romney and John McCain as rhinos, Republicans in name only. And it's like,
*  who is more a real Republican? The nominee of the party, the senator, the governor of the party,
*  or some person in your mind who has never existed and there's no evidence for them existing.
*  What Kant did is he bifurcated reality into what we see around us, the phenomenal world,
*  but then it's inferior. The real world, the noumenal world, we can't access it. Because we
*  have eyes, we only see the thing as it appears, not as it is in itself. And because of this,
*  everything we know is a shadow and is secondary. And that's Plato, right? And straight out of Plato.
*  And the real reality is this realm of ideas. So when Ben is saying facts don't care about
*  your feelings, what he is really saying is reality comes first. Your feelings have to be a response
*  or a reaction to it. You can't say this is how I feel. This table doesn't care. You can yell at it
*  all day long. It will still be indifferent to your emotional state because it comes first.
*  So it's a great statement. I think he's cribbing it for my friend in a sense.
*  I love it.
*  I mean, there's a sense in which he is. I mean, who popularized that kind of idea?
*  And Ben has read Ayn Rand quite extensively.
*  Not enough.
*  Not enough. Well.
*  Not enough to reference her.
*  That's where the yarmulke is. So yeah, obviously. He may be read enough but didn't understand enough.
*  Chat fired.
*  It's absolutely reality. Reality is unaffected by your emotional state and your feelings about it.
*  And this is a great claim against the idealism, the philosophical idealism
*  of much of the world out there, both left and right. I think politically, culturally,
*  the left and right are detached from reality. They live in a different dimension, in a different
*  space that they are creating in their own minds that has nothing to do with the real world.
*  And when they fail, they make stuff up to justify their failure.
*  Right? So this is, you know, all of really the ideas that are promulgated today on both sides
*  are this kind of detached from reality. We're putting emotions or ideas before reality itself.
*  But I believe that, you know, emotions are responses. The responses to reality
*  conditioned by our existing concepts.
*  You're going to have to talk slowly to talk emotions to Lex because he doesn't really
*  understand what that is. I don't understand.
*  So really, you got to really take your words. But he's big on love.
*  What is love? But he's big on love.
*  He's trying to learn. Pretty big on love. I'm all in,
*  I'm a love maximalist. I mean, I could create, we could create an environment on this island where
*  you would really feel emotions. Like fear is an emotion. We could easily terrorize you to the
*  point where you felt fear. Right? So we could teach him about emotion.
*  But emotions are response to reality. So some people, for example, you could take
*  five different people and show them exactly the same thing. And some of them would feel fear.
*  And some of them would actually, you know, feel indifferent and other people might feel love.
*  Right? I think Leonard Peacock uses the example of looking through a microscope and seeing a,
*  I don't know, a virus or bacteria. And for one, it's a scientist. He's made a new discovery.
*  He feels pride and love and, you know, the one has no clue. Right? And he's looking at this and
*  it means nothing to them. And somebody else might look at it and, you know, it's a bacteria, you
*  know, and they feel fear because of what it could do to them. So it's conditioned by what you know,
*  what your values are and your level of knowledge and what the thing is out there in reality.
*  And it's that into, so your emotions respond to that.
*  So aligning your emotions with your reason is making sure that your emotions are really
*  conditioned by what you know explicitly versus what you've internalized implicitly that you
*  might not agree with anymore. You know, things might happen in your childhood, and they probably
*  do, right? Where you get a trauma. I don't know. I'm afraid of dogs. And maybe when I was a five
*  year old, some dogs jumped me and I don't even remember it, right? But I came to a conclusion
*  when I was five, dogs bad. Dogs dangerous. And now anytime I see a dog, oh my God, that
*  bringing my emotions aligned with reality, right? With my ideas is no, now I understand dogs don't
*  have to be scary. I can work through this and there are various techniques and hopefully,
*  if there is such a science of psychology, but in psychology to get you to the point where you can
*  get rid of that fear and align your emotion now with your explicit ideas. And that's what I mean
*  by that. And let me build on that. Talking about your friend, Putin. I think I mentioned this
*  before, maybe on the show. He was meeting with Angela Merkel. Oh, Vladimir, please. Yeah, Vlad.
*  My boy, Vlad. He was meeting with Angela Merkel. Angela Merkel has a fear of dogs. So he brought
*  out his big Labrador Retriever. Now for people who don't know, Labradors are very big dogs,
*  but they're also like the least aggressive. It's like you could punch them in the face,
*  they don't care. That dog is not going to be more likely to attack just because she's scared.
*  And I know they say animals can sense fear. Domesticated dogs, if they see you're scared,
*  they're not going to be aggressive. They're going to try to play. I remember when I was a kid,
*  I will never forget, there was this dog, Rex, this German Shepherd. I'm five. This dog is gigantic.
*  And I'm sitting on the couch. The German Shepherds have been bred for intelligence. They're very
*  bright dogs. They're very good with kids. He's sitting next to me. This thing is three times
*  my size. He very gently puts his paw on my leg to be like, kid, he can sense my fear. He's like,
*  I'm not going to do it. I want to be your friend. I'm still freaking out. He licks my hand. It's
*  just very scary. Animals are so bright, but that's the thing is in terms of facts don't care about
*  your feelings, that dog is not more likely to attack someone because their emotion is so
*  intense. It's not that I feel something very strongly, therefore this thing is more likely
*  to happen. So my intensity of my emotion does not in any way correlate when you're being irrational
*  to the likelihood of that thing actually happening. No, you could have a dog that does
*  respond to your emotion, right? But then it's not, it's not part of reality, right? That's a fact of
*  reality that certain dogs respond to certain emotions. But isn't this emotion a part of reality?
*  Like, okay, let me say a word. So part of that, I would even say, don't let your emotion about
*  your emotion, right? Because sometimes you have an emotion about your emotion. Don't be repressed.
*  Don't be repressed and identify the emotion as reality and evaluate it. Don't judge it.
*  Evaluate it. Is it a rational emotion? Is it consistent with my, like if I'm afraid of these
*  dogs, if I feel that fear, is it rational to be afraid of these dogs? But you're speaking to your
*  own individual trajectory as a human being as you grow through the world and try to understand
*  reality and connect yourself to reason to reality. What I'm talking about is that term,
*  like lived experience. When you observe and analyze the, you know, conversations with other
*  people to try to understand how other people see the world, doesn't emotion fundamentally
*  integrate into that? Like isn't emotion lived experience? So everybody experiences the same
*  reality, but the way they experience it might be very different and that has to do with what?
*  It doesn't have to do with- With their values, with their conclusions, with their ideas,
*  with their experiences, with a million different things. But at the end of the day,
*  it's about the conclusions that they come to, which are then shaping their emotions.
*  But look, emotions are not something to be avoided or ignored. That is, I can sense your emotions to
*  some extent. That's a lie. Okay, it is Lex. I can sense his emotions. I can sense Michael's
*  emotions and that's part of the fact of reality. So if Michael responds to something that I view
*  as really, really important, if we were standing in front of Michelangelo's David,
*  and Michael responds to Michael, Michelangelo's David was, and turned his back to it and walked
*  away. That would be really meaningful to me. That I would respond emotionally to that and cognitively,
*  I would say, what is it about Michael that makes him respond this way? That gives me a lot of
*  information about him. So emotions are information laden, but they are not primary. They are
*  responses, responses to something. So one must be very aware of one's own emotions, recognize them
*  and analyze them. And one should be aware of other people's emotions if they're important to you. If
*  they're not important to you, it doesn't matter. You don't care about a stranger's emotion. Yeah,
*  like a stranger walks up to Michael and he says, David and so there, and walks away. Then I go,
*  okay, I'm glad you're a stranger. But it's, now, I'm not sure what Michael's response to
*  Michelangelo's David was or is. So I'm a little worried about what he's going to say. You got
*  candy too, that was great. Do I get Ukrainian candy? I can't read either. What's this,
*  Joshua? What does that say to him? Is this Ukrainian candy as well? I thought it was,
*  it was sent to me. Do you know that Atlas Shrugged was the best-selling book in Ukraine in 2015 and
*  2016? Do you know Atlas Shrugged was translated to Russian by someone who's now a crypto
*  billionaire and he made like six copies and I have one of them and I sent it to my great-grandma.
*  No, there are more than six. Oh, but they were like very few.
*  Because I have a copy too. Okay. Not I personally, the Institute has a copy.
*  I sent it to my great-grandma and she said, why is he sending me this? I want to read books about
*  love. And I'm like, you know what? It's about love. That's what you should have said.
*  What's that? Is that say? So this says it's a, it has vitamins and minerals.
*  It there's a, there's a bunch of Russian. I don't believe it. It's just, it sounds really,
*  sounds really strange to read like health information in Russian. I'm already distrustful
*  of it. There's a Yorshchik like you have. Exactly. I mean, I'm much, I like Kiev much more than I like
*  Moscow. Wow. Strong words, but this is, this is not, it's like hard candy. I don't know.
*  I think this, some of my friends sent me that's made with blood to give the kids iron.
*  Whose blood? Like cow blood. Oh.
*  Like with chocolate. All right. You can keep it.
*  It's all you. All right. I'm keeping both of these.
*  Can I, can I, can I take all of the gifts? Something you're talking about with emotion.
*  Something that is very pernicious in terms of emotion is people denying the validity of their
*  own emotions. And here's one example. Someone could be in an abusive relationship or have had
*  an abusive childhood and they think, well, I didn't have a black eye. We had dinner on the
*  table. It wasn't abusive because you hear some other story. So they feel their emotion is invalid
*  or like, oh, he never lays hands on me. He gets drunk and is mean to me. He's still basically a
*  good person. You're denying that emotion. And that emotion is a response to something real.
*  There's an expression I've friends who are in 12 step programs. There's an expression there,
*  which I think is very profound, which is if it's hysterical, it's historical. Meaning if some minor
*  incident is having an extreme disproportionate impact on you, think, ask yourself, why am I
*  responding in such an extreme way to some minor thing? And I will tell you 10 times out of 10,
*  you'll go back and you'll be like, oh, I'm feeling now like I felt when I was eight and my dad came
*  home and he was a total jerk and I didn't do anything wrong. And he thought I had, and I was
*  completely powerless. And now I'm in the same situation, my boss. I'm not that eight year old
*  in one sense I am, another sense I'm not, but I feel the same way I did as a kid. And this is a
*  very useful mechanism in terms of furthering one's happiness because you kind of deprogram all those
*  things that you picked up as a child. But it's also, if you're feeling something wrong, even
*  though you're trying to rationalize it in a way, it's not abusive because he's not hitting me.
*  No, the emotion is telling you something real about what's going on. So acknowledge it and
*  fix the situation. So one of the powers emotions give you is they send you signals
*  about something that might not be in cognition yet. And when you examine the emotion, it brings it
*  to cognition and now you can act on it. So maybe the boss is abusive, but I didn't really think of
*  it in those terms of my emotions is sending me signals. And now that I signal it, I'm going to
*  resign and I'm going to find a better another job. I'm going to complain to his boss or whatever.
*  I'm going to take action. Why do you think Ayn Rand is such a controversial figure? Last time
*  I spoke with you on this particular podcast, the amount of emails I've gotten, positive and negative
*  and certainly negative. I don't usually get negative emails. Yeah, I can't relate.
*  I'm sure mine were all positive. It was mostly women sending pictures for me to forward to you.
*  I kept bouncing.
*  Love hurts. Okay. Yes. No, I.
*  But why do you think she's such a divisive figure? Why do you think
*  she provokes such emotion in both the positive and the negative side? I'd love to hear both
*  of your viewpoints on this. Well, I think on the negative
*  sides and both on the positive and the negative side, I think it's because she's radical. She's
*  consistently radical. She upends the premises, the ideas that are prevalent in the culture,
*  that were brought up on, that are like milk and the basic stuff that we're growing up.
*  You have to be altruistic. You have to live for other people. That's just basic stuff.
*  Nobody challenges that. Nobody questions it. If they do question it, they usually question it from
*  the perspective of a cynic or a bad guy. You mentioned the Joker before we started. I'm going
*  to upend the world because I don't care about other people. They presented with these
*  two alternatives and it's real in people's lives. You either live for other people or you're an
*  evil SOB. Yeah, most people are neither one of those, but the ethic is right here. It's
*  living for other people. When you challenge that, they have no way cognitively to go with that.
*  The only place they can go with that cognitively is to the Joker. It's to the evil guy. It's to
*  somebody who wants to smash everything and destroy it because they don't have this alternative
*  conception of, oh no, you can be rationally self-interested and that does not involve
*  destruction and that does not involve exploiting other people. They can't conceptualize that.
*  It's not in their framework. It's the fact that she's so consistently on the side of self-interest,
*  for example, on the side of capitalism, on the side of freedom. It's the fact that she dismisses
*  faith to the extent that she does or to the extent that I do. That alienates people because
*  that is completely different from what they brought up. Now, the flip side of that is
*  it's also really interesting to some people. You got some positives and I got a lot of positives
*  from that appearance. I know a lot of people came to my podcast because I appeared on your show.
*  Why? Because they hear something that's completely fresh, new, different. They've never heard before.
*  It appeals to something in them that maybe, you know, a lot of people say I read Ayn Rand and it
*  confirmed everything I believed. Now, for me, it didn't. It was the opposite. It turned upside
*  down everything I believed. But there are a lot of people out there that have a sense that something's
*  wrong in the world, that altruism is wrong, that socialism, that just the stuff and religion is
*  wrong, but they don't have an alternative. It hasn't coalesced. And they listen to a lot of podcasts
*  because they're trying to get ideas of what is it that I'm sensing that's wrong out there? And
*  suddenly somebody comes out and gives them some clear explanation of things and they go,
*  wow, that's what I've been looking for my whole life. So that's the positive for people.
*  You know, and I read Ayn Rand. It just all made sense. It all clicked and it made clear that
*  everything I believed to that point was just wrong. It just didn't integrate. And I always knew to
*  some extent it didn't integrate, but there was no alternatives. I believed it. What else was there?
*  I remember saying to myself as a kid, probably 15, why should I? Why is this? Why is morality
*  all about other people? Why is that? Well, that's just the way it is. And I couldn't come up with
*  an explanation. She gave me the explanation and she gave me the explanation why it's wrong to do
*  that. And I think so I think that's why people respond. It's just too radical. It can't fit into
*  their cognitive framework that they're being brought up on, that they've been educated on,
*  their whole life revolves around.
*  Michael, you don't bring up Ayn Rand that much in conversation, except as kind of references
*  every once in a while as part of the humor of just the general flow in the music or the way you like
*  to talk. Well, why do you think you don't integrate her into your philosophy when you're like explaining
*  ideas and all those kinds of things? Like, why is she not, you know, a popular reference point
*  for discussion of ideas?
*  Because I don't know if you're going to agree with or can't agree with me. I think for a certain
*  percentage of population, actually, I talked to someone from the Ayn Rand Institute, I forgot his
*  name, older guy with glasses, and he didn't disagree with me. He said, this is changing. I said,
*  I think for a certain percentage of population who are uninformed about her work, higher than 10%,
*  less than 50%, you mentioned Ayn Rand, they have been trained to think this is identical Scientology.
*  So as soon as her name comes up, it's like, okay, I'm out the door. I'm not going to have anything
*  to do with this. And everyone who follows her is a crazy person. That's one thing that has happened.
*  Another thing is Rand in her personality was very aggressive and antagonistic. She was for a long
*  time, the lone voice in the wilderness being like, this isn't like, you know, like one of her big
*  adversaries in a certain sense is Milton Friedman. And she really hated how Milton Friedman was like,
*  oh, you know, having rent control is inefficient. And she's like, inefficient. We're talking about
*  mass homelessness and people dying. And you're talking about this, like what color tie goes with
*  this color shirt? Are you like it? And in fact, it's hilarious. There was an organization called
*  the Foundation for Economic Education, FI. Leonard Reed was the head of this. And there were a series
*  of letters and she was helping him. She was much more philosophically grounded in certain contexts
*  than he was. And there was an essay pamphlet that he published called Roofs or Ceilings. It was
*  co-written by Milton Friedman, later Nobel Prize winner and George Stigler, also later Nobel Prize
*  winner. And basically the argument was, well, if the government controls all housing, how's that
*  going to work out? And she's sitting there and she's typing in all caps. So you know she's holding
*  on the shift key and doing this on a typewriter and being like, how? And you can imagine her
*  with her cigarette holder, apoplectic, being like, how is an organization
*  ostensibly devoted to free enterprise discussing this Stalinist idea in the most casual of terms?
*  She's like, have I taught you not? And what's amazing is, so at FI, they only have her letters
*  because she sent them to Reed. The Ayn Rand Institute must have Leonard Reed's letters.
*  I was able to, knowing Rand enough, predict exactly what the conversation would go like
*  because he also did something she didn't approve of, which is he asked other people for
*  feedback on her work and she goes, I gave this to you to Reed. Who are you shopping around to some
*  jerk that I need their approval? What are you doing? So it was a very interesting situation.
*  So that's one issue.
*  Now remember, this is Ayn Rand when she's young.
*  She was not young.
*  Well, I mean, she was well into the young. It's before Atlas Shrugged.
*  It was before Atlas Shrugged.
*  So it's before she's super famous and before this is, the fan has been published, but you know,
*  she's trying to work with others and they're disappointing her left and right.
*  Yeah. And also when you are a, what she takes away from bad people, you have these kids,
*  and you're going to sit down with them and they're going to be like, yeah, I'm going to take your
*  guns. I'm going to lock you in your house. I'm going to take 60% of your income and all this
*  other stuff. And they might up to reading Rand, they might sit down and have a discussion.
*  And Rand goes, Hey, you know what? You didn't have to give them an answer. You could say,
*  go to hell. We're not having this conversation and you have no right to one second of my life.
*  And this is not a legitimate opener. This is a declaration of war. This isn't like,
*  it's not like if I sit down with you, I'm like, Hey, Ron, here are my plans for your wife.
*  Go to hell. This isn't a conversation we're having. Oh, I'm going to make you unsafe in
*  your house. What? This is not a discussion. So what happens is these people who five minutes
*  ago were able to have a debate with this kid because people read Rand when they're young often.
*  And now that kid is like, yeah, I'm not even talking to you. It's her fault.
*  Whereas in reality, it's that person's fault because that person had no right, although they've
*  been trained to the contrary of our culture to believe, yeah, I'm going to sit down and we're
*  just going to equally have a discussion over your own life. And you have one vote and I have one
*  vote and we're going to, no, Lex has a vote and that's how it's going to be. And Rand's not
*  having it. So I think those are two issues. And there's some other things which I don't need to
*  get into, but one of the things that Rand said consisting of her life is that her philosophy is
*  an integrated whole, right? So to be an objectivist isn't just like, I like Atlas Shrugged. It means
*  I accept objectivism as a totality. Since I do not, I think it is proper to be respectful to her
*  wishes and not constantly be, especially given that I have somewhat of a platform to be like
*  Ayn Rand, Ayn Rand, Ayn Rand because I don't think Ayn Rand would have liked it if I was talking
*  about Ayn Rand this much. So how do you, how do you deprogram? Cause I don't like to bring up Ayn Rand
*  just because I do see what, like how people roll their eyes essentially. So how do you, what's the
*  outside exactly, but what is that pro, can you speak to that programming that people have?
*  I mean, look, at the end of the day, if you talk about the ideas and the ideas make sense and people
*  are attracted to the ideas, then you say, oh, by the way, and this came from Ayn Rand, that's how
*  you deprogram them, right? If you make the ideas prevalent in the culture, if people start viewing
*  self-interest as something that's kind of, that's interesting and worthwhile and something worth
*  investigating, and they said, oh, that came from Ayn Rand, then I think, I think then we'll
*  deprogram them and get them and get them changing their minds about these things. And also, you know,
*  going on shows where people are going to watch your show no matter who you bring on, right? So,
*  even though, now you do, if you put, you put Ayn Rand in the title, that immediately reduces the
*  number of people who watch. So, so in the future you shouldn't. You put Michael Miles in the title
*  and then at least the female population too. The female too, you know, absolutely. Just to see.
*  So, so you go and you try to make them as credible as possible to as many people as possible over
*  time. It takes time and ultimately I don't think the culture will have this response to her. They
*  might still disagree with her, but I think over time, and already you're seeing it, younger people,
*  I think today are far less. There was a generation who never read Ayn Rand and was like this,
*  bring out the garlic and the crosses. We don't want to have anything to do with her. Then,
*  and I think today there are many more people who've read her and might disagree or not disagree,
*  right? And then there are a lot of people who haven't read her, but who are not opposed to it
*  or willing to engage. So, I think it's changing already and I think in 20 years it'll be completely
*  different. And just two more things that she does that I think says that I think people find very,
*  very off putting given our culture. One is she will basically, you could sit down with Rand and
*  be like, your fear is not in any way a hold on my freedom. Just that one sentence. And for a lot of
*  people that's very off putting and very harsh, it's correct. But for them, it's just like, wait a
*  minute, I'm still scared. It's like, I don't care. Like for example, like with lockdowns and things
*  like this, it's like, well, I'm scared and maybe I have a right to be scared. Or like, I'm scared
*  that you have a gun in your house. And it's like, I respect that you're scared. I don't care. As you
*  say at the end of the day, this is my house. I'm going to live my life as I please, as long as I
*  don't hurt other people. Well, you are hurting me because I'm scared. No, that's not-
*  This is the feeling versus fact.
*  Yeah. So that is one situation where-
*  This is like a feeling versus freedom essentially.
*  Yes. Where Rand puts a lot of people off. I also think that historically, a lot of people who are
*  drawn to her are drawn to her for the wrong reasons. That a lot of times, like Howard Rourke,
*  the hero, we're going to still say hero. You're supposed to say protagonist, but hero.
*  The hero of the fountainhead, he's extremely intelligent, but he's also extremely uncompromising.
*  What often ends up happening is you'll have a young kid who is somewhat intelligent,
*  but then they pick up the personality and now you're someone I can't work with.
*  And then it's like, you're not Howard Rourke. Relax. You're not that skilled. You're not that
*  talented. But because the character has to do personification and have certain aspects together,
*  when kids read that, they might get the wrong idea and that's not Rand's fault.
*  And it's more than that. I completely agree with that, but it's even broader than that.
*  So here is, in my view, one of the geniuses of the millennium presenting a philosophy.
*  She's got not just the questions, in my view, she's got the answers. And you're reading them
*  at 16 and you're reading the answers. You don't know at 16 that this is true. You might have a
*  sense that it's true, but you don't have the life experience, the learned experience. You don't have
*  the facts. You don't have the knowledge. You're picking up truth. It's just being absorbed.
*  You're accepting it as true, but you don't know it's true. And then you go out into the world
*  advocating for it, which we all did, or at least I did, when I was 16. And you're obnoxious. You
*  can't prove what you're arguing for because you don't have the experience. It took me, I don't
*  know, 10, 20 years, probably 20, to figure out that I really do think what she said was true.
*  But I didn't know when I was 16. When I was 16, I just absorbed these ideas and accepted them in a
*  sense with some connection to reality, but in a sense on faith, at least presented it that way.
*  And as a consequence, you come off as a detached from reality, obnoxious
*  human being. I think a lot of young objectivists are, and it's hard not to be,
*  because you are. You're confronted with genius, and you're not a genius. I certainly am not a
*  genius. And I'm confronted with just genius, and I have all this information in my head now.
*  I can't articulate it, and it's hard to deal with yourself. There's an inside joke.
*  No, you said, I'm confronted with genius. I point to us.
*  I mean, I'm confronted with you guys. I'm at an age where I know how to deal with geniuses.
*  But I'm going to say there's something else. This is not why people don't like her, but there's
*  something that the fountainhead does, which I think is very, and I don't blame her, but it's
*  a bad consequence. If you read the fountainhead and you're young and you're intelligent and
*  talented, the message at least I got, and I know I'm not alone, is you're going to think that you're
*  going to be a pariah, that a lot of people are going to be against you, and you're going to,
*  you're basically doomed for a short period of being isolated and alone. And that may have been
*  the case when the fountainhead was written. But I think now with the internet, and in my experience,
*  both as a youth and someone who's a little bit older, I didn't appreciate, and you're not going
*  to get it from that book, and you can't get it through that book because it has to have a
*  certain narrative, how many people who are a little older are giddy when they find young talent.
*  How inspiring it is, how exciting it is. Like when you talk to these kids who are doing things on
*  the internet or writing or whatever achievement, you want them to flourish. You're not threatened
*  by them as the antagonists of the fountainhead are, and that doesn't come through in the fountainhead.
*  But it depends on your profession, right? I mean, some of these parts of the world are better than
*  others. If you're an artist, at least the way I can see it, and you want to go study art today,
*  you're going to be pooh-poohed and look down on and so on. So yeah, I agree. I mean, in my generation,
*  when I read Ayn Rand, there was no internet, and I was in Israel, so we were isolated,
*  and there was nobody else who shared their ideas. And you did feel that kind of isolation.
*  But Rourke gave you, to me, he didn't teach me about you're going to be isolated because
*  partially it's because I wasn't... Maybe I was humble, right?
*  You really thought you were Israeli.
*  When I read Atlas Shrug, I identified with Eddie Willis. When I read the fountainhead, I didn't
*  identify with Howard Rourke. How old were you when you read the fountainhead?
*  So I read Atlas when I was 16. I probably read the fountainhead when I was 16 and a half, 17,
*  something like that. That is an unfathomable crime. You read the fountainhead after Atlas Shrug?
*  If anyone listening to this... They should read fountainhead first.
*  If you read fountainhead after Atlas Shrug, that is a war crime.
*  No, for me, reading Atlas Shrug was much more important.
*  It is more important, but my point is I think the fountainhead in many ways is redundant in
*  certain aspects if you read Atlas Shrugged first. And because the fountainhead is such a masterful
*  book and such a personal book... I agree with that. So ideally, you would read the fountainhead.
*  That's what I'm saying, yes. And here's the other thing people don't appreciate. I'm sorry to interrupt
*  you. People think Ranzo is about politics, politics, politics, politics. The fountainhead
*  is not a political book. It's about... Well, she talks about politics in Mansoul, sure.
*  But it's about ethics, how important everyone has to have a moral code. That's the other thing why
*  people find Randolph putting. If you have young people who now find it very important to live a
*  moral life, who are like, what does that mean to have morality, to have ethics, to live with
*  integrity for people who have gotten a little older, who have made these little sacrifices,
*  who are like, I'm not going to fight at work. Do I really need to look for another job? Yeah,
*  my wife's kind of getting annoying, but am I going to make a fight about it? These little
*  sacrifices that they make every day. And big ones.
*  And big ones, absolutely. So when you have someone who's saying, forcing you to look in the mirror
*  and say, those little sacrifices, the big sacrifices made, you did the wrong thing and you're evading
*  that you betrayed your own conscience. That to many people, I think, is very threatening.
*  But this is why so many people say that Ayn Rand is for 14 year old boys.
*  Yeah, right. You'll grow out of it.
*  And there's a reason why it appeals to 14 is a little young, but 16, 18, it's because those are
*  the ages where we're still open to idealism. Idealism in a positive sense, to beautiful
*  things, to ideals, to seeking perfection, to seeking a great life. I think as you grow older,
*  most people become cynical. They give up on their ideals. Why? Because their ideals were wrong,
*  and their ideals failed. My parents were socialist when they were young. Those ideas failed. So where
*  do you go from socialism to your ideals? Cynicism, which is horrible.
*  Almost all adults out there are cynical. And that has failed idealism. And when they look at the
*  young people, they see their idealism. Oh, well, I was idealistic too. And they don't question the
*  idea while they're good ideals and they're bad ideals, they're right ideals and they're wrong
*  ideals. And that's why they attribute it to youth. So it's a threat to a lot of people, a lot of
*  people who it's too late for. For some people, it's too late to change their minds. And they know it.
*  And they're too invested in the job, in the wife, in the compromises.
*  In the comfort.
*  And they're too invested in the comfort. Too invested in compromise, too invested in comfort.
*  And they know that they shouldn't be. They know they should change. And these young people are
*  challenging that. And that is really, really scary for them. And that's why they reject it
*  without too much consideration.
*  One of the things, Rand, the working title for Fountainhead was Secondhand Lives.
*  And Rand had two definitions of selfishness in that book. One is selfishness in the sense of
*  my life is the most important thing. It's not the only important thing. My family would be number
*  two friends. They certainly are extremely high values, but you can't have these secondary values
*  without the first value.
*  But in the context of my life, right? Because your family might not be a value.
*  Right, you're right.
*  Right? You might hate your parents.
*  Sure. The point being selfishness. Then there's the other kind of selfishness,
*  which is Peter Keating, one of the villains of the book, which is he's selfish in that he's greedy.
*  He's looking out for number one, but he has no values. He has no sense of character. He just
*  wants to be wealthy. He wants to have a beautiful wife. He wants to have a big house. Why? He
*  couldn't tell you because other people have it and he wants to have it more than them.
*  His sense of reference is other people. He's living secondhand. The problem with that is
*  a lot of young people read Rand and when they start arguing online, they just start trying to
*  talk like Rand, whereas Rand would be like, be original, be an innovator. If you want to argue
*  for objectivism in Rand's views, take her ideas, articulate them in your own way, because that's a
*  good way of showing that you understand what she thinks. But what they end up doing is just talking
*  like her. It sounds dated and comical and that's going to be off-putting because it's like Rand
*  wouldn't expect someone else to sound like Rand. She's her own person.
*  She of course wouldn't view Keating as selfish in any sense because, or even greedy,
*  greed is a tricky word.
*  But he was selfish in the old school sense.
*  Yeah, he's selfish in the old, but even there, it's not as if he has some passion and he's going
*  after passion no matter what. I'm going to light sheet steel him. His passion is painting,
*  and he doesn't pursue his passion. He pursues what his mother wants him to pursue.
*  And he pursues money and he's completely second-handed in the sense that he follows
*  other people's values, not his own.
*  Can we actually just backtrack and can we define some of these ideas that
*  known for selfishness? Selfishness, egoism, egotism, greed. Basically all of those words
*  are seen as negative in society and Ayn Rand has been reclaiming in her work those words.
*  So can you speak to what they mean?
*  I think she's trying to be needlessly provocative. And it's off-putting. And on one hand,
*  maybe you want to be a provocateur because that gives you people like, what does this woman mean?
*  On the other hand, many people are going to be viscerally put off.
*  When Ayn Rand was on Donahue in 1979, he asked her explicitly, define to me the virtue of
*  selfishness, which is the title of her collection of essays as well. And she, this is Rand,
*  immediately says, use a different word, self-esteem. And it's like, yeah, it's like, why are you
*  championing this word, which has extremely negative connotations? Whereas if you just say,
*  and this is thanks to her and her work, my life matters, my values matter, I'm not going to
*  apologize for that. That is a lot less off-putting than this caricature of Rand, which is when people
*  hear I'm for selfishness, they hear, oh, someone's bleeding out in the corner, but I want to get a
*  Coke. That's nice. She condemned that. She says, I'm against this kind of sociopathy. That's
*  absolutely crazy. But that word selfishness-
*  It goes a mistake to be provocative in this one dimension, to go and to stick with it. I mean,
*  she's stuck with this idea of selfishness and so on.
*  This term. I often use terms for provocative effect.
*  Yes, this is true. You're a master, you're a scholar of the trolling arts.
*  Thank you, sir. But I think this is one example where the costs outweigh the benefits. And go
*  ahead, your turn.
*  Yes, I'm open to that idea, but I don't think that's right. When you actually dig
*  deeper into what people object to, they're not but objecting to the word. They're objecting
*  to the ideas. And she addresses this explicitly in the virtue of selfishness in the introduction.
*  Wait, hold on. I got to ask for clarification. You're saying they're objecting to the ideas,
*  but when they talk about her, they're not talking about her actual ideas. They're talking about the
*  caricature.
*  Well, sure. But the caricature is a defense mechanism, not to have to deal with the ideas.
*  So they create the caricature in order to ignore the ideas. And some of them do it consciously.
*  Like when people like Krugman and others do this, they know exactly what they're doing.
*  Well, Krugman is Ellsworth Toohey.
*  Yes, he's the perfect Ellsworth Toohey. And he knows Ayn Rand. He's read Ayn Rand.
*  And he knows she's the enemy in some sense.
*  Check out our episode with Krugman. I think it's number 90. It was a great conversation.
*  He didn't get as many views as me, but what are you going to do?
*  No, well, he got an OBA prize. So what you got?
*  I got a ticket to heaven. Sorry, Paul.
*  Yasser Al-Fatih has an OBA prize.
*  And Hitler was Times Man of the Year.
*  Yes. But that really bothers me when people bring that up. Are you really?
*  Yeah, Time of the Year.
*  It's called a joke, Michael.
*  Is it?
*  Man of the Year is not representative of good. It represents the most influential
*  person of that year. And Hitler was.
*  What were you upset about?
*  When people like, well, look at Time magazine. They called Hitler Man of the Year.
*  Like you're on set. They weren't saying this guy's awesome. They said,
*  this is the guy who moved out of the world.
*  They never sanctioned him in that sense.
*  It's not like he was Stalin.
*  I don't go out there.
*  Now that's who they like. Hitler's terrible. The Stalin guy. Oh, no, no, I'm not even joking.
*  The attitude between the attitude of people between Nazism or fascism and communism is stunning.
*  In my upcoming book, I have all the receipts how like the things that they were saying
*  about Stalin at the time are, if you look back, it's unconscionable. And these people
*  have had no accountability.
*  In the positive direction.
*  It's not even at the time. And we need to get back to the selfishness stuff.
*  But it's not even at the time. So I was once, I think I've told this story. I was in the green
*  room going on John Stossel show and saw a bunch of libertarians in the green room,
*  all hanging out. And this guy walks in, this young guy he walks in. And somebody says to me,
*  he's a communist. I said, what do you mean? They said, no, no, he's a card carrying
*  real member of the communist party. He's a communist. And I said, and that's okay with
*  you guys? And they go, yeah, yeah, nice guy. And I'm like, no, this is not acceptable.
*  Hold on. Let me quote Rand. Rand said,
*  she would rather talk to a philosophical party. Right? Did she not say this?
*  Yeah. But this is not a, this is, this is a communist in the context of 21st century.
*  Right? So, so I said, well, well, in, in a sense that we know exactly what we know exactly.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's so I'm like, this guy has the blood of a hundred million people on his hands.
*  I'm not letting him off the hook. So I get, I engage with this guy and, and, and literally
*  we get into this, you know, I'm, I'm telling him what I, what I think of his ideas and therefore
*  what I think of him. And the people from the wardrobe department come out and their chairs
*  are put aside and, you know, this little gladiator ring. It's like the libertarians are like sitting
*  there amused because to them it's just, you know, and I don't, you know, I'm not going to name names,
*  but to them it's just like, yeah, he's a communist. And I said, I said at some point,
*  I said at some point to them, I won't name names because I said at some point to them,
*  if somebody walks into a room and says, I'm a Nazi, do you just treat him as, okay, let's,
*  let's go hang out and get some drinks? I do. I don't. I do. Cause I wrote a book about this,
*  then you write. And I did talk to Nazis and I went to North Korea. Cause you were writing a book.
*  Yeah. Right. But, but you're not, you're not going to hang out with a Nazi or communist,
*  just like the regular person, right? To me, a Nazi and a communist are the same. I don't.
*  Okay. Please explain this. Cause first of all, anytime you have equivocation, I hate that
*  because I don't, I don't like equality. I think it's a bad concept. Sure. We're all sitting here as
*  Jewish people, right? We're from the, we're from the Soviet union to say these two things are
*  basically the same. It's a matter of life and death for all of us. We'd be dead under Hitler.
*  We're not doing so hot near Stalin, but we're still alive. Sure. So there's some very big
*  difference. Sure. So, so, so within the context. Hold on one more thing. There's also one very
*  big difference in that one has a lot worse of a brand name and the other does not, even though
*  the other should. It's a brand. Yeah. Yeah. So I, so I agree. So there's a context in which I would
*  fear Stalin more than Hitler. There's a different context in which I would fear Hitler. But as
*  ideologies, they are equally evil. Wait, wait, but not, not the same because the difference has
*  been communism and fascism, but as ideologies, they're equally evil. They both view the individual
*  as insignificant, unimportant, and they both basically want to kill any independent minded.
*  Well, you're equating communism with Stalinism. So you're equating. No, I'm equating communism.
*  I don't know what Stalinism is. I don't care. Stalinism is one version of communism. It's an
*  implementation. Communism is an evil ideology, no matter who practices it. I don't, I don't think
*  that's, I think that's too loose because here's one example. The first person who went to the
*  Soviet Union from the left and denounced it was Emma Goldman. She was an anarcho communist, right?
*  So she went there. She got deported from the United States. She went to Lenin to his face.
*  Hold on. Let me finish. You're already, you're already dismissing what I'm saying. Your body
*  language, your emotions. No, no. Listen to this. Humility, yeah.
*  Humility. History doesn't care about your feelings either. She goes to Lenin. She goes,
*  we're supposed to be about free speech. We're supposed to be about the individual freedom.
*  What are you doing? And he goes, free speech is a bourgeois extravagance. You can't have it during
*  a revolution. Too bad. She comes back to the West. Wait, he's right? Yeah. Oh no, you're correct.
*  Yeah, I just said, yeah, yeah. He's more consistent. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's more consistent.
*  She's a compliment. Yeah, you're right. Well, she comes back to the West. The big red Emma,
*  the big hero of the left. And she goes, you guys, this is a complete, she didn't say bad.
*  She was very ran and she goes, this is pure evil. This is horrifying. What they're doing to the
*  workers, which you supposedly care about, completely oppressing. And when one person described,
*  they go, when she got up to talk, it was a standing ovation. And when she was finished,
*  you could hear a pin drop because she wasn't some capitalist. She wasn't some bourgeois
*  conservative. She was as hard left for violent revolution as it gets. And so I don't think she,
*  as a communist, is an evil person. I think she is. Because if she wasn't evading, and with Rand,
*  and I think in reality, the essence of evil is evasion, is ignoring the facts of reality,
*  is putting your feelings ahead of your facts. She would realize that what was going on in the
*  Soviet Union was the inevitable consequence of her ideas. So she could have changed her mind.
*  She could have, coming back to the Soviet Union, said, these ideas are wrong. I now repudiate my
*  ideas, not just of implementation, but my ideas. And then I would have said, yeah, she'd been
*  mistaken before and now she's confronted reality. But if she stayed a leftist, if she stayed a leftist
*  to that extent, not just a mild leftist, but a leftist, then I think she's dishonest and therefore
*  immoral. Right? So- But you're using three words identically. You're saying dishonest
*  and moral and evil. And I'm- Okay, so evil is more, is an extreme form of immorality.
*  Sure. Of course. So okay, so she's immoral. The ideology she holds is still evil.
*  Maybe she's delusional. Because the ideology, she might be delusional.
*  But delusional and evil aren't the same. But she can be delusional. She cannot be delusional.
*  See, I'm willing to accept a delusion before she's gone to the Soviet Union and seen it.
*  Once she's gone to see it, I don't think that excuse holds anymore. I think now she's been
*  confronted and she's lying to herself about the implications of it. Logically, it's inevitable
*  that what happens in the Soviet Union has to happen in any communist context.
*  So to play a little bit of a devil's advocate here, is it logically inevitable? Is it, can you imagine
*  that there is communist systems where the consequences we've seen in the 20th century
*  are not the consequences we get? Imagine future societies under different conditions, under
*  the internet, different communication schemes, different set of resources.
*  As long as human beings are what we are. Now the Borg, you remember the Borg from Star Trek
*  or whatever the series was? Okay, nerd.
*  Yeah. I mean, I'm a nerd. Okay. The Borg-
*  It's the highest of compliments.
*  The Borg- In this household.
*  The Borg is the highest of lex.
*  The Borg is communist, right? The Borg is a different species. It has a different biology.
*  It has a business, different form of consciousness. Now whether such a being could survive evolution
*  is a question. Whether such a-
*  Well, ants, they don't have to be intelligent.
*  Yeah, but then the question is, can you have free will, human cognitive cognition and be a Borg?
*  I don't think so. But maybe, maybe in another planet. But human beings-
*  You gotta take the empty to meet the Borg.
*  See, human beings, no. Communism is anti- the reason communism's evil is it's anti-reality,
*  anti-human nature, anti-the individual, and therefore it is inherently evil. It cannot
*  result in anything good coming out of it. Only bad can come of it.
*  Do you think you could have predicted that before the 20th century?
*  Yes, and plenty of people did. It's not-
*  You know who did? Mikhail Bakunin. Mikhail Bakunin, who was an early communist, Marx's rival,
*  in 18- this is gonna be in my upcoming book. In 1860, he sat down and wrote an essay, goes,
*  What Marx is advocating is insane. This is gonna be worse than the Tsar. You're talking about
*  complete totalitarian nightmare. When you put this into practice, it's gonna be something we've never
*  seen before. It's a pure horror. He was a hardcore leftist.
*  Marx predicted it, right? We talked about this.
*  That's true, too. Yeah, yeah.
*  Marx at some point says certain people cannot be part of the proletarian. They have to be liquidated.
*  So this idea of mass murder and mass killing is not new to communism. It is an inherent part of
*  what it means. You're either proletarian or you're not. And in Marx, it's in Marx, right?
*  The individual doesn't matter. Now, he might matter in his utopia because he knows he's got
*  a marketing problem. See, Marx has a marketing problem because the fact is you have individuals.
*  How do you convince individuals to give up their individualism, to give up the individuality?
*  What you say is, well, we have to go through this difficult process to get to this utopia.
*  And in this utopia, I mean, he's very Christian. I mean, this is the other thing about Marx.
*  But the end time. Marx is very Christian in everything.
*  In his morality, in his collectivism, and in the end times. The end times for Marx is going back
*  to the Garden of Eden. The end time for Marx is you don't have to do anything. Food is just
*  available. Wealth is just available. You can do your hobbies. You can do everything. You can do
*  whatever you want, whatever feelings, whatever. So it's going back to Garden of Eden perspective.
*  So he knows what that is going to require. It's going to require this dictatorship of the
*  proletarian to get there. And he never tells you how we get there. There's no game plan.
*  It withers away. Yeah, yeah.
*  There's a dictatorship, then there's utopia. It's like the underpants. Step one dictatorship,
*  step two question marks, step three utopia. Yeah. And the question mark is where the action is,
*  right? Innihilate. Yeah, you yada yada the important part.
*  And people buy this garbage, right? So there's nothing of value in Marx. I mean, let me be very
*  clear. There's nothing. He gets capitalism wrong. He gets the proletarian wrong. He gets the workers
*  wrong. He gets the labor theory of value is wrong. There is nothing of value. There's nothing of
*  value in communism. It is a wrong unfitted to human nature ideology from beginning to end.
*  The clarity with which you speak is just not something I don't think I have that clarity
*  about anything. So I mean, it has to do with that thing that where everybody has something to teach
*  you. I just feel like I've been reading Mein Kampf recently, for example, for the first time.
*  Something to learn from Hitler? Well, there's a lot to learn from Hitler.
*  About the nature of evil, about wrong ideas, not about anything good, not about anything positive.
*  So yes, so that's probably a really bad example. Why is Hitler different than Marx?
*  That's a very good question. No, I get that. But in terms of ideas,
*  why is Hitler different than Marx? Why do we have to assume there's something to learn from Marx,
*  but there's nothing but we acknowledge that there's nothing positive to learn from him.
*  I mean, all right. I can tell you something in the sense that
*  there's an interesting question is how did this person get from step A to being able to implement
*  the ideas? I know everybody should read, anybody who's interested should read Marx because it's
*  really important. It's important in the history and a lot of people were influenced by it. Why
*  was it influential? What is it that he says that appeals to people? I find it interesting to see
*  all the parallels with Christianity. I think that's why to a large extent it appeals to people
*  because they got to give up the unimportant part of religion. You got to keep the fun parts of
*  religion, the important parts to them of religion, the morality, for example. But no, there's not
*  something positive to learn from everybody. In Ayn Rand's view, in your view, who was worse,
*  Stalin or Hitler? I think worse is this is something that I'll do a randy and sin and be
*  evasive. It really drives me crazy when people sit down and have these competitions about like
*  if someone who's Jewish brings up the Holocaust and someone who's African American brings up
*  slavery. And this is a conversation that I think is pointless and very hurtful and harmful. And it
*  is really like silly and ridiculous. So it might make sense in like some kind of stoner context
*  about like you're doing the math and trying to figure out, but it's like, you know, and yeah,
*  you could be like, what would you rather have like this kind of cancer or full-blown AIDS and
*  short, I mean, there's got to be life expectancy, but these are such, I'll evade your question,
*  reframe it. I think we understand and a lot of this is a function of the propaganda at the time,
*  and I'm not using the word propaganda in a negative sense, the horrors of Hitler and
*  Nazism. I think and one of the things I'm trying to solve with my upcoming book,
*  there is a very poor understanding about the horrors of Stalinism and what that meant in
*  practice. One of the reasons I wrote Dear Reader, my North Korea book and what I was
*  shocked and delighted by when I started writing Dear Reader, I thought to myself, look, I have
*  very little capacity to affect change, but I can tell stories, I can write books, this is my
*  competency. If I move the needle in America, we got it pretty good here. If I move the needle
*  in North Korea, this could have really profound positive consequences. And so I set a very limited
*  goal and that goal is to change the conversation about North Korea, to stop it being regarded as
*  a laughing stock and start regarding it as an existential horror. And the metaphor I use always,
*  and we brought up earlier, was the Joker, because people look at Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il, his
*  father, they look at a clown, this guy's a buffoon and that's valid. And I said, this is what I can
*  do, I can move that camera a little bit. And now that camera, instead of looking at Kim Jong-un,
*  Kim Jong-il, you see behind him literally millions of corpses. And when you see people putting on
*  these performances in these shows, look at these fools, then you're like, everyone, those people,
*  their kid has a gun to their head right now. If someone puts a gun to your kid's head, you're
*  going to put on clown makeup? Yeah, you are. What color? Put on the shoes, whatever you want.
*  So in terms of people do not appreciate the horrors of Stalinism, I think this is a big
*  fault of the right wing. You can't expect necessarily the New York Times to do this
*  because of the blood on their hands. And for a long time, I was berating conservatives. I go,
*  this was the big right wing victory, bloodless largely, the victory of the Soviet Union.
*  No one's talking about it. No one's informing. And let's be clear, there are very many people
*  who are Democrats who are on the left, who are violently opposed, literally violently opposed
*  to the Soviet Union, it's ours. This is not necessarily a partisan issue. And I'm like,
*  all right, I'm going to do something about it. So I know that's not really literally your question,
*  but that's kind of information that feeds into this. Let me ask you that question if it's okay.
*  So what, which do we can we learn more from from a historical perspective looking forward,
*  from like, which has more lessons in, in how to avoid it, how to end just general lessons
*  about human nature? Well, I mean, I agree with Michael that it's not important who's more evil
*  because they're both evil. And they're both just so evil that the differences don't matter. What
*  matters is what is the ideology? What is the what is what are the consequences? What do we
*  understand from it? What are we worried about? What are we going to avoid? So I'm not worried
*  about Nazism, Quo-Nazism, because everybody hates Nazism. I mean, it's uniform that that's out. Even
*  the people I think on the far right in America are staying away from the cliches of Nazism,
*  some of them are stupid enough not to. But, but in the end, if the United States goes
*  authoritarian, right, it's not going to be Nazism, it'll be some other form of fascism,
*  because that is so obviously, you know, being understood as evil and bad that
*  there's almost no understanding that the evil of communism. I mean, you brought it up earlier,
*  right? Almost nobody understands that communism is an evil ideology, that there's nothing worthwhile
*  there that any any attempt to go in that direction, in any sustainable way is destructive.
*  They are, as you mentioned, they're economists out there claiming they are communists. I mean,
*  I find that despicable that anybody would claim to be a communist economist or communist anything,
*  because I think that's, it's, it's a it's a ideology that has no basis, but we haven't
*  learned that. So to me, communism is the much bigger threat, because we still think it's some
*  kind of beautiful ideal in in the world around us. I think Nazism is out, but I think I think
*  fascism is a is a massive threat out there, because I don't think we've learned real lessons of
*  nobody knows what not fascism is. Everybody thinks fascism is Nazism, they don't they don't
*  recognize that in a sense, we already fascist, and there was certainly heading in that direction.
*  So they don't know what it is. And again, we haven't studied and the real lesson here is we
*  haven't studied what unifies them both, because there's not a big difference between fascism and
*  communism. There's no big difference between Nazism. What does unify them? What unifies them
*  is the common good, the public interest, what unifies them is this idea that there is some
*  elite group of people who can run our lives for us for the common good for the public interest.
*  And that you don't matter. You as an individual, you individual don't matter and they,
*  they will dictate how you live. And you know, so these are philosopher kings, it goes back to
*  Plato's philosophy. But it really unifies it think about communism, communism is about the sacrifice
*  of the individual to the proletarian. Who is the proletarian? It's this collective group here,
*  who represents the proletarian? Well, they have somebody has to somebody has to tell the proletarian
*  what they believe in because they don't know, because there is no collective consciousness.
*  You need a Stalin. And this is the point about Marxism. Marxism needs a dictator,
*  because somebody has to represent the values, the public interest, what's good for the public.
*  Nazism needs the same thing. Just Nazism replaced proletarian with Aryans, the Aryan race,
*  and you have exactly the same thing. You need a dictator to tell us what's good for the Aryan
*  people so we can do what's good for the Aryan people. So it's impossible to have a communist
*  system or a fascist system without a dictator naturally emerging. It's not it's not possible
*  to have a Georgia. It's absolutely impossible to have that on scale. You can certainly have communes
*  where people behave communistically. Because it's not inside the ideology that should happen.
*  Let's talk about fascism, because fascism, definitionally, is going to have a strong man.
*  I don't even know how it could be fascism without that. And let's talk what you said earlier on,
*  is about how people don't know what fascism is. Fascists don't know fascism is. So there's a
*  superb book by John Diggins from the early 70s called Mussolini and Fascism, the View from America.
*  So I find Mussolini to be a far more interesting figure than Hitler, because he had a much more
*  nuanced career. He was much more of an innovator. He was an intellectual. He was an intellectual.
*  Which is shocking because he always comes across as a buffoon. But he was actually a thinker.
*  Hold on. So one of the things with fascism is it comes, it's a direct line from Kant to Mussolini.
*  So basically, there is a philosopher who I adore, who I'm sure you don't, called Schopenhauer.
*  And Schopenhauer, the question became, Rand was not a particularly humorous person. She had some
*  moments of wit. There's a great moment when she was on Tom Snyder's show in 1980, I believe.
*  And she's talking about Kant. And she goes, Emmanuel Kant and all his illegitimate children,
*  if you catch my meaning, she mean all his bastards. But the host, Tom Snyder, did not pick up on it,
*  if you watch it on YouTube, you could pick up on it. And what happened was once Kant
*  bifurcated reality into the phenomenal world, the pure idea world and the numeral world,
*  the question became, well, what is the nature of this world of ideas? And Hegel had it meant reason.
*  I don't know even know what that means, theoretically, that the world of reason is idea.
*  And this is Schopenhauer, who hated Hegel, who constantly attacked him by name and
*  Hegel's followers in his work. He was a very big innovator in a malevolent way,
*  because he said the nature of reality, this idea is will, meaning the universe doesn't care about
*  you. And it's constantly in this reality, putting urges in your mind, values. And when you denounce
*  these values and urges, that's the basis of morality. And from there, it went to Nietzsche.
*  And the will isn't mindless, it is a will to power. Mussolini took this and basically said,
*  because the will to power is the real reality, the Kantian idea, therefore, all of this is
*  secondary. So if we will it, we can make it happen. When you have this concept of my willpower
*  is stronger than reality, and you're like, okay, how's this program going to work?
*  We can make it happen. That was why fascism is not a very coherent ideology, because explicitly,
*  there's a book called from 1936 called The Philosophy of Fascism, we tried to codify this,
*  36, this is a long time ago, where they're like, we're against reason, and explicitly rationality.
*  We are for willpower, for strength. And if you are strong enough and united enough, you can force
*  these things to work. So there's a lot that is not taught about this ideology. I highly recommend
*  people read the books from the time. And what was fascinating about Mussolini is he was regarded as
*  the moderate. Because the 1930s, you had the Great Depression, all the intellectuals said, this proves
*  capitalism can't work. The Great Depression, obviously, air quotes, is capitalism's fault.
*  Then you have the alternative, the USSR. Well, that's not tenable for us. Here comes Mussolini.
*  And Mussolini says, I'm going to take the best of both worlds. I have aspects of markets,
*  capitalism, but I don't have this chaos. But I also don't have complete government control
*  of the bureaucrats. I'm going to have this combination. And there was a Broadway song,
*  You're the Top, you're Mussolini. That was later edited out, because that's when he took a bad
*  turn. But this is kind of the fascist idea. And it's about power and it's about control.
*  That's the essence. It's about will. So they don't care. Fascists don't care who owns stuff,
*  owns in quotes, because what's important is who controls it. So you can own your home. But if I
*  get to tell you when you can sell it, for how much you can sell it, and what you can do on that home,
*  then I'm in control of it. That's the essence of fascism. And if you think about it,
*  we live today in a much more fascist economic context than anything else. We pretend that
*  corporations are private. But when everything they do is regulated, who they can hire, how much they
*  pay them, when and how they can fire them, what they can do in their property, it's all control.
*  That's the way fascists start controlling everything. But it's not possible to have
*  checks on power and balance on power at the top of fascism or communist systems.
*  The question was whether in fascist systems or communist systems,
*  we're saying the dictator naturally or must emerge.
*  If I don't say emerge, the dictator is the one who makes the fascist system.
*  Yeah, fascism. Well, it could emerge because, for example, I think today in America,
*  we're moving much more towards fascism, socialism. And at some point, that manifest itself
*  in some kind of dictator. And the dictator might be different than a Mussolini or a Nazi. It might
*  be couched in some kind of pseudo-constitutional American pretense.
*  It would be a lot easier for a female to be a fascist dictator in America than a male,
*  because you have that softness. She's not going to come off as a strong woman. People won't see it
*  coming, in my opinion. I think it's going to be a nationalist,
*  religionist, environmentalist. I think somebody who can combine those three.
*  Well, Hitler did those, yeah. Yeah, exactly.
*  Somebody who can combine those three and articulate the case for it, I think America is ready for it.
*  You think it's possible for fascism to arise in the world again?
*  Oh, of course. It never went away. It never went away.
*  They just adopt the name.
*  Because the fundamental ideas, the Kantian ideas, the ideas that are behind fascism never went away.
*  They're still as popular, if anything, more popular than they were back then. Marx is as popular.
*  I think these ideas are prevalent. They're out there. And absolutely, I think America is ready
*  for them. Again, it won't be quite in the form that we've experienced in the past. It'll be in
*  a uniquely American form, casted a flag. Of course, it was casted a flag before.
*  But no, yes, some form of authoritarianism is necessary because the fundamental principle behind
*  both communism and fascism is the unimportance of the individual. The individual is nothing.
*  The individual is a nobody and the importance of the collective.
*  The collective will, the collective soul, the collective consciousness.
*  But the collective has no will, has no soul, has no consciousness.
*  Somebody has to emerge to speak for the collective. Otherwise, everything falls apart.
*  So it's necessary, whether it's a committee or whether it's one person, how exactly,
*  somebody has to speak for the collective.
*  Even a committee doesn't function as a committee. Most committees,
*  particularly when the committee is about dictating how people should live, somebody is going to,
*  because now it becomes really, really important, somebody is going to dominate that committee and
*  rule over it because you don't want independent voices because the individual doesn't matter.
*  And also, people are naturally hierarchical. So if you have seven people and they ostensibly
*  have the same role, someone is going to emerge as a leader naturally and some people are going to-
*  Yeah, it's the same reason you cannot have the Richard Wolff type socialism of,
*  and this is the more, if you will, innocent part of his ideas. Oh, why can't we have corporations
*  all be worker owned and everybody votes on everything and we vote on who should be CEO?
*  And no, communism, fascism, most ideas necessitate ultimately authoritarians.
*  And that's most of human history we forget again. This idea of liberty, this idea of freedom,
*  even the limited freedom we have today-
*  It's a recent invention.
*  It's a recent invention. It happens in little pockets throughout history. We had a little bit
*  of this democracy stuff, partial, only a few, some people got to vote and it wasn't rights
*  respecting because they didn't have the concept of rights in Athens, right? You had a few Greek
*  cities. We maybe had a version of it in Venice, we had a version of it in city states around the
*  world. But then it was invented by the founding fathers in this country. That's what makes the
*  founding of America so important and so different and such a radical thing to have happened
*  historically. Freedom is rare, authoritarianism is common.
*  So I was looking at some statistics that 53% of people in the world live under authoritarian
*  governments.
*  Only 53. Oh, because India is democratic, so I guess they don't count India. But yes,
*  it used to be 100.
*  So how do we change that? How do we change that?
*  And even the authoritarianism in a country like China is a lot less than it used to be under Mao.
*  So they were better off than they were under Mao. That's a reality. How do we change it?
*  We have to change the ethical views of people. This brings us back to selfishness.
*  Because as long as the standard of morality is the group, others, as long as the standard of value is
*  what other people want, what other people think, as long as you are alive only to be sacrificed to
*  the group, that's why you have to challenge Christianity. As long as the Jesus on a cross
*  dying for other people's sin is viewed as this noble, wonderful act instead of one of the most
*  unjust things to ever happen to anybody, as long as the common good and the public interest are the
*  standards by which we evaluate things, we will always drift towards fascism, some form of
*  authoritarianism. Can I answer your question? I think there's something that has to go along
*  with what Yaron was saying and I know he's going to agree with me, which is technology.
*  Because if it becomes harder technologically for the authoritarian and more expensive for him
*  to input or force his edicts, that is going to create a pocket of freedom regardless of what
*  the masses think. And the masses, hold on let me finish, the masses as a rule are not going to be
*  able to think in general anyway. I have a much more elitist view of mankind than Rand does.
*  Let me give you one specific example, which I mentioned in my book, The New Right. Let's suppose
*  it's 1990, not that long ago, we all remember 1990 and we're having an argument about censorship.
*  And Yaron says, I want full freedom of the press, freedom of books, publish wherever you want,
*  whatever, free speech. And I say, well, what about books like Mein Kampf? What about, you know,
*  people read this, you have the wrong idea. What about child pornography, things like this? Like,
*  where are you going to draw the line? And we could argue along. Lex appears from the future
*  and he goes, hey guys, this conversation is moot. And we're like, Lex, you look exactly the same.
*  I'm like, yeah, of course, robot stone age. And you go, I'm from the future. And I go, wait a
*  minute, black president? And you go, look, this conversation is moot because in a few years from
*  now, you will be able to send any book anywhere on earth at the speed of light. You can make
*  infinite copies at, in one second. And you could send it to anyone such that
*  they can only open this book if they know a magic word. And I go, well, how much is this going to
*  cost? Oh, it's free. And I go, wait, wait, you're telling me I can make infinite copies of any book
*  and teleport them at the speed of light anywhere for free. And you would say, yes, we would think
*  he's insane, but that's the status quo, right? So technology has done far more to fight government
*  censorship of literature and ideas than has spreading the right ideas. So when you have
*  things like crypto, which makes money less accessible than a gold block in your house,
*  when you have things like people being able to travel quickly, those are also necessary
*  compliments to having the right ideas. And Rand herself said that she couldn't have come up with
*  her philosophy before the industrial revolution. So as time goes forward and we have more technology
*  and we have more discourse. But for a very different reason. Sure. But it's also a lot
*  easier to persuade people the right idea. So I kind of agree. Maybe I'm more pessimistic or
*  maybe I don't get the technology completely. That's because you're a boomer. There you go.
*  Okay, boomer. I get that a lot. I think I'm the last year of the boomer generation. I think I hit
*  that last year. It's a mindset. There you go. I love you so much. So the reason she said she
*  couldn't have developed her philosophy without the industrial revolution is the link between reason
*  and wealth was not obvious before the industrial revolution. For example, it's not obvious to
*  Aristotle. Aristotle doesn't see the link between rationality and wealth creation. Business is low.
*  Money is barren. Interest has no productive function. Bankers don't have. So you had to see
*  it existentially to be able to see reason is the source of wealth creation. So I think that's a
*  little different. Now, there is a sense in which, yes, technology makes it more difficult for
*  authoritarians to achieve their authoritarianism. I'm not convinced that they can't. But I think
*  I'm not convinced that they can't. I didn't say can't. I didn't say can't.
*  Yeah. So at a certain point, I'm just saying it becomes more expensive.
*  It becomes more expensive, no question. It becomes more expensive. And we're still beings that live
*  in a physical reality. Therefore, they can still harm us in this physical reality.
*  But let me say this. It's going to sound as absurd. If there was technology that we could
*  teleport anywhere on earth at the speed of light, that would certainly go a long way towards
*  hurting authoritarianism. Sure, if there was some way to go.
*  Sure. Because they could teleport, too. And this is, of course, the danger of
*  they can use the technology, too. Sure, absolutely.
*  Look at what the Chinese are doing with social scores and with monitoring people and cameras
*  everywhere. So there's a sense in which you probably had more privacy before some of this
*  technology. Oh, absolutely. So it's not obvious to me that... So to me, it's all about ideas.
*  And if we don't get the ideas right, technology will be used for evil. Yes, and it will allow some
*  of us maybe to escape for a little while in some realms, but others not. Iran and North Korea do
*  a pretty good job shutting themselves away from technology, although a lot gets through in the
*  Iranian, at least with Iran. I don't know about North Korea, how much gets through.
*  It's real undermining them, which is wonderful. Yeah, which is great. So yes, but it's more than
*  that. And this is what leads me to be optimistic. It's that we live in a world today where
*  7 billion people basically have access to all of human knowledge, all of human knowledge. It's not
*  like in Rome. When Rome fell, all of human knowledge disappeared. Now, some of it escaped
*  to Byzantines. Some of it Byzantines had and ultimately landed up with the Arabs and
*  found its way back into Western civilization through them. But a lot of knowledge disappeared,
*  just wiped out. How to build a dome, how to build a big dome. How to have, you know, in Pompeii,
*  they had faucets, running water and faucets. They didn't have faucets for another thousand years.
*  A lot of, they couldn't build tall buildings once Rome came down. The Great Pyramid of Egypt was the
*  tallest building on earth till like 1840. It was crazy. Rome was a city of a million people.
*  Other than China, there wasn't another city of a million people in the West until London in the
*  19th century, 1500 years later. So it all disappeared because all of it was concentrated
*  basically in one place. Today, none of that exists because of the internet, because of universities
*  everywhere, institutions. I mean, think about how many engineers there are in the world today
*  who have basically all, basically the same level of knowledge on how to build stuff.
*  So even if the United States went to some kind of dark ages, it's unlikely the whole world goes into
*  that kind of dark ages. So I am optimistic in that sense that the fusion of knowledge is so broad
*  today that other than wiping out all electricity on the planet, everything electronic on the planet,
*  it's just, it's not going to be possible to control us all. And in that sense, technology
*  is going to make it possible for us to survive and to stay semi-free because I don't think full
*  freedom, but semi-free because full freedom, you need the ideas because full freedom means you need
*  some political implementation. No, full freedom means anarchy, but we know that.
*  We need to get into that because we can't leave without pointing out that we fundamentally disagree
*  about that. Oh, that's beautiful to be continued on that one. Let me ask about one particular
*  technology that I've been learning a lot about, thinking a lot about, talking about, which is
*  Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general, but Bitcoin specifically, which a lot of people argue that
*  the Bitcoin that setting ideas aside, when you look at practical tools that governments use to
*  manipulate as people is inflation of the monetary system within the monetary system. And so they see
*  Bitcoin as a way for the, for individuals to fight that, to go outside those specific government
*  control systems and thereby sort of decentralizing power. You know, there's a case to be made,
*  historically, of the 20th century that you couldn't have Stalin, you couldn't have Hitler,
*  you couldn't have much of the evil that you see in the world if they couldn't control the
*  monetary system. You couldn't have had the New Deal and FDR realized this very quickly.
*  Confiscated all the gold. Everybody knows FDR is going to come into, to become president and
*  if you confiscate the gold. So one of the mythologies, the myths about the Great Depression
*  is that there were all these bank runs that, well, bank runs happened because everybody was afraid
*  that FDR would get elected, confiscate the gold. So everybody ran to the bank and took the gold.
*  Little did they realize that he would confiscate their private holdings in their own backyards.
*  He would dig, he would force them to dig up the gold from their own backyards. But yes,
*  one of the first things FDR did in spite of denying it throughout the campaign, right,
*  he was asked about this over and over again and denied it. One of the first things was,
*  was take over the gold and take the United States, the Federal Reserve off the gold standard
*  so that they can in a sense print money and that he could start spending.
*  Yeah, what people don't realize, just to clarify what Yaron said is FDR,
*  this is something that's so crazy to us that we think, okay, I'm misunderstanding it.
*  FDR made it illegal for people to own gold unless it's like a wedding ring. And before that,
*  contracts, because inflation was a concern, I make a contract with Yaron.
*  With gold.
*  I said, okay, you're either going to pay me in $1,500 for my work or the gold equivalent,
*  because if that $1,500, you know, why am I Germany and you have hyperinflation,
*  I don't want that $1,500, just give me the gold bullion. And FDR said all of those clauses,
*  he broke every contract. They don't matter. So now, if I say,
*  Yaron says, okay, you owe me three feet of drywall and I go, here's three feet of drywall,
*  it's 12 inches. And you go, wait, wait, wait, three feet is 36 inches. I go, no, no, not anymore.
*  I was like, what am I supposed to do? And because you have, when you print more money,
*  the value of every individual dollar matters less, it becomes that much harder to plan anything,
*  either in the government level or in the private level. Because if I'm managing outlays,
*  if I'm trying to pay my workers, I'm trying to build factories, I'm thinking long-term,
*  and I don't know what this dollar is going to buy in 10 years, that puts an enormous incentive for
*  me to spend it now and not save it. Because if I save it, it's going to be worth a lot less.
*  And the worst thing about inflation, and this is something I think people who are pro-capitalism
*  don't talk about enough, they do talk about it, I would just like to see it more, this by far
*  hurts the poorest of the poor the most. When we came to this country, my mom told me they would
*  go to 86th Street in Bensonhurst with the fruit stands to buy Mikachka some grapes. And you go to
*  this fruit stand, and she'd walk all the way to the other corner, and if it was three cents more
*  a pound or less a pound, she'd walk all the way back because that three cents mattered. Now,
*  if I have this dollar and it's 5% inflation, whatever, and next year it's 95 cents, me and
*  you, the three of us might not care, but if I'm destitute hand to mouth and I've got 5% less,
*  that is really a material consequence of my life. So, inflation really is evil because it hurts the
*  people for who those pennies matter. Well, one of the ways the government gets around that,
*  and it's because they get smart to that, is they index everything. So, they index social security,
*  they index welfare, they try to make sure, but that only makes you more dependent on them.
*  And the people in the modern context that inflation hurts the most are savers,
*  people trying to save money, and Fed policy right now is just horrific if you're a saver,
*  because the Fed is at the interest rates are zero, you get nothing on your saving, and
*  cost of living is going up, maybe not at a huge level, but it is going up, and yet you can't even
*  save to keep the value of your dollars. And the government controls, and this has massive perverse
*  effects because it's not just the prices go up, it's the prices don't reflect reality anymore.
*  So, some prices go up, some prices might not. Investments get distorted, things get produced
*  that shouldn't get produced. And then people like Richard Wolff turn around and blame all the
*  distortions and the perversions and the crashes and the financial crisis on capitalism, not on
*  the fact that the Fed, look at the financial crisis. Financial crisis was caused, you could
*  argue by inflation, and we could get into that if you wanted, but that's probably a three hour show
*  just that. It was caused by the Federal Reserve, and yet who got blamed for the financial crisis?
*  Who would Richard Wolff is going to jump up and down? This is a crisis of capitalism,
*  this was caused by capitalism. But capitalism is the negation of the Fed. Capitalism says there
*  should be no Fed. That's item number one on the list of the things capitalists want, is to get
*  rid of the Fed and then grant you guys your wish, have competition for currency, and let's see if
*  Bitcoin wins. I'm skeptical, but I don't care. My point is under freedom, I don't care who wins,
*  I just want free choices and let the best currency win. I doubt that becomes Bitcoin,
*  but it doesn't really matter. If I'm wrong, great.
*  Let me add to this, and I think people appreciate, and this is a leftist, leftism at its best,
*  that the government and the banks are in bed with each other. This I don't think is a particularly
*  controversial statement. Well, I don't like that statement. Let me just say why I don't like it.
*  I don't like it because it assumes that they're equal partners or that there's causality goes in
*  both directions. From day one, and this is really from day one of the establishment of the United
*  States, banks have been regulated by the state. The reason for that is primarily Jefferson and
*  others found as distrust of finance. From the beginning, banks have been controlled by the
*  state. Now, over time, if I'm controlling you, you won't have influence over me because I get to...
*  So yes, they get into bed over time, but I don't like it that they're in bed together.
*  One is dominating over the other, and the other is participating because what choice do they make?
*  I should explain to you how things work when you get in bed and it's not always equal.
*  Well, okay. So, let's talk about Safe Words, which is very Randy in topic. She doesn't like those.
*  I had to read that scene three times in the fountainhead as I couldn't read what I was reading.
*  I was like, no, because I looked at the back cover. I'm like,
*  a woman wrote this book in 1943. I must be misunderstanding the scene.
*  She sure had a lot of shades of gray.
*  Yeah. No, she hated that. Only black and white. No, but what I meant is 2008,
*  the bailout of Wall Street. Whereas in 2020, we saw every medium and small business under the sun
*  go under. There's not even a pretense that these are going to be bailed out. So the priorities of
*  the politicians, in my view, are always going to be towards powerful entities,
*  powerful corporations, and they're not going to be about the medium guy, the middle guy.
*  Let me just finish my point because I see you championing at the bit.
*  At the very least, if you have regulation, people influencing each other. With Bitcoin
*  and with crypto, that is not a possibility. You do not have any agency who is king of Bitcoin,
*  who is the Federal Reserve of Bitcoin. There is no organizing management team. Now, you could say
*  this is a bad thing, but you can't say that this is a different thing to money as opposed to the
*  Federal Reserve system. Yeah. So I agree with that description of Bitcoin, my problems with Bitcoin
*  elsewhere. Let me just say about the financial crisis. I don't like it phrased that way again.
*  They let Lehman go under and destroyed Lehman Brothers. In the past, they destroyed
*  Drexel Burnham because they didn't like Michael Malkin. They are vindictive.
*  Yes. It's not an accident that the Treasury Secretary at the time was an ex-chairman of
*  Goldman Sachs, not Lehman Brothers, and Goldman hates Lehman. And the next day, they bail out AIG.
*  What I got out of financial crisis more than anything, and by the way, there wasn't a bail
*  out. So it wasn't even a bail out because they gave money to every bank whether they had problems
*  or not. And indeed, I know several bankers, including big banks like JP Morgan and Wes Fargo
*  and a friend of mine, John Allison of BB&T, who told them explicitly, we don't want your money.
*  We don't need your money. And they were basically a gun was put to their head and they said,
*  you don't take the money, we'll shut you down, basically, the equivalent of that.
*  And so they wanted a virtue signal. So there's a big virtue signal. We're taking care of things.
*  Don't worry. We've got everything under control, even though they were completely panicking and
*  they had no clue what they were doing. One of the things that the financial crisis really
*  illustrated was how pathetic, ignorant, and incompetent the people at the top are. And they
*  knew it. And they, you know, so Paulson goes to Congress, give me $700 billion. Don't tell me how
*  to use it because I have no clue. Just give it to me and give me your authoritarian power to do it
*  any way I want. And that was not out of a sense of grandeur. That was a sense of panic. He had no
*  idea. He had no clue. None of them did. They bailed out everybody they could, everybody under the,
*  you know, within the periphery. When they thought it was appropriate, they were
*  vindictive about some people like Lehman. It was complete arbitrary use of power.
*  The bankers didn't benefit from this. Indeed, many bankers who took their money lost from it.
*  Bank stocks got crushed after the bailout. Before the bailout, bank stocks were doing okay. And
*  right after top was announced, bank stocks crushed because this was bad for banks. It wasn't good for
*  banks. This is just central planning gone amok. It's not them bailing out elites. It's them,
*  you know, throwing money at a problem without knowing what they would actually do and what
*  the consequences would be. Right. But the point is, sorry, where we agree, the focus will always be
*  on bailing out elites. It's almost- But little banks got money too.
*  No, I was saying that last year, there's no talk of saving Ice and Vice, saving Century 21,
*  saving all these other industries. But sure there were. If you look, it's just, sure there was. If
*  you look at what the Fed did, the Fed was bailing out third, fourth class businesses in all kinds of
*  areas that you wouldn't consider elitist areas. The PPP-
*  You're talking 2008? Yeah. No, I'm talking about now.
*  Okay. I'm talking about COVID last year. What the Fed did was unbelievable. The kind of bonds that
*  they were buying even 2008, even after 2008, I couldn't believe what they did last year.
*  PPP, the Payball Protection Program, was targeted at everybody. Everybody got PPP.
*  It's not about- I don't think it's about bailing out elites. It's about securing their power base.
*  And if they believe that securing their power base is Wall Street, then they'll bail out Wall
*  Street. They believe securing their power base is writing checks to restaurant owners all over the
*  country. They'll write checks to restaurant owners all over the country, which is what they did with
*  PPP. It's all about power for them. And it's whatever will achieve power, whatever will result
*  in power. I don't think it's about elites. I don't see elitism in the bailouts of last year.
*  I agree. I agree it wasn't last year. I'm saying that's one distinction between 2008 and 2020.
*  And I do think- just one more thing. I do think getting in good bed with the elites is a great
*  mechanism in general for maintaining one's power. Oh yeah. Yeah, that's not-
*  It's depending on how we define it. Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You mentioned there's some criticism towards Bitcoin. There's a lot of excitement about the
*  technology of Bitcoin for the resistance against this kind of central state pursuit of power.
*  So that's part of my criticism because I don't think it works. So yeah, I can imagine a world.
*  I can imagine- I'd love to see a technology evolve where money is competitive and it's
*  a financial instrument that the government cannot touch.
*  You think the state is too powerful in this Bitcoin?
*  I think two things. I think right now, and maybe this won't be true in the future,
*  right now I think crypto is ill- it cannot function as money right now. It just can't.
*  But it does. No, it doesn't. It functions as a mechanism.
*  It functions as a mechanism to transfer- it's a technology that allows me to transfer
*  fiat money from place to place, but it doesn't function because- and it can't because it's too
*  volatile. Wait, wait. I've sold things with Bitcoin. No, I know you have. But I can sell things. I can
*  buy things and sell things with my airline model. So there are lots of ways in which you can use
*  things as money, but it doesn't make them money. If you're using something as money, it's money.
*  So let me take something you- no. Okay.
*  So let me take something you said before and it contradicts I think Bitcoin. You said one of the
*  things about money is that it's stable. I know what it's going to buy tomorrow, right? This is
*  why we're against inflation because I know what the dollar today I can plan because I can't plan- I
*  don't know what Bitcoin is going to be with tomorrow. So I can't plan with Bitcoin. Bitcoin
*  is way too volatile to serve right now as money. Now the argument from Bitcoin is, yes, it's still
*  being adopted. At some point it'll reach a certain crucial mass.
*  High for Bitcoinization, yeah.
*  Yes. And then it will become money because at that point it can be used as money because they don't
*  have a stable value. Maybe right now it's not useful as money because I can't predict what- I
*  can't invest in it knowing what the value will be in five years. Right now it's an asset. It's not a
*  monetary unit. It's much more functions as an asset. Asset value can go up.
*  Oh, I agree. It's functioning much more as an asset than as money. That's not in dispute.
*  I agree with that completely.
*  So I don't think it's money. But I think it can compete as a money with something tangible.
*  So I think in a free market, some kind of crypto backed by gold would be more successful.
*  So Bitcoin folks argue that Bitcoin has all the same fundamental properties that does gold.
*  So it's backed by- there's a scarcity to it and it's backed by proof of work. So it's backed by
*  physical resources. So they say that's a very natural replacement of gold. It doesn't need
*  to be connected to gold.
*  So the two things that gold has that it doesn't have. One is gold is not finite. Gold supply
*  actually grows over time. Bitcoin at some point is truly finite. At least unless you count the
*  fact that you can split Bitcoins and create coins, but that's a whole other question.
*  So that's one. The second is that gold has value beyond its use as a currency, beyond its use as-
*  For jewelry and stuff.
*  Yeah. But you minimize that. But jewelry and stuff has been important for the human race
*  for a hundred thousand years. You can find jewelry in caves. For the cavemen,
*  design jewelry and wore them. So we obviously as human beings value jewelry a lot.
*  And almost all jewelry evolved to be made out of gold because whatever it is within us is attracted
*  to shiny gold in particular, shiny object generally. So there's something about gold that
*  appeals to human beings. There's some value that gold has beyond its being a currency.
*  It doesn't- it's not- Bitcoin doesn't. Now it's not enough to use it as money. Lots of things
*  appeal to human beings. But those are two characteristics. One, that it's not finite.
*  And second, that it is a value beyond that Bitcoin doesn't have.
*  Don't you think the finiteness could be framed as a feature, the scarcity of Bitcoin?
*  No, because I think it creates a real problem with scarcity economically. It's the issue of
*  planning. There is a mechanism, there's a beautiful mechanism in markets that as the supply of gold
*  in a sense the quantity of gold is- prices are going down because there's too little gold.
*  So the value of gold in a sense in dollar terms, the prices are going down. What happens then is
*  there's an incentive to then go mine for more gold because it becomes cheaper and cheaper to mine
*  as the price goes down. So you mine for more gold. So it keeps increasing and it keeps increasing,
*  basically very correlated to the rate of increase in productivity.
*  That's the beauty of gold mining because prices are related to gold. Gold is the dominant money
*  and it increases at about the same rate as productivity. So it keeps these- it keeps
*  prices relatively stable. You still have bouts of inflation and deflation, but it keeps it
*  relatively stable. With Bitcoin it's finite, it ends. Now prices will only decline. What
*  rate will they decline at? They decline at the rate of productivity increases.
*  It's hard to predict the rate at which productivity increases. For example, technological shocks can
*  change that dramatically. You could get bouts of dramatic deflation, dramatic price drops that could
*  be problematic in terms of planning the same problem of inflation just reversed that you had
*  before. So again, it's a technical issue. I'm sure there are ways to get around it. And again,
*  I'm not sure. I don't know if you guys consider Bitcoin the end or the beginning. Is Bitcoin it
*  or is Bitcoin just the first example of a technology that might evolve in the future?
*  I was just going to say there's the same technological issue with regard to gold,
*  which is we now have the technology that was very expensive to turn elements into different elements.
*  And at a certain- yeah, you could fire electrons at it or whatever. You can make gold. They figure
*  out how to do it. It's not cheap and it's called big process. If gold is the standard,
*  a lot of resources are going to be going toward turning other things into gold,
*  making the production of gold cheaper. And that's going to have a similar consequence.
*  That's kind of the category of security that Bitcoiners talk about that it's very difficult
*  to do that with Bitcoin. But I would argue that it's exceptionally difficult to do that with gold.
*  It is now. But the thing is there's not a huge incentive. If gold is the basis and if gold is
*  worth that much- But gold isn't worth that much. Gold is worth-
*  I'm saying in this world that we're talking about-
*  In the future, yeah. In the future, yeah.
*  Gold is not going to be worth- Let's say right now, gold is about 2000 bucks. It's less than 2000.
*  Let's say it's 2000 bucks. That's its price in terms of dollars. So it would have to be worth
*  you while to create something of $2000. How much would you be willing to put into it?
*  At some point, you're right. And at that point, I think gold stops being money because it's useless.
*  Once I can create it like silicon, then once I can make out official gold. So I don't think
*  Bitcoin is the solution. I don't know what the solution is. I wish I was that innovative.
*  But I think you need a solution that has more of the characteristics of gold
*  than Bitcoin currently has. And I guess I'm surprised at a lot of the technologists
*  who view Bitcoin as the end game, where it strikes me as it represents the birth of a new technology.
*  And who the winner in that technology is going to be, we have no clue.
*  Bitcoin is one of the players. The other players, there might be a new technology that is even
*  better than anything we can imagine right now. So Bitcoin doesn't strike me as optimal.
*  Can you please stop shilling randcoin for five minutes?
*  You know where there was randcoin? South Africa.
*  No, I was-
*  Debit currency is the rand. No, that's true.
*  No, I mean-
*  Iron rand is the South African one dollar. Yeah.
*  Iron randcoin was, I was in China in 20, I think it was 2015 or 14. What's that?
*  China.
*  China. I was in China, something like that. And this entrepreneur came up to me, she said she's
*  bought this massive quantity of land in this area in China, it's a little secluded. She's starting
*  what she's calling Gold's Gulch. She's serious. And she's issuing, and she issued cryptocurrency
*  based on the land, right back by the land called rand, but iron rand with a little portrait of
*  iron rand, you know, a little portrait in the, in the, in the marketing. I don't think it went
*  anyway. You're not going to be a janitor? A janitor in China at Gold's Gulch.
*  Yeah. By the way, I do want to point out something I do enjoy about Objectivist.
*  I constantly talk about Anne Rand and her vampire novels.
*  Anne.
*  That's the joke, Yaron, thank you. And inevitably, someone feels the need to point out that she did
*  not write vampire novels and her name is actually Anne, so thank you, Yaron. We've been talking for
*  two hours, I own her copy of the found head, somehow I thought her name was Anne, thank you.
*  Thank you. Anne is an anthem.
*  So this is really interesting way of phrasing it, which is-
*  I was kidding with the I. I know you knew how to pronounce it.
*  I know you know you know.
*  It just got confusing.
*  I think we all know, and we all know there were jokers here.
*  We're all one.
*  There's no Batman in this conversation.
*  So it's an interesting way to frame it, is Bitcoin the end or the beginning of something. And
*  I've, as sort of with an open mind and seeing kind of all the possibilities of technologies out there,
*  I also kind of thought that Bitcoin is the beginning of something. But what the Bitcoin
*  community argues is that Bitcoin is the end of the base layer, meaning all the different innovations
*  will come on top of it. Like for example, there's something called lightning network, where it's
*  basically just like gold is the end and everything is built like the monetary systems like cash and
*  all that is built on top of gold. Bitcoin is the end in that other technologies are built on top
*  of Bitcoin. That's their argument and-
*  I get that and I hear that all the time. And I just, I don't quite understand that. And I
*  think Bitcoin has limitations that potentially other cryptocurrencies might not have.
*  I, you know, my attitude towards something like this is, to a large extent, I don't understand
*  technology. My view is, let it play out. I think I have more fear of physical, the ability of
*  the government to crush these things than I think many in the community. So for example,
*  so I gave a talk, Bitcoin, you know, and they were hyping the acceptance now, a lot of vendors
*  are willing to accept Bitcoin and this is great. And I said, yeah, it's absolutely great. More
*  options is better than few options. But I said, you know, that that could be taken away like that.
*  Now it's true that we could exchange Bitcoin and the government wouldn't know, I think,
*  wouldn't know that we do. But once he's advertising on his website that he accepts Bitcoin or once
*  he tries to turn his Bitcoin into particular goods, once you manifest it in the physical world,
*  now the government can step in. So the government could say, you can't sell anything to anybody
*  using Bitcoin. They can do that and you won't be able to sell it. It will be, you have to go
*  into the black market. So- But that isn't able to sell it, just to just sell it in the black market.
*  Yeah, but that's where the government thrives, right? The government thrives on letting you
*  do stuff in the black market so they can decide when to put you in jail or not, right? So if I'm
*  buying a sweatshirt from the government, sorry, if I'm buying a sweatshirt from somebody using
*  Bitcoin, the government can't monitor my exchange of Bitcoin to him, but they can monitor the
*  sweatshirt being sent to me, right? That's where they can interfere. And I think that at some point,
*  to the extent Bitcoin is successful, it will be stopped. And that's what will stop it from
*  becoming money. See, money can only become money, it can only become money if people are using it
*  as money, right? And if the government can stop it being used, if I can't go to the grocery store
*  and use my ATM that charges on Bitcoin or whatever, then it's not money. And I think that the government
*  is going to step in and stop people from doing that. And that's what I- So I have more respect
*  and fear for the power of government today. I don't see that at all. However, I could be wrong,
*  and I'm sure Yaron hopes he's wrong. Absolutely. I hope the government just gives in and the Fed
*  tomorrow says, yeah, let Bitcoin thrive. But I think they'll want to regulate and control it.
*  The only way to regulate and control it is to stop it. Yeah, there's a bunch of people who argue
*  that Bitcoin is too compelling to government that they'll actually embrace it. But that issues
*  government has positive goals and wants to do good things. You can ask- No, no, it's greedy.
*  They say government is greedy because they, where Bitcoiners have this whole lingo, they say number
*  go up. Government is not greedy. Government is not greedy for money. Government is greedy for power.
*  Government is greedy for control. Government is much more- Now, money's good too. They'll take the
*  money if they can get it. But it's not fundamentally about money. It's fundamentally- And this is
*  something that many libertarians don't understand. This is something many of the Bitcoin community
*  don't understand. They have far too benevolent a view of politicians and the people in government
*  today. By the way, I'm a liar. And I know why he's laughing. I think I know why he's laughing.
*  You know exactly why I'm laughing. Yeah. And we should get to that issue at some point here.
*  But so I think there's a lot of naivete. Yeah, there's a lot. Speaking of naivete.
*  A lot of it, Yaron. No, I'm not naivete. I'm actually providing the warning and all these
*  Bitcoiners are saying, no, no, no, government doesn't function that way. No one says I'm naivete.
*  Naive people think they're not naivete. So let's put this on the table. Speaking of naivete,
*  I still, more than the two of you by far, I think, have faith that government can work.
*  Okay, let's put that on the table. I got it. I'm not trying to be pedantic. What do you mean work?
*  Government can achieve goals. That is not in dispute. Can achieve goals effectively to build
*  a better world. Okay. A functioning society. So I'm going to take it one step further than you.
*  Oh, boy. The only way to achieve a better world is through government. Michael, what do you think
*  about that? He almost dropped. And I said it on purpose that way. I'm glad that the mask is
*  dropping. You cannot achieve, you cannot have liberty or freedom without a government. Now,
*  not anything like the governments we have today. So I think the idea that you can have liberty or
*  freedom without government is the rejection of the idea of liberty and freedom and the
*  undermining of any effort, any attempt to do it. So in that sense, I do it to you, Lex. I know,
*  exactly. On this side, we're in agreement with Lex, which is unusual. That government is good
*  for freedom. You're in agreement with the guy who's reading my comic. That's not a surprise.
*  Who's dressed in black. Yeah. That's the bad guys. No. The fascism, I mean, the road to fascism is
*  anarchy. It's not. What the hell are you talking about? Can you give me one example of when
*  anarchy led to fascism? Well, every example of a stateless society leads to authoritarianism,
*  every single one in all of human history. It has to. Wait, you're saying why Germany was anarchy?
*  Well, it wasn't pure anarchy, but it got close. But no, I said the reverse, by the way. I said
*  the reverse. I didn't say that every form of authoritarianism started with anarchy. I said
*  that every situation in which human beings lived under anarchy led to authoritarianism. So I said
*  the flip. Anarchism isn't a location. Anarchism is a relationship. The three of us are in an
*  anarchist relationship. Every country is in a relationship of anarchy toward each other.
*  The US and Canada have an anarchist relationship toward one another. And to claim, you know,
*  going back to Emma Goldman, who I love, in 1901, William McKinley, President McKinley,
*  was shot by this guy, Leon Salgas. And it was very funny, but he was a crazy person.
*  And they arrest him. He shot the president and they go, why did you shoot President McKinley?
*  And he just goes, I was radicalized by Emma Goldman. And she's like, oh, god damn it.
*  So now she's on the lam. She had nothing to do with this guy. She's trying to flee. She gets
*  arrested. They caught her. And she said, and this is the hubris of this woman, which I admire
*  as the subject of Be Good and Hubris, she goes, I'd like to thank the cops for doing what they're
*  doing. They're turning far more people into anarchism than I could do on my own. So given
*  everything you've said in these two hours, and then to pivot to being anti-government is being
*  anti-liberty, I don't feel I have to say anything. Well, okay. For people who are not familiar, if
*  you're, I don't know why you would not be familiar, but Michael Malice talks quite a bit about the
*  evils of the state and government and espouses ideas that anarchism is actually, what is it,
*  the most moral system, the most effective system for human relationships? There's this great book
*  called Outlast Shrugged, and the author posits an anarchist private society. She calls it Galt's
*  Gulch, where everything is privately owned and everyone is, no one is in a position of authority
*  over anyone else other than the landowner. That's an anarchist society. There's one judge
*  and one authority. Yeah. And that's what everyone has voluntarily moved there and agreed to be under.
*  It's a very small community, right?
*  That is right. So I have no problem with competing governments.
*  That's the definition of anarchism.
*  What's that?
*  That's the definition of anarchism. Case Clays. Okay, end the show.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  End the show. I got him. I got him over.
*  You're not definition of, not definition of anarchy at all. I'm all for competing governments.
*  Get more cookies. Good job. He did it. He did it. Yay, Aaron. You brought him over. Red Rover.
*  More Lithuanian.
*  What is this class chat?
*  Lithuanian. That's my people.
*  Tulski, Jasnaya Poljana, Miodem, Honey.
*  No claims of health.
*  The other one claimed health. This one no claims.
*  No, I'm for competing governments on different geographic areas. That's fine.
*  Why does it have to be over... Okay, let me...
*  It's really crucial that it's on different... So you don't have two judges in Gulch, Gulch. You
*  have one. And there's a reason one. There's one authority. There's one system of laws
*  in Gulch, Gulch that all the people under the Gulch abide by. There's one.
*  There's two because they're in America.
*  No, they're not. The whole point is they're not.
*  They're not in America. They're in Colorado.
*  I know, but the whole point of the novel is they've left America.
*  They haven't left America.
*  They've hid themselves. So they're not under the authority of the American government.
*  But they are. Don't you get it?
*  But they're hidden. They're supposed to be completely hidden.
*  The point is that they're hidden so they're not under the...
*  No, no, no. If the three of us hide, we're still under the authority of Washington.
*  Not if they don't know what that means.
*  But this is why they haven't established a state and it's not a government and it's not in that
*  sense an example of really the way we form societies. It is a private club that is hidden
*  away from everybody else.
*  Fine. I'm fine with that. What happens if an American kills a Canadian in Mexico?
*  What happens in America? It depends. It depends on the nature of the governments of the three
*  places. But usually what happens in most of human history is that America will launch a war either
*  against Mexico or Canada.
*  So usually violence results in much more violence. Anarchy is just a system that legalizes violence.
*  That's all it does. In international affairs, that's the reality. The reality is that the way
*  you resolve disputes, that are major disputes, is through violence.
*  Ayn Rand said the definition of a government is an agency that has a monopoly of force in a
*  geographical area. So you can't complain that anarchism is legalizing violence when the
*  definition of government, according to Rand, is legalized violence.
*  No, but because you're taking the definition of violence the way she defines it, right,
*  in this context. A, she talks about retaliatory force only.
*  Has that ever happened?
*  That's not the point.
*  That is the point.
*  Before there was Aristotle, it was in Aristotle. Before there was in America, it was in America.
*  The fact that something has never existed means that it will never exist before.
*  The fact that the ideas haven't been developed to make something exist means that it will never
*  exist before. Human race is a young race. The ideas of freedom are very young. The ideas of
*  the Enlightenment are just 250 years old. The idea that you can't create the kind of government
*  Ayn Rand talked about, I talk about, that it's never been before means it will never happen
*  again. That's a silly argument.
*  It's not a silly argument. It's you're being a Platonist.
*  No, not at all.
*  I'll explain to you how you're being exactly a Platonist.
*  So if I was sitting in 1750 arguing with Thomas Jefferson, he was telling me what kind of state
*  he was going to create, and I said, is a state like this ever been created? And he said,
*  no, was I being a Platonist? Of course not.
*  No, you're being a Platonist.
*  Things change.
*  You're being a Platonist now. Here's why you're being a Platonist now.
*  Because one of the things that Aristotle believed in, one of the things that Ayn Rand
*  in other contexts believed in, the cover of her book, The Philosophy Who Needs It,
*  I think it's the Sistine Chapel, the cover, or wherever it is. It's Aristotle and Plato walking.
*  What's that painting? I forget what it is.
*  It's School of Athens.
*  School of Athens, thank you. So Plato's pointing toward the heavens while they're talking,
*  and Aristotle's pointing to the earth.
*  Reality.
*  Reality.
*  Absolutely.
*  So if you want, there's two approaches. There's the Descartes Cartesian approach,
*  which is I sit in my armchair and I deduce all of reality. Or if I want to study the nature of man,
*  if I want to study the nature of dogs, if I want to study the nature of the sun,
*  I have to look around. I have to open my eyes. I have to look at data. It's very difficult.
*  When Rand was on Donahue, he asked her about, aren't you impressed with the order in the
*  universe? And she goes, oh, now you have to give me a moment. And the point she made,
*  which was very hard for many people to grasp, it's hard for me to grasp,
*  is one's concept of order comes from the universe. You can't have a disorderly universe
*  because order means describing that which exists and which has existed.
*  Now, if you are looking at governments throughout history that have always existed,
*  when you were on Lex, you said, what I'm talking about has never existed.
*  To say that this therefore, that that has a possibility of working in reality, I think is
*  certainly not a point in that favor, number one. And number two, Jefferson was a fraud.
*  What Jefferson argued how America would look did not come true. Jefferson's concerns about
*  the Constitution were accurate. And the fact is the federal government did become centralized,
*  did become a civil war. So if you told Mr. Jefferson, the government you're positing
*  can't work, you would have been correct. That's not what I'm saying. It's not the issue of can
*  it work or not. It's the issue of can something exist that hasn't existed in the past. It's a
*  silly argument. Now, we can argue about the fact of reality, whether such a thing can exist.
*  But to say it hasn't existed in the past is not an argument about whether it consists in the future.
*  But that's the argument you made. No, no, you're talking about history,
*  and now you're dancing around it. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. I'm saying that something different
*  happened in the founding of America. It might not have been perfect. It might not have been ideal.
*  It might have been some people even think it was bad, right? Something different happened.
*  Sure. And you could have said 20 years before and said, well, that's never happened before,
*  so it can't happen in the future. That is a bad argument. It's not a good argument.
*  No, but you're making the argument that just because something hasn't happened before,
*  that's certainly not a point to say it's likely to happen or possible.
*  No, I'm saying, first of all, I agree that everything we know about what's possible or
*  what's not possible has to be from reality. That we agree completely. I think anarchists completely
*  evade that point. I think you guys live in a world of mythology, of abstraction, of Descartes,
*  to imagine the kind of anarchy that David Friedman or Rothbard describe. It's complete
*  fiction and it's complete mysticism. Okay. Let me ask just a few dumb questions. First of all,
*  what do we do with violence in terms of just natural emergence of violence in human societies?
*  Sure. The idea that anarchism proposes is that we would, as the community grows,
*  there may be violence and then we together form collectives that fund mechanisms that resist that
*  violence. I'd love to talk about violence because that seems to be the core thing. That's the
*  difference between the state that was definitionally, I guess, is the thing that has a monopoly on
*  violence or controls violence in such a way that you don't have to worry about it. And then the
*  anarchism, I don't know. I'm using bad words. No, your definition is accurate, but the point is
*  that being the definition of the state versus how states act in reality is just absurd. Yeah.
*  So, and then the idea that anarchism will be is that it's more kind of a market of defenses against
*  violence. So you have security companies and then you hire different ones that are more competent.
*  You have things being made affordable. You have more accessibility to security. You have accountability
*  when people misuse their power and you have more layers of security than having a government
*  monopoly. Objectivists understand and they don't deny this. This is something they talk about
*  constantly is anytime you have a government monopoly, it's going to have enormous distortions
*  as a consequence. It's going to be expensive. It's going to be ineffective. And when you're talking
*  about ineffectiveness in markets, that's not just like the cup sucks. It often means mass death.
*  It often means persecution. So this is something that anarchism, if not entirely prevents,
*  certainly mitigates enormously. So can I just, as a thought experiment, say it was very easy to
*  immigrate to another country, like where you could just move about from government to government.
*  Would that alleviate most of the problems that you have towards the state, which is like people
*  being free to choose which government they operate under? Wouldn't that essentially be-
*  Last camp, yeah.
*  So like, what is, I'm trying to understand why governments aren't already the thing that's the
*  goal of anarchism. The kind of collectives that emerge under anarchism seems to be what government-
*  You're equating two terms. So there's something called like private governance and there's
*  government. So for example, if I go to Yaron's house and he has a rule, take off your shoes,
*  your house, if you want to really be kind of silly about it, you could say he's the governor.
*  But it's really nonsensical to say that. If you go to Macy's, right? If you want to return your
*  sweater, Macy's rules are right up there. You have seven days. If you don't have a receipt,
*  you're going to get store credit. If you do have a receipt, you get a refund. So every organization,
*  every bar, every nightclub, your house has rules of governments. This is often they're unspoken.
*  This is unavoidable. No one in America by law has to pay a tip, but it's just customary. You go
*  with the waiter, you give them 15, 20%, so on and so forth. Now, what anarchism does is it says,
*  okay, security is something that is of crucial, essential human need. We all need to be safe in
*  our property, safe in our purpose. The organization that by far is the biggest violator of this and
*  always has been, always will be, is the government. Why? Because it's a monopoly,
*  because it has no accountability. And look at the rioting last year, right? If you have one agency,
*  pretend it's not the government, pretend it's Apple. And Apple has the charge of security in
*  this town. People are rioting, people are looting. And Apple says, yeah, we're not going to send
*  people into work. And if you try to defend yourself, we're going to put you in jail as well.
*  That's the problem of having a government monopoly. And that's something that anarchism
*  solves for. So, okay. But don't you, because you said no accountability, don't you mean to say
*  poor accountability? No, I mean to say no accountability. But isn't that the idea of
*  democracies? I'm not for democracy. No, not for democracy, but like the system of governments
*  that we have, there is a monopoly on violence, but there is a, I mean, at least in the ideal,
*  but I think in practice as well, there's an accountability. I do not think I know you're a
*  critic of the police force and all those kinds of things, but the military is accountable to the
*  people. I do not agree. The police force is accountable to the people. I do not agree.
*  Perhaps imperfectly. I do not agree. But you're saying not at all. Not at all. And we've seen
*  many examples of police officers doing horrific things on video and they don't even lose their
*  pensions. But there's a lot of amazing police officers, no. You, I mean, no, there are not.
*  So you're saying by nature, police is like a fundamentally flawed system. No, by nature,
*  government monopoly and police is a fundamentally irredeemable system. We'll talk about private
*  security. If I have a private security firm, you could have that under a government. And as a result
*  of my private security, my person who I'm bodyguarding gets shot. That's going to be very
*  bad for my company as compared to competing companies. However, when you have a government
*  monopoly and I get people shot, what are you going to do? So the problem is that all the
*  examples are going to be within the context of an existing government. This is why I said the cell
*  phone example and all these other examples of us being here. We're not in anarchy. That is absurd.
*  We're under a particular system of law and the system of laws applies and we know that the
*  particular system of laws applies. So the problem is when you have- There are many laws that we're
*  not going to be enforced. Sure. We know that. Violence related? No, there are lots
*  of laws that are not going to be enforced. Right. That doesn't make this anarchy because
*  there are the laws out there. They could be enforced, which makes it an old system. But look,
*  there's a number of issues here. There's an issue of the role of force in human society.
*  I got to clarify a thing because I think you misunderstood what I said. I'm not saying that
*  America is anarchist. What I'm saying is the three of us have an anarchist relationship between us
*  because none of us have authority over the others. That's what I'm saying.
*  That's a bad use of the word anarchy. No, that's the correct use of the word anarchy.
*  It makes it meaningless. Every time any people get together, they have an anarchistic relationship.
*  Yes. No, we have a voluntary relationship. That's what anarchism means, volunteerism.
*  No, it doesn't. It's a political system. You want to get a dictionary out?
*  You're taking a word and it's accepted usage and then you're saying, oh no.
*  You mean selfishness? Maybe and we never finished that discussion.
*  You're taking a word that you're defining as replacing it with voluntary.
*  Okay, fine. I'm not for anarchism or voluntaryism. Go ahead.
*  But let's understand what voluntary means. So we, for example, going to stores and there's
*  a certain relationship that we have with a store that we engage in certain voluntary transactions
*  with that store. Now, I believe that that works because there is a certain system of law that
*  both the store and we have accepted that makes that possible. Now, if that didn't,
*  there are certain people who would like to walk into their store and just take the stuff.
*  We might not, but there are certain people who might want to go into their store. There's
*  a certain system of laws that regulates the relationship and defines the property rights
*  and then provides protection for the property rights. Now, you would like all that privatized.
*  That is, the store would have its police force and that would be privatized.
*  I don't believe that force can be privatized. I don't think it can.
*  That's an interesting distinction.
*  I don't think it can because I think that it's an unstable equilibrium. I don't think competing
*  police forces can work. At the end, the police force with the biggest gun always wins and always
*  takes over and becomes authoritarian. That's not true. Look at Iran and Iraq,
*  we had the bigger guns, we didn't win. Look at Afghanistan.
*  We didn't win partially because none of that is an example of anarchy.
*  You just said the guy with the biggest gun is going to win.
*  Yeah, the guy with the biggest gun is going to win.
*  We didn't win in Vietnam. We had the bigger guns.
*  But again, you're taking it outside of a context. That was a context in which
*  countries are fighting, not a context in which there is no country.
*  Let's suppose you, Yaron, have a rocket launcher and there's 100 people with handguns. How are
*  you going to win? You have the biggest gun. Oh, believe me, I could win.
*  With one rocket launcher against 100 people? Yeah, it depends how many rockets I have in
*  the rocket launcher and whether I'm willing to use them. Now it's democracy because there are
*  more of them that they win. Look, any one of these scenarios, all it does—so let's go back to the
*  store. This is fascinating, by the way. I'm really enjoying this. I just want to say that.
*  This is great. I'm glad you are. I am enjoying the pain.
*  And I'm also enjoying the comments that are going to happen.
*  Oh, the comments are going to be overwhelmingly on your side.
*  I don't think so. I don't think so.
*  I think the anarchist position is completely dishonest.
*  I'm a modern day—what's his name? What's the guy who is defending communism?
*  Oh, Richard Wolff. I'm a modern day Richard Wolff.
*  There's a sense in which I think anarchists are evading reality in the same sense.
*  Do you think I'm dishonest or delusional? Calling someone dishonest is really—
*  I think you're delusional.
*  I think you're delusional, and I'm going to give you the benefit of a doubt of being delusional.
*  Okay, good.
*  We all love each other.
*  And as I said on the show, on the previous interview, I said only smart people can be
*  anarchists because it requires a certain level of abstraction of being divorced from reality that
*  is hard for people who are actually connected to reality.
*  He makes a good point because I always talk about this with people on social media,
*  and they talk about a lot of people who buy into the corporate media narrative
*  and how they're dumb. I go, it's easier to train smart people than dumb people.
*  It's easier to convince smart people of the systemic that's divorced from reality
*  if somebody's dumb.
*  They can deal with it in abstraction. They don't have to deal with the concretes that actually happen.
*  Um, this is an example I gave debating another anarchist.
*  So—
*  Who was it? She must have sucked.
*  Well, you were the best.
*  They were Hopper fans.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Hopper fans, not one of my least like—the people I like least in the world out there.
*  You like them better than the communists, don't you?
*  Barely.
*  Oh, come on. Seriously?
*  Yes, because I think at least the same place. I really do. I think at least the gulags.
*  Fine.
*  I think anarchists at least the gulags.
*  And I think Hopper's view of anarchy definitely leads to gulags.
*  I'll grant you just for the sake of argument that it leads to gulags.
*  However, surely you concede that they are against gulags,
*  whereas the communists have no problem with it.
*  And that's a big—
*  Yeah. I think some do. I'm not sure—
*  That's fair.
*  I'm not sure people like Hopper do.
*  Because if you read some of his stuff, one wonders, right?
*  You know, once monarchies and he once—
*  No, he said monarchies are preferable to democracy, which is true.
*  No, it's not. Oh, God.
*  I mean, one of the problems with anarchists is—
*  One judge. That's the monarch.
*  You see, one of the problems— Yeah.
*  One judge, one authority.
*  Yeah, the monarch.
*  That's why I think—
*  So you're a Hoppian.
*  I know you're so authoritarian.
*  So Yaron Brooks is a Hoppian.
*  No, I'm not a Hoppian.
*  Get in the chopper.
*  I don't want one judge. I don't want an arbitrary judge. I want an objective judge.
*  There's an essay by John Hasnas. I think his name, I'm going to bungle it.
*  It's going to be in my upcoming book on anarchism.
*  And he just discusses—and it's a very long, complicated technical issue—
*  that the idea of objective law is incoherent.
*  Well, yeah. I mean, that's why we disagree so much.
*  Because I think objective law is the only coherence system.
*  Do you disagree that we, in effect, have competing systems of law under America?
*  Meaning there's different ideologies.
*  You have the Sotomayor ideology versus the Scalia ideology, and that effectively—and
*  the point being, when you and I file a lawsuit, it completely depends on who the judge is.
*  Yes. And in theory—I don't think the system works this way, but in theory,
*  the way the system would work is that on new issues, there are—there is some competition.
*  It's nice to meet you.
*  Siri, I wasn't talking to you. Technology.
*  Capitalism.
*  In theory, the system works, and this works, I think, with competing states, but also with
*  competing legal views, particularly on a new issue. There's some—this is how common law
*  worked, right? There's some evolution of it, and at some point, that gets codified into the law,
*  and it gets objectified in that sense. That is, there's some conclusion that people come to.
*  This is the role in theory of a legislature, and the legislature would be nice if it was
*  composed of people who had some idea of legal philosophy.
*  Sure.
*  And it gets codified. And when—because these things are complex, and at some point,
*  it goes through all the arguments, and then a certain truth emerges, or a certain proof is
*  identified, and that's what gets encoded in law. That's what the purpose of a legislature is.
*  Now, if you have competing mechanisms that don't converge on one authority, because there's no one
*  authority. There are multiple authorities. That is, in a sense, there are multiple governments or
*  multiple systems of enforcement, right? Then you get not just something emerging out of it. What
*  you get is competing legal systems. Competing legal systems that now have competing mechanisms
*  of enforcement, competing police forces, competing militaries, however we want to define it.
*  And now there's no mechanism to resolve that. Now, yes, we could negotiate, and there's goodwill,
*  and so on, right?
*  Yeah, there you go.
*  No, but now we're talking about the law, what each view, each position views as true and right.
*  And it might involve, for example, it might involve the fact that the legal system has
*  come to the conclusion that it's okay for children to have sex with adults, and this legal system
*  thinks that is evil and wrong, right? And, you know, something has happened between the two,
*  right? How do you resolve that conflict? There is no resolution. You know, this adult wants to have
*  sex with this child. This legal system thinks it's okay. That legal system thinks it's okay.
*  The only way to resolve that system is through one system imposing itself on the other. An example
*  of countries is exactly that. When you had monarchies, when you had little states all over
*  the place, the way any kind of dispute was resolved when there were issues of territorial
*  disputes or issues of marriage or issues of different legal interpretations was war.
*  No, it wasn't. It was marriage. A lot of times people would marry a princess from another country.
*  Sure, forced marriages, which was not very pleasant.
*  I'd rather sacrifice one princess than a car.
*  No, I don't want to sacrifice anybody. And in addition, I don't want to sacrifice anybody.
*  I want to sacrifice the royals.
*  And in addition, well, I don't want royals.
*  Well, that's what sacrificing means.
*  I think royals are pretty disgusting.
*  I agree. Let's get the baskets.
*  And then on top of that, look, those periods in history are filled with violence,
*  much more violence than we have today, much more bloody than they are today,
*  far less freedom than we have today in terms of individual freedom.
*  You're comparing this to the 20th century.
*  Yes, I'm comparing a monarchy. You said that's preferable to democracy.
*  Yes, I do.
*  Right? I'm comparing a little.
*  I'm saying Hoppe said that. I'm not saying I'm saying that.
*  Oh, I thought you agreed with it.
*  To some extent, but I'm not going to die in that hell.
*  Hoppe said that, and I think it's ridiculous. These kings and queens were fighting constantly.
*  The wars back then were violent in a way that-
*  Unlike now?
*  No, much more violent than now. If you look at the actual percentage of people killed in war-
*  The Steven Pinker book.
*  If you look at the percentage of people, and not just that, you can look at the other stats.
*  The percentage of people killed in war back then were far greater than the percentage of people,
*  even during World War II and World War I. So, anarchy, and David Friedman loves to quote the
*  sagas of Iceland about how wonderful the anarchy- I mean, it's funny because a lot of people read,
*  David Friedman never read the sagas. It's worth reading. The sagas of the Iceland are filled
*  with violence. Constant violence. Constantly people killing each other over,
*  I stole your chickens and you slept with my wife. The only way to resolve disputes,
*  the only way to resolve disputes was violence. There was no authority. There was no mechanism
*  to resolve these disputes. There was a council, but the council couldn't enforce anything. So,
*  in the end of the day, we just resolved to violence. And this is legalized because there is no
*  there is no mechanism by which to make the violence illegal. So, all anarchy is, is legalized
*  violence constrained for a while and up until people stop that constraint by arrangements between
*  the security organizations. But the security organizations have us by the balls, to put it
*  figuratively right. They really do. Sure. Unlike the state. Oh, the state today has it,
*  but I would much rather live in this state, much rather live in this state, much rather live in
*  many more authoritarian states than this, than a place where there's constant violence. I have a
*  bunch of questions, but I'm enjoying this. That's why everything he said is wrong. Okay, yes. First
*  of all, the idea of competing legal systems is inevitable because what Rand talked about is what
*  she wanted was, and this is really kind of Eric at a character with her broader ideology is,
*  I think this was her term and I'm not saying this to make fun of you. When she has a judge
*  and he's looking at the information, she wants him to be basically, I think she used the word robot,
*  someone without any ideology, that they're just looking at the facts. They're not bringing their
*  kind of worldview to it. I take it as a compliment. You are welcome.
*  I think that given otherwise, her correct view that ideology, state constantly ideology is just
*  a slur for someone's philosophy, that someone, especially someone is erudite, educated and
*  informed as a judge has to, and in fact should bring their ideology to their work is in one
*  sensible contradiction in her view, number one. Number two is we have right now the DA in
*  San Francisco. I forget his name. He's the son of literal terrorists, communist terrorists,
*  and he has made it the decree unilaterally that if you shoplift for less than, I forget, $200,
*  we're not prosecuting. You know this game, right? So now you and I, certain and Lex, I'm sure,
*  probably agree that his ideology is abhorrent, that this doesn't help poor people. It doesn't
*  help shop owners. It creates a culture, an area where it's just deleterious to human life.
*  However, he has in one sense, given that he is a state operative, a legitimate worldview.
*  Can I ask you just a quick question? Sure.
*  Why couldn't a security force in a particular context say,
*  yeah, if you take stuff on that store, we're not going to have any problem with that.
*  I agree with you. That's very fair. That's a very legitimate question. The point is
*  in the context that I'm talking about, that firm is like, wait a minute, I'm hiring you for security.
*  You're saying we're not going to provide security. Why am I writing you a check?
*  We have examples of this in real life. If I get into a car accident with you,
*  you have your car insurance. I have my car insurance. If your car insurance had their
*  druthers, they wouldn't pay me one penny. If my car insurance didn't have their druthers,
*  they wouldn't pay you one penny. We already have all that. You were saying earlier that we need to
*  have one kind of umbrella mechanism of use. There are already more cases than you can count
*  where there's private arbitration. Now, the argument is that private arbitration only works
*  because they have recourse to the government. But my point is there's many examples where even
*  though that recourse is theoretically possible, it's not a realistic concern. Specifically because
*  they know that if you have recourse to the state, you have no concept of what that outcome is going
*  to look like, except knowing it's going to be exorbitant. It's going to be time consuming.
*  We can't use the state. I'm as critical as the state as it is right now. Maybe not as critical
*  as yours, not as critical as yours. But I'm quite critical of the state as it is right now.
*  But let's say we got into a traffic accident and you have a Rolls Royce. I destroyed your Rolls
*  Royce and my insurance company now owes your insurance company a lot of money. Let's imagine
*  it's a lot of money just for the sake of it. You're clearly guilty. Yeah, clearly guilty.
*  My insurance company looks at the books and goes, really, I don't want to pay this.
*  You know what? I've got bigger guns than his insurance company. Sure. I'm just going to take
*  over their insurance company. Hostile takeover takes on a whole new meaning when I can muster
*  guns on my behalf than in a hostile takeover in a capitalist context. That to me is what happens.
*  That to me is inevitably what happens. I think this is where the delusion comes in.
*  The idea that when big money is involved and power is involved, remember, again, the same kind of
*  politicians who today get into politics are likely to want to run some of these security agencies
*  because they'll have a lot of power over people. So the same kind of maybe sociopaths would be there.
*  I don't think it's the same skill set, but that's a separate issue. I think it very much is.
*  You think the people in Washington are the same as CEOs psychologically and skill set wise?
*  Well, today's CEOs, yes. Okay. Yes. You might be right.
*  Because I think that's what's rewarded for a CEO is somebody who could get along with government.
*  And I think the kind of CEO who is going to run a security company, which is not just about
*  business, it's about the use of force, it's about control, it's about negotiation with other
*  entities that are using force, diplomacy. And we should get back to objective law because I
*  think it's essential to this whole argument. I would love to get back to something.
*  I think all you get into is security agencies, fighting security agencies, and again, the biggest
*  gun. And I don't mean here the guy who has the biggest literal gun, the rocket launcher versus
*  the guns. I got excited.
*  By the biggest gun? Yeah.
*  The party that has the more physical force, however that is mustered either by numbers
*  or by weapons, is going to dominate and will take over everybody else. Now, one of the things that's
*  common in a market is takeovers. It's consolidation. And here the consolidation can happen through
*  force and you can roll other security companies. And that's exactly what will happen until you
*  dominate the particular geographic area. Okay. So let me explain why I disagree with that.
*  You were just saying, and I agree correctly, I agree with you, that listen, if I have access
*  to the bigger gun, why am I paying you or whoever's paying whatever? I'm just going to use force and
*  not pay them. We have that right now. It's called lobbying. So instead of me, and I'm sure in your
*  example, you weren't being literal, instead of the insurance company literally having the army,
*  they could be like, hey, let me call corrupt co with the mafia. I agree.
*  Yeah. Go out and take them out. By having this federal government, as you know, and certainly
*  I'm not a fan of, takes more through asset forfeiture than burglaries combined. What
*  asset forfeiture is, people don't even understand this. This is something crazy, which you, Ron,
*  is as opposed to me as opposed as I am, which is I'm a cop. I go to your house. I think you haven't
*  been charged or convicted of anything. I have evidence. It's usually in a car.
*  Yeah. Yeah. But it's like drug deals. Okay. I go to your house, you're a drug dealer.
*  I say, and you can understand the reasoning. Well, if someone is getting profit through illegal
*  mechanisms, their profit isn't real, their property, and they shouldn't be rewarded,
*  that property. So basically I go to your house, you're a drug dealer. I seize all your property.
*  You don't really have recourse, even though you haven't been through deep, I'm just explaining
*  to the audience, be through a new process and SOL. That combined for people who don't know
*  is more than the total amount of burglaries in America. It's a huge and what happens is
*  the police department, which seizes your car auctions, it sees your house auctions,
*  it's a great way to line their pockets. This is a huge incentive. It's horrible. It's a huge
*  incentive for police departments to do this because it's like, look, this guy's a crook.
*  Maybe he's not a drug dealer, but he's clearly a pimp. Let me just take all his stuff and it's
*  going to go to the community. Well, and the rationale originally was, if I try him,
*  in the meantime, he'll take that money and funnel it somewhere else and hide it, and I'll never be
*  able to get access to it. It was passed in the 1970s under the original seized laws,
*  what kind of Rico act, but we're going after the mafia. One of the reasons I despise Giuliani as
*  much as I do, and there's very few politicians out there that I despise more, is because he was the
*  first guy to use Rico on financiers. And so it wasn't even a drug deal. It was you were accused
*  of a financial fraud. You weren't shown to be guilty. You were accused. Your assets basically
*  were forfeiture. Innocence is proven guilty when out the window. If you were managing money,
*  you were done. You were finished. So you're saying this kind of stuff naturally in the
*  emergency room of the states. Hold on. So my point is, what are presented as the strongest
*  criticism of anarchism are inevitably descriptions of status quo. What you're describing is already
*  the event. I am a big insurance company. I don't want to pay you. I call Washington,
*  either I pay you and Washington gives me a subsidy. So what you're describing is an inevitable aspect
*  of having a government. So what I'm describing is the inevitable evolution of anarchy into a
*  government. I just think that the markets don't consolidate into monopoly. That's a leftist
*  propaganda myth. Not markets where you have substitute products. But this is the problem.
*  The problem is force has no substitute. That is force is not a product you can have. So this is
*  my fundamental issue about turning competing police forces. Force is not a product. Force is not a
*  service. It's not a service. And it's not a product. Security is not a service? No. Well,
*  security in the context of a legal system is. But this is the point. The legal system, the laws
*  are not a service or product. They are a different type of human institution. Science
*  is not a product or service. It's a different type of human institution. There are different
*  types of human institutions. Some you can create markets in, some you cannot. Law is not a marketable
*  system. Can I ask a question quickly? Is there any other field other than law that you think
*  you can't create markets? Well, science. Science is not marketable. The science itself is not
*  marketable. Well, science is true. And the same I think is in law. Law is not marketable. Law
*  is the system that allows markets to happen. You need a system of law, whether it's private law
*  in a particular narrow context or whether it's broader law. Law is the context in which markets
*  arise. So one of the reasons we transact is we know that there's a certain contract between us,
*  explicit or implicit, that is protected by a certain law, whether it's protected by private
*  agency or private. The government doesn't matter, but there's a certain contract that is
*  protectable by a system. Theoretically. Theoretically, yes. So law is the context in which markets arise.
*  You don't create a market because there's nothing above it in a sense. It is the context that
*  allows markets to be created. Once you market it, markets fall apart. So hold on a second. Hold on.
*  So you think that law could be a market. And it already is a market. And we see it, for example,
*  eBay. If I am buying something from Yaron, I won't even know his name. I don't know. Maybe he's in
*  another country. And he screws me out of the money. I don't have access. I can't sue you. Or if I sue
*  you in England, good luck with that. You're not going to argue that I'm going to sue you. What
*  happens in this case, which has already been solved by the market, eBay and PayPal, which has access
*  to your bank account, they act as the private arbiter. They're going to get it wrong a lot.
*  Not even a question. Just like Yaron's not going to argue that the government right now gets it
*  wrong a lot. That's not even a question. The point is, at the very least, I'm going to get
*  my resolution faster, cheaper, and more effectively. So the issue with having any kind of government,
*  anything, and Yaron's not going to disagree with this, is at the very least, it's going to be
*  expensive, inefficient, and cause conflict. Yeah, but I think what it allows is exactly-
*  We don't even know what the Supreme Court's going to judge.
*  Again, you're moving us to today's environment, which I'm against, right?
*  No, but reality doesn't have to be what it is. That's the most anti-Rand quote.
*  In a sense of the politics, the political reality.
*  I know, but the quote by itself is great. I know. I know. You'd love to-
*  He agrees with Donald Hoffman, as we would say. Yeah, it turns out I agree with Hoffman.
*  He's an elf. So it's- Where were we? So I believe that because we have a certain system
*  of government, it allows for these private innovations to come about that facilitate
*  certain issues in a much more efficient way than the government would deal with it. But it's only
*  because we have a particular system that has defined property rights, that has a clear view
*  of what property rights are. It has a clear view of what a transaction mean and what contract law
*  is, and eBay has a bunch of stuff that you sign, whether you read it or not.
*  Of course. All of that is defined first, and then there are massive innovations at the level of
*  particular transactions, at the level of an eBay, that facilitate increased efficiency,
*  and that's great. But the fact is none of that gets developed. None of that gets created.
*  In a world in which I might be living under a different definition of property rights,
*  eBay might be living under a separate definition of property rights, you might have a third
*  definition of property rights, and there's no mechanism by which we can actually operationalize
*  that because we all have a different system. There is a mechanism. We already have that.
*  Let's change the example I just used. What happens if a Chinese person who has a different
*  definition of property rights kills an American in Brazil? Again, in a smaller community,
*  what happens is lots of violence. No, but I'm talking about right now.
*  If a Chinese person has- Right now, the only reason that it doesn't
*  lead to violence is because people are afraid of even more violence, and it affects many people,
*  large numbers of people who don't want to go to war. But if you have small, in a state where the
*  states were small, in those little states, there was war all the time for exactly those reasons.
*  Because the cost was lower, because it was more personal, because I knew maybe the person who was
*  killed over there, and I went to my king and encouraged him to go to war. Violence is constant.
*  You know why there was war? Because there had been no Ayn Rand, and good ideas lead to good
*  societies, which leads to good people, which leads to good behavior, good interrelationships.
*  So now that we have Ayn Rand, all this stuff in the past is irrelevant because if they studied
*  her works, Rand was on Donahue again, you can watch the clip, and he asks her, she goes,
*  he goes, you're saying that if we were more selfish and acted more self-interest,
*  there'd be less war, less Hitler, and she said there wouldn't be any.
*  Right. Well, if we were all selfish, there wouldn't be any Hitlers.
*  Who do you regard as the overweening authority if I am buying a product from you as someone in
*  England via eBay? Who is the governing authority? The governing authority is other legal systems in
*  England and the United States, which have to be synchronized pretty well. Right, but what I'm
*  saying is why eBay doesn't function in certain countries because there is no legal system.
*  My point is why do those legal systems have to be a function specifically of geography as opposed to
*  why can't I, sitting here, I could sit here, you're not going to let me finish my point,
*  I can sit here and be a British diplomat, right? And as a British diplomat, I'm going to be treated
*  differently under American law than you are as an American citizen, as you are. Why can't you have
*  that same process? Sure, we're geographically proximate, but I'm a citizen of this company,
*  and you're a citizen of that company. Why would that be different in your opinion?
*  If it's England and the United States, it's probably not going to matter that much, right?
*  But if it's Iran and the United States, then the fact that we're sitting next to each other makes
*  a huge difference, massive difference. And the fact is that, and Ayn Rand, I think, would be
*  the first to acknowledge this, and this is why she was so opposed to anarchy. That's not why.
*  It's because of Rothbard. No, it has nothing to do with it.
*  Nothing? It has nothing to do with Rothbard.
*  Nothing. Nothing.
*  How do you know? Nothing.
*  How would you know? Because the argument against
*  anarchy is an intellectual one, not a personality based one.
*  Can it be both? Anyway, but back to it, back to Iran.
*  No, it has nothing to do with Rothbard. You don't know that. You're not a psychic,
*  or a necromancer. The only way we're going to resolve this is arm wrestling, right? It's to
*  violence. Arm wrestling's not violence.
*  Words are violence. Words are violence, Yaron.
*  Words are violence. Emotions are violence. He throws me off with this stuff. That's the problem.
*  He's very, very good. Not facts and truths. I mean, there's distinctions and arbitrary statements,
*  because your statement about Rothbard is an arbitrary statement that has no cognitive
*  standing, and therefore I can dismiss it. So I'm not doing like this because I want to dismiss it.
*  It has no cognitive status. The fact that she disliked Rothbard doesn't mean that everything
*  he said she was going to dismiss because she disliked him.
*  I agree with you, but what I'm saying is it would not be impossible.
*  But there's no evidence. I'll talk. I'll give you some evidence.
*  Human psychology. It is not impossible that if you hate some, what's his name? What's that guy's
*  name? Richard Wolff.
*  Right. It's not impossible that if Richard Wolff said something that you would otherwise agree with,
*  you hold on, let me finish. You'd be dismissive or less likely to give him credit for it.
*  Being a human being. That's all I'm saying.
*  It's as silly as to say Rothbard came up with this theory of anarchy because he was pissed off at
*  what I ran and wanted to write something. I don't know.
*  Bring it down so that he can speak too. I don't think we're getting agitated.
*  No, you guys aren't. No, no, no.
*  Bring it down not in terms of give more pauses so Michael can insert himself. That's what I mean.
*  See, private governance. What's the point of that?
*  Private governance. Look, it's private governance.
*  Private governance is great. I'm trying to establish a geographic
*  law of the land. That's not the point.
*  I do think that Michael's, that's interesting that you disagree with this. I do believe that
*  psychology has an impact on ideas. You don't think Ayn Rand had grudges that impacted the way she
*  saw the world? I would like to think that- I don't think any of her grudges entered into
*  philosophical statements, at least not that I can tell. Given the centrality Ayn Rand gave
*  to the role of government, to the existence of government, to the need for government
*  to establish real freedom and the way she defines freedom, which is very different than Rothbard
*  and the way she defines government, to say then that her opposition to anarchy is because of,
*  I think is just an arbitrary statement. I didn't say because.
*  I didn't say because. I said followed by.
*  And not, and I don't see why psychology would enter it. Now, maybe the tone in which she
*  responded to her answer might have been motivated by that or something like that, but given the
*  amount of thought she gave to the role of government in human society and why government was needed
*  and why you needed laws in order to be free, that freedom didn't proceed,
*  that you needed the right hierarchy, I think that we could say that it, give it at least a respect,
*  she, this was, she might have been wrong, right? But she, she had a particular theory that,
*  that rejected anarchy and the thought anarchy was wrong.
*  Okay, hold on. I really resent, and I don't want to say you're doing this, the implication
*  that if Rand was guided by her passions, that somehow is the criticism of her or lessens her.
*  I think Rand was a very passionate person. I think she loved her husband enormously.
*  She despised certain people enormously. And I don't think that there's anything wrong.
*  Don't think she would change her philosophical position about something because she dislikes
*  somebody. I agree, but what I'm saying.
*  Given the amount of thought she gave to that philosophical.
*  All I'm saying is it is possible that if someone comes across ideas that she had not considered
*  before, if she regarded this person as a bad actor, like all of us, she would be less likely
*  to take them under consideration. Sure.
*  That's all I'm saying. Sure.
*  And I think, I think other people, other people confronted her with ideas of anarchy. I don't
*  think Rothbard was the only one. Correct. Roy Charles as well. Yeah.
*  Roy Charles certainly did. And she rejected them and she rejected them because she had,
*  and whether you agree with her or not, she had a thought out position about why you needed to have
*  this particular structure in place so that markets and human freedom could exist.
*  It's just really interesting because this is the one time in my view, and please correct me if I'm
*  wrong, where she invokes need as kind of a basis for political activity. So if, let's suppose you
*  want this federal government, whatever you want, you don't want it like it is now, but like your
*  version of the government. I don't see why it's an issue for you, for me and Lex to say we're not
*  privy to Washington. We're going to do our own thing. And given, if we go about our lives,
*  not initiating for us and being productive actors, why she would have an issue with this.
*  Why would I care? Well, you would care because if you're saying the government has a monopoly on
*  force between these two oceans. You can do that as long as you don't violate somebody else's rights.
*  Sure, but what I'm saying is we just declare ourselves sovereign. We're not going to pay
*  any income taxes. We're going to be peaceful people. And when Lex and I have disputes,
*  we're going to call Joe, that's Joe Rogan. You're never going to get to meet him, but he's a good
*  guy. I know. We're going to call Joe and Joe's going to resolve it between us. He's so good at
*  needling and getting you off topic that way. He's really effective at it.
*  He's Muhammad Ali and you're Joe.
*  I always say when I debate communists, I always say to them.
*  You mean Lex?
*  Yeah, maybe Lex. Maybe I should do this test.
*  Comrade, I love you.
*  That if they really believe-
*  Burgundy, not red.
*  If they really believe in what they think, then they should be advocates of capitalism.
*  Because under capitalism, under my system of government, capitalist government, they could
*  go and start a commune. They can live in communists. They can live to each according to
*  his needs, from each according to his ability, all they want and live their pathetic miserable
*  lives that way. And the government would never intervene because the whole view of capitalism
*  is freedom. We live the way we want. As long as you're not violating my rights, as long as you're
*  not taking my property, as long as you're not engaging with- So in that sense, yeah, you and
*  Lex can form your own thing. I don't believe in compulsory taxes anyway. So you and Lex can
*  do your own thing, never pay taxes. As long as you're not violating the laws, and the laws are
*  very limited, right? Because they're only there to protect individuals. So as long as you're not
*  violating somebody else's property rights or inflicting force on anybody else, you're peaceful.
*  You can do what you want. Don't have sex with kids.
*  I will stop immediately.
*  Good. The rest of us are just playing checkers and he's playing chess.
*  I mean, a government that protects individual rights properly is a government that leaves you
*  alone to live your life as you see fit, even if you live your life in a way that I don't approve
*  of, that I don't think is right. That's the whole point. The only thing you can do is
*  try to enforce arbitrary laws that you come up with on me.
*  Of course. Absolutely. Okay, great.
*  Wouldn't it be wonderful if we lived in a world where rights protecting laws are superfluous,
*  but the reality is usually that somebody violates them, whether by accident or
*  intentionally, and that you need some mechanism. Now, if you guys can resolve that dispute without
*  getting involved, fine. But if you guys land up not resolving, there is another authority that
*  will help you resolve it. Yeah.
*  So can I ask you a question? Under anarchism, what kind of systems of laws do you think will emerge?
*  Do you think we'll have basically a similar kind of layer of universal law to where-
*  Let me answer this. This is a great question. I know what you're going to do with this.
*  This is often presented as a criticism of anarchism. And this is actually something
*  I think you're on would agree with as well in other contexts, which is this.
*  One of the reasons communism can't work, central planning can't work, and this was one of Mises's
*  great innovations is if I could sit down, it's like asking, what would the fashion industry look
*  like if the government didn't run it? There's no way for me to know. What the fashion industry is,
*  which all of us are in favor of it being free, is literally millions of designers, of seamstresses,
*  of people who make the fabric, also references throughout history and these creative artistic
*  minds putting things together in every year. And there's no shortage of clothes. In fact,
*  we make so many clothes that we send them in landfill sizes to overseas poor countries.
*  And you have people in these destitute countries wearing Adidas shirts. They can't even read English,
*  but because we don't know what to do with all these clothes. That's how the glory of free enterprise
*  is the problem is, the problem is it's loosely, everything comes cheap and overabundant.
*  Well, it doesn't actually come overabundant. It's done properly.
*  Sure. That's fair.
*  Supply meets demand.
*  Sure, that's fair. But I'm saying if 150 years ago you said,
*  you know, one day we're going to have an issue where there's going to be so much food and-
*  Obesity.
*  That the kids are too fat. It's just going to be like, I have four who are dead in the crib.
*  I wish. I mean, what kind of paradise is this? So what you would have, we have this right now
*  in certain centers. You have the Hasidim, you have Sharia, you have different, you have,
*  I'm sure in the medical system, they have their own kind of private courts and court
*  marshals is another example. This is obviously that's through the state. So you would have
*  innovation in law under markets, just the same way as you'd have it. And we have this already.
*  Maybe it's not, Yaron doesn't like it in terms of like murder and rape, and I can understand why,
*  but in terms of like business and interactions, he would have no problem with different arbitration
*  firms having different rules for like what kind of evidence is allowed. Maybe you only have 60
*  days to make your case and so on and so forth. And the market is a process of creative innovation
*  and it would be dynamic. It would be changing all the time.
*  So what's interesting relating to this is that one of the ways Ayn Rand proposed raising revenue
*  for the government, because she was against, was let's say we have a contract. We could just
*  have it arbitrated without government intervening. But if we wanted to access the courts of the
*  government as a final authority, we would pay. And that's how governments would raise some of
*  the funds would be raised that way. So there's definitely a value to having this innovation and
*  the public space, but I don't believe that is the case with murder. I don't believe that is the case
*  with violent crime. And it's funny you bring up Sharia because David Friedman, when he gives-
*  Wait, I got to ask you to clarify. I'm not trying to interrupt you. You were talking about with
*  murder. I mean, you would agree, I think just to clarify for the audience, that there is room
*  for innovation in murder because there's things like mass slaughter, there's murder one, murder two.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't think it happens at a market level. I don't think there's a market
*  innovation for murder. Somebody has to figure out what those standards are and they will evolve
*  as we gain more knowledge. But we're all agreement that the word murder means very different things.
*  Oh, absolutely. And if circumstances matter and standards of proof and standards of evidence,
*  all of that there has to be a standard. And consequences too, yes.
*  All of that there has to be a standard and that's what I think the proper government provides.
*  Right. So David Friedman uses in some of his talks about private law, he uses Sharia law in
*  Somalia as an example. Look, legal systems evolve privately, independent. Yeah, authoritarian ones,
*  ones that don't respect the rights of women at all. Are you married?
*  No, no, but we all want to have sex with our mother, as Freud would say.
*  Oh my God, can we make that a clip?
*  Yep.
*  Where the hell did that come from?
*  That's much better than what I was just saying about the kids.
*  I appreciate that. Okay, so we went in a voluntary way, although sometimes for
*  Yaron and sometimes for Michael it felt involuntary. But we all got the big guns.
*  So how do we land this? Clearly there's a disagreement about anarchism here.
*  I think we're in agreement. I think there's a big agreement because if Yaron was saying that if I
*  want to have my voluntary stupid thing with you and his government is not going to tax me
*  and is not going to insinuate itself unless we're murdering each other or something like that,
*  I'm okay with that.
*  So if you take the example of Sharia law, which was mentioned earlier,
*  so if you have a little community within my world that imposes Sharia law,
*  if it starts mutilating little girls, then you impose your law on it.
*  You impose the law on it because it's an issue protecting individual rights.
*  If they want to treat women, if women have to cover up and the women are okay with that,
*  that's fine. If the woman wants to leave but is not allowed to leave,
*  that's where my government would step in and prevent them from using force against her.
*  And that's it. Now, I think it's more complicated than that because I think there are
*  complex issue property rights often where it's not going to be easy for you guys to resolve,
*  particularly if you interact with people outside of your community.
*  But yeah, my view is government is there to protect individual rights. That's it.
*  To otherwise leave you alone.
*  I think this conversation is going to continue for quite a while.
*  Michael has a new book on the topic coming out eventually one day.
*  So you're working also on the still called Dwight Pell.
*  And the first line of the Dwight Pell is, Ayn Rand did not laugh.
*  I'm not joking. That's literally the first line.
*  I believe it.
*  Because it opens up with her, who knows what the books can look like when it's done.
*  But as of now, that's the beginning because it opens up with her testimony at the House
*  on American Activities Committee where she's trying to explain to these congresspeople
*  what it was like when she left the Soviet Union and they're just befuddled by it.
*  Can you explain she did not laugh?
*  Well, because the first line in the Fountainhead, spoiler alert, is Howard Rourke laughed.
*  So this is a little inversion of that. It says Ayn Rand did not laugh.
*  Because Ayn Rand was a huge fan of America, as am I. She took our political system very seriously.
*  She had enormous reverence for institutions.
*  One example of this is one of the villains of the Atlas Shrugged is based on Harry Truman.
*  I think Thompson is the character's name.
*  And because she had such respect for the title of president, she refers to him as the chairman.
*  She couldn't even bring herself to say that.
*  She had a huge respect for the presidency.
*  I wonder if she'd still have it given the last string of presidents we've had.
*  So having her, which sets up the broader point of the book, which I'm sure I'll be
*  back on the show to discuss, assuming this bridge hasn't been burned, but I'll try my best.
*  All three of us are canceled.
*  Some are more canceled than the others.
*  The point being, which sets up the broader point of the book, is how ignorant many people are in
*  the West about the horrors of Stalinism and communism, but also how many people in the West
*  were complicit in saying to Americans, go home, everything's fine, this is great,
*  this is why Pentsy's have a race, they're sure they're mistakes.
*  And they really made a point to downplay really gratuitously some of the unimaginable atrocities
*  of the communism.
*  And just one more sentence.
*  And going through the work and learning about what they actually did is so jaw-dropping
*  that it's...
*  If I didn't know about it, and many people I'm friends with who are historians who are
*  interested in the space, this isn't common knowledge to them, then we can assume that
*  almost no one knows about it.
*  And I think it's very important for people to appreciate, whether Republican, Democrat,
*  liberal, whatever, how much of a danger this is.
*  And I think Americans have this...
*  There's a book called It Can't Happen Here, I think by Sinclair Lewis, about a fashion
*  that come to America.
*  American exceptionalism has a positive context, but also have a negative context where you think
*  we're invincible, all these horrible things that happens in other countries, it can't
*  possibly happen here, where America was special.
*  And it's completely an absurdity.
*  Have you seen the movie, Mr. Jones?
*  My friend wrote it.
*  No, I haven't.
*  But Walter Duranty and his quotes, I have a thread on Twitter, Walter Duranty, for those
*  who don't know, he won a Pulitzer because he was the New York Times man in Moscow.
*  And endlessly, he was talking about how great it was, how if you hear about this famine in Ukraine,
*  this is just propaganda, I went to the villages, everyone's happy and fed.
*  A lot of it was explicit lies.
*  And when you realize you're talking about, let's give them the absolute benefit of the doubt,
*  an accidental genocide, it's still mind boggling.
*  And also, Anne Applebaum, who's just a phenomenal, phenomenal writer, she wrote a book called
*  Red Famine, Stalin's War in Ukraine.
*  And she talks about how what people in America don't appreciate is how clever in their sadism
*  the Soviets were.
*  And what they knew to do in Ukraine is everyone is starving.
*  So they knew if you've got some meat on your bones, you're hiding food.
*  So they come back at night, take your hand, put in the door jam, keep slamming the door,
*  ransack your house.
*  They didn't have to find the food.
*  Burn down your house, take all your clothes.
*  Goodbye and good luck.
*  I don't recall saying good luck.
*  So I highly recommend the movie because it's very well done.
*  It's very well directed, it's beautifully made, it's stunningly effective.
*  Okay, good.
*  Illustrating exactly that.
*  The scenes in Ukraine during the famine, your heart goes, I mean, it's crushing.
*  And it shifts to black and white.
*  It's very, very well made aesthetically.
*  Highly recommend it.
*  And it's written by Andrzej Chalupa.
*  She's a Ukrainian friend of mine.
*  She interests me.
*  Janmi Park, who's a big North Korean defector.
*  And this is the kind of thing where I think more people need to…
*  When I wrote The New Right, which talks a lot about the Nazis or the kind of neo-Nazis,
*  one of their big complaints about, you know, against people who are Jewish is like,
*  oh, we hear all about the Holocaust.
*  How come you don't talk about the Hall of the More?
*  I'm like, I'm trying to do my part.
*  I agree with you that we need to be talking about the Holocaust.
*  Absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  And it's sad there are not more movies that are anti-Soviet,
*  which tells you a lot about the view of the intelligentsia.
*  It's a great idea.
*  It just was badly implemented.
*  And no, it's a rotten idea.
*  It's an evil idea.
*  And it was implemented.
*  Exactly.
*  It was implemented exactly how it has to be implemented.
*  There's no alternative.
*  Can we talk about the fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged?
*  And which character do you find most fascinating once that kind of you meet in your own mind,
*  that you almost have conversations with or as an influence on you and your life in general?
*  You know what character I like?
*  Because I know no one ever gives this answer, but this is my just aesthetically,
*  you know how sometimes you're drawn to a character and it's if this person were real,
*  you think they're just, but there's something about the resonates with you.
*  I can't even explain this,
*  but I love the character in Atlas Shrugged of Lillian Riordan, who's Hank Riordan's wife.
*  And what is amazing about her, she's his wife.
*  He's this big industrialist innovator and she's this like former beauty in that,
*  but she's so cold and soulless that there's, I mean, I joke about Anne Rand's vampire novels.
*  That character is as close to a literal vampire as you're going to see in Rand.
*  And there's just this great scene where, you know, Hank Riordan invents Riordan metal.
*  It's this great metal, which is extremely strong, but extremely, it's like light.
*  So this creates all these innovations.
*  And he brings her a bracelet made of the first Riordan metal.
*  This is his life goal.
*  This is like Prometheus bringing fire.
*  And she's like, what the fuck is this?
*  You could've brought me diamonds.
*  Yeah, you could've brought me diamonds.
*  What is this shit?
*  And Dagny, who's another industrialist, she's a heroine, a very strong female character
*  in Atlas Shrugged is at a party and she goes, I got diamonds, let's trade.
*  And Lilian's like, you want this?
*  And she's like, yes, because that's the concretization of the human mind.
*  These are rocks.
*  And Lilian's like, okay, whatever.
*  And that character is someone who has a lot of resonance in our culture, this kind of soulless.
*  It's easy to write a soulless male figure, like Peter Keating in some ways, a soulless,
*  but that for some reason when it's like a soulless female, it seems that much more
*  chilling and effective.
*  Do you not agree though that Lilian Riordan is an amazingly very powerful figure?
*  Powerful figure.
*  And I think Riordan is too.
*  And what I love about Riordan is his evolution, right?
*  He's so flawed.
*  He's a hero who's completely flawed.
*  And it drives me nuts when people say,
*  her characters are cartoonish, they never change, there's no emotion.
*  Really?
*  Did you read the same book I did?
*  Because if you take Riordan, and he's struggling and he's trying to deal with Lilian and his
*  family and all this stuff, and we know family members like this, right?
*  I mean, they were leeches and parasites, but he's excusing them because that's what he's
*  supposed to do.
*  And then as he evolves to fully realize what's going on, that evolution is difficult, it's hard.
*  Like the scene after he has sex with Dagny, of course he gives a speech, but the speech is
*  It's such a good speech in terms of conveying his mind-body split, right?
*  He thinks he really had fun, he really enjoyed the sex, right?
*  But he thinks it's animalistic and he thinks it's a sign of his depravity and he thinks
*  and here he is, this woman he loves and he adores her and he can't connect the two,
*  he can't connect the sex with the love, he can't connect the sex with adoration and with the value.
*  Her characters are anything I think but cardboard characters because I think Dagny
*  and the scenes where she's listening to music and gets captured by the music and the way
*  Ray Rand describes that, I think it's just beautiful.
*  Or the scene, my favorite scene in Atlas is the scene where they're taking the first train ride
*  across the John Gould Bridge and they're in the engine room and it's traveling through.
*  And the way she's describing Dagny and it's almost like Dagny's having sex with the machine, right?
*  It's so powerful emotionally, their success, the fact that they did it.
*  Everybody told them it was impossible and the train is going really fast and that whole,
*  it's got a sexual vibe to it, it's all about passion, it's all about success
*  and it's all about the success of their minds and nobody else matters.
*  What's really great about that scene just in terms of constructing the novel,
*  I'm not going to spoil anything.
*  So the Atlas Shrugged has three acts, like three act structure is not uncommon.
*  And the first act is about Hank Reardon overcoming all this adversity at home
*  in his personal life and in his business to create this great achievement.
*  So Rand really makes the reader invested in this character and his accomplishments.
*  He's unambiguously doing something good, there's no downside here,
*  he's making it easy to transport people, transport food, this is really just great.
*  And it's just once you read it and you look back, you're like,
*  she does such a masterful job of making, you have to be a fan of this person and root for them
*  because she's like, oh, you think things are going great, he's overcome?
*  Hold on a minute.
*  And then the rest of it, she's just, and your sense of injustice is triggered as a reader
*  to such an nth degree because you saw what he went through to get to this point and now
*  you're seeing it taking away people's fear and fear to him.
*  And one of the quotes on Twitter I use all the time is, I'll see someone, politician or
*  bureaucrat or a thinker, just advocate for something completely unconscionable.
*  And I'll just quote and say, my favorite criticism of Ayn Rand is that they say her
*  villains are too evil and unrealistic because the things that people posit with a straight face
*  are so much worse than she has in her book.
*  And not just politicians, you find intellectuals today.
*  Oh, of course.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  Way over the time, even when I read it, Adla Shrock, that was good.
*  Nobody really talks like this.
*  No, they do.
*  Let me give you one example.
*  There was a story she wrote, which she never published.
*  They published her journals, the Ayn Rand Institute, and there was one character,
*  and this is a prototype of Ellsworth too.
*  He was the villain of one of the villains of the Fountainhead.
*  And basically the kid had like deformed legs or broke his legs or something like that.
*  And he wants to get leg braces and the dad is like, oh, we're not going to do that.
*  Why should you be better than anyone else?
*  Like you should just have like, except your fate.
*  And you're reading this and like, what dad is not going to give his kid leg braces.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  But now it's not uncommon for deaf children to not get cochlear implants and not be able to hear
*  because their parents say, well, we're going to lose deaf culture.
*  Hearing is just information and you're sitting there and whether you agree with this or not,
*  this is very close to what she was saying.
*  And when I read what she was saying, I'm like, okay, crazy Ayn Rand, this is not a thing.
*  And it's like, oh, yeah, the craziness is that it's not braces, it's hearing.
*  It's yeah.
*  And what evil to deny your kid hearing.
*  I mean, God.
*  So here's the other thing.
*  If you want deaf culture, which I would believe is a thing, sign language, whatever,
*  they could turn it off.
*  Give them the choice.
*  I'm sorry, one more thing.
*  Rand used the word evil frequently.
*  And I think maybe I can make the argument she used it too loosely.
*  If you are denying a child the gift of music, I will say that's evil.
*  I agree completely.
*  Unambiguously.
*  Go online and watch videos of people getting hearing aids and being able to hear for the first time.
*  Seeing what happens to their faces.
*  I promise you, you will cry because there's no pure, I'm getting teared up right now.
*  There's no pure expression of humanity and technology at its best than seeing a two-year-old
*  or one and a half-year-old who can't even talk.
*  And then you see their reaction when they hear mom's voice.
*  It's so beautiful and moving.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah, there's a few things that's moving.
*  It's one of the ways to rethink technology perhaps.
*  And there's this, it's seriously funny because sometimes it'll be this tough dude,
*  right?
*  And he's been deaf all his life and then they put the hearing in.
*  The girlfriend's like, can you hear me?
*  And he's trying to be tough for three seconds.
*  Yeah, he just loses it.
*  And you just sit there.
*  No, absolutely.
*  And that's true of any sense.
*  Like colorblind people seeing color for the first time, that kind of thing.
*  It's not quite the same, but it's somewhat.
*  But if you're blind and somebody can see, it's just stunning.
*  And how do we form our concepts?
*  How do we think?
*  We have to, we get information from reality.
*  We interact with reality through our senses and that's how we become conceptual beings.
*  And you deny an element of that from a human being.
*  That is horrible.
*  There's a potential with that with the Neuralink too, so further developments there.
*  So, I mean, on that, there's a powerful question of who is John Galt?
*  I don't know if we can do this without spoiler alerts.
*  Yeah, don't spoil the book.
*  Okay.
*  But you can say.
*  What's the importance of this character?
*  What's the importance of this question?
*  Without the importance of it.
*  So I want to give a talk on who is John Galt.
*  And who is John Galt in a sense as anybody who takes their own life seriously.
*  Anybody who's willing to really live fully their own life.
*  Use their mind in pursuit of their rational values and pursue their happiness fully,
*  uncompromisingly with no compromise and sticking to their integrity.
*  Anybody can be John Galt in that sense.
*  I think one of the mottos I live by is all we are tasked to, maybe this is a little bit religious,
*  but I think your own is going to agree with it.
*  I'm sure you'll agree with it.
*  All any of us can do is leave the world a little bit of a better place than we found it.
*  And I think if you do that through hard work, being honest,
*  being a kind of not at the expense of other people,
*  you can go to your grave, patting yourself on the back.
*  I mean, to me, the leaving the world a better place.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's not what drives me.
*  What drives me is, I mean, what I think drives people, I think just live a good life.
*  And good life means a life you're happy living.
*  And part of that is the impact you have on the world.
*  But it's, you know, so many people live wasted lives, live mediocre lives,
*  live conventional lives.
*  You know, maybe they even leave the world a better place, but they didn't really.
*  But they didn't leave the world a better place.
*  They left the world a better place, but they didn't live their potential.
*  They didn't, or they died feeling guilty about it, or they.
*  A million different things.
*  So there's so many productive people.
*  I mean, think about all the innovators and the technologists and the businessmen
*  who leave the world a better place by a big shot, but are never happy.
*  Never happy in their own souls and their own life.
*  And to me, that's what counts.
*  And if you're going to be happy, you'll leave the better world a better place.
*  And that's what John Gault symbolizes.
*  To me, it's living your life by your standards, by your values,
*  and pursuing that happiness.
*  Well, I take, I'm sorry, I take in a different context, because I think a lot of,
*  and I don't think you're going to disagree with this.
*  I think a lot of times when you're young, you have unrealistic expectations
*  about what you're going to accomplish.
*  And you think to yourself, well, suppose someone wants to go into politics.
*  Well, if I'm not elected president, I'm a failure.
*  That's nonsensical.
*  There's lots of people who are successful who haven't achieved literally the
*  top position in their role.
*  So if you can go to your grave, having defending everything you've done,
*  and you move the needle in the pot.
*  Success should not be relative.
*  Yes.
*  So that goes back to second-handedness.
*  Yes.
*  Success is not being better than other people's success.
*  That is not being the best.
*  Success is maximizing your potential, whatever that is.
*  And look, you know, I know people, you know, I have a son who's,
*  who could be a really good engineer, a really good mathematician,
*  really good scientist, but he decided he wants to write comedy, right?
*  So he might have been a better mathematician than he'd a comedian,
*  but that's his values.
*  That's his goals.
*  That's what he wants to do.
*  And hopefully he'll be really, really good at that.
*  And he'll be incredibly successful at it materially in every other sense.
*  But that's what you pursue.
*  So it's really being true to yourself in a deep sense.
*  And if you are true to yourself, yeah, you'll leave the world a better place.
*  But that's not the essence.
*  The essence is you.
*  No, focus on, focus on you.
*  Focus on making your life the best life that it can be.
*  And if you do that, you'll make the world a better place by almost by definition.
*  But yeah, we're looking at the same thing in different ways.
*  Yeah.
*  It's at least in my little corner of the world, it was disappointing how rare that is.
*  So one of the reasons I'm here in Austin and one of the reasons
*  I, my work gravitated towards Elon Musk is because he represents that person for me
*  in the world of technology, in the world of CEO, in the world of business.
*  It was very surprising to me.
*  The more I've learned about the world of tech, how few people live unapologetically, fully
*  to their potential.
*  I'm sure people, others do that, maybe music and art.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I don't know about those worlds.
*  I do know about the technology world.
*  And it was disappointing to me how many people compromise their integrity
*  in subtle ways at first, but then it becomes a slippery slope.
*  There's this great quote and I always forget if it's Steinbeck or Hemingway
*  and the quote, and this applies for money and applies for morality.
*  The quote was, how did you go bankrupt?
*  And he says two ways, gradually and then suddenly.
*  It's very hard to one day be like, I have no integrity.
*  That doesn't happen.
*  It's very easy if it's like, look, I stole this candy bar.
*  What's the big deal if I steal this thing?
*  People say they're no slippery slopes.
*  They are and they're big and they're very slippery.
*  This is the biggest one.
*  And people violate the integrity even without stealing.
*  Just little things about how they treat other people, how they treat themselves,
*  the values they pursue.
*  They don't go after the profession they really wanted to.
*  They compromise in ways that they shouldn't with their spouse or with their mothers or
*  whatever.
*  They look the other way when they see it justice.
*  Yep.
*  And this is why people go through a midlife crisis.
*  Midlife crisis is a crisis where you suddenly realize, I didn't do it.
*  I didn't live up to my standards.
*  I didn't live up to my youthful idealism.
*  I compromised and I sold out.
*  But I also would warn you about Silicon Valley.
*  Yeah, I think at the top, very few of them stick to it and partially it's the political
*  pressure is unbearable.
*  How would you?
*  How can you?
*  It would require to be a hero and very few of them all.
*  But there are a lot of people who do really well at all kinds of levels in technology.
*  Who little startups, people.
*  And this is the point Michael is making.
*  You don't have to be the best.
*  You don't have to be a CEO to live to your max and to live with integrity and to live
*  a great life.
*  I know people who do because they joined Amazon or whatever have just made a life for themselves,
*  an amazing life for themselves.
*  And have done great work at Amazon, let's say.
*  And then have lived a great life because of the opportunity that created for them.
*  So I think there are more good people out there.
*  But yes, one of the saddest things of growing up is notice, even when you're a teenager
*  and looking at adults and noticing how few of them actually live.
*  I mean, are really alive in a sense of living their values and enjoying their life.
*  You start with your parents and you look across the people.
*  Everybody lives such mediocre lives.
*  The other thing is they don't have to.
*  That's what people don't appreciate.
*  They don't have to.
*  Particularly not in the world we live in today.
*  They're so wealthy.
*  And so many, we all have so many opportunities.
*  So what, by way of advice, what advice would you give to young people to live their life
*  fully?
*  I mean, Michael and I have talked about this, but it bears repeating.
*  So if you look at John Galt, if you look at the highest ideals of a life we could live,
*  what advice would you give to a 20-year-old today?
*  Can I say, I don't think, and I think Rand would agree.
*  When Rand was writing John Galt, she says, when you have this character's human perfection,
*  you don't want to get too close.
*  So he's a little bit of a vague character because she was aware that when you're dealing
*  with day-to-day, it kind of, the shine comes off.
*  I think Rourke is a lot better character for a young person.
*  Oh, really?
*  But Rourke is all, the entirety of the fountainhead is Rourke.
*  So, and we're just the one of several.
*  We barely know John Galt.
*  Yeah.
*  But Rourke is someone where you could be like, okay.
*  And what Rourke also gives young people is-
*  That's in the fountainhead.
*  The fountainhead is the strength to persevere.
*  Because when you're young, you're going to have down times.
*  There's going to be times when you're lonely.
*  There's going to be times when you don't have a girlfriend.
*  There's going to be times when you're out of work and you're thinking,
*  holy crap, I'm falling between the cracks.
*  I'm going to accomplish that.
*  I'm going to be a failure.
*  And he gives them the courage to, there's even a scene in the fountainhead,
*  which is this amazing scene.
*  It's not talked about enough where basically Rourke is looking at one of his buildings
*  and this little kid on a bicycle comes up to him.
*  And I wrote, your honor, please correct me.
*  And he's like, who built this?
*  And Rourke said, I did.
*  And the line is, Rourke didn't realize it,
*  but he just gave that kid the courage to face the lifetime.
*  And I think that is such a beautiful thing where you can find inspiration in this character.
*  Don't become needlessly difficult.
*  Don't start parroting his lines.
*  You're not Howard Rourke and he's not a real person,
*  but there's aspects of him that you can apply to your life.
*  And here's something else.
*  I'll give you one example because this happened to me.
*  When I was working at Goldman Sachs, I was doing tech support
*  and my great-grandmother had passed away that year.
*  And I promised my grandmother I would have, thanks.
*  I've told the story several times.
*  I would have Thanksgiving dinner with her.
*  I was working second shift, four to midnight, and we were 24-7 help desk.
*  And I got the schedule for the next week
*  and I sold my grandmother lunch with her on Thanksgiving.
*  And they had put me down from four to midnight the day before Wednesday,
*  which is my normal shift.
*  But then the day shift the next day and I go to my boss, I go,
*  first off second shift, I'm like, this Thanksgiving, I promised my grandma.
*  And they're like, well, if you could find someone to fill this, we'll do it.
*  And I asked everyone, they're like, no.
*  And I said, I'm not coming in.
*  And I, 100%, not even a question, if I asked my grandmother,
*  can we have dinner instead?
*  She would have said yes.
*  But this was one of those moments, maybe this is from my huge ego,
*  where I felt like I was in a movie and I'm making a choice.
*  Am I going to ask grandma or am I going to just bend the knee?
*  And I go, I couldn't find anyone.
*  And I go, I'm not coming in.
*  And they go, if you're not coming in, you're fired.
*  And I go, fire me.
*  And they did fire me and I have no regrets.
*  And because if I'd compromised, I'd have money in my pocket.
*  But since I didn't compromise, I could look at that story.
*  Rand talks about how man is a being of self-made soul.
*  I could look at that story.
*  And next time, I have a time where it's a tough decision,
*  where there's really pressure.
*  I could be like, you know what?
*  This is the kind of person you are.
*  Stick to it.
*  I'll give one more example.
*  Sorry, Ron.
*  I've given talks on networking and I tell people, I like to use humor
*  because humor is a great way to shortcut the brain
*  and get the truth to them directly.
*  I say, if you know someone is in town, it's their birthday
*  and they're not doing anything, take them out.
*  And I say, I do this for Rand reasons.
*  I do it selfishly.
*  And the audience laughs and I go, you're laughing.
*  But I go, the guy who takes people out for their birthday is awesome.
*  That could be you.
*  There's nothing stopping you.
*  You're just not thinking of these terms.
*  What's it going to cost you?
*  $30?
*  But for the rest of their life or a few years,
*  that person will remember you and be like, you know what?
*  This person did right by me.
*  And I'll give you a concrete example, which changed my life profoundly.
*  Ted Hope, who was the producer of the film American Splendor,
*  which starred my mentor, Harvey Picar, sent an email to his firm
*  that said Harvey's in town with nothing to do.
*  If you want to hang out with him, here's your chance.
*  They worked at a film company and I was the only one, I got the email.
*  I wasn't working there from a friend who took him up on it.
*  And as a consequence, Harvey wrote a graphic novel about me, Egon Hubris,
*  which is $250 on eBay now and it moves at that, not too shabby.
*  The point being, you know what?
*  Someone had a movie made about him.
*  Someone is an interesting figure.
*  Take the lunch and stay overtime for an hour.
*  But so many people don't think in those terms
*  and there's so many opportunities for them.
*  So that's the advice I give.
*  And I think it's also good to give advice via anecdote.
*  So not only is the person getting the advice,
*  they are learning why you got to that point.
*  And maybe I'm wrong, but at least they've thought about it.
*  Yeah, I mean, I agree with all of that.
*  And I like the line, Einman's line about man is a self-made soul,
*  is a creature of a self-made soul is huge.
*  And it's something most people don't realize.
*  And it's something that modern intellectuals undermine.
*  I mean, even somebody like Sam Harris,
*  when you keep telling people they don't have free will,
*  then you don't have a self-made soul because what is self-made?
*  There is no self, according to Sam, right?
*  He meditates and he sees that he doesn't have a self.
*  So you're undermining the ability of people
*  to take control over their own lives
*  and make the kind of choices that are necessary
*  to create the kind of moral character
*  that is necessary for them to be successful.
*  So I'd encourage people to go read Found, Hidden, and Out with Shrugged
*  because put aside the politics,
*  put aside even aspects of the philosophy,
*  focus on these models.
*  How to Walk is a great model for all of us.
*  It's a great story to have in your head, in your mind,
*  when you encounter challenging choices that you might make.
*  And then spend the time, and this is,
*  I don't think I ever did this when I was young.
*  I don't think people do this,
*  but spend the time thinking about what your values really are.
*  What do you love doing?
*  What makes, what gets you going?
*  What gets you excited?
*  And in the end, you're going to be able to do that.
*  And how can I make a living at this?
*  How can I do this and live through this?
*  And then, you know, think about what kind of life you want,
*  what kind of, I don't know,
*  what kind of people you want to hang out with.
*  Don't just, don't let life just happen to you.
*  Think it through.
*  What kind of people, for example,
*  if you want ambitious, excited,
*  maybe you should move to Silicon Valley, to Austin, Texas, right?
*  If you want to be around artsy people,
*  I mean, you should go to Hollywood,
*  maybe you should go to New York.
*  I don't know, but figure out what kind of life you want to live,
*  what kind of people you want to hang out with,
*  what kind of woman you want to spend your life with,
*  or what kind of romantic relationship you want to have.
*  Figure that out and go and do it.
*  Don't sit around.
*  Life is not...
*  Or try and fail.
*  It's okay.
*  You're going to fail.
*  Failure, failure is absolutely...
*  And learn from that failure.
*  And that's the other thing.
*  Think about what you're doing, why you're succeeding,
*  why you're failing, and keep improving.
*  Keep working on it,
*  because it's not just going to happen like this.
*  Nobody is Francisco to take a character out of Atlas Shark,
*  to succeed at everything first try.
*  Right?
*  We all need to fail a few times.
*  We all need to...
*  But what have you got to lose?
*  Every second is never going to be back.
*  I mean, these are all cliches, but they're all true cliches.
*  So think, figure out what your values are,
*  and try to apply your reason,
*  your rational thought on getting those values,
*  and try to...
*  We talked about early on in the show, in the interview,
*  we talked about integrating your emotions with your cognition.
*  I think that's crucial,
*  because you don't want to be fighting your emotions
*  as you move towards these things.
*  You don't want your emotions to be barriers to your own success.
*  You want them to be cheerleaders, right?
*  To cheer on when good things happen,
*  and to be negative emotions when it's justified that they're negative.
*  So work on integrating your soul.
*  So creating your own soul, that's the real challenge.
*  And I'll give one piece of meta advice.
*  When you're young, you're going to be clueless,
*  because you're going to be ignorant, you know the data.
*  Don't ask your dopey friends for advice,
*  because they want to be helpful.
*  Or your parents.
*  But the friends want to be helpful.
*  They're as dopey as you, they're uninformed as you,
*  so they're just going to give you platitudes,
*  and you're going to be worse off, because now you're going to be confused.
*  Especially with social media.
*  Reach out to people who are older than you, who are accomplished.
*  You'd be surprised how often that you got to send them 20 bucks,
*  buy them dinner, buy their book, whatever it takes.
*  You are getting free, world-class advice for very cheap.
*  And that is really a mechanism for success.
*  And here's something very unpopular and not sexy.
*  This is why people probably unfollow me.
*  That's not why.
*  Read.
*  Well, you'll tell me why after this.
*  Read, read, read.
*  Because you're not always going to have access to those experts.
*  And I'm not just talking about self-help books.
*  I'm not even talking about self-help books.
*  Read the words with literature.
*  I mean, literature presents you with all the different characters.
*  Read Dostoevsky.
*  Read Who Go.
*  Read all these authors that have taken time to really create characters
*  and put them in situations that maybe you will never face those exact situations,
*  but you'll face similar situations.
*  And they play it out for you.
*  You'll see what the consequences are.
*  Great literature is a real tool for building your soul.
*  Great art generally with literature and particularly because it's more conceptual.
*  Maybe you could speak to love and relationship in your own life,
*  but in general, if we look at Al Schrog, if we look at Fountainhead,
*  and maybe this is going to become a therapy session for Lex,
*  but also just looking at your own life in a form of advice,
*  how can you be an auroric, reared and type character and do it?
*  Live your life to the fullest in creating the most amazing things that you're able to create
*  and yet have others in your life that you give yourself to in terms of loving them fully
*  and having a family, having kids, but even just the love of your life kind of thing.
*  How do you balance those things together?
*  Is there anything to say?
*  I'll say one thing because then I'll defer to your own
*  because he's the one who's married here.
*  I don't think it's a balance.
*  I think they complement each other and feed off each other.
*  So it's like, how do you balance having shoes and pants?
*  It's like, no, you want both.
*  You want it all.
*  And having a great partner who thinks you're a badass,
*  and then sometimes they're on the stage and you're like,
*  oh my, I'm married to a badass.
*  That's the goal.
*  Am I wrong?
*  No, absolutely.
*  It feeds off of each other.
*  It's synergetic.
*  It's completely synergetic.
*  The problem that people have, I think,
*  where they get into challenges is when they view them as opposites.
*  Work or family?
*  Well, if you don't work the family, you can't finance the family, but more than that,
*  why is your wife going to love you?
*  What are the virtues that you're bringing?
*  If you don't maximize your own potential,
*  if you don't live the best life that you can live, what is it to love?
*  And if she doesn't do the same thing, why do you love her?
*  So you don't get this conflict between work and how do I have a balanced life?
*  Of course you have a balanced life.
*  You balance it based on your values, and it's never going to be the same.
*  The balance is the time you spend at work with family when you're young
*  or when you have little kids or when they're grown up
*  is all going to be different.
*  It's going to depend on your priorities at the point,
*  but it's all going to feed off of each other.
*  So maybe another word outside of balance is sacrifice.
*  Do you think relationship involves sacrifice or not?
*  Does he know what he's doing?
*  I know. He's trolling you.
*  Is he trolling me?
*  He's a big troll.
*  Lex is the biggest troll on Twitter.
*  Never.
*  Ever.
*  Ever.
*  Ever.
*  Ever sacrifice.
*  Never sacrifice.
*  But see, he means sacrifice in the context.
*  I know. So I'm going to define something.
*  Yeah, yeah, okay.
*  So sacrifice in my world.
*  Can I say one thing before we get sidebar?
*  Rand had a good example when we're talking about balance.
*  So she was married to this guy, Frank O'Connor.
*  He was not a cerebral. He was not intellectual.
*  That's fine. She was in love with him.
*  And I met someone who had been friends with Rand.
*  And a lot of times she'd have these conversations with her acolytes
*  till like four in the morning about the most cerebral topics.
*  And I said he would always bring them food.
*  He'd stay up and kind of sit there in a corner.
*  And I go, when this was happening, was he sitting there like,
*  oh, God, here goes crazy old Ein and I just got to be bored.
*  And they go, absolutely not.
*  He was so proud of her. He was so excited.
*  In fact, when she got a lot of money from, I think, selling Red Pawn,
*  which was her screenplay, which never produced,
*  he told her you can buy any kind of fur coat as long as it's mink.
*  He's like, you earn this, celebrate it.
*  So that was a good example.
*  And that's a good relationship. Absolutely.
*  No, sacrifice is the giving of a value
*  and expecting either nothing or something less in return.
*  You don't do that in a love relationship.
*  Your love relationship is a sense, a trait.
*  You're constantly trading. You're not trading materially,
*  but you're trading spiritually.
*  Imagine if I only gave my wife, if I gave spiritually and materially,
*  only in one direction.
*  I'd get sick of it. She'd get sick of it.
*  It would never last.
*  It has to be in give and take constantly in different ways, right?
*  Different values.
*  It's not a monetary exchange,
*  but it's constantly you're giving and you're receiving and you're giving.
*  And that's got to be in balance.
*  And I know a lot of relationship where that gets out of bounds.
*  And at one party feels like they're giving all the time, the sacrificing.
*  They're giving more than they're receiving in a sense.
*  And it's over.
*  Now people use the word sacrifice, like Jordan Peterson.
*  Sometimes he uses it both ways.
*  That's a problem.
*  People use it.
*  I don't know him personally.
*  Jordan Peterson, I said.
*  I didn't call him Jordan.
*  He uses it in his talks as sometimes he uses it as just as I described it.
*  And he's supportive of that, like the sacrifice Jesus made.
*  And sometimes he uses it as an investment.
*  But it's not.
*  If you're giving some giving money now, expecting a bigger return in the future,
*  that's not a sacrifice.
*  That's an investment.
*  That's why we have two concepts for that.
*  And the same is true if my wife is ill.
*  And I mean, I've got a whole relationship build around what I'm giving.
*  It's not that I'm not getting anything back.
*  What I'm getting back is that she is recovering, right?
*  Is that she is still alive or whatever it is
*  that I'm keeping.
*  That's the value that I'm getting in return.
*  If I'm not getting that, why am I doing it?
*  Because I signed a contract a long time ago.
*  So it's not a sacrifice.
*  Children are not a sacrifice.
*  If I don't go to the movies because I stay at home with my kids,
*  it's because I love my kids more than I love going to the movies.
*  And if I love going to the movies more than I love staying with the kids,
*  then get a babysitter.
*  Or don't have kids, which is the better approach.
*  Here's another question.
*  What book did Ayn Rand say is the most evil book in all of serious literature?
*  Tolstoy?
*  It was Anna Karenina.
*  Yeah, Anna Karenina.
*  And the reason it was that book, which I haven't read,
*  please correct me if I get the plot wrong.
*  Rand was saying is the plot is a guy who's a big shot, I think.
*  He marries a stupid girl who has nothing of value to offer him for at all.
*  And she ends up killing herself.
*  Whereas Rand's version, and we can take this out of the romantic context.
*  I am delighted when I could be of use to my friends.
*  It makes me feel wonderful and not in a kind of parasitic way.
*  That I'm at a certain point where they call me up,
*  they're having a problem, and I've helped them with that problem.
*  Anna Karenina, he gives up the love of his life.
*  Oh, is that what it is?
*  The intelligent girl, the amazing girl.
*  He has an affair with her outside of marriage, taints her,
*  is married to the stupid, but she gives him the prestige and everything.
*  Oh, that's clearly very anti-Rand.
*  And the smart, the one he loves, she commits suicide in there.
*  Oh, okay, I got it wrong.
*  So it's about him choosing mediocrity and nothingness over this over love.
*  So pursuing your values is so crucial.
*  So don't sacrifice.
*  It doesn't mean that if you want to eat Chinese and she wants to eat Italian,
*  you don't once in a while eat Italian on that day, right?
*  It's just noodles.
*  That's silly, right?
*  That's not a sacrifice, not in the sense in which we're talking about.
*  That's, you know, it doesn't mean don't compromise.
*  It doesn't mean don't compromise on the day-to-day stuff.
*  It means don't compromise on moral values.
*  It doesn't mean you don't compromise on the big stuff.
*  And you never sacrifice.
*  And that way you have a relationship that's built as equals
*  and you admire each other.
*  And love at the end of the day is a response to value.
*  If you start undermining your own value,
*  the person who loves you will stop loving you or love you less.
*  If you love yourself less, you have to,
*  and I also said, in order to say I love you, you have to be able to say the I.
*  Right?
*  You have to be somebody.
*  You have to know yourself.
*  You have to have value.
*  And so love is a profound emotional response to value.
*  So speaking of love and the three of us being on this deserted island for time together,
*  somehow not murdering each other, let me ask you,
*  Yaron, Michael, what is the most beautiful thing you find about the other?
*  So let's go, Yaron, first.
*  What do you think about Michael that you appreciate about him?
*  Where do you get these questions from?
*  That you think...
*  What do you love?
*  What do you love about Michael?
*  That makes sense.
*  That he's going to edit it.
*  See, that makes sense to me.
*  I just programmed him.
*  Press play.
*  It's all just...
*  It's all just a pre-recorded message.
*  So I've never met Michael before.
*  So this is my...
*  That's not true.
*  You have and...
*  So I don't remember ever meeting Michael before.
*  And you're the very beginning of the new right is me meeting you.
*  I'm in the book?
*  Yes.
*  All right.
*  Well, now I have to read his book because I mean,
*  am I presented positively or negatively?
*  Very.
*  Oh, okay, good.
*  Lex is not so sure.
*  He's like...
*  I like that he goes,
*  am I presented positively or negatively?
*  I just go very.
*  Very.
*  And he's like, oh, good.
*  I'm like, is it?
*  So Michael Sharp is quick.
*  He's funny, although some of the humor is beyond me.
*  That's a nice way of saying he's very intelligent.
*  Yeah, he's definitely very intelligent.
*  But also very engaging.
*  I think that's very engaging.
*  And a sharp dresser.
*  It's just fun.
*  Oh, he's definitely...
*  Well, yeah, I'm going to compliment him on stuff that's obvious
*  and everybody can see by the video.
*  Let me also just comment one thing you mentioned about
*  you deriving joy from being of value to your friends.
*  People talk to me about you sometimes because you'll do
*  humor about various things and think like maybe you're some kind of
*  crazy person or something like that.
*  I wanted to think that.
*  Yeah, I know you enjoy this aspect of it.
*  But I say that the reason I'm friends with Michael is there's real love there
*  and the kind of kindness you give to your friends, to people that are close to you,
*  to your family is amazing, man.
*  So that's one of my favorite things about you.
*  Your intellect aside, your philosophies aside, your humor aside.
*  I think there's a lot of love in you.
*  That's what I really appreciate.
*  But enough about you.
*  I'm actually getting sick of saying nice things about you.
*  You always get to say it.
*  And I take it all back.
*  Can I say one thing?
*  You're joking, but this is something that's very key and it's something in a random context.
*  It is very disturbing.
*  And this is not by accident how in our culture it is pooh-poohed to show kindness,
*  earnestness, appreciation, to tell someone.
*  You see this on Twitter where someone's like, you know what?
*  I read your book.
*  It's made my life a lot better.
*  Okay, simp.
*  And there is a real, and this very much comes out of urban media circles.
*  There's this real disdain for showing appreciation, for showing happiness,
*  for showing kindness.
*  And you don't know, now that I've called it out, you'll notice it.
*  But when you see how common it is and how people can't take compliments,
*  the effects of that are extreme and extremely negative.
*  I gotta say about Texas, one of the-
*  Texas is a particular family.
*  So Austin especially.
*  I mean, I don't really fully know Texas, Texas.
*  But Austin, the friendliness.
*  There's a reason I've gotten fatter and been drinking a lot
*  is all the friendliness from random people who are no longer random.
*  They're just friends.
*  I've made more friends in one week than I have in my entire stay in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  One and a half.
*  You know what the number two means.
*  I've never counted up that high.
*  So this is what happens when people are free?
*  No.
*  When people are free and individualistic, it's exact opposite of what people believe.
*  The more collectivist we are, the less free we are, the nastier we are to one another.
*  Individualists who are pursuing their own happiness
*  are incredibly kind, friendly, and supportive people.
*  Okay. And now your task with doing-
*  Talk about bad juju.
*  To practice what you preach, is there in your soul that you can find
*  one beautiful thing to say about Yaron now that you guys
*  met for the first, second, or third time, or at least in book format?
*  So that's the easy one.
*  So what I like about Yaron is that I think he is taking-
*  One of the problems with maybe more old school objectivism
*  is that they would just use Rand's arguments in Rand's way.
*  And it's like, you're a parrot.
*  You're not adding anything and you're not going to be better than her.
*  So you give this talk about-
*  I think you compare- was it Bill Gates to-
*  Who was the one-
*  Mother Teresa.
*  No, who was the one who went to jail?
*  Oh, Bernie Madoff.
*  To Bernie Madoff.
*  And you make the point, you're like,
*  does anyone here really think Bernie Madoff was happy?
*  Yeah, he's successful and he's wealthy, but does he go to bed being like,
*  hey, I'm a great guy?
*  No, and his son kills himself with all this tragedy that goes with him.
*  So I think anyone who takes an ideology or worldview that I think is of value
*  and adds to it and articulates it in a new way, I think is a great accomplishment.
*  I like how uncompromising you are in your views of putting her views forward.
*  And I like how you illustrate how silly it is to argue against anarchism.
*  So I don't really have to do any of the work.
*  As for you, and I've thought this before many times,
*  you were the first person I met who I come at, literally the first,
*  other than my friend who went to Yeshiva with as a kid, who I come at us.
*  There was a line on Friends where Ross and Rachel were thinking of dating, right?
*  And they go, if we start dating, it would be like the third date,
*  because they knew each other well.
*  And then she's like, yeah, but it'd be like that.
*  So it's like a plus and a minus, like, yeah, you're fast-forwarding to seriousness,
*  but it's also the fact that you and I have the same background.
*  Like, I can sit with your own or any of my other friends and try to explain it.
*  The fact that intuitively you and I grew up the same,
*  and I know that we have that background in common does create a bond,
*  because I feel even if I haven't told you certain things,
*  you are going to understand me a lot better than many of my friends
*  who've known me for a long time.
*  I also really like how I feel, this is a very new age term, but I'm going to use it.
*  I feel very seen when I talk to you.
*  I think you see me for who I am, you appreciate me for who I am.
*  And I also really like how, and this is increasingly common as my platform increases,
*  so I'm very flattered by this.
*  You understand what I'm trying to do and you don't try to get in the way,
*  even though it's your show.
*  You're like, okay, this guy's a performer, he's doing his thing.
*  People appreciate it, I appreciate it.
*  I'm not going to try to drive their car.
*  I think some people who are bad, and I've not encountered this because I would shoot it down,
*  but I think a lot of times people have a tendency when they're hosts
*  to try to drive the car.
*  These things work when we come in here, none of us prepare, you prepare by me,
*  none of us talk beforehand and make it spontaneous.
*  The audience really enjoys that more because they know it's real, earnest and dynamic.
*  Yeah, I enjoy having you drive the car even though I believe you don't have a license.
*  And you think we're going to crash.
*  No, I think he's an extraordinary interviewer because of all those things.
*  He makes you feel visible.
*  But he also comes across as really earnest.
*  Questions that you seem really interested in, that you really want answers to.
*  It doesn't come across as canned or I prepared my three book project questions.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  I was pretty sure that on a desert island this would end in murder, but now I believe it may.
*  Well, given his comments and anarchy, it might still.
*  It's going to be human testing.
*  It might still.
*  It might still.
*  It might still.
*  The day is young, the night is young.
*  This is just the beginning.
*  This is a huge honor.
*  I've been a fan of both of you separately for a long time.
*  I really appreciate wasting all this time with me today.
*  I love you, Michael.
*  I love you, Aaron.
*  We love you too.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Malus and Yaron Brook.
*  And thank you to Ground News, Public Goods, Athletic Greens, Brave, and Four Sigmatic.
*  Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.
*  Surround yourself with people who make you happy.
*  People who make you laugh.
*  Who help you when you're in need.
*  People who genuinely care.
*  They are the ones worth keeping in your life.
*  Everyone else is just passing through.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
