# Jordan Ellenberg: Mathematics of High-Dimensional Shapes and Geometries | Lex Fridman Podcast #190
**Lex Fridman:** [June 12, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tueAcSiiqYA)
*  The following is a conversation with Jordan Ellenberg, a mathematician at University of Wisconsin
*  and an author who masterfully reveals the beauty and power of mathematics in his 2014 book,
*  How Not to be Wrong, and his new book, just released recently, called Shape! The hidden
*  geometry of information, biology, strategy, democracy, and everything else. Quick mention
*  of our sponsors, Secret Sauce, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Indeed. Check them out in the
*  description to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that geometry is what made me
*  fall in love with mathematics when I was young. It first showed me that something definitive could
*  be stated about this world through intuitive visual proofs. Somehow that convinced me that
*  math is not just abstract numbers devoid of life, but a part of life, part of this world,
*  part of our search for meaning. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation
*  with Jordan Ellenberg. If the brain is a cake, it is. Let's just go with me on this. Okay.
*  We'll pause it. So for Noam Chomsky, language, the universal grammar, the framework from which
*  language springs is like most of the cake, the delicious chocolate center, and then the rest of
*  cognition that we think of is built on top, extra layers, maybe the icing on the cake, maybe just,
*  maybe consciousness is just like a cherry on top. Where do you put in this cake mathematical
*  thinking? Is it as fundamental as language in the Chomsky view? Is it more fundamental in language?
*  Is it echoes of the same kind of abstract framework that he's thinking about in terms
*  of language that they're all like really tightly interconnected? That's a really interesting question.
*  You're getting me to reflect on this question of whether the feeling of producing mathematical
*  output, if you want, is like the process of, you know, uttering language or producing linguistic output.
*  I think it feels something like that, and it's certainly the case, let me put it this way,
*  it's hard to imagine doing mathematics in a completely non-linguistic way. It's hard to
*  imagine doing mathematics without talking about mathematics and sort of thinking in propositions,
*  but you know, maybe it's just because that's the way I do mathematics, so maybe I can't imagine it
*  any other way, right? Well, what about visualizing shapes, visualizing concepts to which language is
*  not obviously attachable? Ah, that's a really interesting question, and you know, one thing it
*  reminds me of is one thing I talk about in the book is dissection proofs, these very beautiful
*  proofs of geometric propositions. There's a very famous one by Bhaskara of the Pythagorean theorem.
*  Proofs which are purely visual, proofs where you show that two quantities are the same by taking
*  the same pieces and putting them together one way and making one shape and putting them together
*  another way and making a different shape, and then observing those two shapes must have the same area
*  because they were built out of the same pieces. You know, there's a famous story, and it's a little
*  bit disputed about how accurate this is, but that in Bhaskara's manuscript, he sort of gives this
*  proof, just gives the diagram, and then the entire verbal content of the proof is he just writes under
*  it, behold! Like that's it. There's some dispute about exactly how accurate that is, but so then
*  that's an interesting question. If your proof is a diagram, if your proof is a picture, or even if
*  your proof is like a movie of the same pieces like coming together in two different formations to make
*  two different things, is that language? I'm not sure I have a good answer. What do you think?
*  I think it is. I think the process of manipulating the visual elements is the same as the process of
*  manipulating the elements of language, and I think probably the manipulating, the aggregation,
*  the stitching stuff together is the important part. It's not the actual specific elements. It's more
*  like to me language is a process and math is a process. It's not just specific symbols. It's
*  inaction. It's ultimately created through action, through change, and so you're constantly evolving
*  ideas. Of course, we kind of attach. There's a certain destination you arrive to that you attach
*  to, and you call that a proof, but that doesn't need to end there. It's just at the end of the
*  chapter and then it goes on and on and on in that kind of way. But I got to ask you about geometry,
*  and it's a prominent topic in your new book Shape. So for me, geometry is the thing, just like as
*  you're saying, made me fall in love with mathematics when I was young. So being able to prove something
*  visually just did something to my brain that it planted this hopeful seed that you can
*  understand the world perfectly. Maybe it's an OCD thing, but from a mathematics perspective,
*  humans are messy. The world is messy. Biology is messy. Your parents are yelling or making you do
*  stuff, but you can cut through all that BS and truly understand the world through mathematics.
*  Nothing like geometry did that for me. For you, you did not immediately fall in love with geometry.
*  So how do you think about geometry? Why is it a special field in mathematics?
*  And how did you fall in love with it? You have.
*  Wow, you've given me a lot to say. And certainly the experience that you described
*  is so typical, but there's two versions of it. One thing I say in the book is that geometry is
*  the cilantro of math. People are not neutral about it. There's people who like you are like,
*  the rest of it I could take or leave, but then at this one moment, it made sense. This class made
*  sense. Why wasn't it all like that? There's other people I can tell you because they come and talk
*  to me all the time who are like, I understood all the stuff where you're trying to figure out what
*  X was or some mystery. You're trying to solve it. X is a number. I figured it out. But then there
*  was this geometry. What was that? What happened that year? I didn't get it. I was lost the whole
*  year and I didn't understand why we even spent the time doing that. But what everybody agrees on is
*  that it's somehow different. There's something special about it. We're going to walk around in
*  circles a little bit, but we'll get there. You asked me how I fell in love with math. I have a
*  story about this. When I was a small child, I don't know, maybe like I was six or seven, I don't know.
*  I'm from the 70s. I think you're from a different decade than that. But in the 70s,
*  you had a cool wooden box around your stereo. That was the look. Everything was dark wood.
*  The box had a bunch of holes in it to let the sound out. The holes were in this rectangular
*  array, a six by eight array of holes. I was just zoning out in the living room as kids do,
*  looking at this six by eight rectangular array of holes. If you like, just by focusing in and out,
*  looking at this box, looking at this rectangle, I was like, well, there's six rows of eight holes
*  each, but there's also eight columns of six holes each. So eight sixes and six eights. It's just
*  like the dissection Bruce you were just talking about, but it's the same holes. It's the same 48
*  holes. That's how many there are, no matter whether you count them as rows or count them as columns.
*  This was unbelievable to me. Am I allowed to cuss on your podcast? I don't know if that's
*  we FCC regulated. It was fucking unbelievable. That's the last time. Get it in there. This story
*  merits it. So two different perspectives and the same physical reality. Exactly. It's just as you
*  say, I knew the six times eight was the same as eight times six. I knew my times table. I knew
*  that that was a fact, but did I really know it until that moment? That's the question.
*  Right. I knew that I sort of knew that the times table was symmetric, but I didn't know why that
*  was the case until that moment. And in that moment I could see like, oh, I didn't have to have somebody
*  tell me that that's information that you can just directly access. That's a really amazing moment.
*  And as math teachers, that's something that we're really trying to bring to our students.
*  And I was one of those who did not love the kind of Euclidean geometry ninth grade class of like,
*  prove that an isosceles triangle has equal angles at the base, like this kind of thing. It didn't
*  vibe with me the way that algebra and numbers did. But if you go back to that moment,
*  from my adult perspective, looking back at what happened with that rectangle, I think that is a
*  very geometric moment. In fact, that moment exactly encapsulates the intertwining of algebra and
*  geometry. This algebraic fact that, well, in the instance, eight times six is equal to six times
*  eight, but in general, that whatever two numbers you have, you multiply them one way and it's the
*  same as if you multiply them in the other order. It attaches it to this geometric fact about a
*  rectangle, which in some sense makes it true. So, you know, who knows? Maybe I was always fated to
*  be an algebraic geometer, which is what I am as a researcher. So that's the kind of transformation.
*  And you talk about symmetry in your book. What the heck is symmetry? What the heck is these kinds of
*  transformation on objects that once you transform them, they seem to be similar. What do you make
*  of it? What's its use in mathematics or maybe broadly in understanding our world?
*  Well, it's an absolutely fundamental concept. And it starts with the word symmetry in the way
*  that we usually use it when we're just like talking English and not talking mathematics, right? Sort
*  of something is when we say something is symmetrical, we usually means it has what's called an axis of
*  symmetry. Maybe like the left half of it looks the same as the right half. That would be like a left
*  right axis of symmetry, or maybe the top half looks like the bottom half or both, right? Maybe
*  there's sort of a fourfold symmetry where the top looks like the bottom and the left looks like the
*  right or more. And that can take you in a lot of different directions. The abstract study of what
*  the possible combinations of symmetries there are, a subject which is called group theory was actually
*  one of my first loves in mathematics, what I thought about a lot when I was in college.
*  But the notion of symmetry is actually much more general than the things that we would call
*  symmetry if we were looking at like a classical building or a painting or something like that.
*  Nowadays, in math, we could use a symmetry to refer to any kind of transformation of
*  an image or a space or an object. So what I talk about in the book is take a figure
*  and stretch it vertically, make it twice as big vertically and make it half as wide.
*  That I would call a symmetry. It's not a symmetry in the classical sense, but it's a well-defined
*  transformation that has an input and an output. I give you some shape and it gets kind of,
*  I call this in the book a scrunch. I just had to make up some sort of funny sounding name for it
*  because it doesn't really have a name. Just as you can sort of study which kinds of objects are
*  symmetrical under the operations of switching left and right or switching top and bottom or
*  rotating 40 degrees or what have you, you could study what kinds of things are preserved by
*  this kind of scrunch symmetry and this kind of more general idea of what a symmetry can be.
*  Let me put it this way. A fundamental mathematical idea, in some sense, I might even say the idea
*  that dominates contemporary mathematics, or by contemporary, by the way, I mean like the last
*  150 years. We're on a very long time scale in math. I don't mean like yesterday. I mean like
*  a century or so up till now. It's this idea that's a fundamental question of when do we consider
*  two things to be the same? That might seem like a complete triviality. It's not. For instance,
*  if I have a triangle and I have a triangle of the exact same dimensions but it's over here,
*  are those the same or different? Well, you might say like, well, look, there's two different things.
*  This one's over here. This one's over there. On the other hand, if you prove a theorem about
*  this one, it's probably still true about this one. If it has like all the same side lanes and
*  angles and like looks exactly the same, the term of art, if you want it, you would say they're
*  congruent. But one way of saying it is there's a symmetry called translation. Translation is
*  saying it is there's a symmetry called translation, which just means move everything three inches to
*  the left. And we want all of our theories to be translation invariant. What that means is that
*  if you prove a theorem about a thing that's over here, and then you move it three inches to the
*  left, it would be kind of weird if all of your theorems like didn't still work. So this question
*  of like, what are the symmetries? And which things that you want to study are invariant under those
*  symmetries is absolutely fundamental. Boy, this is getting a little abstract, right? It's not at
*  all abstract. I think this is this is completely central to everything I think about in terms of
*  artificial intelligence. I don't know if you know about the MNIST data set with handwritten digits.
*  Yeah. And you know, I don't smoke much weed or any really, but it certainly feels like it when I look
*  at MNIST and think about this stuff, which is like, what's the difference between one and two? And
*  why are all the twos similar to each other? What kind of transformations are within the category
*  of what makes a thing the same? And what kind of transformations are those that make it different?
*  And symmetry is core to that. In fact, our whatever the hell our brain is doing, it's really good at
*  constructing these arbitrary and sometimes novel, which is really important when you look at like
*  the IQ test or they feel novel ideas of symmetry of like what like playing with objects, we're able
*  to see things that are the same and not and construct almost like little geometric theories
*  of what makes things the same and not and how to make programs do that in AI is a total open
*  question. And so I kind of stared and wonder how what kind of symmetries are enough to solve
*  the MNIST handwritten digit recognition problem and write that down.
*  Exactly. And what's so fascinating about the work in that direction from the point of view of a
*  mathematician like me and a geometer is that the kind of groups and of symmetries, the types of
*  symmetries that we know of are not sufficient, right? So in other words, like, we're just going
*  to keep on going into the weeds on this. The deeper the better. You know, a kind of symmetry
*  that we understand very well is rotation. Yeah, right. So here's what would be easy if humans,
*  if we recognize the digit as a one, if it was like literally a rotation by some number of degrees
*  of some fixed one in some typeface like Palatino or something, that would be very easy to understand,
*  right? It would be very easy to like write a program that could detect whether something was
*  a rotation of a fixed digit one. Whatever we're doing when we recognize the digit one and
*  distinguish it from the digit two, it's not that. It's not just incorporating one of the types of
*  symmetries that we understand. Now, I would say that I would be shocked if there was some kind of
*  classical symmetry type formulation that captured what we're doing when we tell the difference
*  between a two and a three. To be honest, I think what we're doing is actually more complicated than
*  that. I feel like it must be. They're so simple. These numbers, I mean, they're really geometric
*  objects. Like we can draw one, two, three. It does seem like it should be formalizable. That's why it's
*  so strange. Do you think it's formalizable when something stops being a two and starts being a
*  three, right? You can imagine something continuously deforming from being a two to a three. Yeah, but
*  that's, there is a moment. I have myself a written program that literally morphs twos and threes and
*  so on. And you watch and there's moments that you notice depending on the trajectory of that
*  transformation, that morphing, that it is a three and a two. There's a hard line. Wait, so if you ask
*  people, if you showed them this morph, if you ask a bunch of people, do they all agree about where the
*  transition happened? Because I would be surprised. I think so. Oh my God, okay, we have an empirical
*  dispute. But here's the problem. Here's the problem that if I just showed that moment that
*  I agreed on. Well, that's not fair. No, but say I said, so I want to move away from the agreement
*  because that's a fascinating actually question that I want to backtrack from because I just
*  just dogmatically said, because I could be very, very wrong, but the morphing really helps
*  that like the change, because I mean, partially because our perception systems, see this, it's
*  all probably tied in there. Somehow the change from one to the other, like seeing the video of it
*  allows you to pinpoint the place where a two becomes a three much better. If I just showed you
*  one picture, I think you might really, really struggle. You might call it a seven.
*  I think there's something also that we don't often think about, which is it's not just about
*  the static image. It's the transformation of the image, or it's not a static shape. It's the
*  transformation of the shape. There's something in the movement that seems to be not just about our
*  perception system, but fundamental to our cognition, like how we think about stuff.
*  Yeah, and that's part of geometry too. In fact, again, another insight of modern geometry is this
*  idea that maybe we would naively think we're going to study, I don't know, like Poincaré,
*  we're going to study the three body problem. We're going to study sort of like three objects in space
*  moving around subject only to the force of each other's gravity, which sounds very simple, right?
*  If you don't know about this problem, you're probably like, okay, so you just put it in your
*  computer and see what they do. Well, guess what? That's like a problem that Poincaré won a huge
*  prize for, like making the first real progress on in the 1880s. And we still don't know that much
*  about it 150 years later. I mean, it's a humongous mystery. You just open the door and we're going to
*  walk right in before we return to symmetry. What's the, who's Poincaré and what's this conjecture
*  that he came up with? Why is it such a hard problem? Okay. So Poincaré, he ends up being a
*  major figure in the book. And I don't, I didn't even really intend for him to be such a big figure,
*  but he's so, he's, he's first and foremost a geometer, right? So he's a mathematician who kind
*  of comes up in late 19th century France at a time when French math is really starting to flower.
*  Actually, I learned a lot. I mean, you know, in math, we're not really trained on our own history.
*  We got a PhD in math and learn about math. So I learned a lot. There's this whole kind of
*  moment where France has just been beaten in the Franco-Prussian war. And they're like, oh my God,
*  what did we do wrong? And they were like, we got to get strong in math, like the Germans, we have to
*  be like more like the Germans. So this never happens to us again. So it's very much, it's like the
*  Sputnik moment, you know, like what happens in America in the fifties and sixties with the
*  Soviet Union. This is happening to France. And they're trying to kind of like instantly like
*  modernize. That's fascinating. The humans and mathematics are intricately connected to the
*  history of humans. The cold war is, I think, fundamental to the way people saw science and
*  math in the Soviet Union. I don't know if that was true in the United States, but certainly
*  was in the Soviet Union. It definitely was. And I would love to hear more about how it was in the
*  Soviet Union. I mean, there's a, and we'll talk about the, the Olympiad. I just remember
*  that there was this feeling like the world hung in a balance and you could save the world
*  with the tools of science and mathematics was like the superpower that fuels science. And so like
*  people were seen as, you know, people in America often idolize athletes, but ultimately the best
*  athletes in the world, they just throw a ball into a basket. So like there's not what people
*  really enjoy about sports. And I love sports is like excellence at the highest level. But when
*  you take that with mathematics and science, people also enjoyed excellence in science and mathematics
*  in the Soviet Union, but there's an extra sense that that excellence will lead to a better world.
*  So that created all the usual things you think about with the Olympics, which is like
*  extreme competitiveness, right? But it also created this sense that in the modern era in America,
*  somebody like Elon Musk, whatever you think of him, like Jeff Bezos, those folks, they inspire
*  the possibility that one person or a group of smart people can change the world, like not just
*  be good at what they do, but actually change the world. Mathematics was at the core of that.
*  And I don't know, there's a romanticism around it too. Like when you read books about in America,
*  people romanticize certain things like baseball, for example, there's like these beautiful poetic
*  writing about the game of baseball. The same was the feeling with mathematics and science in the
*  Soviet Union. And it was, it was in the air. Everybody was forced to take high level mathematics
*  courses. Like you took a lot of math, you took a lot of science and a lot of like really rigorous
*  literature. Like they, the level of education in Russia, this could be true in China, I'm not sure,
*  in a lot of countries is in whatever that's called, it's K to 12 in America, but like young
*  people education, the level they were challenged to learn at is incredible. It's like America,
*  it's like America falls far behind, I would say America then quickly catches up and then
*  exceeds everybody else at the, like the, as you start approaching the end of high school to college,
*  like the university system in the United States arguably is the best in the world.
*  But like what, what we challenge everybody, it's not just like the good, the A students,
*  but everybody to learn in the Soviet Union was fascinating. I think I'm going to pick up on
*  something you said. I think you would love a book called Duel at Dawn by Amir Alexander,
*  which I think some of the things you're responding to, what I wrote, I think I first got turned onto
*  by Amir's work. He's a historian of math and he writes about the story of Everest Galois,
*  which is a story that's well known to all mathematicians. This kind of like very, very
*  romantic figure who he really sort of like begins the development of this, well, this theory of
*  groups that I mentioned earlier, this general theory of symmetries and then dies in a duel in
*  his early twenties, like all this stuff, mostly unpublished. It's a very, very romantic story that
*  we all learn. And much of it is true, but Alexander really lays out just how much the way people
*  thought about math in those times in the early 19th century was wound up with, as you say,
*  romanticism. I mean, that's when the romantic movement takes place and he really outlines how
*  people were predisposed to think about mathematics in that way because they thought about poetry
*  that way and they thought about music that way. It was the mood of the era to think about,
*  we're reaching for the transcendent, we're sort of reaching for sort of direct contact with the
*  divine. And so part of the reason that we think of Galois that way was because Galois himself was a
*  creature of that era and he romanticized himself. I mean, now we know he like wrote lots of letters
*  and he was kind of like, I mean, in modern terms, we would say he was extremely emo.
*  We wrote all these letters about his like florid feelings and like the fire within him about the
*  mathematics. And so it's just as you say that the math history touches human history. They're
*  never separate because math is made of people. I mean, that's what it's people who do it and
*  we're human beings doing it and we do it within whatever community we're in and we do it affected
*  by the mores of the society around us. So the French, the Germans and Poincaré.
*  Yes. Okay. So back to Poincaré. So he's, you know, it's funny, this book is filled with kind of,
*  you know, mathematical characters who often are kind of peevish or get into feuds or sort of have
*  like weird enthusiasms because those people are fun to write about and they sort of like say
*  very salty things. Poincaré is actually none of this. As far as I can tell, he was an extremely
*  normal dude who didn't get into fights with people and everybody liked him and he was like
*  pretty personally modest and he had very regular habits. You know what I mean? He did math for like
*  four hours in the morning and four hours in the evening and that was it. Like he had his schedule.
*  I actually, it was like, I still am feeling like somebody's going to tell me now that the book is
*  out like, oh, didn't you know about this like incredibly sordid episode of this? As far as I
*  could tell, a completely normal guy, but he just kind of in many ways creates the geometric world
*  in which we live and, you know, his first really big success is this prize paper he writes for this
*  prize offered by the King of Sweden for the study of the three body problem. The study of what we
*  can say about, yeah, three astronomical objects moving in what you might think would be this very
*  simple way. Nothing's going on except gravity. So what's the three body problem? Why is that a problem?
*  So the problem is to understand when this motion is stable and when it's not. So stable meaning
*  they would sort of like end up in some kind of periodic orbit or I guess it would mean,
*  sorry, stable would mean they never sort of fly off far apart from each other and unstable would
*  mean like eventually they fly apart. So understanding two bodies is much easier.
*  Yeah, exactly. Two bodies, this is what Newton knew, two bodies, they sort of orbit each other
*  in some kind of either in an ellipse, which is the stable case, you know, that's what planets
*  do that we know. Or one travels on a hyperbola around the other, that's the unstable case,
*  it sort of like zooms in from far away, sort of like whips around the heavier thing and like
*  zooms out. Those are basically the two options. So it's a very simple and easy to classify story.
*  With three bodies, just a small switch from two to three, it's a complete zoo. It's the first,
*  what we would say now is it's the first example of what's called chaotic dynamics,
*  where the stable solutions and the unstable solutions, they're kind of like wound in among
*  each other and a very, very, very tiny change in the initial conditions can make the long-term
*  behavior of the system completely different. So Poincare was the first to recognize that
*  that phenomenon even existed. What about the conjecture that carries his name? Right, so he
*  also was one of the pioneers of taking geometry, which until that point had been largely the study
*  of two and three dimensional objects, because that's like what we see, right? That's those are
*  the objects we interact with. He developed a subject we now call topology. He called it
*  analysis situs. He was a very well-spoken guy with a lot of slogans, but that name did not,
*  you can see why that name did not catch on. So now it's called topology now.
*  Sorry, what was it called before? Analysis situs, which I guess sort of roughly means like the
*  analysis of location or something like that. Like it's a Latin phrase. Partly because he understood
*  that even to understand stuff that's going on in our physical world, you have to study higher
*  dimensional spaces. How does this work? And this is kind of like where my brain went to it,
*  because you were talking about not just where things are, but what their path is, how they're
*  moving when we were talking about the path from two to three. He understood that if you want to
*  study three bodies moving in space, well, each body has a location where it is. So it has an
*  x coordinate, a y coordinate, a z coordinate, right? I can specify a point in space by giving
*  you three numbers, but it also at each moment has a velocity. So it turns out that really to
*  understand what's going on, you can't think of it as a point or you could, but it's better not to
*  think of it as a point in three dimensional space that's moving. It's better to think of it as a
*  point in six dimensional space where the coordinates are, where is it and what's its velocity right now.
*  That's a higher dimensional space called phase space. And if you haven't thought about this
*  before, I admit that it's a little bit mind bending, but what he needed then was a geometry
*  that was flexible enough, not just to talk about two dimensional spaces or three dimensional spaces,
*  but any dimensional space. So the sort of famous first line of this paper where he introduces
*  analysis Cetus is no one doubts nowadays that the geometry of n dimensional space is an actually
*  existing thing, right? I think that maybe that had been controversial. And he's saying like,
*  look, let's face it, just because it's not physical doesn't mean it's not there. It doesn't mean we
*  shouldn't study it. Interesting. He wasn't jumping to the physical interpretation. Like it does,
*  it can be real even if it's not perceivable to human cognition. I think that's right. I think,
*  don't get me wrong, Poincaré never stays far from physics. He's always motivated by physics,
*  but the physics drove him to need to think about spaces of higher dimension. And so he needed a
*  formalism that was rich enough to enable him to do that. And once you do that, that formalism is
*  also going to include things that are not physical. And then you have two choices. You can be like,
*  oh, well, that stuff's trash. Or, but, and this is more of the mathematician's frame of mind.
*  If you have a formalistic framework that like seems really good and sort of seems to be like
*  very elegant and work well, and it includes all the physical stuff, maybe we should think about
*  all of it. Like maybe we should think about thinking, oh, maybe there's some gold to be mined
*  there. And indeed, like, you know, guess what? Like before long there's relativity and there's
*  space time. And like all of a sudden it's like, oh yeah, maybe it's a good idea. We already have
*  this geometric apparatus like set up for like how to think about four dimensional spaces, like turns
*  out they're real after all. This is a story much told in mathematics, not just in this context,
*  but in many. I'd love to dig in a little deeper on that actually, because I have some intuitions to
*  work out. Okay. My brain. Well, I'm not a mathematical physicist, so we can work it out
*  together. Good. Well, we'll together walk along the path of curiosity, but Poincare conjecture.
*  What is it? The Poincare conjecture is about curved three dimensional spaces. So I wasn't my way
*  there. I promise. The idea is that we perceive ourselves as living in, we don't say a three
*  dimensional space. We just say three dimensional space. You know, you can go up and down, you can
*  go left and right. You can go forward and back. There's three dimensions in which we can move.
*  In Poincare's theory, there are many possible three dimensional spaces in the same way that
*  going down one dimension to sort of capture our intuition a little bit more.
*  We know there are lots of different two dimensional surfaces, right? There's a balloon
*  and that looks one way and a donut looks another way. And a Mobius strip looks a third way. Those
*  are all like two dimensional surfaces that we can kind of really get a global view of because we
*  live in three dimensional space so we can see a two dimensional surface sort of sitting in our
*  three dimensional space. Well, to see a three dimensional space whole, we'd have to kind of
*  have four dimensional eyes, right? Which we don't. So we have to use our mathematical eyes. We have
*  to envision. The Poincare conjecture says that there's a very simple way to determine whether
*  a three dimensional space is the standard one, the one that we're used to. Essentially, it's
*  that it's what's called fundamental group has nothing interesting in it. That I can actually
*  say without saying what the fundamental group is. I can tell you what the criterion is.
*  This would be good. Oh, look, I can even use a visual aid. So for the people watching this on
*  YouTube, you'll be able to see this. For the people on the podcast, you have to visualize it. So
*  Lex has been nice enough to give me a surface with an interesting topology. There's a mug
*  right here in front of me. A mug, yes. I might say it's a genus one surface, but we could also
*  say it's a mug. Same thing. So if I were to draw a little circle on this mug, which way should I
*  draw it so it's visible? Like here. Okay. If I draw a little circle on this mug, imagine this to be a
*  loop of string. I could pull that loop of string closed on the surface of the mug. Right? That's
*  definitely something I could do. I could shrink it, shrink it, shrink it until it's a point.
*  On the other hand, if I draw a loop that goes around the handle, I can kind of judge it up here
*  and I can judge it down there and I can sort of slide it up and down the handle, but I can't pull
*  it closed, can I? It's trapped. Not without breaking the surface of the mug, right? Not without like
*  going inside. So the condition of being what's called simply connected, this is one of Bunker
*  Ray's inventions, says that any loop of string can be pulled shut. So it's a feature that the mug
*  simply does not have. This is a non-simply connected mug and a simply connected mug would
*  be a cup, right? You would burn your hand when you drank coffee out of it. So you're saying the
*  universe is not a mug? Well, I can't speak to the universe, but what I can say is that
*  regular old space is not a mug. Regular old space, if you like sort of actually physically have like
*  a loop of string, you can always close it. You can always pull it shut. But you know, what if your
*  piece of string was the size of the universe? Like what if your piece of string was like billions
*  of light years long? Like how do you actually know? I mean, that's still an open question of the shape
*  of the universe. Exactly. Whether it's, I think there's a lot, there is ideas of it being a tourist.
*  I mean, there's some trippy ideas and they're not like weird out there controversial. There's legitimate
*  at the center of cosmology debate. I mean, I think most people think it's flat. I think that somebody who thinks that there's like some kind of
*  dodecahedral symmetry. I mean, I remember reading something crazy about somebody saying that they saw
*  the signature of that in the cosmic noise or what have you. I mean, to make the flat earthers happy,
*  I do believe that the current main belief is it's flat. It's flat-ish or something like that. The
*  shape of the universe is flat-ish. I don't know what the heck that means. I think that has like a very,
*  I mean, how are you even supposed to think about the shape of a thing that doesn't have any thing
*  outside of it? I mean, ah, but that's exactly what topology does. Topology is what's called an
*  intrinsic theory. That's what's so great about it. This question about the mug, you could answer it
*  without ever leaving the mug, right? Because it's a question about a loop drawn on the surface of the
*  mug and what happens if it never leaves that surface. So it's like always there. See, but that's
*  the difference between the topology and say if you're like trying to visualize a mug,
*  you can't visualize a mug while living inside the mug. Well, that's true. The visualization is
*  harder, but in some sense, no, you're right. But if the tools of mathematics are there,
*  sorry, I don't want to fight, but I think the tools of mathematics are exactly there to enable
*  you to think about what you cannot visualize in this way. Let me give, let's go always to make
*  things easier, go down a dimension. Let's think about we live on a circle. Okay, you can tell
*  whether you live on a circle or a line segment because if you live on a circle, if you walk a
*  long way in one direction, you find yourself back where you started. And if you live in a line
*  segment, you walk for long enough one direction, you come to the end of the world. Or if you live
*  on a line, like a whole line, an infinite line, then you walk in one direction for a long time.
*  And like, well, then there's not a sort of terminating algorithm to figure out whether
*  you live on a line or a circle, but at least you sort of, at least you don't discover that
*  you live on a circle. So all of those are intrinsic things, right? All of those are things that you
*  can figure out about your world without leaving your world. On the other hand, ready? Now we're
*  going to go from intrinsic to extrinsic. Why did I not know we were going to talk about this? But
*  why not? Why not? If you can't tell whether you live in a circle or a knot, like imagine like a
*  knot floating in three-dimensional space. The person who lives on that knot, to them, it's a
*  circle. They walk a long way, they come back to where they started. Now we, with our three-dimensional
*  eyes can be like, oh, this one's just a plain circle and this one's knotted up. But that's a,
*  that has to do with how they sit in three-dimensional space. It doesn't have to
*  do with intrinsic features of those people's world. We can ask you one ape to another. Does it make
*  you, how does it make you feel that you don't know if you live in a circle or on a knot, in a knot,
*  in, inside the string that forms the knot? I don't even know how to say that. I'm going to be honest
*  with you. I don't know if like, I, I, I fear you won't like this answer, but it does not bother me
*  at all. It does. I don't lose one minute of sleep over it. So like, does it bother you that if we
*  look at like a Mobius strip, that you don't have an obvious way of knowing whether you are inside
*  if you live on a surface of a cylinder or you live on the surface of a Mobius strip?
*  No, I think you can tell. If you live. Which one? Because if what you do is you like tell your
*  friend, hey, stay right here. I'm just going to go for a walk. And then you like walk for a long
*  time in one direction and then you come back and you see your friend again. And if your friend is
*  reversed, then you know, you live on a Mobius strip. Well, no, because you won't see your friend.
*  Right. Okay. Fair, fair point. Fair point on that. But you have to believe the stories
*  about no, I don't even know. I would, would you even know? Would you really? Oh, no, your,
*  no, your point is right. Let me try to think of a better, let's see if I can do this on the
*  fly. It may not be correct to talk about cognitive beings living on a Mobius strip because there's a
*  lot of things taken for granted there. And we're constantly imagining actual like three-dimensional
*  creatures, like how it actually feels like to, to live in a Mobius strip is tricky to internalize.
*  I think that on what's called the real protective plane, which is kind of even more sort of like
*  messed up version of the Mobius strip, but with very similar features, this feature of kind of
*  like only having one side that has the feature that there's a loop of string, which can't be
*  pulled close. But if you loop it around twice along the same path that you can pull closed,
*  that's extremely weird. Yeah. But that would be a way you could know without leaving your world that
*  something very funny is going on. You know, it's extremely weird. Maybe we can comment on,
*  hopefully it's not too much of a tangent is I remember thinking about this. This might be
*  right. This might be wrong, but if you're, if we now talk about a sphere and you're living inside
*  a sphere that you're going to see everywhere around you, the back of your own head
*  that I was, cause like I was, this was very counterintuitive to me to think about. Maybe
*  it's wrong, but cause I was thinking of like earth, you know, your 3d thing on sitting on a sphere,
*  but if you're living inside the sphere, like you're going to see, if you look straight,
*  you're always going to see yourself all the way around. So everywhere you look,
*  there's going to be the back of your own head. I think somehow this depends on something of like
*  how the physics of light works in this scenario, which I'm sort of finding it hard to bend my.
*  That's true. The C is doing a lot of work, like saying you see something's doing a lot of work.
*  People have thought about this. I mean, this, this metaphor of like, what if we're like
*  little creatures in some sort of smaller world, like how could we apprehend what's outside? That
*  metaphor just comes back and back. And actually I didn't even realize like how frequent it is.
*  It comes up in the book a lot. I know it from a book called Flatland. I don't know if you ever
*  read this when you were a kid or an adult, you know, this, this sort of, this sort of comic
*  novel from the 19th century about an entire two dimensional world. It's narrated by a square.
*  That's the main character and the kind of strangeness that befalls him when, you know,
*  one day he's in his house and suddenly there's like a little circle there and there with him.
*  And then the circle, but then the circle like starts getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
*  And he's like, what the hell is going on? It's like a horror movie, like for two dimensional
*  people. And of course what's happening is that a sphere is entering his world. And as the sphere
*  kind of like moves farther and farther into the plane, it's cross section. The part of it that he
*  can see to him, it looks like there's like this kind of bizarre being that's like getting larger
*  and larger and larger until it's exactly sort of halfway through. And then they have this kind of
*  philosophical argument with the spheres, like I'm a sphere. I'm from the third dimension. The
*  square is like, what are you talking about? There's no such thing. And they have this kind of like
*  sterile argument where the square is not able to kind of like follow the mathematical reasoning
*  of this sphere until the sphere just kind of grabs him and like jerks him out of the plane
*  and pulls him up. And it's like, now, like now do you see, like now do you see your
*  whole world that you didn't understand before?
*  So do you think that kind of process is possible for us humans? So we live in the three dimensional
*  world, maybe with a time component, four dimensional, and then math allows us to
*  go high into high dimensions comfortably and explore the world from those perspectives.
*  Like, is it possible that the universe is many more dimensions than the ones we experience as
*  human beings? So if you look at the, you know, especially in physics theories of everything,
*  physics theories that try to unify general relativity and quantum field theory, they seem to
*  go to high dimensions to work stuff out through the tools of mathematics. Is it possible?
*  So like the two options are one is just a nice way to analyze the universe, but the reality is,
*  as exactly we perceive it, it is three dimensional. Or are we just seeing, are we those flatland
*  creatures? They're just seeing a tiny slice of reality. And the actual reality is many, many,
*  many more dimensions than the three dimensions we perceive.
*  Oh, I certainly think that's possible. Now, how would you figure out whether it was true or not
*  is another question. And I suppose what you would do as with anything else that you can't directly
*  perceive is you would try to understand what effect the presence of those extra dimensions
*  out there would have on the things we can perceive. Like what else can you do? Right?
*  And in some sense, if the answer is they would have no effect, then maybe it becomes like a
*  little bit of a sterile question because what question are you even asking? Right? You can kind
*  of posit however many entities that you want. Is it possible to intuit how to mess with the
*  other dimensions while living in a three dimensional world? I mean, that seems like a very challenging
*  thing to do. The reason flatland could be written is because it's coming from a three dimensional
*  writer. Yes, but what happens in the book? I didn't even tell you the whole plot. What happens is
*  the square is so excited and so filled with intellectual joy. By the way, maybe to give the
*  story some context, you ask like, is it possible for us humans to have this experience of being
*  transcendentally jerked out of our world so we can sort of truly see it from above? Well,
*  Edwin Abbott, who wrote the book, certainly thought so because Edwin Abbott was a minister.
*  So the whole Christian subtext of this book, I had completely not grasped reading this as a kid,
*  that it means a very different thing, right? If sort of a theologian is saying like, oh,
*  what if a higher being could like pull you out of this earthly world you live in so that you can
*  sort of see the truth and like really see it from above as it were. So that's one of the things
*  that's going on for him. And it's a testament to his skill as a writer that his story just works,
*  whether that's the framework you're coming to it from or not. But what happens in this book,
*  in this part now, looking at it through a Christian lens, it becomes a bit subversive,
*  is the square is so excited about what he's learned from the sphere. And the sphere explains
*  him like what a cube would be. Oh, it's like you but three dimensional and the square is very
*  excited and the square is like, okay, I get it now. So like, now that you explained to me how just
*  by reason, I can figure out what a cube would be like, like a three dimensional version of me,
*  like, let's figure out what a four dimensional version of me would be like. And then the sphere
*  is like, what the hell are you talking about? There's no fourth dimension. That's ridiculous.
*  There's three dimensions, like that's how many there are, I can see. So it's this sort of comic
*  moment where the sphere is completely unable to conceptualize that there could actually be
*  yet another dimension. So yeah, that takes the religious allegory to like a very weird place
*  that I don't really understand theologically. But that's a nice way to talk about religion and myth
*  in general as perhaps us trying to struggle, us meaning human civilization, trying to struggle
*  with ideas that are beyond our cognitive capabilities. But it's in fact not beyond
*  our capability, maybe beyond our cognitive capabilities to visualize a four dimensional
*  cube, a tesseract, as some like to call it, or a five dimensional cube or a six dimensional cube,
*  but it is not beyond our cognitive capabilities to figure out how many corners a six dimensional
*  cube would have. That's what's so cool about us, whether we can visualize it or not, we can still
*  talk about it, we can still reason about it, we can still figure things out about it. That's amazing.
*  Yeah, if we go back to this, first of all to the mug, but to the example you give in the book of
*  the straw, how many holes does a straw have? And you listener may try to answer that in your own head.
*  Yeah, I'm going to take a drink while everybody thinks about it so we can give you a moment.
*  A slow sip. Is it zero, one, or two, or more than that maybe? Maybe you can get very creative,
*  but it's kind of interesting to dissecting each answer as you do in the book. It's quite brilliant,
*  people should definitely check it out, but if you could try to answer it now,
*  think about all the options and why they may or may not be right.
*  Yeah, it's one of these questions where people on first hearing it think it's a triviality and
*  they're like, well, the answer is obvious. And then what happens if you ever ask a group of people
*  this, something wonderfully comic happens, which is that everyone's like, well, it's completely
*  obvious. And then each person realizes that half the person, the other people in the room have a
*  different obvious answer. And then people get really heated, people are like, I can't believe
*  that you think it has two holes, or like, I can't believe that you think it has one. And then, you
*  know, you really like people really learn something about each other and people get heated.
*  I mean, can we go through the possible options here? Is it zero, one, two, three, 10?
*  Sure. So I think, you know, most people, the zero holders are rare, they would say like, well, look,
*  you can make a straw by taking a rectangular piece of plastic and closing it up. Rectangular piece
*  of plastic doesn't have a hole in it. I didn't poke a hole in it. So how can I have a hole?
*  They'd like it's just one thing. Okay. Most people don't see it that way. That's like,
*  is there any truth to that kind of conception? Yeah, I think that would be somebody who's a count.
*  I mean, what I would say is you could say the same thing.
*  About a bagel, you could say I can make a bagel by taking like a long cylinder of dough, which
*  doesn't have a hole and then smushing the ends together. Now it's a bagel. So if you're really
*  committed, you can be like, okay, a bagel doesn't have a hole either. But like, who are you if you
*  say a bagel doesn't have a hole? I mean, I don't know. Yeah. So that's almost like an engineering
*  definition of it. Okay. Fair enough. So what's, what about the other options? So, you know,
*  one hole people would say, I like how these are like groups of people, like where we've planted
*  our foot. There's books written about each belief. You know, we'd say, look, there's like a hole and
*  it goes all the way through the straw, right? There's one region of space. That's the hole.
*  And there's one and two hole people would say like, well, look, there's a hole in the top and the hole
*  at the bottom. I think a common thing you see when people
*  argue about this, they would take something like this bottle of water I'm holding,
*  and go open it. And they say, well, how many holes are there in this? And you say, well,
*  there's one, there's one hole at the top. Okay, what if I like poke a hole here so that all the
*  water spills out? Well, now it's a straw. Yeah. So if you're a one-hole, I say to you, like,
*  well, how many holes are in it now? There was one hole in it before and I poked a new hole in it.
*  And then you think there's still one hole, even though there was one hole and I made one more?
*  Clearly not. This is two holes. Yeah. And yet if you're a two-hole or the one-hole,
*  we'll say like, okay, where does one hole begin and the other hole end?
*  Yeah. And in the book, in math, there's two things we do when we're faced with a problem that's
*  confusing us. We can make the problem simpler. That's what we were doing a minute ago when we
*  were talking about high dimensional space. And I was like, let's talk about circles and line
*  segments. Let's go down a dimension to make it easier. The other big move we have is to make the
*  problem harder and try to sort of really like face up to what are the complications. So, you know,
*  what I do in the book is say like, let's stop talking about straws from it and talk about pants.
*  How many holes are there in a pair of pants? So I think most people who say there's two holes in
*  a straw would say there's three holes in a pair of pants. I guess, I mean, I guess we're filming
*  only from here. I could take up. No, I'm not going to do it. You just have to imagine the pants.
*  Sorry. Yeah. Lex, if you want to. No, I get no.
*  That's going to be in the director's cut. It's a Patreon only footage. There you go.
*  So many people would say there's three holes in a pair of pants. But, you know, for instance,
*  my daughter, when I asked, by the way, talking to kids about this is super fun. I highly recommend
*  it. What does she say? She said, well, yeah, I feel a pair of pants like just has two holes because
*  yes, there's the waist, but that's just the two leg holes stuck together. Whoa. Okay.
*  Two leg holes. Yeah. Okay. I mean, that's one for the straw. So she's a one holder for the straw too.
*  And and that really does capture something. It captures this fact, which is central to the
*  theory of what's called homology, which is like a central part of modern topology that
*  holes, whatever we may mean by them, there are somehow things which have an arithmetic to them.
*  There are things which can be added like the waist, like waist equals leg plus leg is kind
*  of an equation, but it's not an equation about numbers. It's an equation about some kind of
*  geometric, some kind of topological thing, which is very strange. And so, you know, when I come down,
*  you know, like a rabbi, I like to kind of like come up with these answers to somehow like
*  dodge the original question and say like, you're both right, my children. Okay, so. Yeah. So for
*  this truth, for the for the straw, I think what a modern mathematician would say is like,
*  the first version would be to say like, well, there are two holes, but they're really both the
*  same hole. Well, that's not quite right. A better way to say it is there's two holes,
*  but one is the negative of the other. Now, what can that mean? One way of thinking about what it
*  means is that if you sip something like a milkshake through the straw, no matter what,
*  the amount of milkshake that's flowing in one end, that same amount is flowing out the other end.
*  The other end. So they're not independent from each other. There's some relationship between them
*  in the same way that if you somehow could like suck a milkshake through a pair of pants,
*  the amount of milkshake, just go with me on this experiment. I'm right there with you. The amount
*  of milkshake that's coming in the left leg of the pants, plus the amount of milkshake that's coming
*  in the right leg of the pants is the same that's coming out the the waist of the pants. So just so
*  you know, I fasted for 72 hours the last three days, so I just broke the fast with a little
*  bit of food yesterday. So this sounds, food analogies or metaphors for this podcast work
*  wonderfully because I can intensely picture it. Is that your weekly routine or just in preparation
*  for talking about geometry for three hours? Exactly. It's just for this. It's hardship to
*  purify the mind. No, for the first time I just wanted to try the experience and just to pause,
*  to do things that are out of the ordinary, to pause and to reflect on how grateful I am to be
*  just alive and be able to do all the cool shit that I get to do. So did you drink water? Yes,
*  yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Water and salt. So like electrolytes and all those kinds of things.
*  But anyway, so the inflow on the top of the pants equals to the outflow on the bottom of the pants.
*  Exactly. So this idea that, I mean, I think, you know, Poincaré really had this idea,
*  this sort of modern idea. I mean, building on stuff other people did,
*  Betty is an important one of this kind of modern notion of relations between holes.
*  But the idea that holes really had an arithmetic, the really modern view was really Emmy Nutter's
*  idea. So she kind of comes in and sort of truly puts the subject on its modern footing that we
*  have now. So, you know, it's always a challenge, you know, in the book, I'm not going to say I give
*  like a course so that you read this chapter and then you're like, oh, it's just like I took like
*  a semester of algebraic anthropology. It's not like this. And it's always a, you know,
*  it's always a challenge writing about math, because there are some things
*  that you can really do on the page and the math is there. And there's other things which
*  it's too much in a book like this to like do them all the page, you can only
*  say something about them, if that makes sense. So, you know, in the book, I try to do some of both.
*  I try to do, I try to topics that are, you can't really compress and really truly say
*  exactly what they are in this amount of space. I try to say something interesting about them,
*  something meaningful about them so that readers can get the flavor. And then in other places,
*  I really try to get up close and personal and really do the math and have it take place on the
*  page. To some degree be able to give inklings of the beauty of the subject. Yeah, I mean,
*  there's, you know, there's a lot of books that are like, I don't quite know how to express this
*  well, I'm still laboring to do it. But there's a lot of books that are about stuff. But I want
*  I want my books to not only be about stuff, but to actually have some stuff there on the page in
*  the book for people to interact with directly and not just sort of hear me talk about distant
*  features about this, this different distant features of it. Right. So not be talking just
*  about ideas, but the actually be expressing the idea is there, you know, somebody in the,
*  maybe you can comment, there's a guy, his YouTube channel is three blue, one brown,
*  Grant Sanderson. He does that masterfully well. Absolutely. Of visualizing of expressing a
*  particular idea and then talking about it as well back and forth. What do you think about Grant?
*  It's fantastic. I mean, the flowering of math YouTube is like such a wonderful thing, because,
*  you know, math teaching, there's so many different venues through which we can teach people math,
*  there's the traditional one, right? Well, where I'm in a classroom with, you know, depending on
*  the class, it could be 30 people, it could be 100 people, it could, God help me be 500 people,
*  if it's like the calculus lecture or whatever it may be. And there's sort of some, but there's some
*  set of people of that order of magnitude. And I'm with them, we have a long time, I'm with them for
*  a whole semester. And I can ask them to do homework. And we talk together, we have office hours,
*  if they have one on one questions, Spotify, it's like a very high level of engagement. But
*  how many people am I actually hitting at a time? Like not that many, right? And you can, and there's
*  kind of an inverse relationship where the more, the fewer people you're talking to, the more
*  engagement you can ask for. The ultimate, of course, is like the mentorship relation of like a
*  PhD advisor and a graduate student where you spend a lot of one on one time together for like,
*  you know, three to five years. And the ultimate high level of engagement to one person.
*  You know, books, I can, this can get to a lot more people than are ever going to sit in my
*  classroom and you spend like, however many hours it takes to read a book. Somebody like Three Blue,
*  One Brown or Numberphile or people like Vi Hart. I mean, YouTube, let's face it, has bigger reach
*  than a book. Like there's YouTube videos that have many, many, many more views than like,
*  you know, any hardback book, like not written by a Kardashian or an Obama is going to sell, right?
*  And then, you know, those are, you know, some of them are like longer, 20 minutes long, some of
*  them are five minutes long, but they're, you know, they're shorter. And then even somebody,
*  look, like Eugenia Chang is a wonderful category theorist in Chicago. I mean, she was on, I think,
*  The Daily Show or is it? I mean, she was on, you know, she has 30 seconds, but then there's like
*  30 seconds to sort of say something about mathematics to like untold millions of people.
*  So everywhere along this curve is important. And one thing I feel like is great right now is that
*  people are just broadcasting on all the channels because we each have our skills, right? Somehow
*  along the way, like I learned how to write books. I had this kind of weird life as a writer where I
*  sort of spent a lot of time like thinking about how to put English words together into sentences
*  and sentences together into paragraphs, like at length, which is this kind of like weird
*  specialized skill. And that's one thing, but like sort of being able to make like,
*  you know, winning good looking eye catching videos is like a totally different skill.
*  And, you know, probably, you know, somewhere out there, there's probably sort of some like
*  heavy metal band that's like teaching math through heavy metal and like using their skills
*  to do that. I hope there is at any rate. Their music and so on. Yeah. But there is something to
*  the process. I mean, Grant does this especially well, which is in order to be able to visualize
*  something that he writes programs, so it's programmatic visualization. So like the things
*  he is basically mostly through his Manham library and in Python, everything is drawn through Python.
*  You have to, you have to truly understand the topic to be able to visualize it in that way
*  and not just understand it, but really kind of think in a very novel way. It's funny because
*  I've spoken with him a couple of times, spoken with him a lot offline as well. He really doesn't
*  think he's doing anything new, meaning like he sees himself as very different from maybe like a
*  researcher. But it feels to me like he's creating something totally new, like that act of understanding
*  and visualizing is as powerful or has the same kind of inkling of power as does the process of
*  proving something. It doesn't have that clear destination, but it's pulling out an insight
*  and creating multiple sets of perspective that arrive at that insight. And to be honest,
*  it's something that I think we haven't quite figured out how to value inside academic mathematics
*  in the same way. And this is a bit older that I think we haven't quite figured out how to value
*  the development of computational infrastructure. We all have computers as our partners now and people
*  build computers that sort of assist and participate in our mathematics. They build those
*  systems and that's a kind of mathematics too, but not in the traditional form of proving theorems
*  and writing papers. But I think it's coming. Look, I mean, I think, you know, for example,
*  the Institute for Computational and Experimental Mathematics at Brown, which is like a, you know,
*  it's a NSF funded math institute, very much part of sort of traditional math academia. They did an
*  entire theme semester about visualizing mathematics, looking at the same kind of thing that they would
*  do for like an up and coming research topic. Like that's pretty cool. So I think there really is buy
*  in from the mathematics community to recognize that this kind of stuff is important and counts
*  as part of mathematics, like part of what we're actually here to do. Yeah, I'm hoping to see more
*  and more of that from like MIT faculty, from faculty from all the top universities in the world.
*  Let me ask you this weird question about the Fields Medal, which is the Nobel Prize in Mathematics.
*  Do you think since we're talking about computers, there will one day come a time
*  when a computer and AI system will win a Fields Medal?
*  No. Of course, that's what a human would say. Why not? Is that like, that's like my capture.
*  That's like the proof that I'm a human is like, yeah. What is, how does he want me to answer?
*  Is there something interesting to be said about that? Yeah, I mean, I am tremendously interested
*  in what AI can do in pure mathematics. I mean, it's of course, it's a parochial interest, right?
*  You're like, why am I interested in like how it can like help feed the world or help solve
*  like the real problems? I'm like, can it do more math? Like, what can I do? We all have our interests,
*  right? But I think it is a really interesting conceptual question. And here too, I think
*  it's important to be kind of historical because it's certainly true that there's
*  lots of things that we used to call research and mathematics that we would now call computation.
*  Tasks that we've now offloaded to machines, like, you know, in 1890, somebody could be like,
*  here's my PhD thesis. I computed all the invariants of this polynomial ring under
*  the action of some finite group. Doesn't matter what those words mean, just it's like some thing
*  that in 1890 would take a person a year to do and would be a valuable thing that you might want to
*  know. And it's still a valuable thing that you might want to know. But now you type a few lines
*  of code in Macaulay or Sage or Magma and you just have it. So we don't think of that as
*  math anymore, even though it's the same thing. What's Macaulay, Sage and Magma? Oh, those are
*  computer algebra programs. So those are like sort of bespoke systems that lots of mathematicians
*  use. That's similar to Maple and- Yeah. Oh, yeah. So it's similar to Maple and Mathematica. Yeah.
*  But a little more specialized, but yeah. It's programs that work with symbols and allow you
*  to do, can you do proofs? Can you do kind of little leaps and proofs? They're not really built
*  for that, and that's a whole other story. But these tools are part of the process of mathematics
*  now. Right. They are now, for most mathematicians, I would say, part of the process of mathematics.
*  And so, you know, there's a story I tell in the book, which I'm fascinated by, which is,
*  you know, so far, attempts to get AIs to prove interesting theorems have not done so well. It
*  doesn't mean they can. There's actually a paper I just saw, which has a very nice use of a neural
*  net to find counter examples to conjecture. Somebody said like, well, maybe this is always that.
*  Yeah. And you can be like, well, let me sort of train an AI to sort of try to find
*  things where that's not true. And it actually succeeded. Now, in this case, if you look at the
*  things that it found, you say like, okay, I mean, these are not famous conjectures. Yes. Okay. So
*  like somebody wrote this down, maybe this is so. Looking at what the AI came up with, you're like,
*  you know, I bet if like five grad students had thought about that problem, they wouldn't have
*  come up with that. I mean, when you see it, you're like, okay, that is one of the things you might
*  try if you sort of like put some work into it. Still, it's pretty awesome. But the story I tell
*  in the book, which I'm fascinated by is there is there's a, okay, we're gonna go back to knots.
*  It's cool. There's a knot called the Conway knot after John Conway, who maybe we'll talk about a
*  very interesting character also. Yes. There's a small tangent, somebody I was supposed to talk to,
*  and unfortunately he passed away and he's somebody I find as an incredible mathematician, incredible
*  human being. So. Oh, and I am sorry that you didn't get a chance because having had the chance to
*  talk to him a lot when I was, you know, when I was a postdoc. Yeah, you missed out. There's no
*  way to sugarcoat it. I'm sorry that you didn't get that chance. Yeah, it is what it is. So knots.
*  Yeah. So there was a question. And again, it doesn't matter the technicalities of the question,
*  but it's a question of whether the knot is sliced. It has to do with something about what kinds of
*  three dimensional surfaces in four dimensions can be bounded by this knot. But never mind what it
*  means. It's some question and it's actually very hard to compute whether a knot is slice or not.
*  And in particular, the question of the Conway knot, whether it was sliced or not, was particularly
*  vexed until it was solved just a few years ago by Lisa Piccirillo, who actually, now that I think
*  of it, was here in Austin. I believe she was a grad student at UT Austin at the time. I didn't
*  even realize there was an Austin connection to this story until I started telling it. She is,
*  in fact, I think she's now at MIT. So she's basically following you around.
*  If I remember correctly, the reverse, there's a lot of really interesting richness to this
*  story. One thing about it is her paper was rather, was very short, was very short and simple,
*  nine pages of which two were pictures. Very short for like a paper solving a major conjecture.
*  And it really makes you think about what we mean by difficulty in mathematics. Like do you say,
*  actually the problem wasn't difficult because you could solve it so simply? Or do you say,
*  well no, evidently it was difficult because the world's top topologist worked on it for 20 years
*  and nobody could solve it, so therefore it is difficult. Or is it that we need some new category
*  of things about which it's difficult to figure out that they're not difficult?
*  This is a computer science formulation, but the journey to arrive at the simple answer
*  may be difficult, but once you have the answer, it will then appear simple.
*  I hope there's a large set of such solutions because once we stand at the end of the scientific
*  process that we're at the very beginning of, or at least it feels like, I hope there's just
*  simple answers to everything. That we'll look and it'll be simple laws that govern the universe,
*  simple explanation of what is consciousness, what is love, is mortality fundamental to life,
*  what's the meaning of life, are humans special or are we just another sort of reflection of
*  all that is beautiful in the universe in terms of like life forms. All of it is life and just
*  has different, when taken from a different perspective, all life can seem more valuable
*  or not, but really it's all part of the same thing. All those will have a nice like two equations,
*  maybe one equation. Why do you think you want those questions to have simple answers? I think
*  just like symmetry and the breaking of symmetry is beautiful somehow.
*  There's something beautiful about simplicity. I think it's aesthetic.
*  Or, but it's aesthetic in the way that happiness is an aesthetic.
*  Why is that so joyful that a simple explanation that governs a large number of cases is really
*  appealing? Even when it's not, like obviously we get a huge amount of trouble with that because
*  oftentimes it doesn't have to be connected with reality or even that explanation could be
*  exceptionally harmful. Most of like the world's history that was governed by hate and violence
*  had a very simple explanation at the court that was used to cause the violence and the hatred.
*  So like we get into trouble with that, but why is that so appealing? And in this nice forms
*  in mathematics, like you look at the Einstein papers, why are those so beautiful? And why is
*  the Andrew Wiles proof of the Fermat's Last Theorem not quite so beautiful? Like what's
*  beautiful about that story is the human struggle of like the human story of perseverance, of the
*  drama of not knowing if the proof is correct and ups and downs and all of those kinds of things.
*  That's the interesting part. But the fact that the proof is huge and nobody understands, well,
*  from my outsider's perspective, nobody understands what the heck it is,
*  is not as beautiful as it could have been. I wish it was what Fermat originally said, which is,
*  you know, it's not small enough to fit in the margins of this page, but maybe if he had like
*  a full page or maybe a couple of post-it notes, he would have enough to do the proof. What do you
*  make of, if we could take another of a multitude of tangents, what do you make of Fermat's Last
*  Theorem? Because the statement, there's a few theorems, there's a few problems that are deemed
*  by the world throughout its history to be exceptionally difficult. And that one in particular
*  is really simple to formulate and really hard to come up with a proof for. And it was like
*  taunted as simple by Fermat himself. Is there something interesting to be said about that
*  X to the N plus Y to the N equals Z to the N for N of three or greater? Is there a solution to this?
*  And then how do you go about proving that? Like, how would you try to prove that? And what do you
*  learn from the proof that eventually emerged by Andrew Wiles? Yeah, so right, so to give,
*  let me just say the background, because I don't know if everybody listening knows the story. So,
*  you know, Fermat was an early number theorist, at least sort of an early mathematician, those
*  special adjacent didn't really exist back then. He comes up in the book actually, in the context of
*  a different theorem of his that has to do with testing whether a number is prime
*  or not. So I write about, he was one of the ones who was salty and like he would exchange these
*  letters where he and his correspondence would like try to top each other and vex each other
*  with questions and stuff like this. But this particular thing, it's called Fermat's Last
*  Theorem because it's a note he wrote in his copy of the Disquestionis Arithmetic I. Like he wrote,
*  here's an equation, it has no solutions, I can prove it, but the proof is like a little too long
*  to fit in this in the margin of this book. He was just like writing a note to himself. Now,
*  let me just say historically, we know that Fermat did not have a proof of this theorem.
*  For a long time, people like, you know, people were like, this mysterious proof that was lost,
*  a very romantic story, right? But Fermat later, he did prove special cases of this theorem
*  and wrote about it, talked to people about the problem. It's very clear from the way that he
*  wrote where he can solve certain examples of this type of equation that he did not know how to do
*  the whole thing. He may have had a deep, simple intuition about how to solve the whole thing that
*  he had at that moment without ever being able to come up with a complete proof. And that intuition
*  maybe lost the time. Maybe. But I think we, so, but you're right that that is unknowable. But I think
*  what we can know is that later, he certainly did not think that he had a proof that he was concealing
*  from people. He, he thought he didn't know how to prove it. And I also think he didn't know how to
*  prove it. Now, I understand the appeal of saying like, wouldn't it be cool if this very simple
*  equation there was like a very simple, clever, wonderful proof that you could do in a page or
*  two. And that would be great. But you know what, there's lots of equations like that that are
*  solved by very clever methods like that, including the special cases that Fermat wrote about the
*  method of descent, which is like very wonderful and important. But in the end, those are nice
*  things that like, you know, you teach an undergraduate class, and it is what it is,
*  but they're not big. On the other hand, work on the Fermat problem, that's what we like to call it
*  because it's not really his theorem because we don't think you proved it. So, I mean, work on
*  the Fermat problem, develop this like incredible richness of number theory that we now live in
*  today, like, and not by the way, just while Andrew Wiles being the person who together with Richard
*  Taylor finally proved this theorem. But you know how you have this whole moment that people try to
*  prove this theorem and they fail. And there's a famous false proof by LeMay from the 19th century,
*  where Kummer in understanding what mistake LeMay had made in this incorrect proof,
*  basically understands something incredible, which is that, you know, a thing we know about numbers
*  is that you can factor them and you can factor them uniquely. There's only one way to break a
*  number up into primes. Like if we think of a number like 12, 12 is two times three times two,
*  I had to think about it. Right? Or it's two times two times three, of course, you can reorder them.
*  Right. But there's no other way to do it. There's no universe in which 12 is something times five,
*  or in which there's like four threes in it. Nope, 12 is like two twos and a three, like that
*  is what it is. And that's such a fundamental feature of arithmetic that we almost think of it
*  like God's law. You know what I mean? It has to be that way. That's a really powerful idea. It's so
*  cool that every number is uniquely made up of other numbers and like made up, meaning like there's
*  these like basic atoms that form molecules that get built on top of each other. I love it. I mean,
*  when I teach, you know, undergraduate number theory, it's like, it's the first really deep
*  theorem that you prove. What's amazing is, you know, the fact that you can factor a number into
*  primes is much easier. Essentially Euclid knew it, although he didn't quite put it in that way.
*  The fact that you can do it at all. What's deep is the fact that there's only one way to do it,
*  or however you sort of chop the number up, you end up with the same set of prime factors.
*  And indeed, what people finally understood at the end of the 19th century is that if you work in
*  number systems slightly more general than the ones we're used to, which it turns out are relevant
*  for Ma, all of a sudden this stops being true. Things get, I mean, things get more complicated
*  and now because you were praising simplicity before, you were like, it's so beautiful, unique
*  factorization. It's so great. So when I tell you that in more general number systems, there is no
*  unique factorization, maybe you're like, that's bad. I'm like, no, that's good because there's
*  like a whole new world of phenomena to study that you just can't see through the lens of the numbers
*  that we're used to. So I'm for complication. I'm highly in favor of complication. Every complication
*  is like an opportunity for new things to study. And is that the big, kind of one of the big insights
*  for you from Andrew Wiles' proof? Is there interesting insights about the process they
*  used to prove that sort of resonates with you as a mathematician? Is there an interesting concept
*  that emerged from it? Is there interesting human aspects to the proof? Whether there's interesting
*  human aspects to the proof itself is an interesting question. Certainly it has a huge amount of
*  richness sort of at its heart is an argument of what's called deformation theory,
*  which was in part created by my PhD advisor, Barry Mazur.
*  Can you speak to what deformation theory is? I can speak to what it's like.
*  Sure. How about that? What does it rhyme with? Right. Well, the reason that Barry called it
*  deformation theory, I think he's the one who gave it the name. I hope I'm not wrong in saying this
*  on Sunday. In your book, you have calling different things by the same name as one of the
*  things in the beautiful map that opens the book. Yes. And this is a perfect example. So this is
*  another phrase of Poincare, this incredible generator of slogans and aphorisms. He said,
*  mathematics is the art of calling different things by the same name. That very thing we do,
*  right? When we're like this triangle and this triangle, come on, they're the same triangle.
*  They're just in a different place. Right? So in the same way, it came to be understood that
*  the kinds of objects that you study when you study for Maslow's theorem, and let's not even
*  be too careful about what these objects are. I can tell you they're Gouwel representations
*  in modular forms, but saying those words is not going to mean so much. But whatever they are,
*  they're things that can be deformed, moved around a little bit. And I think the insight of what
*  Andrew and then Andrew and Richard were able to do was to say something like this. A deformation
*  means moving something just a tiny bit, like an infinitesimal amount. If you really are good at
*  understanding which ways a thing can move in a tiny, tiny, tiny, infinitesimal amount in certain
*  directions, maybe you can piece that information together to understand the whole global space in
*  which it can move. And essentially, their argument comes down to showing that two of those big global
*  spaces are actually the same, the fabled r equals t part of their proof, which is at the heart of it.
*  And it involves this very careful principle like that. But that being said, what I just said,
*  it's probably not what you're thinking. Because what you're thinking when you think, oh, I have a
*  point in space and I move it around like a little tiny bit, you're using
*  your notion of distance that's from calculus. We know what it means for like two points in the real
*  line to be close together. So yet another thing that comes up in the book a lot is this fact that
*  the notion of distance is not given to us by God. We could mean a lot of different things by distance.
*  And just in the English language, we do that all the time. We talk about somebody being a close
*  relative. It doesn't mean they live next door to you, right? It means something else. There's a
*  different notion of distance we have in mind. And there are lots of notions of distances
*  that you could use. In the natural language processing community in AI, there might be some
*  notion of semantic distance or lexical distance between two words. How much do they tend to arise
*  in the same context? That's incredibly important for doing autocomplete and machine translation
*  and stuff like that. And it doesn't have anything to do with are they next to each other in the
*  dictionary, right? It's a different kind of distance. Okay, ready? In this case,
*  number theory, there was a crazy distance called the P-adic distance. I didn't write about this
*  that much in the book because even though I love it, it's a big part of my research life. It gets
*  a little bit into the weeds, but your listeners are going to hear about it now. Please. What a
*  normal person says when they say two numbers are close, they say their difference is like a small
*  number. Like seven and eight are close because their difference is one and one's pretty small.
*  If we were to be what's called a two-adic number theorist, we'd say, oh, two numbers are close
*  if their difference is a multiple of a large power of two. So like one and 49 are close because
*  their difference is 48 and 48 is a multiple of 16, which is a pretty large power of two.
*  Whereas one and two are pretty far away because the difference between them is one, which is not
*  even a multiple of a power of two at all. It's odd. You want to know what's really far from one?
*  Like one and one sixty-fourth because their difference is a negative power of two,
*  two to the minus six. So those points are quite, quite far away. Two to the power of a large n
*  would be two, if that's the difference between two numbers, then they're close.
*  Yeah, so two to a large power is this metric, a very small number, and two to a negative power
*  is a very big number. That's too addic- okay, I can't even visualize that. It takes practice.
*  It takes practice. If you've ever heard of the Cantor set, it looks kind of like that.
*  So it is crazy that this is good for anything, right? I mean, this just sounds like a definition
*  that someone would make up to torment you. But what's amazing is there's a general theory
*  of distance where you say any definition you make that satisfies certain axioms deserves to be
*  called a distance. And this- See, I'm sorry to interrupt. My brain, you broke my brain.
*  Awesome. Ten seconds ago. Because I'm also starting to map for the two-added case to binary
*  numbers, because we romanticized those. So I was trying to- Oh, that's exactly the right way to
*  think of it. I was trying to mess with numbers. I was trying to see, okay, which ones are close?
*  And then I'm starting to visualize different binary numbers and which ones are close to each
*  other. And that's- Well, I think there's a- No, no, it's very similar. That's exactly the way
*  we want to think of it. It's almost like binary numbers written in reverse. Because in a binary
*  expansion, two numbers are close. A number that's small is like 0.0000 something. Something that's
*  the decimal and it starts with a lot of zeros. In the two-adic metric, a binary number is very small
*  if it ends with a lot of zeros and then the decimal point. Gotcha. So it is kind of like binary
*  numbers written backwards is actually- I should have- That's what I should have said, Lex.
*  That's a very good metaphor. Okay. But so why is that interesting except for the fact that
*  it's a beautiful kind of framework, different kind of framework of what you think about distances.
*  And you're talking about not just the two-adic, but the generalization of that. Yeah, the NEP.
*  Because that's the kind of deformation that comes up in Wiles' proof that deformation,
*  where moving something a little bit means a little bit in this two-adic sense. Trippy.
*  Okay. No, I mean, it's such a- I mean, I just get excited talking about it and I just taught this
*  in the fall semester that- But it's like reformulating. Why is-
*  So you pick a different measure of distance over which you can talk about very tiny changes
*  and then use that to then prove things about the entire thing.
*  Yes, although, you know, honestly, what I would say, I mean, it's true that we use it to prove
*  things, but I would say we use it to understand things. And then because we understand things
*  better, then we can prove things. But you know, the goal is always the understanding. The goal
*  is not so much to prove things. The goal is not to know what's true or false. I mean, this is
*  something I write about in the book Near the End. It's a wonderful, wonderful essay by Bill Thurston,
*  one of the great geometers of our time, who unfortunately passed away a few years ago,
*  called on proof and progress in mathematics. And he writes very wonderfully about how
*  it's not a theorem factory where we have a production quota. I mean, the point of mathematics
*  is to help humans understand things. And the way we test that is that we're proving new theorems
*  along the way. That's the benchmark, but that's not the goal.
*  Yeah, but just as a kind of absolutely, but as a tool, it's kind of interesting
*  to approach a problem by saying, how can I change the distance function? Like what the nature of
*  distance, because that might start to lead to insights for deeper understanding of things.
*  Start to lead to insights for deeper understanding. Like if I were to try to describe
*  human society by distance, two people are close if they love each other.
*  Right.
*  And then start to do a full analysis on everybody that lives on Earth currently,
*  the seven billion people. And from that perspective, as opposed to the geographic perspective of
*  distance. And then maybe there could be a bunch of insights about the source of violence, the source
*  of maybe entrepreneurial success or invention or economic success or different systems, communism,
*  capitalism start to, I mean, that's, I guess what economics tries to do, but really saying, okay,
*  let's think outside the box about totally new distance functions that could unlock something
*  profound about the space.
*  Yeah, because think about it. Okay. Here's, I mean, now we're going to talk about AI, which
*  you know a lot more about than I do. So just, you know, start laughing uproariously. If I say
*  something that's completely wrong, we both know very little relative to what we will know centuries
*  from now. That is, that is a really good humble way to think about it. I like it. Okay. So let's
*  just go for it. Okay. So I think you'll agree with this, that in some sense, what's good about AI is
*  that we can't test any case in advance. The whole point of AI is to make, or one point of it, I
*  guess, is to make good predictions about cases we haven't yet seen. And in some sense, that's always
*  going to involve some notion of distance because it's always going to involve somehow taking a
*  case we haven't seen and saying what cases that we have seen, is it close to, is it like, is it
*  somehow an interpolation between. Now, when we do that in order to talk about things being like
*  other things, implicitly or explicitly, we're invoking some notion of distance and boy, we
*  better get it right. Right? If you try to do natural language processing and your idea of
*  distance between words is how close they are in the dictionary. When you write them in alphabetical
*  order, you are going to get pretty bad translations, right? No, the notion of distance has to come from
*  somewhere else. Yeah. That's essentially what neural networks are doing. That's what word embeddings
*  are doing is coming up with. In the case of word embeddings, literally, like literally what they
*  are doing is learning a distance. But those are super complicated distance functions and
*  it's almost nice to think maybe there's a nice transformation that's simple. Sorry,
*  there's a nice formulation of the distance. Again, with the simple.
*  So you don't, let me ask you about this. From an understanding perspective, there's the Richard
*  Feynman, maybe attributed to him, but maybe many others.
*  Is this idea that if you can't explain something simply that you don't understand it,
*  in how many cases, how often is that true? Do you find there's some profound truth in that?
*  Oh, okay. So you were about to ask, is it true? To which I would say flatly no. But then you said,
*  you followed that up with, is there some profound truth in it? And I'm like, okay,
*  sure. So there's some truth in it. It's not true.
*  Says your mathematician answer. The truth that is in it is that learning to explain something helps
*  you understand it. But real things are not simple. A few things are, most are not. And I don't, to be
*  honest, I don't, I mean, I don't, we don't really know whether Feynman really said that right, or
*  something like that is sort of disputed. But I don't think Feynman could have literally believed
*  that, whether or not he said it. And, you know, he was the kind of guy, I didn't know him, but I'm
*  reading his writing. He liked to sort of say stuff like stuff that sounded good. You know what I mean?
*  So it's, it's totally strikes me as the kind of thing he could have said, because he liked the way
*  saying it made him feel, but also knowing that he didn't like literally mean it.
*  Well, I definitely have, have a lot of friends and I've talked to a lot of physicists and they
*  do derive joy from believing that they can explain stuff simply, or believing it's possible to
*  explain stuff simply, even when the explanation is not actually that simple. Like I've heard people
*  think that the explanation is simple and they do the explanation. And I think it is simple,
*  but it's not capturing the phenomena that we're discussing. It's capturing, it somehow maps in
*  their mind, but it's, it's taking as a starting point, as an assumption that there's a deep
*  knowledge and a deep understanding that's, that's actually very complicated. And the simplicity is
*  almost like a, almost like a poem about the more complicated thing, as opposed to a distillation.
*  And I love poems, but a poem is not an explanation.
*  Well, some people might disagree with that, but certainly from a mathematical perspective.
*  No poet would disagree with it.
*  No poet would disagree. You don't think there's some things that can only be described imprecisely?
*  I said explanation. I don't think any poem would, I don't think any poet would say their
*  poem is an explanation. They might say it's a description. They might say it's sort of capturing
*  sort of. Well, some people might say the only truth is like music, right? That the, the, the,
*  not the only truth, but some truth can only be expressed through art. And I mean, that's the
*  whole thing we're talking about religion and myth. And there's some things that are limited
*  cognitive capabilities and the tools of mathematics or the tools of physics are just not going to
*  allow us to capture. Like it's possible consciousness is one of those things.
*  Yes, that is definitely possible. But I would even say, look, and consciousness is a thing about
*  which we're still in the dark as to whether there's an explanation we would, we would understand it
*  as an explanation at all. By the way, okay, I got to give yet one more amazing Poincare quote
*  because this guy just never stopped coming up with great quotes that, you know, Paul Erdős,
*  another fellow who appears in the book. And by the way, he thinks about this notion of distance of
*  like personal affinity, kind of like what you're talking about, that kind of social network and
*  that notion of distance that comes from that. So that's something that Paul Erdős did. Well,
*  he thought about distances in networks. I guess he didn't probably, he didn't think about the
*  social network. That's fascinating. That's how it started that story of Erdős number. Yeah. Okay.
*  But you know, Erdős was sort of famous for saying, and this is sort of one line they were saying,
*  he talked about the book, capital T, capital B, the book. And that's the book where God keeps the
*  right proof of every theorem. So when he saw a proof he really liked, it was like really elegant,
*  really simple. Like that's from the book. That's like, you found one of the ones that's in the book.
*  He wasn't a religious guy, by the way. He referred to God as the supreme fascist. He was like,
*  but somehow he was like, I don't really believe in God, but I believe in God's book. I mean,
*  there was a, but Poincare on the other hand, and by the way, there were other, Hilda Hudson is one
*  who comes up in this book. She also kind of saw math. She's one of the people who sort of develops
*  the disease model that we now use, that we use to sort of track pandemics, this SIR model that
*  sort of originally comes from her work with Ronald Ross, but she was also super, super, super devout.
*  And she also sort of on the other side of the religious coin was like, yeah, math is how we
*  communicate with God. She has a great, all these people are incredibly quotable. She says,
*  you know, math is the truth, the things about mathematics. She's like, they're not the most
*  important of God thoughts, but they're the only ones that we can know precisely. So she's like,
*  this is the one place where we get to sort of see what God's thinking when we do mathematics.
*  Again, not a fan of poetry or music. Some people will say Hendrix is like,
*  some people will say chapter one of that book is mathematics and then chapter two is like classic
*  rock. Right? So like, it's not clear that the- I'm sorry, you just sent me off on a tangent,
*  just imagining like Erdős at a Hendrix concert, like trying to figure out if it was from
*  the book or not. What I was coming to do was just to say, but what Poincare said about this is he's
*  like, you know, if like, this has all worked out in the language of the divine and if a divine being
*  like came down and told it to us, we wouldn't be able to understand it. So it doesn't matter.
*  So Poincare was of the view that there were things that were sort of like inhumanly complex
*  and that was how they really were. Our job is to figure out the things that are not like that.
*  That are not like that. All this talk of primes got me hungry for primes. You were a blog post,
*  the beauty of bounded gaps, a huge discovery about prime numbers and what it means for the future of
*  math. Can you tell me about prime numbers? What the heck are those? What are twin primes? What are
*  prime gaps? What are bounded gaps in primes? What are all these things and what if anything
*  or what exactly is beautiful about them? Yeah, so you know, prime numbers are one of the things that
*  number theorists study the most and have for millennia. They are numbers which can't be
*  factored. And then you say like, like five and then you're like, wait, I can factor five, five is
*  five times one. Okay, not like that. That is a factorization. It absolutely is a way of expressing
*  five as a product of two things. But don't you agree there's like something trivial about it?
*  It's something you could do to any number. It doesn't have content the way that if I say that
*  12 is six times two or 35 is seven times five, I've really done something to it. I've broken up. So
*  those are the kind of factorizations that count. And number that doesn't have a factorization like
*  that is called prime, except historical side note one, which at some times in mathematical history
*  has been deemed to be a prime but currently is not. And I think that's for the best. But I bring
*  it up only because sometimes people think that, you know, these definitions are kind of, if we think
*  about them hard enough, we can figure out which definition is true. No, there's just an artifact
*  of mathematics. So which definition is best for us for our purposes? Well, those edge cases are
*  weird, right? So it can't be, it doesn't count when you use yourself as a number or one as part
*  of the factorization or as the entirety of the factorization. So you somehow get to the meat
*  of the number by factorizing it. And that seems to get to the core of all of mathematics. Yeah,
*  you take any number and you factorize it until you can factorize no more. And what you have left is
*  some big pile of primes. I mean, by definition, when you can't factor anymore, when you when you're
*  done, when you can't break the numbers up anymore, what's left must be prime, you know, 12 breaks into
*  two, and two and three. So these numbers are the atoms, the building blocks of all numbers.
*  And there's a lot we know about them. But there's much more that we don't know them. I'll tell you
*  the first few there's two, three, five, seven, 11. By the way, they're all going to be odd from
*  then on because if they were even, I could factorize two out of them. But it's not all the odd numbers,
*  nine isn't prime because it's three times three, 15 isn't prime because it's three times five,
*  but 13 is where we're at two, three, five, seven, 11, 13, 17, 19, not 21, but 23 is etc. etc. Okay,
*  so you could go on. How high could you go if we were just sitting here, by the way, your own brain,
*  if continuous without interruption, would you be able to go over 100?
*  I think so. There's always those ones that trip people up. There's a famous one, the Grotendieck
*  prime 57, like sort of Alexander Grotendieck, the great algebraic geometer was sort of giving
*  some lecture involving a choice of a prime in general. And somebody said, like,
*  can't you just choose a prime? He said, okay, 57, which is in fact not prime, it's three times
*  19. Oh, damn. But it was like, I promise you in some circles, that's a funny story. Okay.
*  What? But um, there's a humor in it. Yes, I would say over 100. I definitely don't remember like 107.
*  I think I'm not sure. Okay, like, so is there a category of like fake primes that that are
*  easily mistaken to be prime? Like 57? I wonder. Yeah, so I would say 57 and take a small piece,
*  57 and 51 are definitely like prime offenders. Oh, I didn't do that on purpose. Oh, well done.
*  Didn't do it on purpose. Anyway, they're definitely ones that people are or 91 is another
*  classic seven times 13. It really feels kind of prime, doesn't it? But it is not. Yeah.
*  So there's also, by the way, but there's also an actual notion of pseudo prime, which is a,
*  which is the thing with a formal definition, which is not a psychological thing. It is a prime,
*  which passes a primality test devised by Fermat, which is a very good test, which if,
*  if a number fails this test, it's definitely not prime. And so there was some hope that, oh,
*  maybe if a number passes the test, then it definitely is prime. That would give a very
*  simple criteria for primality. Unfortunately, it's only perfect in one direction. So there are
*  numbers. I want to say 341 is the smallest, uh, which passed the test, but are not prime 341.
*  Is this test easily explainable or no? Uh, yes, actually. Um, ready? Let me give you the
*  simplest version of it. You can dress it up a little bit, but here's the basic idea. Uh,
*  I take the number, the mystery number, I raised two to that power.
*  So let's say your mystery number is six. Are you sorry? You asked me, are you ready?
*  It's not, no, I'm breaking my brain again, but yes, let's, let's, let's do it. We're going to do a
*  live demonstration. Um, let's say your number is six. So I'm going to raise two to the sixth power.
*  Okay. So if I were working on it, I'd be like, that's two cubes squared. That's eight times eight.
*  So that's 64. Now we're going to divide by six, but I don't actually care what the quotient is,
*  only the remainder. So let's say 64 divided by six is, uh, well, it's it, there's a quotient of
*  10, but the remainder is four. So you failed because the answer has to be two for any prime.
*  Let's, let's do it with five, which is prime two to the fifth is 32 divide 32 by five. Uh,
*  and you get six with a remainder of two, the remainder of two, seven, two to the seventh is
*  128 divide that by seven. And let's see, I think that's seven times 14. Is that right? No,
*  seven times 18 is one 26 with a remainder of two, right? One 28 is a multiple of seven plus two.
*  So if that remainder is not two, then that's definitely not, that is definitely not prime.
*  And then if it is, it's likely a prime, but not for sure. It's likely a prime, but not for sure.
*  And there's actually a beautiful geometric proof, which is in the book. Actually,
*  that's like one of the most granular parts of the book, because it's such a beautiful proof.
*  I couldn't not give it. So you draw a lot of like opal and pearl necklaces and spin them. That's
*  kind of the geometric nature of the, of this proof of Fermat's little theorem. Um, so yeah,
*  so with pseudo primes, there are primes that are kind of faking it. They pass that test, but they're
*  or numbers that are faking it. They pass that test, but are not actually prime. Um, but the point is,
*  um, there are many, many, many theorems about prime numbers. Um, are there, like there's a bunch of
*  questions to ask, is there an infinite number of primes? Uh, can we say something about the gap
*  between primes as the numbers grow larger and larger and larger and so on? Yeah, it's a perfect
*  example of your desire for simplicity in all things. You know, it would be really simple
*  if there was only finally many primes. Yes. And then there'll be this
*  this finite set of atoms that all numbers would be built up. That's right. That would be very
*  simple and good in certain ways, but it's completely false. And number theory would be totally different
*  if that were the case. It's just not true. Um, in fact, this is something else that Euclid knew. So
*  this is a very, very old fact, like much before, long before we had anything like modern number
*  theory. That primes are infinite. The primes that there are, that right? There's an infinite
*  number of primes. So what about the gaps between the primes? Right. So, so one thing that people
*  recognized and really thought about a lot is that the primes on average seem to get farther and
*  farther apart as they get bigger and bigger. In other words, it's less and less common.
*  Like I already told you of the first 10 numbers, two, three, five, seven, four of them are prime.
*  That's a lot. 40%. If I looked at, you know, 10 digit numbers, no way would 40% of those be prime.
*  Being prime would be a lot rare in some sense, because there's a lot more things for them to be
*  divisible by. That's one way of thinking of it. It's, it's a lot more possible for there to be a
*  factorization because there's a lot of things you can try to factor out of it. As the numbers get
*  bigger and bigger, primality gets rarer and rarer. Um, and the extent to which that's the case,
*  that's pretty well understood. But then you can ask more fine grained questions. And here is one.
*  Um, a twin prime is a pair of primes that are two apart, like three and five, or like 11 and 13.
*  Or like 17 and 19. And one thing we still don't know is are there infinitely many of those?
*  We know on average they get farther and farther apart, but that doesn't mean there couldn't be
*  like occasional folks that come close together. And indeed, uh, we think that there are.
*  And one interesting question, I mean, this is, because I think you might say like, well, why,
*  how could one possibly have a right to have an opinion about something like that?
*  Like what, you know, we don't have any way of describing a process that makes
*  primes like, sure, you can like look at your computer and see a lot of them, but the fact
*  that there's a lot, why is that evidence that there's infinitely many, right? Maybe I can go
*  on the computer and find 10 million. Well, 10 million is pretty far from infinity, right? So
*  how is that, how is that evidence? There's a lot of things. There's like a lot more than 10 million
*  atoms. That doesn't mean there's infinitely many atoms in the universe, right? I mean,
*  on most people's physical theories, there's probably not, as I understand it. Okay. So
*  why would we think this? The answer is that we've, that it turns out to be like incredibly
*  productive and enlightening to think about primes as if they were random numbers, as if they were
*  randomly distributed according to a certain law. Now they're not, they're not random. There's no
*  chance involved. It's completely deterministic whether a number is prime or not. And yet it
*  just turns out to be phenomenally useful in mathematics to say, even if something is
*  governed by a deterministic law, let's just pretend it wasn't. Let's just pretend that they
*  were produced by some random process and see if the behavior is roughly the same. And if it's not,
*  maybe change the random process, maybe make the randomness a little bit different and tweak it
*  and see if you can find a random process that matches the behavior we see. And then maybe you
*  predict that other behaviors of the system are like that of the random process. And so that's
*  kind of like, it's funny because I think when you talk to people about the twin prime conjecture,
*  people think you're saying, wow, there's like some deep structure there that like makes those
*  primes be like close together again and again. And no, it's the opposite of deep structure.
*  What we say when we say we believe the twin prime conjecture is that we believe the primes are like
*  sort of strewn around pretty randomly. And if they were, then by chance you would expect there to be
*  infinitely many twin primes. And we're saying, yeah, we expect them to behave just like they would if
*  they were random dirt. You know, the fascinating parallel here is, you know, the question is,
*  I just got a chance to talk to Sam Harris and he uses the prime numbers as an example. Often,
*  I don't know if you're familiar with who Sam is. He uses that as an example of there being no free
*  will. Wait, where does he get this? Well, he just uses as an example of it might seem like this is
*  a random number generator, but it's all like formally defined. So if we keep getting more
*  and more primes, then like that might feel like a new discovery and that might feel like a new
*  experience, but it's not. It was always written in the cards. But it's funny that you say that
*  because a lot of people think of like randomness, the fundamental randomness within the nature of
*  reality might be the source of something that we experience as free will. And you're saying it's
*  like useful to look at prime numbers as a random process in order to prove stuff about them. But
*  fundamentally, of course, it's not a random process. Well, not in order to prove some stuff
*  about them so much as to figure out what we expect to be true and then try to prove that.
*  And here's what you don't want to do. Try really hard to prove something that's false. That makes
*  it really hard to prove the thing if it's false. So you certainly want to have some heuristic ways
*  of guessing, making good guesses about what's true. So yeah, here's what I would say. You're
*  going to be imaginary Sam Harris now. Yes. Like you're talking about prime numbers and you're like,
*  but prime numbers are completely deterministic. And I'm saying like, well, but let's treat them
*  like a random process. And then you say, but you're just saying something that's not true.
*  They're not a random process. They're deterministic. And I'm like, okay, great. You hold to your
*  insistence that it's not a random process. Meanwhile, I'm generating insight about the
*  primes that you're not because I'm willing to sort of pretend that there's something that they're
*  not in order to understand what's going on. Yeah. So it doesn't matter what the reality is. What
*  matters is what's what framework of thought results in the maximum number of insights.
*  Yeah. Cause I feel, look, I'm sorry, but I feel like you have more insights about people. If you
*  think of them as like beings that have wants and needs and desires and do stuff on purpose,
*  even if that's not true, you still understand better what's going on by treating them in that
*  way. Don't you find, look, when you work on machine learning, don't you find yourself sort
*  of talking about what the machine is, what the machine is trying to do in a certain instance?
*  Do you not find yourself drawn to that language? Well, it knows this, it's trying to do that.
*  It's learning that I'm certainly drawn to that language to the point where I receive quite a bit
*  of criticisms for it. Cause I, you know, like, Oh, I'm on your side, man. So especially in robotics,
*  I don't know why, but robotics people don't like to name their robots. They certainly don't like to
*  gender their robots because the moment you gender a robot, you start to anthropomorphize. If you say
*  he or she, you start to, you know, in your mind construct like a, um, like a life story in your
*  mind. You can't help it. There's like, you create like a humorous story to this person. You start to
*  this person, this robot, you start to project your own. But I think that's what we do to each other.
*  And I think that's actually really useful for the engineering process, especially for human robot
*  interaction. And yes, for machine learning systems, for helping you build an intuition about a
*  particular problem. It's almost like asking this question, you know, when a machine learning
*  system fails in a particular edge case, asking like, what were you thinking about? Like,
*  like asking like almost like when you're talking about to a child who just does something bad,
*  you're, you're, you want to understand like, what was, um, how did they see the world? Maybe
*  there's a totally new, maybe you're the one that's thinking about the world incorrectly. And, uh,
*  yeah, that, that anthropomorphization process I think is ultimately good for insight. And the same
*  as I, I agree with you. I tend to believe about free will as well. Let me ask you a ridiculous
*  question if it's okay. Of course I've just recently, most people go on like rabbit hole,
*  like YouTube things. And I went on a rabbit hole often do of Wikipedia. And I found a page on, um,
*  finiteism, ultra finiteism and intuitionism or into, um, I forget what it's called. Yeah.
*  Intuitionism intuitionism. That seemed pretty, pretty interesting. I have on my to-do list,
*  actually like look into like, is there people who like formally attract, like real mathematicians
*  are trying to argue for this, but the belief there, I think let's say finiteism that infinity is,
*  is fake. Meaning, um, infinity may be like a useful hack for certain, like a useful tool
*  in mathematics, but it really gets us into trouble because there's no infinity in the real world.
*  Maybe I'm sort of not expressing that, uh, fully correctly, but basically saying like there's things
*  there in, once you add into mathematics, things that are not provably within the physical world,
*  you're starting to inject, to, to, to corrupt your framework of reason. What do you think about that?
*  I mean, I think, okay, so first of all, I'm not an expert and I couldn't even tell you what the
*  differences between those three terms finiteism, ultra finiteism, intuitionism, all I know, they're
*  related. I tend to associate them with the Netherlands in the 1930s. Okay. I'll tell you,
*  can I just quickly comment because I read the Wikipedia page, the difference in ultra,
*  like the ultimate sentence of the modern age. Can I just comment because I read the Wikipedia
*  page that sums up our moment, bro. I'm basically an expert ultra ultra finiteism. So finiteism
*  says that the only infinity you're allowed to have is that the natural numbers and infinite.
*  So like those numbers are infinite. So like one, two, three, four, five, the integers are infinite.
*  The ultra finiteism says, Nope, even that infinity is fake.
*  That's I'll bet ultra finiteism came second. I'll bet it's like when there's like a hardcore
*  scene and then one guy's like, Oh, now there's a lot of people in this scene. I have to find
*  a way to be more hardcore than the hardcore people. Well back to the emo doc. Yeah. Okay.
*  So is there any, are you ever, cause I'm often uncomfortable with infinity, like psychologically.
*  I, you know, I have, I have trouble when that sneaks in there. It's cause it works so damn well.
*  I get a little suspicious because it could be almost like a crutch or an oversimplification
*  that's missing something profound about reality. Well, so first of all, okay. If you say like,
*  is there like a serious way of doing mathematics that doesn't really treat infinity as
*  a real thing or maybe it's kind of agnostic and it's like, I'm not really going to make a firm
*  statement about whether it's a real thing or not. Yeah. That's called most of the history of
*  mathematics, right? So it's only after Cantor, right? That we really are sort of, okay, we're
*  going to like have a notion of like the cardinality of an infinite set and like,
*  um, do something that you might call like the modern theory of infinity.
*  Um, that said, obviously everybody was drawn to this notion and no, not everybody was comfortable
*  with it. Look, I mean, this is what happens with Newton, right? I mean, so Newton understands that
*  to talk about tangents and to talk about instantaneous velocity, um, he has to do
*  something that we would now call taking a limit, right? The fabled dy over dx. If you sort of go
*  back to your calculus class, for those who've taken calculus and remember this mysterious thing.
*  And, you know, what is it? What is it? Well, he'd say like, well, it's like you sort of, um,
*  divide the length of this line segment by the length of this other line segment, and then you
*  make them a little shorter and you divide again, and then you make them a little shorter and you
*  divide again, and then you just keep on doing that until they're infinitely short and then you divide
*  them again. These quantities that are like, they're not zero, but they're also smaller than any
*  actual number, these infinitesimals. Well, people were queasy about it and they weren't wrong to be
*  queasy about it, right? From a modern perspective, it was not really well formed. There's this very
*  famous critique of Newton by Bishop Berkeley, where he says like, what these things you define,
*  like, you know, they're not zero, but they're smaller than any number. Are they the ghosts of
*  departed quantities? That was this like ultra-permanent of Newton. And on the one hand,
*  he was right. It wasn't really rigorous by modern standards. On the other hand, like Newton was out
*  there doing calculus and other people were not, right? It works. It works. So I think, I think a
*  sort of intuitionist view, for instance, I would say would express serious doubt. And by, it's not
*  by the way, it's not just infinity. It's like saying, I think we would express serious doubt
*  that like the real numbers exist. Now, most people are comfortable with the real numbers.
*  Well, computer scientists with floating point number, I mean,
*  floating point arithmetic. That's a great point, actually. I think, in some sense, this flavor of
*  doing math saying, we shouldn't talk about things that we cannot specify in a finite amount of time.
*  There's something very computational in flavor about that. And it's probably not a coincidence
*  that it becomes popular in the 30s and 40s, which is also like kind of like the dawn of ideas about
*  formal computation, right? You probably know the timeline better than I do. Sorry, what becomes
*  popular? These ideas that maybe we should be doing math in this more restrictive way where even
*  a thing that, you know, because look, the origin of all this is like, you know, number represents
*  a magnitude, like the length of a line. Like, so I mean, the idea that there's a continuum,
*  there's sort of like, there's like, is pretty old, but that, you know, just because something is old
*  doesn't mean we can't reject it if we want to. Well, a lot of the fundamental ideas in computer
*  science, when you talk about the complexity of problems, of tutoring himself, they rely on
*  infinity as well. The ideas that kind of challenge that, the whole space of machine learning, I would
*  say challenges that. It's almost like the engineering approach to things like the floating point
*  arithmetic. The other one that, back to John Conway, that challenges this idea, I mean,
*  maybe to tie in the ideas of deformation theory and limits to infinity, is this idea of cellular
*  automata. With John Conway looking at the game of life, Stephen Wolfram's work that I've been a big
*  fan of for a while, cellular automata. I was wondering if you have ever encountered these
*  kinds of objects, you ever looked at them as a mathematician, where you have very simple
*  rules of tiny little objects that when taken as a whole create incredible complexities,
*  but are very difficult to analyze, very difficult to make sense of, even though the one individual
*  object, one part, it's like what you're saying about Andrew Wiles, like you can look at the
*  deformation of a small piece to tell you about the whole. It feels like with cellular automata,
*  or any kind of complex systems, it's often very difficult to say something about the whole thing,
*  even when you can precisely describe the operation of the small, the local neighborhoods.
*  Yeah, I mean, I love that subject. I haven't really done research into it myself. I played
*  around with it. I'll send you a fun blog post I wrote where I made some cool
*  texture patterns from cellular automata that I, but.
*  And those are really always compelling, is like you create simple rules and they create some
*  beautiful textures. It doesn't make any sense. Actually, did you see there was a great paper?
*  I don't know if you saw this, like a machine learning paper. I don't know if you saw the one
*  I'm talking about where they were like learning the texture is like, let's try to like reverse
*  engineer and like learn a cellular automaton that can produce texture that looks like this
*  from the images. Very cool. And as you say, the thing you said is I feel the same way when I read
*  machine learning paper is that what's especially interesting is the cases where it doesn't work.
*  What does it do when it doesn't do the thing that you tried to train it to do? That's extremely
*  interesting. Yeah, yeah, that was a cool paper. So yeah, so let's start with the game of life.
*  Or let's start with John Conway. So Conway. So yeah, so let's start with John Conway again.
*  Just, I don't know, from my outsider's perspective, there's not many mathematicians
*  that stand out throughout the history of the 20th century. He's one of them. I feel like he's not
*  sufficiently recognized. I think he's pretty recognized. Okay, well, I mean,
*  he was a full professor at Princeton for most of his life. He was sort of in certainly the
*  pinnacle of. Yeah, but I found myself every time I talk about Conway and how excited I am about him,
*  I have to constantly explain to people who he is. And that's always a sad sign to me.
*  But that's probably true for a lot of mathematicians. I was about to say, I feel like you have a very
*  elevated idea of how famous, this is what happens when you grow up in the Soviet Union, you know,
*  you think the mathematicians are like very, very famous. Yeah, but I'm not actually so convinced
*  at a tiny tangent that that shouldn't be so. I mean, there's, it's not obvious to me that that's
*  one of the, like, if I were to analyze American society, that perhaps elevating mathematical
*  scientific thinking to a little bit higher level would benefit the society. Well, both in discovering
*  the beauty of what it is to be human, and for actually creating cool technology, better iPhones.
*  But anyway, John Conway. Yeah, Conway is such a perfect example of somebody whose humanity was,
*  and his personality was like wound up with his mathematics, right? So it's not sometimes I think
*  people who are outside the field think of mathematics as this kind of like, cold thing
*  that you do separate from your existence as a human being, no way your personality is in there,
*  just as it would be in like a novel you wrote, or a painting you painted, or just like the way you
*  walk down the street, like it's in there, it's you doing it. And Conway was certainly a singular
*  personality. I think anybody would say that he was playful, like everything was a game to him.
*  Now, what you may think I'm going to say, and it's true, is that he sort of was very playful in his
*  way of doing mathematics. But it's also true, it went both ways. He also sort of made mathematics
*  out of games. He like looked at, he was a constant inventor of games with like crazy names. And then
*  he was sort of analyzed those games mathematically, to the point that he, and then later collaborating
*  with Knuth, like, you know, created this number system, the serial numbers, in which actually
*  each number is a game. There's a wonderful book about this called, I mean, there are his own books,
*  and then there's like a book that he wrote with Berlecamp and Guy called Winning Ways, which is
*  such a rich source of ideas.
*  And he too kind of has his own crazy number system, in which, by the way, there are these
*  infinitesimals, the ghosts of departed quantities, they're in there, not as ghosts, but as like
*  certain kind of two player games. So, you know, he was a guy, so I knew him when I was a postdoc,
*  and I knew him at Princeton, and our research overlapped in some ways. Now it was on stuff that
*  he had worked on many years before, the stuff I was working on kind of connected with stuff in
*  group theory, which somehow seems to keep coming up. And so I often would like sort of ask him a
*  question, I would sort of come upon him in the common room, and I would ask him a question about
*  something. And just anytime you turned him on, you know what I mean, you sort of asked a question,
*  it was just like turning a knob and winding him up, and he would just go and you would get
*  a response that was like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like,
*  he would just go and you would get a response that was like, so rich and went so many places
*  and taught you so much. And usually had nothing to do with your question. Yeah, usually your
*  question was just a prompt to him, you couldn't count on actually getting the question. That's
*  brilliant curious minds at that age. Yeah, it was definitely a huge loss. But on his game of life,
*  which was I think he developed in the 70s, as almost like a side thing, a fun little experiment.
*  Game of life is this. It's a very simple algorithm. It's not really a game per se,
*  in the sense of the kinds of games that he liked, whereas people played against each other. And
*  but essentially, it's a game that you play with marking little squares on the sheet of graph
*  paper. And in the 70s, I think he was like, literally doing it with like a pen on graph
*  paper, you have some configuration of squares, some of the squares in the graphic are filled in
*  some are not. And then there's a rule, a single rule that tells you at the next stage, which
*  squares are filled in, and which squares are not sometimes an empty square gets filled in,
*  that's called birth, sometimes a square that's filled in gets erased, that's called death.
*  And there's rules for which squares are born, which squares die. It's the rules very simple,
*  you can write it on one line. And then the great miracle is that you can start from some very
*  innocent looking little small set of boxes and get these results of incredible richness. And of
*  course, nowadays, you don't do it on paper. Nowadays, you do it on a computer. There's
*  actually a great iPad app called Golly, which I really like that has like Conway's original rule
*  and like, gosh, like hundreds of other variants. And it's lightning fast. So you can just be like,
*  I want to see 10,000 generations of this rule play out like faster than your eye can even follow.
*  And it's like amazing. So I highly recommend it if this is at all intriguing to you getting Golly on
*  your iOS device. And you can do this kind of process, which I really enjoy doing, which is
*  almost from like putting a Darwin hat on or a biologist hat on and doing analysis of a higher
*  level of abstraction, like the organisms that spring up, because there's different kinds of
*  organisms, like you can think of them as species and they interact with each other. They can,
*  there's gliders, they shoot different, there's like things that can travel around, there's things that
*  can glider guns that can generate those gliders. You can use the same kind of language as you would
*  about describing a biological system. So it's a wonderful laboratory, and it's kind of a rebuke
*  to someone who doesn't think that like very, very rich complex structure can come from very simple
*  underlying laws. Like, it definitely can. Now, here's what's interesting. If you just pick like
*  some random rule, you wouldn't get interesting complexity. I think that's one of the most
*  interesting things of these, one of the most interesting features of this whole subject,
*  that the rules have to be tuned just right, like a sort of typical rule set doesn't generate any
*  kind of interesting behavior. But some do. I don't think we have a clear way of understanding
*  which do and which don't. I don't know, maybe Stephen thinks he does, I don't know. No, it's a
*  giant mystery. What Stephen Wolfram did is, now there's a whole interesting aspect to the fact
*  that he's a little bit of an outcast in the mathematics and physics community, because he's
*  so focused on a particular, his particular work. I think if you put ego aside, which I think
*  unfairly some people are not able to look beyond, I think his work is actually quite brilliant.
*  But what he did is exactly this process of Darwin-like exploration, he's taking these very
*  simple ideas and writing a thousand page book on them, meaning like, let's play around with this
*  thing, let's see. And can we figure anything out? Spoiler alert, no, we can't. In fact, he does a
*  challenge, I think it's like rule 30 challenge, which is quite interesting, just simply for
*  machine learning people, for mathematics people, is can you predict the middle column? For his,
*  it's a 1D cellular automata. Can you, generally speaking, can you predict anything about how a
*  particular rule will evolve, just in the future? Very simple, just looking at one particular part
*  of the world, just zooming in on that part, you know, 100 steps ahead, can you predict something?
*  And the challenge is to do that kind of prediction, so far as nobody's come up with an answer,
*  but the point is like, we can't, we don't have tools, or maybe it's impossible, or, I mean,
*  he has these kind of laws of irreducibility they hear first, but it's poetry, it's like,
*  we can't prove these things, it seems like we can't, that's the basic, it almost sounds like
*  ancient mathematics or something like that, where you're like, the gods will not allow us
*  to predict the cellular automata, but that's fascinating that we can't. I'm not sure what
*  to make of it, and there's power to calling this particular set of rules game of life as Conway did,
*  because, not exactly sure, but I think he had a sense that there's some core ideas here that
*  are fundamental to life, to complex systems, to the way life emerged on Earth.
*  I'm not sure I think Conway thought that, it's something that, I mean, Conway always had a rather
*  ambivalent relationship with the game of life, because I think he saw it as, it was certainly
*  the thing he was most famous for in the outside world, and I think that his view, which is correct,
*  is that he had done things that were much deeper mathematically than that, and I think it always
*  grieved him a bit that he was the game of life guy, when he proved all these wonderful theorems,
*  created all these wonderful games, created the serial numbers, he was a very tireless guy who
*  did an incredibly variegated array of stuff, so he was exactly the kind of person who
*  you would never want to reduce to one achievement, you know what I mean?
*  Let me ask you about group theory. You mentioned it a few times. What is group theory?
*  What is an idea from group theory that you find beautiful?
*  Well, so I would say group theory sort of starts as the general theory of symmetry, is that
*  people looked at different kinds of things and said, as we said, oh, it could have,
*  maybe all there is is the symmetry from left to right, like a human being, right? That's roughly
*  bilaterally symmetric, as we say. So there's two symmetries, and then you're like, well, wait,
*  didn't I say there's just one, there's just left to right? Well, we always count the symmetry of
*  doing nothing. We always count the symmetry that's like, there's flip and don't flip. Those are the
*  two configurations that you can be in. So there's two. You know, something like a rectangle
*  is bilaterally symmetric, you can flip it left to right, but you can also flip it top to bottom.
*  So there's actually four symmetries. There's do nothing, flip it left to right, and flip it top
*  to bottom, or do both of those things. A square, there's even more because now you can rotate it.
*  You can rotate it by 90 degrees. So you can't do that. That's not a symmetry of the rectangle. If
*  you try to rotate it 90 degrees, you get a rectangle oriented in a different way.
*  So a person has two symmetries, a rectangle for a square eight, different kinds of shapes have
*  different numbers of symmetries. And the real observation is that that's just not like a set
*  of things. They can be combined, you do one symmetry, then you do another. The result of
*  that is some third symmetry. So a group really abstracts away this notion of saying
*  it's just some collection of transformations you can do to a thing where you combine any two of
*  them to get a third. So you know, a place where this comes up in computer science is in sorting,
*  because the ways of permuting a set, the ways of taking sort of some set of things you have on the
*  table and putting them in a different order, shuffling a deck of cards, for instance, those
*  are the symmetries of the deck. And there's a lot of them. There's not two, there's not four,
*  there's not eight. Think about how many different orders the deck of card can be in. Each one of
*  those is the result of applying a symmetry to the original deck. So a shuffle is a symmetry,
*  right? You're reordering the cards. If I shuffle and then you shuffle, the result is some other
*  kind of thing you might call a double shuffle, which is a more complicated symmetry. So group
*  theory is kind of the study of the general abstract world that encompasses all these kinds
*  of things. But then of course, like lots of things that are way more complicated than that,
*  like infinite groups of symmetries, for instance. So they can be infinite, huh? Oh, yeah. Okay. Well,
*  okay, ready? Think about the symmetries of the line. You're like, okay, I can reflect it left to
*  right, you know, around the origin. Okay, but I could also reflect it left to right grabbing
*  somewhere else, like at one or two or pi or anywhere. Or I could just slide it some distance.
*  That's a symmetry. Slide it five units over. So there's clearly infinitely many symmetries
*  of the line. That's an example of an infinite group of symmetries. Is it possible to say
*  something that kind of captivates, keeps being brought up by physicists, which is gauge theory,
*  gauge symmetry, as one of the more complicated type of symmetries? Is there an easy explanation
*  of what the heck it is? Is that something that comes up on your mind at all? Well, I'm not a
*  mathematical physicist, but I can say this. It is certainly true that it has been a very useful
*  notion in physics to try to say, like, what are the symmetry groups, like, of the world? Like,
*  what are the symmetries under which things don't change? Right? So we just, I think we talked a
*  little bit earlier about it should be a basic principle that a theorem that's true here is also
*  true over there. And same for a physical law, right? I mean, if gravity is like this over here,
*  it should also be like this over there. Okay. What that's saying is we think translation in space
*  should be a symmetry. All the laws of physics should be unchanged if the symmetry we have in
*  mind is a very simple one, like translation. And so then there becomes a question, like,
*  what are the symmetries of the actual world with its physical laws? And one way of thinking,
*  this is an oversimplification, but like one way of thinking of this big shift from before Einstein
*  to after is that we just changed our idea about what the fundamental group of symmetries were.
*  So that things like the Lorenz contraction, things like these bizarre relativistic phenomenon,
*  or Lorenz would have said, oh, to make this work, we need a thing to change its shape
*  if it's moving nearly the speed of light. Well, under the new frame of framework,
*  it's much better to say, oh, no, it wasn't changing its shape. You were just wrong about
*  what counted as a symmetry. Now that we have this new group, the so-called Lorenz group,
*  now that we understand what the symmetries really are, we see it was just an illusion
*  that the thing was changing its shape. Yeah. So you can then describe the sameness of things
*  under this weirdness that is general relativity, for example. Yeah. Yeah. Still, I wish there was a
*  simpler explanation of like exact, I mean, gauge symmetry is a pretty simple general concept
*  about rulers being deformed. It's just that I've actually just personally been on a search,
*  not a very rigorous or aggressive search, but for something I personally enjoy, which is taking
*  complicated concepts and finding the sort of minimal example that I can play around with,
*  especially programmatically. That's great. I mean, this is what we try to train our students to do,
*  right? I mean, in class, this is exactly what this is like best pedagogical practice.
*  I do hope there's simple explanation, especially like I've in my sort of drunk random walk,
*  drunk walk, whatever that's called, sometimes stumble into the world of topology.
*  And like quickly, like, you know, when you like go into a party and you realize this is not the
*  right party for me. So whenever I go into topology, it's like so much math everywhere.
*  I don't even know what it feels like. This is me like being a hater is I think there's way too
*  much math. Like there are two, the cool kids who just want to have like everything is expressed
*  through math because they're actually afraid to express stuff simply through language. That's,
*  that's my hater formulation of topology. But at the same time, I'm sure that's very necessary to
*  do sort of rigorous discussion. But I feel like, but don't you think that's what gauge
*  symmetry is like? I mean, it's not a field I know well, but it certainly seems like,
*  yes, it is like that. But my problem with topology, okay. And even like differential
*  geometry is like, you're talking about beautiful things. Like if they could be visualized,
*  it's open question if everything could be visualized, but you're talking about things
*  that can be visually stunning, I think, but they are hidden underneath all of that math.
*  Like if you look at the papers that are written in topology, if you look at all the discussions
*  on stack exchange, they're all math dense, math heavy. And the only kind of visual things that
*  emerge every once in a while is like something like a Mobius strip. Every once in a while, some kind of
*  simpler visualizations. Well, there's the the vibration, there's the hop vibration,
*  or all those kinds of things that somebody, some grad student from like 20 years ago,
*  wrote a program in Fortran to visualize it. And that's it. And it's just, you know, it makes me
*  sad because those are visual disciplines, just like computer vision is a visual discipline. So
*  you can provide a lot of visual examples. I wish topology was more excited and in love with
*  visualizing some of the ideas. I mean, you could say that, but I would say for me,
*  a picture of the hop vibration does nothing for me. Whereas like when you're like, oh, it's like
*  about the quaternions, it's like a subgroup of the quaternions. And I'm like, oh, so now I see
*  what's going on. Like, why didn't you just say that? Why are you like showing me this stupid picture
*  instead of telling me what you were talking about? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm just saying, no, but it goes
*  back to what you were saying about teaching that like people are different and what they'll respond
*  to. So I think there's no I mean, I'm very opposed to the idea that there's one right way to explain
*  things. I think there's like a huge variation in like, you know, our brains like have all these
*  like weird like hooks and loops. And it's like very hard to know like what's going to latch on. And
*  it's not going to be the same thing for everybody. So what that I think monoculture is bad, right? I
*  think that's and I think we're agreeing on that point that like, it's good that there's like a
*  lot of different ways in and a lot of different ways to describe these ideas, because different
*  people are going to find different things illuminating. But that said, I think there's a
*  lot to be discovered when you force little like silos of brilliant people to kind of
*  find the middle ground or like, aggregate or come together in a way. So there's like,
*  people that do love visual things. I mean, there's a lot of disciplines, especially in
*  computer science that they're obsessed with visualizing visualizing data, visualizing neural
*  networks. I mean, neural networks themselves are fundamentally visual, there's a lot of work in
*  computer vision that's very visual. And then coming together with some folks that were like
*  deeply rigorous, and are like totally lost in multi dimensional space where it's hard to even
*  bring them back down to 3d. They're very comfortable in this multi dimensional space. So forcing them
*  to kind of work together to communicate, because it's not just about public communication of ideas.
*  It's also I feel like when you're forced to do that public communication, like you did with your
*  book, I think deep profound ideas can be discovered that's like applicable for research and for science.
*  Like, there's something about that simplification, not simplification, but distillation or
*  condensation or whatever the hell you call it compression of ideas that somehow actually
*  stimulates creativity. And I'd be excited to see more of that in the mathematics community. Can you?
*  Let me make a crazy metaphor. Maybe it's a little bit like the relation between prose and poetry,
*  right? I mean, if you might say like, why do we need anything more than prose, you're trying to
*  convey some information. So you just like say it. Well, poetry does something, right? It's sort of,
*  you might think of it as a kind of compression. Of course, not all poetry is compressed, like not
*  awesome. Some of it is quite baggy. But like, you are kind of often it's compressed, right? A lyric
*  poem is often sort of like a compression of what would take a long time and be complicated to
*  explain in prose into sort of a different mode that is going to hit in a different way.
*  We talked about Poincare conjecture. There's a guy, he's Russian, Grigori,
*  Perlman. He proved Poincare conjecture. If you can comment on the proof itself,
*  if that stands out to you as something interesting, or the human story of it, which is he turned down
*  the Fields Medal for the proof. Is there something you find inspiring or insightful about the proof
*  itself or about the man? Yeah, I mean, one thing I really like about the proof, and partly that's
*  because it's sort of a thing that happens again and again in this book. I mean, I'm writing about
*  geometry and the way it sort of appears in all these kind of real world problems. But it happens
*  so often that the geometry you think you're studying is somehow not enough. You have to go
*  one level higher in abstraction and study a higher level of geometry. And the way that plays out
*  is that, you know, Poincare asks a question about a certain kind of three-dimensional object.
*  Is it the usual three-dimensional space that we know, or is it some kind of exotic thing? And so,
*  of course, this sounds like it's a question about the geometry of the three-dimensional space.
*  But no, Perlman understands. And by the way, in a tradition that involves Richard Hamilton and many
*  other people, like most really important mathematical advances, this doesn't happen alone.
*  It doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens as the culmination of a program that involves many people.
*  Same with Wiles, by the way. I mean, we talked about Wiles, and I want to emphasize that
*  starting all the way back with Kummer, who I mentioned in the 19th century, but Gerhard
*  Frey and Mazer and Ken Ribbett and like many other people are involved in building the other pieces
*  of the arch before you put the keystone in. We stand on the shoulders of giants.
*  Yes. So, what is this idea? The idea is that, well, of course, the geometry of the three-dimensional
*  object itself is relevant, but the real geometry you have to understand is the geometry of the
*  space of all three-dimensional geometries. Whoa. You're going up a higher level. Because when you
*  do that, you can say, now, let's trace out a path in that space. There's a mechanism called
*  Ricci flow. And again, we're outside my research area. So, for all the geometric analysts and
*  differential geometers out there listening to this, please, I'm doing my best and I'm roughly saying
*  so, the Ricci flow allows you to say, okay, let's start from some mystery three-dimensional space,
*  which Poincare would conjecture is essentially the same thing as our familiar three-dimensional
*  space, but we don't know that. And now, you let it flow. You sort of let it move in its natural
*  path according to some almost physical process and ask where it winds up. And what you find is
*  that it always winds up. You've continuously deformed it. There's that word deformation again.
*  And what you can prove is that the process doesn't stop until you get to the usual
*  three-dimensional space. And since you can get from the mystery thing to the standard space
*  by this process of continually changing and never kind of having any sharp transitions,
*  then the original shape must have been the same as the standard shape. That's the nature of the
*  proof. Now, of course, it's incredibly technical. I think, as I understand it, I think the hard part
*  is proving that the favorite word of AI people, you don't get any singularities along the way.
*  But of course, in this context, singularity just means acquiring a sharp kink. It just means
*  becoming non-smooth at some point. So, just saying something interesting about
*  formal, about the smooth trajectory through this weird space. Yeah, but yeah, so what I like about
*  it is that it's just one of many examples of where it's not about the geometry you think it's about.
*  It's about the geometry of all geometries, so to speak. And it's only by kind of being
*  jerked out of flatland, right? Same idea. It's only by sort of seeing the whole thing globally
*  at once that you can really make progress on understanding the one thing you thought you were
*  looking at. It's a romantic question, but what do you think about him turning down the Fields Medal?
*  Is that just our Nobel prizes and Fields Medals, just the cherry on top of the cake and really
*  math itself, the process of curiosity, of pulling at the string of the mystery before us,
*  that's the cake, and then the awards are just icing and clearly I've been fasting and I'm hungry.
*  But do you think it's tragic or just a little curiosity that he turned on the medal?
*  Well, it's interesting because on the one hand, I think it's absolutely true that right in some
*  kind of like vast spiritual sense, like awards are not important, like not important the way that
*  sort of like understanding the universe is important. On the other hand, most people who
*  are offered that prize accept it. So there's something unusual about his choice there.
*  I wouldn't say I see it as tragic. I mean, maybe if I don't really feel like I have a clear picture
*  of why he chose not to take it. I mean, he's not alone in doing things like this. People
*  sometimes turn down prizes for ideological reasons, but probably more often in mathematics. I mean,
*  I think I'm right in saying that Peter Schultze turned down sort of some big monetary
*  prize because he just, you know, I mean, I think at some point you have plenty of money
*  and maybe you think it sends the wrong message about what the point of doing mathematics is.
*  I do find that there's most people accept, you know, most people have given a prize. Most people
*  take it. I mean, people like to be appreciated. Like I said, we're people, not that different
*  from most other people. But the important reminder that that turning down the prize serves for me
*  is not that there's anything wrong with the prize and there's something wonderful about the prize.
*  I think the Nobel prize is trickier because so many Nobel prizes are given.
*  First of all, the Nobel prize often forgets many, many of the important people throughout history.
*  Second of all, there's like these weird rules to it. That's only three people and some projects
*  have a huge number of people. And it's like this, it, I don't know, it doesn't kind of
*  highlight the way science is done on some of these projects in the best possible way.
*  But in general, the prizes are great. But what this kind of teaches me and reminds me is sometimes
*  in your life, there'll be moments when the thing that you, you would really like to do,
*  society would really like you to do is the thing that goes against something you believe in,
*  whatever that is, some kind of principle and stand your ground in the face of that.
*  It's something I believe most people will have a few moments like that in their life,
*  maybe one moment like that, and you have to do it. That's what integrity is.
*  So like, it doesn't have to make sense to the rest of the world, but to stand on that, like
*  to say no, it's interesting because I think- But do you note that he turned down the prize
*  in service of some principle? Because I don't know that.
*  Well, yes, that seems to be the inkling, but he has never made it super clear. But the
*  inkling is that he had some problems with the whole process of mathematics that includes awards,
*  like this hierarchies and the reputations and all those kinds of things and individualism that's
*  fundamental to American culture. He probably, because he visited the United States quite a bit,
*  that he probably, you know, it's like all about experiences. And he may have had, you know,
*  some parts of academia, some pockets of academia can be less than inspiring perhaps sometimes,
*  because of the individual egos involved, not academia, people in general, smart people with
*  egos. And if they, if you interact with a certain kinds of people, you can become cynical too easily.
*  I'm one of those people that I've been really fortunate to interact with incredible people
*  at MIT and academia in general, but I've met some assholes. And I tend to just kind of, when I run
*  into difficult folks, I just kind of smile and send them all my love and just kind of go around.
*  But for others, those experiences can be sticky. Like they can become cynical about the world
*  when folks like that exist. So it's, he may have, he may have become a little bit cynical about the
*  process of science. Well, you know, it's a good opportunity. Let's posit that that's his reasoning,
*  because I truly don't know. It's an interesting opportunity to go back to almost the very first
*  thing we talked about the idea of the mathematical Olympiad, because of course, that is
*  this is the International Mathematical Olympiad is like a competition for high school students
*  solving math problems. And in some sense, it's absolutely false to the reality of mathematics,
*  because just as you say, it is a contest where you win prizes. The aim is to sort of be faster
*  than other people. And you're working on sort of canned problems that someone already knows
*  the answer to, like not problems that are unknown. So, you know, in my own life, I think when I was
*  in high school, I was like very motivated by those competitions. And like I went to the Math Olympiad
*  and you won it twice and got me Well, there's something I have to explain to people because
*  it says I think it says on Wikipedia that I won a gold medal in the real Olympics. They only give
*  one gold medal in each event. I just have to emphasize that the International Math Olympiad
*  is not like that the gold medal gold medals are awarded to the top one 12th of all participants.
*  So sorry to bust the legend or anything. Well, you're an exceptional performer in terms of
*  achieving high scores on the problems and they're very difficult. So you've achieved a high level
*  performance on the in this very specialized skill. And by the way, it was very it was a very Cold
*  War activity. You know, the one in 1987, the first year I went, it was in Havana. Americans couldn't
*  go to Havana back then it was a very complicated process to get there. And they took the whole
*  American team on a field trip to the Museum of American Imperialism
*  in Havana so we could see what America was all about. How would you recommend a person
*  learn math? So somebody who's young, or somebody my age or somebody older, who've taken a bunch
*  of math, but wants to rediscover the beauty of math, and maybe integrated into their work more
*  so than the research space. So and and so on. Is there something you could say about the process of
*  incorporating mathematical thinking into your life?
*  I mean, the thing is, it's in part a journey of self knowledge, you have to know what's going to
*  work for you. And that's going to be different for different people. So there are totally people who
*  at any stage of life, just start reading math textbooks, that is a thing that you can do. And
*  it works for some people and not for others. For others, a gateway is, you know, I always recommend
*  like the books of Martin Gardner, another sort of person we haven't talked about, but who also
*  like Conway embodies that spirit of play. He wrote a column in Scientific American for decades called
*  mathematical recreations, and there's such joy in it and such fun. And these books, the columns are
*  collected into books, and the books are old now, but for each generation of people who discover
*  them, they're completely fresh. And they give a totally different way into the subject than
*  reading a formal textbook, which for some people would be the right thing to do. And you know,
*  working contest style problems to those are bound to books, like especially like Russian and
*  Bulgarian problems, right? There's book after book problems from those contexts, that's going to
*  motivate some people. For some people, it's going to be like watching well produced videos, like a
*  totally different format. Like, I feel like I'm not answering your question, I'm sort of saying
*  there's no one answer. And like, it's a journey where you figure out what resonates with you.
*  For some people, it's the self discovery is trying to figure out why is it that I want to know.
*  Okay, I'll tell you a story. Once when I was in grad school, I was very frustrated with my like
*  lack of knowledge of a lot of things, as we all are, because no matter how much we know,
*  we don't know much more. And going to grad school means just coming face to face with like the
*  incredible overflowing fault of your ignorance, right? So I told Joe Harris, who was an algebraic
*  Geometer professor in my department, I was like, I really feel like I don't know enough. And I
*  should just like take a year of leave and just like read EGA, the holy textbook elements of
*  algebraic geometry. This like, I'm just gonna I feel like I don't know enough. So I just gonna
*  sit and like read this like 1500 page many volume book. And he was like, and the professor here,
*  I was like, that's a really stupid idea. And I was like, why is that a stupid idea? Then I would
*  know more algebraic geometry, because you're not actually going to do it like you learn.
*  I mean, he knew me well enough to say like, you're gonna learn because you're gonna be working on a
*  problem. And then there's gonna be a fact from EGA you need in order to solve your problem that you
*  want to solve. And that's how you're going to learn it. You're not going to learn it without
*  a problem to bring you into it. And so for a lot of people, I think if you're like, I'm trying to
*  understand machine learning, and I'm like, I can see that there's sort of some mathematical
*  technology that I don't have. I think you like let that problem that you actually care about
*  drive your learning. I mean, one thing I've learned from advising students, you know,
*  math is really hard. In fact, anything that you do right, is hard. And because it's hard, like,
*  you might sort of have some idea that somebody else gives you, oh, I should learn x, y, and z.
*  Well, if you don't actually care, you're not going to do it. You might feel like you should,
*  maybe somebody told you you should. But I think you have to hook it to something that you actually
*  care about. So for a lot of people, that's the way in. You have an engineering problem you're
*  trying to handle. You have a physics problem you're trying to handle. You have a machine
*  learning problem you're trying to handle. Let that not a kind of abstract idea of what the
*  curriculum is, drive your mathematical learning. And also just as a brief comment, that math is
*  hard. There's a sense to which hard is a feature, not a bug, in the sense that, again, this maybe
*  this is my own learning preference. But I think it's a value to fall in love with the process of
*  doing something hard, overcoming it, and becoming a better person because of it. Like, I hate running.
*  I hate exercise to bring it down to like the simplest hard. And I enjoy the part once it's
*  done. The person I feel like for the rest of the day once I've accomplished it. The actual process,
*  especially the process of getting started in the initial, like I really, I don't feel like doing it.
*  And I really have, the way I feel about running is the way I feel about really anything difficult in
*  the intellectual space, especially mathematics, but also just something that requires like holding a
*  bunch of concepts in your mind with some uncertainty, like where the terminology or the
*  notation is not very clear. And so you have to kind of hold all those things together and like
*  keep pushing forward through the frustration of really like obviously not understanding certain
*  like parts of the picture, like your giant missing parts of the picture and still not giving up.
*  It's the same way I feel about running. And there's something about falling in love with
*  the feeling of after you went through the journey of not having a complete picture at the end,
*  having a complete picture, and then you get to appreciate the beauty and just remembering that
*  it sucked for a long time and how great it felt when you figured it out, at least at the basic.
*  That's not sort of research thinking because with research you probably also have to enjoy
*  the dead ends. With learning math from a textbook or from a video, there's a nice-
*  I think you have to enjoy the dead ends, but I think you have to accept the dead ends. Let me
*  say, let's put it that way. Well, yeah, enjoy the suffering of it. So
*  the way I think about it, I do, there's an- I don't enjoy the suffering. It pisses me off.
*  I accept that it's part of the process. It's interesting. There's a lot of ways to kind of
*  deal with that dead end. There's a guy who's an ultra marathon runner, Navy SEAL, David Goggins,
*  who kind of- I mean, there's a certain philosophy of like, most people would quit here.
*  And so if most people would quit here, and I don't, I'll have an opportunity to discover
*  something beautiful that others haven't yet. So like, any feeling that really sucks, it's like,
*  okay, most people would just like go do something smarter. And if I stick with this,
*  I will discover a new garden of fruit trees that I can pick.
*  Okay, you say that, but like, what about the guy who like wins the Nathan's hot dog eating
*  contest every year? Like when he eats his 35th hot dog, he like correctly says like,
*  okay, most people would stop here. Like, are you like lauding that he's like, no,
*  I'm going to eat the 36th hot dog? I am. I am. I am. In the long archivist tree,
*  that man is onto something, which brings up this question. What advice would you give to young
*  people today thinking about their career, about their life, whether it's in mathematics,
*  poetry, or hot dog eating contest? And you know, I have kids, so this is actually a live issue for
*  me, right? I actually, it's not a thought experiment. I actually do have to give advice to young people
*  all the time. They don't listen, but I still give it. You know, one thing I often say to students,
*  I don't think I've actually said this to my kids yet, but I say it to students a lot is,
*  you know, you come to these decision points and everybody is beset by self-doubt, right? It's like,
*  not sure like what they're capable of, like not sure what they're, what they really want to do.
*  I always, I sort of tell people like often when you have a decision to make,
*  one of the choices is the high self-esteem choice. And I always say, make the high self-esteem choice,
*  make the choice, sort of take yourself out of it and like, if you didn't have those,
*  you can probably figure out what the version of you that feels completely confident would do
*  and do that and see what happens. And I think that's often like pretty good advice.
*  That's interesting. Sort of like, you know, like with Sims, you can create characters.
*  I could create a character of yourself that lacks all of the self-doubt.
*  Right, but it doesn't mean, I would never say to somebody, you should just go have
*  high self-esteem. You shouldn't have doubts. No, you probably should have doubts. It's okay to
*  have them, but sometimes it's good to act in the way that the person who didn't have them would act.
*  That's a really nice way to put it. Yeah, that's a, that's a like from a third person perspective,
*  take the part of your brain that wants to do big things. What would they do?
*  That's not afraid to do those things. What would they do? Yeah, that's,
*  that's really nice. That's actually a really nice way to formulate it.
*  It's very practical advice. You should give it to your kids.
*  Do you think there's meaning to any of it from a mathematical perspective?
*  This life, if I were to ask you, we talked about primes, talk about proving stuff.
*  Can we say, and then the book that God has that mathematics allows us to arrive at something about
*  in that book, there's certainly a chapter on the meaning of life in that book.
*  Do you think we humans can get to it? And maybe if you were to write Cliffs Notes,
*  what do you suspect those Cliffs Notes would say? I mean, look, the way I feel is that, you know,
*  mathematics, as we've discussed, like it underlies the way we think about constructing learning
*  machines and underlies physics. It can be, I mean, it does all this stuff. And also you want the
*  meaning of life? I mean, it's like, we already did a lot for you. Like ask a rabbi.
*  No, I mean, I, you know, I wrote a lot in the last book, How Not To Be Wrong.
*  Yeah. I wrote a lot about Pascal, a fascinating guy who is a sort of very serious religious mystic,
*  as well as being an amazing mathematician. And he's well known for Pascal's Wager. I mean,
*  he's probably among all mathematicians, he's the ones who's best known for this. Can you actually
*  apply mathematics to kind of these transcendent questions? But what's interesting, when I really
*  read Pascal about what he wrote about this, you know, I started to see that people often think,
*  oh, this is him saying, I'm going to use mathematics to sort of show you why you should believe in God,
*  you know, to really, that's, mathematics has the answer to this question. But he really doesn't
*  say that. He almost kind of says the opposite. If you ask Blaise Pascal, like, why do you believe
*  in God? He'd be like, oh, because I met God. You know, he had this kind of like psychedelic
*  experience, like a mystical experience, where, as he tells it, he just like directly encountered God.
*  It's like, okay, I guess there's a God, I met him last night. So that's it. That's why he believed.
*  It didn't have to do with any kind of, you know, the mathematical argument was like,
*  about certain reasons for behaving in a certain way. But he basically said, like,
*  math doesn't tell you that God's there or not. Like, if God's there, he'll tell you, you know.
*  I love this. So you have mathematics, you have, what do you have, like, waste, explore the mind,
*  let's say psychedelics, you have like incredible technology, you also have love and friendship,
*  and like, what the hell do you want to know what the meaning of it all is? Just enjoy it.
*  I don't think there's a better way to end it. Jordan, this was a fascinating conversation.
*  I really love the way you explore math in your writing, the willingness to be specific and clear
*  and actually explore difficult ideas, but at the same time, stepping outside and figuring out
*  beautiful stuff. And I love the chart at the opening of your new book that shows the chaos,
*  the mess that is your mind. Yes, this is what I was trying to keep in my head all at once while
*  I was writing. And I probably should have drawn this picture earlier in the process. Maybe it
*  would have made my organization easier. I actually drew it only at the end. And many of the things
*  we talked about are on this map. The connections are yet to be fully dissected and investigated.
*  And yes, God is in the picture. Right on the edge, right on the edge, not in the center.
*  Thank you so much for talking. It is a huge honor that you would waste your valuable time with me.
*  Thank you, Lex. We went to some amazing places today. This is really fun.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jordan Ellenberg. And thank you to Secret Sauce,
*  ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Indeed. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Jordan in his book, How Not to Be Wrong.
*  Knowing mathematics is like wearing a pair of x-ray specs that reveal hidden structures
*  underneath the messy and chaotic surface of the world.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
