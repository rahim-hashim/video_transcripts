# Robert Crews: Afghanistan, Taliban, Bin Laden, and War in the Middle East | Lex Fridman Podcast #244
**Lex Fridman:** [November 28, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDiqA4SJNpA)
*  The following is a conversation with Robert Cruz, a historian at Stanford,
*  specializing in the history of Afghanistan, Russia and Islam.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now here's my conversation with Robert Cruz.
*  Was it a mistake for the United States to invade Afghanistan in 2001, 20 years ago?
*  Yes. As simple as yes.
*  Why was it a mistake?
*  I'm a historian, so I say this with some humility about what we can do.
*  I think I'd still like to know much more about what was going on in the White House
*  in the hours, days, weeks after 9-11.
*  But I think the George W. Bush administration acted in a state of panic.
*  And I think they wanted to show toughness.
*  They wanted to show some kind of resolve.
*  This was a horrific act that played out on everyone's television screens.
*  And I think it was really fundamentally a crisis of legitimacy within the White House,
*  the noble office.
*  And I think they felt like they had to do something and something dramatic.
*  I think they didn't really think through, you know, who they were fighting,
*  who the enemy was, what this geography had to do with 9-11.
*  I think looking back at it, I mean, some of us, not to say I was clairvoyant
*  or could see into the future, but I think many of us were, you know,
*  from that morning, skeptical about the connections that people were drawing
*  between Afghanistan as a state, as a place, and the actions of Al Qaeda
*  in Washington and New York and Pennsylvania.
*  So as you watch the events of 9-11, the things that
*  our leaders were saying in the minutes, hours, days, weeks that followed,
*  maybe you can give a little bit of a timeline of what was being said.
*  One was the actual invasion of Afghanistan.
*  And also, what were your feelings in the minutes, weeks after 9-11?
*  I was in D.C. I was, you know, on the way to American University,
*  hearing on NPR what happened.
*  And I thought of the.
*  American University logo, which is red, white and blue, it's an eagle.
*  And I thought, you know, Washington is under attack and symbols
*  of American power are under attack.
*  And so, yeah, I was quite concerned and at the time lived, you know,
*  just a few miles from the Capitol.
*  And so, you know, I felt that, you know, it was, it was real.
*  So I appreciate the, you know, the sense of anxiety and fear and panic.
*  And for two, three years later in D.C., we were constantly getting reports,
*  you know, mostly rumors and confirmed about all kinds of attacks
*  that would follow the city.
*  So I definitely appreciate the sense of being under assault.
*  But in watching television, including Russian television that day,
*  because I just just installed a satellite thing.
*  So I was trying to watch world news and get different points of view.
*  And that was quite useful to have an alternative set of eyes in Russian.
*  Yeah, in Russian. Yeah. OK.
*  So your Russians is good enough to understand Russian television.
*  The news. Yeah, the news and the visuals that were coming
*  that were not shown on American television.
*  I don't know how they had it, but they had they were not filtering anything
*  in the way that the major networks and cable televisions were doing here.
*  So it was a very unvarnished view of the violence of the moment.
*  You know, New York City, if people diving from the towers are being, you know,
*  it was really they didn't hold back on that, which was quite fascinating.
*  I think much of the world saw much more than actually the American public saw.
*  But to your question, you know, amid that feeling of imminent doom,
*  I watched commentators start to talk about Al Qaeda and then talk about Afghanistan.
*  And one of the experts was was Barnett Rubin, who's at NYU,
*  who's a kind of long, very learned Afghanistan hand.
*  And he's brought on Peter Jennings on ABC News to to kind of lay this out for everyone.
*  And I thought, you know, he did a fine job, but I think it was formative
*  in submitting the view that somehow Al Qaeda was synonymous with this space, Afghanistan.
*  I think again, I was no Al Qaeda expert then.
*  And I'm not now.
*  But I think my immediate thought went to war.
*  And because my background had been with at that point,
*  mostly Afghans who had been displaced from decades of war,
*  whom I encountered in Uzbekistan, who were refugees and so on.
*  I thought immediately my mind went to the suffering of Afghan people,
*  that this war was going to sweep sweep up, of course, the, you know,
*  the defenseless people who have nothing to do with these politics.
*  So we should give maybe a little bit of contact.
*  Yeah, you can speak to. Yeah.
*  So assume nobody's an expert in anything. Yeah.
*  So let's just say you and I are not experts in anything.
*  Right. What as a historian were you studying at the time and thinking about?
*  See, is it is it the full global history of Afghanistan?
*  Is it the region where you thinking about the Mujahideen and Al Qaeda and Taliban?
*  Were you thinking about the Soviet Union, the proxy war through Afghanistan?
*  Were you thinking about Iraq and oil?
*  Like what what's the full space of things in your heart, in your mind at the time?
*  I mean, just the moment, of course, it was, you know, there's the sense of,
*  you know, the suffering and the tragedy of the moment of the deaths.
*  And that was, I think I was preoccupied by by the violence of the moment.
*  But as the conversation turned to Afghanistan as a kind of theater
*  to somehow respond to this moment, I think immediately what came to mind was that
*  little I knew about Al Qaeda at the time,
*  so that the geography was was inaccurate,
*  that this was a global network, a global threat,
*  that this is a kind of, you know, a movement that went beyond borders.
*  And I think that it felt early on that
*  Afghanistan was going to be used as a scapegoat.
*  And it's intellectually at the time, you know, I was teaching at American University.
*  My courses, you know, touched on a range of subjects,
*  but I was trying to complete a book on Islam and the Russian Empire, actually.
*  But in doing that research, which took me across Russia and Central Asia,
*  purely by accident, I had developed an interest in Afghanistan because
*  just again, a series of coincidences.
*  I found myself in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, without housing
*  through an American friend who was like the king of the market in Tashkent.
*  He knew everyone.
*  He run into some Afghan merchants there.
*  They found out I didn't have a place to live.
*  I didn't know where Afghanistan was, honestly.
*  This was 1997.
*  I had a vague idea it was next door.
*  Well, you lived in Uzbekistan?
*  Yeah, in Tashkent, doing decision research.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it was, you know, hub of the Russian Empire in Central Asia.
*  Yeah.
*  So just by accident, I ended up with these young Afghans who took me in as roommates.
*  And then I think that the sense of that community shaped my idea of what Afghanistan is.
*  It was my first exposure to them.
*  They were part of a trading diaspora.
*  They brought, they had brought matches from Riga, Latvia.
*  They had somehow brought blower and some agricultural products from Egypt.
*  And they were sitting in enclosed containers in Tashkent, waiting for the
*  Uzbekistan estate to permit them to trade.
*  So these guys are mostly hanging out during the day.
*  They would get dressed up.
*  They put on suits and ties, like you're wearing.
*  They'd polish their shoes.
*  And they would sit around offices, drink tea, pistachios.
*  Then they'd feast at lunch.
*  And then at night we would go out.
*  So part of my research, because I also had a bottleneck in my research, I was going to
*  the state archives in Tashkent and because of the state of Uzbekistan, you know, that
*  was a very kind of suspicious thing to do.
*  So it took a while to get in.
*  So I had downtime in Tashkent, just like these guys.
*  So I got to know them pretty well.
*  And it was really just a, an accidental kind of thing, but grew quite close to them.
*  And I developed an appreciation of, which now I think, again, thinking of the seeds
*  of all this. These people had already lived, young guys, you know, in the 20s, they'd
*  already lived in 67 countries.
*  They all spoke half a dozen languages.
*  One of my best friends there had been a kickboxer and breakdancer trained in Tehran.
*  His father was a theater person in Afghanistan.
*  He told stories of escaping death in Afghanistan during the civil war, going to
*  Uzbekistan, escaping death there.
*  And these were very, you know, real stories.
*  Can you also just briefly mention geographically speaking, Afghanistan,
*  Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, you mentioned Iran.
*  Right.
*  What, who are the neighbors of all of this?
*  What are we supposed to be thinking about for people?
*  I was always terrible at geography and spatial information.
*  So can you lay it out?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Sure.
*  So Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan.
*  It was a hub of Russian imperial power in the 19th century.
*  The Russians take the city from a local kind of Muslim dynasty in 1865.
*  It becomes the city, the kind of hub of Soviet power in Central Asia after 1917.
*  It becomes the center of the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan, which becomes
*  independent finally in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapses.
*  So these are all like these, uh, republics are the fingertips of Soviet
*  power in Central Asia.
*  That's right.
*  And they've been independent since 1991, but they have struggled to disentangle
*  themselves from Moscow, from one another.
*  And now they face very serious pressure from China to form a kind of periphery of,
*  you know, the great machine that is the Chinese economy and its ambitions
*  to stretch across Asia.
*  Um, for Afghanistan, where my roommates, my friends hailed from, um, yeah,
*  Afghanistan had fallen into civil war in the late 1970s when leftists tried to
*  seize power there in 1978.
*  So the union then extended from Uzbekistan, you know, crossing the border
*  with this forces in 1979 to try to shore up this leftist government, that
*  had seized power in 1978.
*  Um, and so for Central Asians in the wider region, you know, their, their
*  fate had for some decades been tied to Afghanistan in a variety of ways, but
*  it became much more connected in 1980s when Soviet Red Army occupied, um,
*  Afghanistan for 10 years.
*  And here I refer your listeners and viewers to, um, Rambo three as the guide
*  to the historically accurate, the Bible, the Bible of African history and Rambo
*  three, as, as a fantastic window onto the American view of the war, right.
*  But for us Afghans, you know, there are people who fought against the Soviet army.
*  Um, but of a certain generation, the guys I knew, you know, their mission was
*  to survive and so they fled in waves, you know, by the millions to Pakistan,
*  to Iran, some went north into so essential Asia later in the 90s, um, and
*  some were displaced across the planet.
*  So California, wherever Sydney today has a large community that came in the
*  80s and 90s in the East Bay.
*  Um, can I ask a quick question?
*  That's a little bit of a tangent.
*  Yep.
*  What is the correct or the respectful way to pronounce Afghanistan, Afghanistan,
*  I, Iran, Iran.
*  So as a Russian speaker, Afghanistan, the on versus the, and is it a different
*  country by country as an English speaker in America, is it pretentious and
*  disrespectful to say Afghanistan or is it the opposite respectful to say it that way?
*  What are your thoughts on that?
*  That's a fascinating question.
*  Um, I defer to the people from those countries to, of course, sort out those
*  politics.
*  I think, you know, I think one of the fascinating things about the region broadly
*  is that it is a place of so many cultures and, and really quite cosmopolitan.
*  So I think people are mostly quite forgiving about how you say Afghanistan,
*  Afghanistan, not like Paris, the French are not forgiving.
*  No, no, no, exactly.
*  No, I think people are very, very forgiving.
*  And I think that, you know, Iranians are a bit, you know, more instructive in
*  suggesting Iran rather than Iran, right?
*  Iraq, Iraq, you know, I, I think there's, there's, there's going to be a fit
*  between certain ways of pronouncing these places and the position that
*  Americans take about them.
*  Right.
*  So it's more jarring when people say Iraq and it comes with, you know, a
*  claim that a certain kind of person, you know, should be the victim of violence
*  or, right.
*  So does that, yeah, it's kind of like talking about the democratic party or
*  the Democrat party.
*  It's a sometimes using certain kinds of terminology to make a little bit of a
*  sort of a implied statement about your beliefs.
*  That's fascinating.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think when I hear Iraq and Iran, I mean, I think it, yeah, is it
*  intentional in the case of a Democrat or is it just a, you know, and it's
*  a whatever, I think, again, I think most Iranians and Afghans people I know
*  have, have been very cool about that.
*  What annoys Afghans now, I can say, I think it's fair to say, I don't mean to
*  speak for mainstay people, for entire group of people, but I can just share
*  with our, our non-Afghan friends.
*  Um, the term Afghani, uh, is, is a kind of term of offense because that's the
*  name of the currency.
*  And so lots of people ask, you know, why having, especially again, it's more
*  directed at Americans because, you know, we've been so deeply involved in that
*  country, obviously for the last 20 years.
*  Right.
*  So Afghans ask why after 20 years, are you still calling us the wrong name?
*  What is the right name?
*  Somebody they prefer Afghans Afghans.
*  Yeah.
*  And Af Afghani is the name of the currency.
*  And so I just dodged the bullet cause I was going to say, yeah, I hear you.
*  That's really great to know.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's, and it's again, I think, but I would emphasize that people are quite
*  open and, and, you know, it's a, it's a whole region of incredible diversity and,
*  and respect for linguistic pluralism actually.
*  So I think that, you know, but I also appreciate that during, in this context,
*  um, when there's a lot of pain, you know, in the Afghan diaspora community in
*  particular, you know, being called the wrong name after 20 years, when they
*  already feel so betrayed at this moment, you know, just kind of, if one follows
*  us on social media, that is one kind of, um, hot wire.
*  Yeah.
*  So the reason I ask about pronunciation is because yes, it is true that there
*  are certain things when mispronounced kind of reveal that you don't care
*  enough to pronounce correctly.
*  So I don't know enough to pronounce correctly and you dismiss the culture
*  and the people, which I think that's right as per your writing is something
*  that if it's okay, I'll go with Afghanistan just because I'm used to, I
*  say Iraq, Iran, but I say Afghanistan is as you do in your writing, uh,
*  Afghanistan suffers from much misunderstanding from the rest of the world.
*  But back to our discussion of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, the whole region that gives
*  us context for the events of 9 11.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So yeah, if we go back to that day and the weeks that followed, um, in my mind
*  went to the community I knew in Tashkent, um, which was interesting.
*  It was, I mean, they were, so Islam was the focal point of our conversation
*  in the U S about 9 11, right?
*  Everyone wanted to know what was the relationship between this perfect
*  violence and that religious tradition with its, you know, 1 billion plus
*  followers across the globe.
*  Right.
*  That became the issue, of course, for American security institutions,
*  for local state and police institutions.
*  Right.
*  I mean, it became the, I think it was the question that most Americans had on
*  their minds.
*  So again, I didn't imagine myself as someone who had all the answers of course,
*  but given my background and coming at this from Russian history, coming at
*  this from studying empire and trying to think about the region broadly, you
*  know, I was very alarmed at the way that the conversation went.
*  Can I ask you a question?
*  What was your feeling on that morning of 9 11?
*  Who did this?
*  Isn't that, isn't that a natural feeling?
*  There's a, it's coupled with fear of what's next, especially when you're in
*  DC, but also who is this?
*  Is this an accident?
*  Yeah.
*  Is this a deliberate terrorist attack?
*  Is this a domestic, like, what were your thoughts of the options and the
*  internal ranking given your expertise?
*  I mean, I suppose I was taken by the narrative that this was international.
*  I mean, I had also lived in New York during one of the first bombings in
*  94 of the world trade center.
*  So it was clear to me that a radical community had really fixed New York as
*  part of their imagination of, and I immediately thought it was a, it was a,
*  I kind of blow to American power.
*  And, you know, I was drawn by the symbolism of, of it, you know, if you
*  think of it as an act, it was a kind of, um, an act of speech, if you will, a
*  kind of, uh, a way of speaking to from a position of relative weakness, speaking
*  to, uh, you know, an imperial power.
*  And that I saw, I saw it as a kind of symbolic, you know, speech act of that
*  with horrific, you know, real world, um, consequences for all those innocent
*  victims, for the firing of the police and just the, you know, the horror of the moment.
*  Um, so I, I, I did see it as, as transcending the United States, but I did
*  not see it as really having anything necessarily to do fundamentally about
*  Afghanistan and the history of the region that I've been studying and the
*  community people that I knew who were not particularly religious, right?
*  That the, the guys I hung out with actually wore me out because they
*  wanted to go out every night.
*  They wanted to party every night.
*  We had drinking.
*  Yep.
*  We had discussions about alcohol.
*  I mean, Uzbekistan is famous for its, you know, its drinking, you
*  know, it's something to look forward to.
*  So I do want to travel to that part of the world.
*  When was the last time you were in that part of the world?
*  Early 2000s, only mid 2000s, uh, 2010s.
*  So wait, so, uh, by the way, we're drinking vodka.
*  What's, what's the, what kind of choice
*  Uzbekistan has incorporated vodka as, as the, um, the choice.
*  Um, and that, and it, it informs, you know, and it's, but the fascinating
*  thing, you know, and as a student is what you're observing as a non-Muslim.
*  You know, I'm a, I'm a non-Russian.
*  I'm, this is all, you know, culturally new to me.
*  And I'm, you know, a student of all that, right.
*  As a grad student doing my work there.
*  So you're like Jane Goodall of vodka and Russia.
*  That's right.
*  Just observing.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you get the, you get the Samogon, the grass vodka you get, you know, I
*  have, I've had some long nights on the Kazakhstan frontier that I'm not proud of.
*  Um, you know,
*  but you got to know the people and some of them from, from, from, from,
*  yeah, but intellectually.
*  So the thing, I mean, the, the fascinating thing there was it.
*  And just as a, I mean, there's a whole, yeah, I'm an historian, right.
*  But there, there are great contributions by, you know, anthropologists and
*  ethnographers who, who've gone across the planet and try to understand how Muslims
*  understand the tradition at different contexts.
*  So many Uzbeks will say, you know, um, this is part of our national culture
*  to drink and eat as we please.
*  Right.
*  And yet I'm a very devout Muslim.
*  And so of course you can encounter other Muslim communities who
*  won't touch alcohol, right.
*  But it's become kind of, I think it's very much, um, you know, Soviet
*  culture left a deep impression in each of these places.
*  And so there are ways of thinking, ways of performing ways of enjoying
*  oneself that are shared across.
*  So be informed, so be space to this day.
*  Right.
*  And you've written also about Muslims in the Soviet Union.
*  That's right.
*  Uh, there's an article that, uh, there was a paywalls that couldn't read it.
*  And I really want to read it is, uh, Moscow and the mosque or something like that.
*  Um, by the way, just another tangent on a tangent.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, so I bought all your books.
*  I love them very much.
*  One of the reasons I bought them and read many parts is, uh, because they're easy
*  to buy unlike articles, every single website has a paywall.
*  So it's, it's very frustrating to read brilliant scholars such as yourself.
*  Um, I wish there was one fee I could pay everywhere.
*  I don't care what that fee is, where it gives, allows me to read
*  some of your brilliant writing.
*  No, no, thank you.
*  I hear you.
*  No, I think moving toward more kind of open source, formatting stuff, I think
*  is what a lot of journals are thinking about now.
*  And I think it's definitely for the kind of democratization of knowledge and
*  scholarship, that's definitely an important thing that we should all think about.
*  And I think, um, you know, we need to exert pressure on these publishers to do that.
*  So this is what I'm doing here.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Good.
*  Good.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I appreciate it.
*  So, uh, so your thought was Afghanistan is not, it's not going to be the center.
*  The source of where it's not the center of this and evading that country isn't
*  going to fix, isn't going to fix the, you know, toxic milestone of politics
*  that produced nine 11, right?
*  I think it's thinking of some of the personalities, just thinking about going
*  back to the touch against storage, I'll end with, I mean, just observing, you
*  know, real Muslims doing, doing things and then asking questions about it and, and
*  trying to understand through their eyes, what the tradition means to them.
*  And then, you know, you have a, we had, we had a very narrow conversation about
*  what Islam is that, you know, generated immediately exploded in, you know, on
*  the day of nine 11, right.
*  Um, and then of course, um, I think the antipathy toward Islam and Muslims, you
*  know, it was informed by, by racism informed by xenophobia.
*  So it became a perfect storm.
*  I think of demonization that didn't sit with, you know, what I knew about the
*  tradition and with the actual people that I had known because then going back
*  to, I mean, there are other friends and encounters and so on, but just thinking
*  about Afghanistan and, and touch get from them.
*  And I mean, just that, that thought about my friends who had been, who had suffered
*  a great deal in their short lives who've been, you know, cast aside from country
*  to country, but had found a place in Tashkent with some relative stability.
*  And, you know, they wanted to go out every night and, you know, they explained,
*  you know, one friend, we talked about it with the alcohol and all that.
*  And he, he didn't get crazy, but he was like, you can drink, but just don't get
*  drunk.
*  That's, that's permissible within Islam.
*  Right.
*  Um, and he was, you know, ethnic Pashtun, ethnic Uzbeks had a different view, you
*  know, often the more vodka, the better, you know, and it doesn't violate as I
*  understand Islam.
*  So even, you know, it's kind of a silly example, but it's just an illustration of
*  the ways in which different communities, different generations, different people
*  could come at this very complex rich tradition in so many different ways.
*  So obviously if whatever kind of scholar you are, any kind of expert, whatever
*  you, you know, it's always disconcerting to see your field of specialization be
*  flattened, right.
*  And then be flattened and then be turned to arguments for, for violence.
*  Right.
*  Mixed up with natural human feelings of hate and, uh, and pain.
*  So I, you know, I mean, that day I vividly remember, I sat with, um, other
*  PhD historians in different fields.
*  We, you know, we oddly enough had lunch that day and it kind of deserted
*  Washington's place was open.
*  We went, um, and we just thought, you know, this is going to kind of open up
*  like a great mall of destruction.
*  And, you know, the American state is going to destroy and it's going to
*  destroy in this geography.
*  And I thought that was misplaced for lots of reasons.
*  And then I think if one, you know, I'd been doing some research on Afghanistan
*  then I was kind of shifting to the South and I had been looking at the Taliban,
*  um, from afar for some years.
*  And, you know, I think it's clear now that in retrospect, there were opportunities
*  for alternative policies at that moment.
*  So what should the conversation have been like, what should we have done
*  differently because, you know, from a perspective of the time, the United
*  States was invaded by a foreign force.
*  What is the proper response or what is the proper conversation about the
*  proper response at the time?
*  You think, you know, I know my colleague at Sanford, Connalisa Rice would tell
*  me this is above my pay grade.
*  And, um, you know, she makes a point in her classes to talk about how difficult
*  decision-making is under such intense pressure.
*  And I appreciate that.
*  Um, you know, I am a historian who sits safely in my office.
*  I don't like battlefields.
*  I don't like taking risks.
*  Um, so I concede all those limits.
*  You know, I'm not a military expert.
*  I've been accused of being a spy wherever I've gone because of the way I look and
*  because of my nationality and so on, but I'm not a spy.
*  So I defer, you know, I respect the expertise of all those communities, but I
*  think they acted out of ignorance.
*  They acted, I think, because, I mean, you think of the, in a way there was a
*  compensatory aspect of this decision-making.
*  I mean, the Bush administration failed.
*  This is an extraordinary failure.
*  Right?
*  So if we start, if we're going to break down the intelligence, I mean, if they,
*  you know, if you follow the story of Richard Clark, um, who's Richard Clark, he
*  was a national security expert who was tasked with following Al Qaeda, who had
*  produced a dossier under the Clinton administration that he passed on to the
*  George W.
*  Bush administration.
*  And if you look at the work of Connolly Surrise, she wrote a very famous, I think
*  unpaywalled foreign affairs article that you can read announcing the George W.
*  Bush foreign policy kind of outlook.
*  Um, and it was all about great powers.
*  It was about the rise of China is about Russia.
*  I mean, there's definitely a kind of hangover of those who missed having
*  Russia as the boogie man who spoke, you know, the Clinton administration repeated
*  again and again, the idea of making sure the bear stayed in his cage, um, which
*  is why the United States through a lifeline to the central Asian states,
*  hoping to have pipelines, hoping to shore up their national sovereignty as a way
*  of containing Russia initially, but also Iran, you know, which sits to the
*  south and west and then peripherally looking down the road to China, to the
*  east.
*  So the, the bear is what like Russia or is it kind of like some weird
*  combination of Russia, Iran and China?
*  The bear is Russia and Russia is this, um, I'm trying to characterize the
*  imagination of some of these national security figures.
*  Um, this is an image formed in the cold war.
*  I mean, it has deeper seeds in European and Western intellectual thought that go
*  back at least to the 1850s and the reign of Tsar Nicholas the first.
*  When we first get this language about, um, the Russian empire is this kind of
*  evil, uh, polity.
*  Obviously this was a kind of pillar of Reaganism.
*  Um, but the Clinton folks kept that alive.
*  They wanted to make sure that, you know, American power would be unmatched and
*  they being creatures of the cold war themselves, they look to Russia as a
*  recession power well before Putin was even thought of.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this is, you mentioned one deep, uh, profound historical piece in Rambo.
*  It's probably, uh, the, this, this conflict has to do with another
*  Celesta stolen movie of Rocky four, which is also historically accurate and based
*  on, uh, it's basically a documentary.
*  So, um, there is something about the American power, even at the level of
*  kind of Lisa rice, these respected, uh, deep kind of, uh, leaders and thinkers
*  about history in the future where they like to have competition with other
*  superpowers and almost a conjure up superpowers, even when those countries
*  don't maybe at the time at least deserve the label of super power.
*  That's right.
*  Great point.
*  Yeah.
*  They're all all at some points.
*  So yeah, I mean, Russia was, I think many, many exports.
*  I mean, my, my mentor at Princeton, um, Stephen Cochran, you know, was then
*  writing great things about how, you know, if you look at Russia's economy, the
*  scale of its GDP, you know, its capacity to actually act globally, it's all quite
*  limited.
*  Um, but Connie rice and the people around her, you know, came into power with
*  Georgia, B Bush thinking that, you know, the foreign policy challenges of her era
*  would be those of the past, right?
*  Richard Clark and others within the administration warned that in fact, there
*  is this group that has declared war against the United States and they are
*  coming for us, the FBI had been following these people around for many
*  months.
*  And so, you know, by the time George W.
*  Bush comes to power, lots of Al Qaeda activists are well, not lots, but you
*  know, uh, perhaps a dozen or so are already, you know, training in the United
*  States, right?
*  Um, and what we knew immediately from the biographies of some of the characters of
*  the attackers of nine 11, it was a hodgepodge of people from across the planet,
*  but mostly they were Saudi, right?
*  And that was known very early on or presumed to be very long.
*  So again, if we go back to your big question about the geography, why
*  Afghanistan?
*  It didn't add up, right?
*  It seemed to me that Afghanistan was a kind of soft target.
*  It was a place to have explosions, to seemingly recapture American supremacy.
*  Um, and also I think, you know, there was in many quarters, there was a, a deep
*  urge for revenge and this was the place to have some casualties, have some
*  explosions, and then I think, you know, restore the legitimacy of the Bush
*  administration by showing that we are in charge, we'll pay.
*  I think that was a very old fashioned punitive dimension, which rests upon a
*  presumption that if we intimidate these people, they'll know not to try this
*  again, right?
*  All these, I would suggest are all misreadings of a, of an organization
*  that was always global.
*  It had no real center.
*  I mean, it called itself the center.
*  That's one way to translate Al Qaeda, but that center was really in the
*  imagination, um, Bin Laden bounced around from country to country.
*  Um, and crucially, I think, uh, a dimension that I don't claim to know
*  anything new about, but has endured as a kind of doubt is the role of Saudi
*  Arabia and the fact that, you know, the muscle in that operation of 9-11 was
*  Saudi, right?
*  I mean, this was a Saudi operation with different things.
*  So again, just on the basis of nationalities, Saudis, you know, an
*  Egyptian or two, a Lebanese guy and the Egyptian guy, you know, had been
*  studying in Germany.
*  He was an urban planner, right?
*  Um, so if one thinks of the imagination of this, I mean, and if I have to
*  view, look at the kind of typology of the figures who have led this radical
*  movement, I mean, if you think of the global jihadists, they are mostly not
*  religious scholars, right?
*  Bin Laden was not a religious scholar.
*  His training was an engineer, you know, some biographers claim that he was a
*  playboy for much of his youth, but really the, the, these ideas, I think
*  that's probably why they chose the Twin Towers.
*  I mean, this is an imagination fueled by training and engineering.
*  I mean, a lot of the, you know, the sociology, if you do a kind of
*  post-propagography of a lot of these leading jihadists, their backgrounds
*  are not in Islamic scholarship, but actually in engineering and kind of
*  practical sciences and professions, medical doctors are among their ranks.
*  Um, and so there's long been a tension between Islamic scholars who devote
*  their whole lives to study of texts and commentary and interpretation.
*  And then what some scholars call kind of new intellectuals, new Muslim
*  authorities who actually have secular university educations, often in the
*  natural sciences or engineering and technical fields, who then bring that
*  kind of mindset, if you will, to what Muslim scholars call the religious
*  sciences, which are, you know, a field of kind of ambiguity and of gradation
*  and of subtlety and nuance and really have decades of training before one
*  becomes authoritative to speak about issues like whether or not it's legitimate
*  to take someone else's life.
*  With the relation to Afghanistan, who was Bin Laden?
*  Bin Laden was a, a visitor.
*  Um, if you look at his whole life course, part of it is an enigma.
*  So, you know, he is from a Saudi elite family, but a family that kind of has
*  a Yemeni Arabian sea kind of genealogy.
*  Um, so the family has no relationship to Afghanistan past or present, except
*  at some point in 1980s, when he went like thousands of other young Saudis, first
*  to Pakistan, to places like Bashar on the border, where they wanted to aid
*  the jihad in some capacity.
*  And for the most part, the Arabs who went opened up hospitals, some opened
*  up schools, the Bin Laden family had long been based in engineering construction.
*  So it's thought that he used some of those skills and resources and
*  connections to build things.
*  Um, you know, we have images of him firing a gun, uh, for show, right?
*  It's not clear that he ever actually fired a gun in what we would call combat.
*  Um, again, I could be corrected by this and I think, you know, they're competing
*  accounts of who he was.
*  So he's kind of a, I mean, when these figures that he, who sit at the
*  pinnacle of this world are, you know, fictive heroes that people, you know,
*  map their aspirations onto, right?
*  And so people like Mullah Omar, who was then head of the Taliban was
*  rarely seen in public.
*  The current head of the Taliban is almost never seen in public.
*  I mean, there's kind of studied Arab, um, mystery that they've cultivated to
*  make themselves available for all kinds of fantasies, right?
*  Do you think he believed so his religious beliefs?
*  Do you think he believed some of the more extreme things that enable him
*  to commit terrorist acts, maybe put another way, what makes a man want to
*  become a terrorist and what aspect of Bin Laden made him want to be a terrorist?
*  Right.
*  Um, I mean, let me offer some observations.
*  Uh, I think, you know, there are others who know more about Bin Laden and have
*  farmer expertise and Al Qaeda, so I'm coming this in an adjacent way, kind of
*  from Afghanistan and from my historical training.
*  So this is my two cents.
*  So, you know, bear with me.
*  Um, I don't have the authoritative account.
*  Itself is fascinating because you're a historian of Afghanistan and the fact
*  that Bin Laden isn't a huge part of your focus of study just means that Bin Laden
*  is not a key part of the history of Afghanistan, except that America made
*  him a key part of the history of Afghanistan.
*  I would endorse that.
*  Definitely.
*  That's it.
*  I mean, you've, you've put it in a very pithy pithy way.
*  Um, yeah, so listen, he was, he was a, so he was an engineer.
*  He was said to be a playboy.
*  Um, he spent a lot of cash from his family, you know, like many young
*  Saudis and from some other countries, he was inspired by this idea that
*  there was jihad in Afghanistan.
*  It was going to take down one of the two superpowers, the Soviet union, who, you
*  know, the red army did murder hundreds of thousands, perhaps as many as 2 million.
*  Um, Afghan civilians during that conflict.
*  It's very, you know, plausible and very, you know, completely
*  understandable that many young people would see that cause as, you know, the
*  righteous, pious fighters for jihad who call themselves Jihadine are aided
*  against this evil empire, right?
*  Of a godless Soviet empire that, I mean, there's even confusion about
*  what the Soviets wanted, right?
*  And now we know much more about like what the Kremlin wanted, what Brezhnev
*  wanted and how the Soviet elite thought about it because we have many more
*  other records, but from the outside, you know, for Jimmy Carter and then for Reagan,
*  it looked like the Soviets were making a move on, on South Asia because they
*  wanted to get to the warm water ports, you know, which Russians always want
*  supposedly, right?
*  And it was kind of a, a move to take over our oil and, you know, to assert world
*  domination, right?
*  So there are lots of ways in which this looked like good versus evil in Congress.
*  It looked like, um, you know, kind of Vietnam again, but this time it, this is
*  our chance to get them and there are lots of great quotes, uh, I mean, disturbing,
*  but really revealing quotes that American policymakers made about wanting
*  to give the Soviets their Vietnam.
*  So the CIA funneled, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars into this project
*  to back the Mujahideen, you know, who Reagan called freedom fighters.
*  And so Bin Laden was part of that universe.
*  He's part of that, you know, he's swimming in the ocean of these Afghan
*  Mujahideen who out of size, you know, did 95% of the fighting.
*  They're the ones who died.
*  They're the ones who defeated the Red Army, right?
*  The Arabs who were there did a little fighting, but a lot of it was for, you
*  know, their purposes.
*  It was to get experience.
*  It was to kind of create their reputations.
*  Like Bin Laden began to forge for himself, uh, being spoken for a global project.
*  Because by the late eighties, when Bin Laden, I think was more active and began
*  conspiring with people from other Arab countries, the idea that, you know,
*  Gorbachev got power in 85, he's like, let's get out of here.
*  This is, this is draining the Soviet budget.
*  It's an embarrassment.
*  Uh, we didn't think about this properly.
*  Let's focus on restoring, um, the party and strengthening the Soviet Union.
*  Let's get out of this costly war.
*  You know, it's, it's, it's a waste.
*  Um, it's not worth it.
*  We're even don't lose anything by getting out of Afghanistan.
*  Um, and so their retreat was quite, uh, effective and successful from
*  the Soviet point of view, right?
*  It's not what we're seeing now.
*  Um, what year was the retreat?
*  Um, I mean, it began, so Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985.
*  You know, he was a generation younger than the other guys.
*  He was a critic of the system.
*  He didn't want to abolish it.
*  He wanted to reform it.
*  He was a true believer in, in Soviet socialism and in the, in the
*  party as a, uh, you know, a monopolist, right?
*  Um, but he's critical of the old guard and recognize that the party had a
*  change and the whole system had to change to continue to compete.
*  And so Afghanistan was one element of this.
*  And so he pushed the Afghan elites that Moscow was backing to basically say,
*  listen, we're going to share power.
*  Um, and so a figure named Najibullah who was a Soviet trained intelligence
*  specialist sitting in Kabul, um, agreed.
*  And he said, we need to have a more kind of pluralistic accommodations
*  approach to our enemies who are backed by the U S mainly sitting in Pakistan,
*  sitting in Iran, backed by these Arabs to a degree, getting money from Saudi.
*  And he said, let's draw some of them into the government and basically have a kind
*  of unity government that would make some space to the opposition.
*  And for the most part, with us backing, with Pakistani backing, with Iranian
*  backing, with Saudi backing, the opposition said, no, we're not going to reconcile.
*  We're going to push you off the cliff.
*  And so that story goes on from at least 1987, the last Soviet red army
*  troops leave early 1989, um, but the Najibullah government holds on for three more years.
*  It is the, um, I mean, they're still getting some help from the Soviet Union.
*  It's enemies are still getting help from the U S mainly.
*  And, um, it's not until 1992 that, that, um, that they lose.
*  And then Mujadid come to power.
*  They immediately, you know, they're deeply fractured.
*  And that's where Bin Laden is watching all of this on roll.
*  That's right.
*  And he's, he's part of the mix, but he's also mobile.
*  So he got, he at one point, you know, goes, um, you know, is in Sudan, you know,
*  he's, he's moving from place to place.
*  His people are all over the world.
*  In fact, they, I mean, if you think of the, once the Mujadid take power, you
*  know, they, they have difficulties with the Arab fighters too, and they don't
*  want them coming in and messing with Mujadid regard this as like, you know,
*  this is an Afghan national state that we're going to build.
*  It's going to be Islamic.
*  It's going to be an Islamic state, but you can't interfere with us.
*  And so there are always tensions.
*  And so the Arabs are always kind of, I would say they were Arab
*  fighters were always interlopers.
*  Um, yes, the Africans are happy to take their money, send patients to their
*  hospitals, um, take their weapons, but they were never going to let this be
*  like a Saudi or Egyptian or whatever project.
*  Um, but then many of those fighters went home.
*  They went back to Syria.
*  They went back to Egypt.
*  Some wanted to go back to the Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis are very careful.
*  I mean, the Saudis always use Afghanistan as a kind of safety valve.
*  In fact, they had, you know, fundraisers on television.
*  They chartered jets.
*  It filled them with people to fly to Pakistan, um, get out in the shower
*  and say, you know, go fight.
*  And it was one way that the, the monarchy, the Saudi monarchy, um, very cleverly, I
*  think created a, a kind of escape valve for would be dissidents in Saudi Arabia.
*  Right.
*  Just send them abroad.
*  You want to fight jihad, go do that somewhere else.
*  Don't, don't bother the kingdom.
*  But all this became dicier, um, in the early nineties, when some of these guys
*  came back home and some of the scholars around them said, you know, let's, we've
*  defeated the Soviet Union, which is a huge, huge boost.
*  And I think part of the dynamic we see today is that the Taliban victory is a
*  renewed inspiration for people who think, look, we beat the Soviets.
*  Now we beat the Americans.
*  And so already watching the Soviet retreat across this bridge, back into
*  Uzbekistan, if you see these dramatic images of the tanks, you know, moving,
*  a lot of people interpreted this as like, you know, we are going to change the
*  world and now we're turning to the Americans and our, our local national
*  governments are backed by the Americans.
*  So let's start with a, start with those places and then let's go strike.
*  Let's go strike the belly of the beast, which is America, which is New
*  York and going back to Milan, your question about, you know, what motivates
*  him, what motivated him, you know, again, he was not a rigorously trained
*  Islamic scholar and that I think, you know, when I, when this, when this
*  comes up in our classes, you know, I think especially young people, I mean,
*  people who weren't even born on 11.
*  I mean, they're, they're shocked.
*  They, they see, they see his appearance.
*  They see him pictured in front of a giant bookshelf of Arabic books.
*  He's got the clash and a cough.
*  He's got what looks like a religious scholars library behind him.
*  Right.
*  But if you look at his words, I mean, one fascinating thing about just our politics
*  and just one thing that kind of sums it all up, I mean, the fact that on 9 11,
*  we had to have a few people, a few experts, people like Bernard Rubin, who
*  was an Afghanistan expert.
*  So that was one way in which I think, you know, I'm not faulting him personally,
*  but it's just one way in which that relationship appeared to be, you know,
*  formed right of linking Afghanistan to that moment.
*  Um, if one looks actually, you know, what Bin Laden was saying and doing people
*  like Richard Clark were studying this.
*  There were Arab leaders, the Arab press was watching this because he gave some
*  of his first interviews to a few Arab newspaper outlets.
*  But speaking of our American kind of, you know, monolingualism, a lot of
*  what you're saying wasn't known.
*  And so I think for several years, people weren't reading what Bin Laden said.
*  I mean, experts are reading, reading in Arabic, but there was great anxiety
*  around translating his works.
*  So, you know, we have Mein Kampf, we have all this other stuff you can buy.
*  The collective works of Lin and Stalin, Mao, whatever you want in whatever
*  language you want, but Bin Laden was taboo for American publishing.
*  And so it was only Verso in the UK that published a famous volume called
*  messages to the world, which was the first companion of Bin Laden's writings.
*  So he has a Mein Kampf.
*  He has a type, does he have a thing?
*  I mean, it's a kind of collective works.
*  It's a collective works.
*  Okay.
*  So he had like a blog, like a collection of articles versus...
*  Yeah, these are interviews.
*  These are his missives, his declarations, his decrees, right?
*  But I think just in terms of, if we zoom out for a second about, you know,
*  American policy choices and so on, the powers that be didn't trust us to know
*  what he was really about, I put it that way, and I don't say that in a
*  conspiratorial sense.
*  I just think that it was, you know, it was a taboo.
*  I think people, you know, there was a kind of consensus that, you know, trust us.
*  We know, we know how to fight Al-Qaeda and you don't need to know what they're
*  about because they're crazy.
*  They're fanatics.
*  They're fundamentalists.
*  They hate us.
*  Remember that language?
*  Yeah.
*  Us versus them.
*  But if you read Bin Laden, that's when it gets messy.
*  That's where Bin Laden's argumentation is not fundamentally about Islam.
*  And if you're sitting here with an Islamic scholar, he would say, you know,
*  depending on which Islamic scholar they would tend to go through and dissect
*  and negate 99% of the arguments that Bin Laden claimed was in Islam, right?
*  But what strikes me as an historian who's again, looking at this
*  adjacently, if you read Bin Laden, I mean, the arguments that he make are,
*  first of all, they're sophisticated.
*  They reflect a mind that is about geopolitics.
*  He uses terms like imperialism.
*  He knows something about world history.
*  He knows something about geography.
*  So imperialism is the enemy for him?
*  Or what's the nature of the enemy?
*  It's an amalgam.
*  And like a good politician, which is what I would call him, he is adept at speaking
*  in different ways to different audiences.
*  So if you look at the context in which he speaks, if you look at messages to the
*  world, if you look at his writings and it, you can zoom out now and we now have
*  compendia of the writings of Al Qaeda more broadly, you can purchase these, you
*  know, they're basically primary source collections.
*  We now have that for the Taliban.
*  I mean, what's fascinating about, I think, if you'd like this culture,
*  acknowledging it's very diverse internally is that these people are
*  representatives of political movements who seek followers.
*  They speak.
*  They often are very, I'd say, skilled at visual imagery.
*  And especially now, I mean, what's fascinating is that, I mean, the Taliban
*  used to shoot televisions.
*  They used to, you know, blow up VCR, you know, videotapes.
*  They used to string audio and video cassettes from trees and kind of ceremonial
*  hangings, right?
*  That we're, we're killing this nefarious, infidel technology that is doing the
*  work of Satan.
*  And yet today, and plastic, I mean, one of the keys to the Taliban success is that
*  they got really good at using media.
*  I mean, brilliant at using a written word, the spoken word music, actually.
*  And, you know, Hollywood, Hollywood is the gold standard.
*  And these guys have studied how to create drama, how to speak to modern users.
*  I mean, Islamic State did this.
*  I mean, the, the role of media, new media.
*  I mean, I am, I follow and I am followed by senior Taliban leaders, which is, you
*  know, bizarre, you know, on Twitter.
*  On Twitter?
*  I don't know why they care about me.
*  I'm, I'm, I'm nothing.
*  Uh, they follow, they follow, they follow you on Twitter.
*  I don't know why.
*  This is no joke.
*  This is no joke.
*  So it's, they are part of our modern world and it's how they talk and it's how they
*  recruit and this is part of the, this is why they are, you know, so, so Bin Laden,
*  if you read Bin Laden, he, he speaks multiple languages.
*  I would say it's, uh, it's environmentalism.
*  You know, the West is bad because we destroyed the planet.
*  The West is bad because we abuse women.
*  So in class, you know, uh, especially, you know, female students are very
*  surprised to learn and actually say, you know, this, this feminist argument is not.
*  You know, we start with, you know, this is a murder.
*  This is a person who has taken human life, innocent life over and over again.
*  And he is, um, you know, aspirationally genocidal, but let's try to understand
*  what he's about.
*  So we walked through the texts, read them and people are shocked to learn that.
*  It's not just about, you know, quotations in the Quran strung together
*  in some irrational fashion.
*  He knows, um, I mean, at the core, I'd say is the problem of human suffering.
*  And he has a geography of that, that is mostly Muslim, but he talked
*  about the suffering of Kashmir.
*  All right.
*  So if you have a student in your class, who's from South Asia, he knows about
*  Kashmir, you know, he or she will say, that's not entirely inaccurate, you know,
*  the Indian state commits atrocities in Kashmir, uh, you know, Pakistanis
*  have done that too, you know, Palestine is an issue, right?
*  So you have an American university setting people across the spectrum who
*  get that, you know, Palestinians have had a raw deal and so it's a victimhood
*  is central and it's Muslim victimhood, which is primary, but as a number of
*  scholars have written and I'm, you know, I definitely think this is a framework
*  for what this useful, I mean, in this kind of vocabulary and the same in
*  this framing, this narrative, um, today in today's world, if we think of
*  today's world being post-Cold War, 91 to the present, looking at the
*  series of Gulf Wars and seeing the visuals of that, I think that, you know,
*  I think the American public has been shielded from some of this, but if you
*  look at, you know, it's the, the carnage of the Iraqi army that George HW Bush
*  produced, right?
*  Or you think of, you know, the images of the suffering of Iraqi children under
*  George HW Bush's sanctions, US British airstrikes, then you have Madeleine
*  Albright answer a question on 16 minutes saying, do you think, you know, the
*  deaths of half a million Iraqi kids is, is worth it, you know, is that justified
*  to contain Saddam Hussein?
*  And she says on camera, yes, that it's worth it to me.
*  If you put that all together, I mean, American kids, and of course, the
*  American public, they're not always aware of those, those facts of global history.
*  But these guys are, and they, they very capably use these images, use these
*  tropes and use facts.
*  I mean, in fact, I mean, some of these things are not, are not deniable.
*  I mean, the, I mean, these estimates about the number of Iraqi civilian children
*  dead, you know, that, that came from, I think the Lancet and it came from, you
*  know, those are, those are estimates, but looking at this one point of view of,
*  of, of Amman, of, you know, Jaffa, of Nairobi, you know, just think around the
*  planet, um, and if you see yourself as the victim of this great imperial power,
*  yeah, you can see why especially young men would be drawn to, uh, a road of, of,
*  of self-sacrifice.
*  And the idea is that in killing others, you are making them feel how you feel
*  because they won't listen to your arguments reasonably because they won't, you
*  know, recognize Palestinian suffering, Bosnian suffering, right?
*  Chechen suffering.
*  You go across the planet, right?
*  Because they won't recognize our suffering, we're going to speak to you in
*  the only language that you understand, and that's violence.
*  And look at the violence of, of the post 1991 world, right?
*  In which American air power really becomes a global, you know, kind of
*  fact in the lives of so many people.
*  Um, and then the big mistake after 9-11 among many, I mean, fundamentally was
*  taking the war on terror to some, you know, 30 or 40 countries, right?
*  So that you have a more and more of the globe feel like they're under attack.
*  Right.
*  And the, and the logic is essentially it's not, it's not, it's free bin Laden.
*  It's not, we're going to convert you and turn you into Muslims.
*  And that's why we're doing this.
*  That, that appears, that claim does appear at times, but it's, if you look
*  at any given bin Laden text, I mean, there are 40 claims in each text.
*  I mean, it's kind of, it's dizzying, but he's a modern politician.
*  He knows the language of, of social equality.
*  You know, that there's a class dimension to it.
*  There is an environmental dimension to it.
*  There's a gender dimension to it.
*  And yes, there are chronic quotes sprinkled in.
*  And when he wants to speak that language, he knew that, you know, he's not a scholar.
*  So he would often get a few recognized scholars to sign on.
*  So some of his decorations of Jihad had his signature kind of sprinkled in with
*  like a dozen other, other signatures from people who are somewhat known or at
*  least with titles, right?
*  Um, so as a kind of intellectual exercise, it's fascinating to see that
*  he is throwing everything at the wall in one level.
*  Um, that's one way to see that it's a, it's a, these are kind of testaments
*  toward recruitment of people who, yes, they're angry.
*  Yes, they're unhappy.
*  And this is what, you know, I think for our broader public, it's hard to get,
*  you're like, well, bin Laden didn't suffer.
*  He wasn't poor.
*  Like, yeah, I mean, linen, pole pot.
*  I mean, they're speaking to, they're empathetic to the suffering, the landscape,
*  the full landscape of suffering.
*  It's interesting to think about suffering, you know, America, the American
*  public, American politicians and leaders, when they see what is good and evil,
*  they're often not empathetic to the suffering of others.
*  And what you're saying has been Laden perhaps accurately could speak to the
*  ignorance of America, maybe the Soviet Union to the suffering of their people.
*  That's right.
*  And I mean, if you look at the speeches and the ideas that are public of Hitler
*  in the 1930s, he spoke quite accurately to the injustice and maybe the, the
*  suffering of the German people.
*  It, I mean, charismatic politicians are good at telling accurate stories.
*  It's not all fabricated, but they emphasize certain aspects.
*  And then the problem part is the actions you should take based on that.
*  So the narratives and the stories may be grounded in historical accuracy.
*  The actions then cross the line.
*  The ethical line.
*  I found that too.
*  I mean, it's a, again, if you pick up just one of these texts, I mean, it's,
*  it's a kaleidoscope.
*  So the Hitler analogy is interesting because it's, you know, Hitler spoke to,
*  he could speak to things like inflation, right?
*  Which really existed.
*  But he also appealed to the irrational emotions of Germans, right?
*  He sought out scapegoats, you know, Jews, Roma, disabled people,
*  homosexuals and so on, right?
*  I mean, that's also there in Bin Laden too.
*  I mean, Dariyev, you know, an antisemitism, the constant flagging of Zionists and
*  crusaders, it's a kind of shotgun approach to a search for followers.
*  But I also hasten to add that it's for all of the things that we could take off
*  saying, well, yes, Kashmiris have suffered, Chechens have suffered and so on.
*  Bin Ladenism never became a mass movement.
*  I mean, it never really, I think that, I mean, this is the encouraging thing, right?
*  About ideology.
*  I mean, I think the blood on his hands always limited his appeal among Muslims and others.
*  But Bin Laden did have, I mean, he had a, there's a great book by a great scholar at
*  UC San Diego, Jeremy Prestol, who wrote a great book about global icons in which he
*  has Bin Laden, he has Bob Marley, he has Tupac.
*  You know, he asked why, you know, when he was doing research in East Africa, why did
*  he see young kids wearing Bin Laden shirts?
*  They're also wearing like Tupac shirts.
*  They're wearing Bob Marley shirts.
*  And basically it's a way of looking at a kind of partial embrace of some aspects of
*  the rebelliousness of some of these figures, some of the time by some people under
*  certain conditions.
*  Well, the terrifying thing to me.
*  So yeah, there is a longing in the human heart to belong to a group and a charismatic
*  leader is somehow, especially when you're young, just a catalyst for all of that.
*  And I tend to think that perhaps it's actually hard to be Hitler.
*  So a leader so charismatic that he can rile a nation to war.
*  And Bin Laden, perhaps we're lucky, was not sufficiently charismatic.
*  I feel like if his writing was better, if his speeches were better, if his ideas were
*  stronger, better, it's like more viral and then there would be more people kind of young
*  people uniting around him.
*  So in some sense, it's almost like accidents of history of just how much charisma, how
*  much charisma a particular evil person has, a person like Bin Laden.
*  I think it's fair. Evil works, I think.
*  Do you think Bin Laden is evil?
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, he was a mass murderer.
*  I'm just saying that his ideas were they're more complex than we have tended to
*  acknowledge. They have a wider potential resonance than we would acknowledge.
*  I mean, and also, I guess what I'm just one fundamental point is that thinking about
*  the complexity of Bin Laden is also a way of removing him from Islam.
*  He is not an Islamic thinker.
*  He is a cosmopolitan thinker who plays in all kinds of modern ideologies, which have
*  proven to mobilize people in the past.
*  Right. So anti-Semitism, populism, environmentalism, and the kind of the urging to
*  like, you know, do something about humanity, do something about suffering.
*  That's why I think the actual yes, about like what motivates people to do this kind
*  of stuff. I think that's why if one goes below the level of leadership and this is
*  being reported, if you look at the trial ongoing now in Paris of the Bataclan
*  murders, I think the court allowed some discussion of the backgrounds of the
*  accused and they come from different backgrounds.
*  But if there's any common bond, it's kind of that they had some background in
*  petty crime.
*  Famously, in the 7-7 bombings in London, the Metropolitan Police, UK authorities
*  looked at all those guys and what people want is this idea that like they must be
*  very pious.
*  They must be super Islamic to do this kind of stuff.
*  They must be fanatical true believers.
*  But what they found with those guys was that some were nominally Muslim, some
*  went to mosque, some didn't.
*  Some were single, young guys with like criminal backgrounds.
*  Some were like, sorry, they were kind of misfits who never succeeded in anything.
*  But others had at least one thing, had a wife and family who he widowed and
*  orphaned.
*  And so there's no, I mean, for policing, I mean, if you're looking at that lens,
*  there is no kind of typology that will predict who will become violent.
*  And that's why I think we have to move beyond thinking about religious
*  argumentation narrowly or by itself and think about things like geopolitics,
*  think about how people respond to inequality, the existential threat of
*  climate crisis, of a whole host of matters and think about this is a mode of
*  political contestation.
*  I mean, it's a violent one.
*  It's one I condemn.
*  It is evil, right?
*  But these are people that are trying to be political.
*  They're trying to change things in some way.
*  It's not narrowly about like, I don't know, impose Sharia law on you.
*  You know, you must wear a veil.
*  You must eat this kind of food.
*  It's not that parochial.
*  But one, another quick thought about your interesting claim about charisma in
*  this, I think that the one self-limiting feature of this subculture is that
*  definitely, you know, I mentioned the enigma of not wanting to be seen and that
*  the kind of invisibility is a productive force of a power, you know, which a
*  colleague of mine who knows ancient history far better than I, you know, said
*  that this is, you know, when she looked at Malomar initially or we come up in
*  Laden, I mean, this kind of studied posture of staying in the shadows, you
*  know, is also a source of authority potentially because it, it, it invites
*  the idea, and it's partly dictatorships do as well.
*  I mean, if I said, yeah, that someone's working and maybe it's the, it's the
*  basis for a lot of QAnon or other conspiracy today that someone's working
*  behind the scenes and things are going to go the right way, you can't see it.
*  That's almost preferable because you can kind of feel it.
*  And so not having someone out front can maybe, maybe more effective than having
*  someone out in front constantly.
*  Then the whole, maybe, and then the whole Bin Laden, you know, Malomar thing,
*  like you can't see me or if you look at, you know, Bin Laden's photographs and
*  his video stuff, I mean, he's, he's coy.
*  Uh, some observers have noted that he's kind of effeminate.
*  He doesn't strike this kind of masculine.
*  He's not a Mussolini.
*  He's not a Hitler macho.
*  I'm standing my, dumping my chest.
*  He's not doing the theatrical chin, you know, that theater people
*  tell us is so aggressive.
*  Um, you know,
*  Oh, a chin, what bringing your chin up is.
*  I saw a great, uh, BBC theater person.
*  It was kind of a, it was a makeover show about how to become a better,
*  Oh no.
*  Uh, a powerful, uh, uh, yeah.
*  Leader authoritarian figure.
*  No, just how to, how to like get ahead in life and then, and just, and just
*  like about acting, how you can act differently.
*  Right.
*  So it was, it was a BBC thing.
*  Um, and this woman claimed that, um, you know, sticking your chin out, like a
*  wrestler does, right.
*  Is the most like male to male.
*  I love this kind of most aggressive, hilarious analysis that people have about
*  power.
*  But watch the chin, watch the chin.
*  It's the same as analyzing like in wrestling styles that win or fighting or
*  so on, there's so many ways to do it.
*  The chin.
*  I mean, the, the chin is a, could be interesting verbal gesture.
*  And I, uh, I've watched enough Mussolini footage from my classes to try to pick
*  the right moment and the chin is Mussolini is all about the chin.
*  So, and I have watched human beings and human nature enough to know that there's
*  more to a man, a powerful man than a chin.
*  Yeah, no, no, no.
*  I'm saying, I'm saying it's an act of aggression.
*  I'm not saying it's, it's one of the many tools in the toolkit.
*  Yeah, yeah, sure.
*  So she definitely, it's not all about the chin, but it's, it's a sign.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's what I'm trying to tell you about Ben Laden.
*  I don't think he was deliberate enough with the way he presents himself.
*  What I'm saying about Ben Laden that makes him different from these other
*  characters is that because he played at being the scholar, he played at being a
*  figure of modesty and humility.
*  And that meant that he was often, again, if you watch his visuals, I mean, yes,
*  there's one video of him firing a gun, but if you watch how he moved, how he
*  wouldn't look at people directly, how his face was almost, I mean, he
*  appears to be incredibly shy.
*  He saw spoken, you know, his voice was low.
*  He attempted to be poetic, right?
*  So it wasn't a warrior kind of image that he tried to project of like a tough guy.
*  It was, I'm, I'm demure.
*  I'm humble.
*  I mean, you know, I'm, I'm offering you this message and that, and that the,
*  I think the appeal that he was going for was to see, um, to, you know, to project
*  himself as a scholar, whose knowledge and humility, the whole package carried with
*  it, an authenticity and a valor that would animate, inspire people to commit
*  acts of violence, right?
*  And there's a different kind of like logic of like, go and kill, right?
*  So he, he put, he presented himself in contrast to the imperialist kind of,
*  um, macho power, whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's just yet another way of, uh, and you have to have facial hair or hair
*  of different kindness recognized.
*  We had a very recognizable look to, or at least later in life.
*  Yeah.
*  No, he, he tried to look apart.
*  Um, yeah, yeah.
*  But I'm saying more fortunate that whatever calculation that he was making,
*  he was not more, um, effective yet.
*  I mean, there's the, the world is full of terrorist organizations and we're
*  fortunate to the degree, any one of them does not have an incredibly charismatic
*  leader that attains the kind of power that's very difficult to, to manage
*  at the geopolitical level.
*  Yeah.
*  And we, and we credit the, we credit the publics, you know, who don't, you
*  don't bind to that, right?
*  You see through this.
*  We credit the critics, you know, um, barely on pretty much 9 11 itself.
*  One of the problems was that us government officials kept kind of
*  leaning on Muslims to, to condemn this as if all Muslims shared some collective
*  responsibility or culpability.
*  And in fact, um, dozens of scholars and organizations, hundreds condemn this,
*  but their condemnations never quite made it out, but it created a
*  tension where, you know, if you wore a veil, you must've been one of them
*  and you must be on team bin Laden.
*  And so a lot of the, you know, I think a lot of the popular violence and
*  discrimination and profiling came out of that urge to see a oneness, which,
*  you know, bin Laden projected, right?
*  He wanted to say, we are one community.
*  You know, if you are Muslim, you must be with me.
*  Right.
*  But I think the, that's where the diversity of Muslim communities became
*  important because outside of small pockets, I mean, they
*  didn't, they didn't accept his leadership.
*  Right.
*  People wore t-shirts in some countries.
*  I mean, non-Muslims wore t-shirts cause he was like, he stuck it to the Americans.
*  So in Latin America, people were like, yeah, that was sad, but you know, finally,
*  I mean, there was a kind of schadenfreude in that moment.
*  Yeah.
*  International.
*  It's like Che Guevara or somebody like that.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a character in a Prasad's book.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  It's just a symbol.
*  It's not exactly what he believed or the cruelty of actions he took.
*  Right.
*  It's more like he stood for an idea of revolution versus authority.
*  That's right.
*  And that's, and that's a great way to understand bin Ladenism and the
*  whole phenomenon, but I think looking at the big picture, it's also, you
*  wonder, you know, without ever end, right?
*  I mean, is that, I mean, that's the, the risk of being a kind of
*  hyper power, um, like the U S where you, in, in assisting on a kind of
*  unipolar world in 2001, 2002, 2003, I think that created, um, and
*  almost irresistible target, you know, wherever the U S wanted to exert
*  itself militarily before it would go to the history of Afghanistan, the
*  people, and I just want to talk to you about just some fascinating
*  aspect of the culture.
*  Let's go to the end withdrawal of us troops from Afghanistan.
*  Uh, what are your thoughts on how that was executed?
*  How could it have been done better?
*  Yeah.
*  An important question.
*  I mean, I would preface all this by saying, you know, as I noted,
*  I think the war was a mistake.
*  Um, I had hoped the war would end sooner.
*  I think there were different exit routes all along the way.
*  Again, I think there were lots of policy choices in September, in
*  October, when the war began.
*  Um, there were choices in December, 2001.
*  So we could look at almost every six month stopping point and say,
*  we could have done differently as it turns out though.
*  I mean, the way it played out, um, you know, it's been catastrophic.
*  And I think, um, the Biden administration has remained
*  unaccountable for the scale of the strategic and humanitarian and
*  ethical failure that they're responsible for.
*  Well, okay.
*  Let's lay out the full there's George W.
*  Bush.
*  There's Barack Obama.
*  There's Donald Trump.
*  That's right.
*  There's, uh, Biden.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, so they're all driving this van and these exits and they keep not taking
*  the exits and then running out of gas.
*  I do this all the time thinking, where am I going to pull off?
*  I'll go to the first to those empty.
*  How could it have been done better?
*  And what exactly, um, how much suffering has all the decisions along the way
*  caused one of the long-term consequences?
*  What are the biggest things that concern you about the decisions we've made in
*  both invading Afghanistan and staying in Afghanistan as long as we have?
*  I mean, if we start at the end, as you proposed, um, you know, the
*  horrific scenes of the airport, you know, that was just one, one dimension.
*  Um, I think in the weeks to come, I mean, we're going to see Afghanistan implode.
*  Um, there are lots of signs that malnutrition, hunger, starvation are going
*  to claim tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives this winter.
*  And I think there is really nothing.
*  There's no.
*  Framework in place to forestall that.
*  What is the government?
*  What is currently the system there?
*  What's the role of the Taliban?
*  So there could be tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of starved, uh,
*  either just almost the famine or starved to death.
*  So this is economic implosion.
*  This is political implosion.
*  What, um, what's the system they're like?
*  And what could be the one, you know, some inkling of hope.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  The Taliban sit, sit in control.
*  That's unique when they were in power in 1990s from 1996, 2001, they controlled
*  some 85 to 90% of the country.
*  Now they own it all.
*  Uh, but they have no budget.
*  The Afghan banking system is frozen.
*  So the financial system is a mess.
*  And it's frozen by the U S because the U S is trying to use that lever to exert
*  pressure on the Taliban and so the ethical quandaries are of course, legion.
*  Right.
*  Do you release that money to allow the Taliban to shore up their rule?
*  Right.
*  The Biden administration has said no, but the banks aren't working.
*  Uh, if you're in California, you want to send a hundred dollars to your cousin.
*  So she can buy bread.
*  You can't do that now.
*  It's almost impossible.
*  There are some informal networks that are moving some stuff, but there are bread
*  lines, the Taliban government is incapable.
*  Fundamentally just of ruling.
*  I mean, they, they can discipline people on the street.
*  They can force people into the mosque.
*  They can shoot people.
*  They can beat protesters.
*  They can put out a newspaper.
*  They can have their graded diplomacy.
*  It turns out, uh, they can't rule this country.
*  So essentially the hospitals and the kind of healthcare infrastructure is being
*  managed by NGOs that are international.
*  Um, but.
*  Most people had to leave and the Taliban have impeded some of that work.
*  They've told adult women essentially to stay home.
*  Right.
*  So a big part of the workforce isn't there.
*  So the, I mean, the, the, the supply chain is, you know, is kind of crawling to a halt
*  trade with Pakistan and its neighbors.
*  I mean, it's kind of a transit trade economy.
*  Um, it exports fruits.
*  Pakistan has been closing the border because they're anxious about refugees.
*  They want to exert pressure on the national community to recognize the Taliban
*  because the Pakistan want the Taliban to succeed in power because I see that in
*  Pakistan's national interest, especially to the lens of its rivalry with, with India.
*  So the Pakistan, the Pakistani security institutions are playing a double game.
*  And especially the Afghan people are being held hostage.
*  And so the Taliban are also saying, you know, if you don't recognize us, you're
*  going to let tens of millions of Afghans starve.
*  So to which degree is Taliban like who are the Taliban?
*  What do they stand for?
*  What do they want?
*  Obviously year by year, this changes.
*  So what is the nature of this organization?
*  Can they be a legitimate, peaceful, kind, respectful, uh, government sort of
*  holder of power or, or are they fundamentally not capable of doing so?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the briefest answer would be that they are a clerical slash military
*  organization.
*  Um, they have, this is kind of a imperfect metaphor, but years ago, a German
*  scholar used the term caravan to describe them and that, that has some attractive
*  elements because different people who joined the Taliban for different purposes
*  at different times, but today, and people tell us, you know, scholars who know more
*  about the movement than I have said, listen, the Taliban is this kind of hodgepodge
*  of different actors and people and competing interests.
*  And I think, so we have a lot of scholars that listen that they're, it's polycentric.
*  It's got people in this city and that city and so on.
*  I think actually I was always very skeptical.
*  How do they know this?
*  I mean, this is an organization that doesn't want you to know, um, where
*  that money comes from and so on.
*  But I would say now that we have a clearer picture of what has happened,
*  I'd say they were a astoundingly well-organized clerical military
*  organization that has a very cohesive and enduring ideology, which is quite
*  idiosyncratic if we zoom out and continue the conversation we're having about Islam
*  and how we think about radicalism and who's drawn to what, um, people throw
*  different terms around to describe the Taliban.
*  Some use a term that links it to a kind of school of thought born in the 90th
*  century in India, the Doha Bhandi school.
*  Uh, but if you look at their teachings, it's very clear now, I think that these
*  labels, it's like saying, you know, you're an MIT guy.
*  Well, what does that mean?
*  I mean, MIT is home to dozens of different potentially kinds of
*  intellectual orientations, right?
*  I mean, attaching them to school doesn't quite capture.
*  I mean,
*  it's, it's complicated.
*  I mean, actually MIT is interesting because I would say MIT is different
*  than Stanford, for example.
*  I think MIT has a more kind of narrow, um, bad analogy in my part.
*  Maybe.
*  Well, no, it's interesting because I would argue that there's some aspect of a
*  brand like Taliban or MIT, no relation that has a kind of, uh, interact like
*  the, the brand results in the behavior of the, like enforces a kind of behavior
*  on the people and the people feed the brand.
*  And like, there's a loop.
*  I think Stanford is a good example of something that's more distributed.
*  There's sufficient amount of diversity in like all kinds of like centers and all
*  that kind of stuff that the, the, the, the brand doesn't become one thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, MIT is so engineering.
*  It's, I think, okay, so scratch MIT, the scratch thing for two, because I think
*  Stanford's more like MIT than, than, than you might imagine, but, uh, but isn't
*  Taliban, isn't it pretty, I don't think there's a diversity.
*  So yeah, so sorry.
*  So just to rephrase, so, so people say, oh, the day of bondy school.
*  I'm like, what is that?
*  I mean, but the Taliban are, they're an ethnic movement.
*  They represent a vision of Pashtun power, right?
*  Pashtuns are people who are quite internally diverse, who actually speak
*  multiple dialects of Pashto, who reside across the frontier of Pakistan and
*  Afghanistan, there are Pashtuns who live all over the planet, right?
*  There's a community in Moscow, California, everywhere.
*  Right?
*  So it's a global diaspora of sorts.
*  Pashtuns have a kind of genealogical imagination so that lots of Pashtuns can
*  tell you the names of their grandparents, great grandparents, and so on.
*  That's kind of a, there's a sense of pride in that Pashto language is a kind
*  of core element of that identity, but it's not universal.
*  So for example, you can meet people who say I am Pashtun, but I don't know Pashto.
*  So as you, as you claw away at this idea, it's amorphous.
*  It also means different things, different people at different times.
*  So saying the Taliban are Pashtun requires lots of qualifiers because
*  lots of Pashtuns will say, no, no, I have nothing to the Taliban.
*  I hate those people.
*  You know, so the Taliban tried to mobilize other Pashtuns with limited
*  success, but their core membership is almost exclusively Pashtun.
*  And they say, no, no, we represent Afghans.
*  We represent pious Muslims.
*  And so in recent two, three years, they've gone further to say, no,
*  we have other groups.
*  We have Uzbeks, we have Tajiks.
*  We have Hazaras and in the North of Afghanistan, in recent years, they did
*  do a bit better at drawing in people who were very disaffected because of the
*  government and they were able to diversify their ranks somewhat.
*  But if you watch August 15 and who they've appointed, what language they've
*  used, how they've presented themselves, it's clear that, you know, they are
*  Pashtun, they are male and they are extremely ideologically cohesive.
*  And disciplined, I'd say.
*  Right.
*  So I think that a lot of the polycentrism, blah, blah, some of that stuff was a
*  way to fight a war.
*  They are, they are fundamentally, you know, a guerrilla movement.
*  They see themselves as kind of pious Robin Hoods.
*  The rhetoric is very much about taking from the rich, taking from the privilege,
*  giving to the poor, being on the side of the underdog fighting against evil.
*  And so, I mean, they're, they're, they're bag, if you like their thing, they're,
*  they're central theme, their brand is about public morality.
*  And so their origin story, going back to 1994 is that they interceded, they
*  broke up a gang of criminals who were trying to rape people.
*  And so there's a very interesting kind of like emphasis on like sexuality and on,
*  on public morality and really being the core of like, you know, we're going to
*  restore order and public morality and how that translates into governance.
*  It's something they've never sorted out.
*  I mean, how do you run a banking system?
*  If you're intellectual priorities are really about, you know, the length of a
*  beard and then, and then their path to power and a kind of abstract sense.
*  I mean, a lot of that was very much driven by, if you like, propagating the
*  problems of martyrdom and that sounds, I don't mean to say that in a way that to
*  make it sound ridiculous, make it sound like it's, um, you know, a moral judgment.
*  It's simply, I think a fact, it's a fact of their appeal that they promised young
*  men who have known nothing else, but studying in certain schools, if at all,
*  but they've known fighting and they've known, they've known victimization.
*  And this isn't, I'm not asking for like sympathy for them, but I think the reality
*  is that a lot of the, we know about the kind of foot soldiers is that they, they
*  lost families and bombings, um, in airstrikes in night raids.
*  You know, I mean, orphans have always been a stream, um, living in, in all
*  male society, uh, not knowing girls, not knowing women, hearing things from
*  outside about places like Kabul.
*  And so there's always been this kind of urban rural dimension.
*  It's not, it's not just that, but I think there's a, there's a whole imagination
*  that being Taliban captures and the whole margin of thing is really, it's, um,
*  you know, I think to any religious person, I mean, it's not a, it's not a bizarre
*  idea. I mean, it animates, I mean, so many global traditions, you know, but I think
*  the, but when you try to sell like an army colonel, right, if you were to have a
*  conversation with, you know, a U S Marine about this, I mean, someone get it from
*  their own religious backgrounds, but I think the, it, it's an alien idea, but I
*  think it is essential to kind of stretch out my initials.
*  I'm saying that's, that's attractive.
*  And now one of the dilemmas going forward is that they've got a pivot from
*  martyrdom and some have been, some have told foreign journalists.
*  I mean, it's good that we're in charge now we're going to build a proper state,
*  but I, I, it's kind of boring.
*  Um, I want to keep fighting.
*  I want to, maybe I'll do that in Pakistan.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's nice that they are expressing that thought.
*  So some are not even honest sufficiently with themselves to express that kind of
*  thought. If you're, if you're a fighter, it's a, you see that with a bunch of
*  fighters or professional athletes, once they retire, they don't know it's very,
*  it's boring.
*  And so like the, if the spirit of the Taliban, even the, the, the best version
*  of the Taliban is to fight, is to be martyrs, is to, is to paint the world as
*  good and evil and you're fighting evil and all that kind of stuff.
*  That's difficult to imagine how they can run an education system, a banking
*  system, respect all kinds of citizens who have different backgrounds and religious
*  beliefs and women and all that kind of stuff.
*  So yeah.
*  And they've, they've walked into Kabul and other major cities.
*  Um, you know, some are young, they never, they didn't know those places, but also
*  the very important obstacle for them is that Afghan society has changed.
*  I mean, it's, it's not what even for the older guys, it's not what they knew in
*  the 1990s.
*  Um, some always had some ambivalence about, you know, the capital, but now it's
*  totally different.
*  I mean, they've been shocked to see, I think to me, one of the most striking
*  features of the last few weeks has been that, you know, women have come out on
*  the streets and have stood in their faces and said, you know, we demand rights, we
*  demand education, we demand employment.
*  And, um, these foot soldiers are, are paralyzed.
*  They're not sure.
*  They don't know what to do with women period.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And they don't know what to do with being yelled at.
*  And having someone stick their fingers in their faces, I mean, this is not, not
*  what they've imagined.
*  And so I think, and at this, at this juncture, there are still foreign cameras
*  around, so they have committed acts of violence against women, against
*  journalists, they've beaten people.
*  They've disappeared people, even with cameras around, even in this tense period.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think that when the cameras, you know, retreat and that that's not going
*  to happen, it's going to get much worse.
*  I think so that the challenge now is, you know, can the Taliban rule?
*  And, and then this is where the diplomacy is important because the Taliban can't
*  rule in isolation and they know that.
*  And part of the success is due to the fact that they were, they became very good
*  at talking to other people in the last, I mean, it's been building for the last
*  decade, but that's the last five years.
*  And they always had Pakistan's backing.
*  And so the Taliban are, we noted their military force, very effective guerrilla
*  force, they beat, they beat NATO.
*  I mean, this is still hasn't sunk in.
*  I mean, the fact that they, with light arms, using suicide attacks, using minds,
*  improvised explosive devices, machine guns, and some, you know, recent years,
*  they got sniper rifles and, you know, from the summer, they got American
*  equipment on a broad scale, right?
*  They have airplanes.
*  They have a lot that they will be able to use eventually.
*  So, but still, basically it's a story of AK-47s, some American small arms and
*  mines, so it's very hoochie men, very old school guerrilla fighting, right?
*  And they defeated the most powerful military alliance in world history,
*  probably.
*  So that has not yet sunk in and what that means for American and global politics.
*  And now they're trying to rule, right?
*  They know they need international support and their most consistent back
*  has been Pakistan, who sees them as an extension of Pakistani power.
*  You know, and this is very important for a Pakistani elite that, of course,
*  is looking toward India.
*  They want to have their rear covered, right?
*  They want to make sure that these postures don't cause trouble for Pakistan.
*  And they like, I mean, for some of the security forces, they like this vision of
*  the Islamic state that the Taliban are building there because they, those are not
*  so distant from their views of what Pakistan should be.
*  But the Taliban have been smart enough to kind of diversify their potential
*  international allies.
*  So everyone in the neighborhood has wanted the US to leave, right?
*  If we go back to 2001, there were Iranian and American special forces in the north
*  working together against the Taliban to displace them using, you know, Iranian,
*  American, and then Afghan resistance forces against the Taliban.
*  And that was a real moment of repression.
*  If we go back to the missed exits, the relationship with Iran could have been
*  different at that moment, but the US under George W. Bush, you know, devised this
*  axis of evil language, put them together with their enemy, Iraq and then North
*  Korea, all that went south.
*  That was the most opportunity.
*  But in recent years, the Taliban in Iran have kind of papered over the
*  differences.
*  They allowed the Taliban to open some offices on Iranian territory, likely
*  shared some resources, some intelligence, some sophisticated weaponry.
*  And then the Taliban went to Moscow and for the Putin administration, you know,
*  they've long been worried that, you know, they see the Taliban as a kind of, you
*  know, disease that will potentially move north.
*  In fact, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,
*  and maybe creep into Russia's sphere of influence.
*  Maybe that's why they have, you know, a bunch of troops sitting in Tajikistan.
*  I mean, the one, you know, forward base that Russia as well has in Central Asia
*  is in Tajikistan.
*  And so the Taliban were always, you know, a worrying point, but also useful
*  because they could say, well, you know, in case the Taliban get out of control,
*  we need to be here.
*  And so Tajikistan said, okay, you know, you're helping secure us.
*  And yes, it impinges upon our sovereignty, but it's okay, you know.
*  So Putin said, you know, let's, you know, give another black eye to the Americans
*  and let's treat the Taliban as if they're the kind of government in waiting.
*  Let's have them come to Moscow multiple times.
*  This summer, you know, for the last year or two, they've been talking to China, right?
*  So the photographs of senior Taliban figures going from their office in Qatar,
*  which was a major blow to the US-backed government, the fact that they were able
*  to open up an office in Qatar that at one point began to fly a flag of the Islamic
*  Emirate of Afghanistan that basically said we're a state in the waiting.
*  And as the US-backed Afghan government failed and failed and failed at ruling too, right?
*  As they showed how corrupt they were.
*  And as they really alienated more and more Afghans by committing acts of violence
*  against them, by stealing from them, by, you know, basically creating a kind of
*  kleptocracy, right?
*  The Taliban said we are pure, we are not corrupt.
*  And look at us, we're winning on the battlefield internationally.
*  Look, we're talking to China.
*  We're talking to Putin, we're talking to China.
*  We're a legitimate, powerful center of central Asia.
*  And also kind of, you know, hinting that, you know, we, oh, we have a website.
*  I mean, the whole digital angle is amazing because they began to, and this is important
*  actually, they had a website which grew more and more sophisticated.
*  Again, after having shot televisions and these kind of ceremonial killings of these
*  infidel devices, right?
*  They said we have a government, we have commissions, we have a complaint line.
*  They lifted all this technocratic language that you get from any UN document, you know,
*  about good governance and all that kind of, you know, generic language that the NGO world
*  has produced for us, right?
*  In English, they reproduced that in five languages on their Taliban website.
*  And of course, I'm not saying anyone believed this, but it was like, you know, just put
*  me in, coach, you know, I know the playbook.
*  I know how to run a government and look, we have an agricultural commission.
*  We have, you know, a taxation system.
*  And again, this idea, and then on the ground, they had their own law courts and they would
*  creep into a district, assassinate some people, the local authority figures, the men of influence,
*  talk to local clerics, either get them on board or kill them and say, you know, this state is
*  corrupt, but we're bringing you justice.
*  This is our calling card.
*  We're bringing public morality and justice.
*  And then to a broader world, they said, you know, yeah, things didn't go perfectly,
*  a whole al-Qaeda thing, you know, you know, we should do over on that.
*  We're not going to let anyone hurt you from our territory.
*  We just want to rule and people like us and look.
*  And so if we look at the neighborhood, Iran, even the Central Asian states after a while,
*  recognizing they could make some money.
*  I mean, one of the one thing that Uzbekistan likes about the current arrangement or they're not
*  hostile to is that they have all these contracts.
*  They can potentially make some money from, you know, the pipeline dream remains alive,
*  running natural gas oil to, you know, which is the Indian Ocean to markets, you know,
*  beyond Central Asia.
*  It's sitting on a couple of trillion dollars, probably in mineral resources that
*  China would love to have, of course.
*  And so people looking at Afghanistan now after 20 years saying, you know, under American rule,
*  it was a basket case, right?
*  There was immense human suffering, incredibly violent.
*  The world did not start counting civilian casualties in Afghanistan until 2009.
*  And we think about that.
*  The war went on for eight years.
*  The Taliban were never really defeated.
*  They just went to Pakistan.
*  They went to the mountains, they went to the woods.
*  And so all these different American operations, as you noted, under Bush, Obama, Trump, and so on,
*  killed countless civilians.
*  The US never accounted for that.
*  We never, we never even counted.
*  Trump escalated the civilian casualties by escalating the air war.
*  But a lot of this was like very ugly on the ground, you know, night raid stuff.
*  Where you drop into a hamlet and massacre people.
*  And then, you know, honest about what happened, right?
*  So that dynamic continued to fuel the growth of Taliban from below.
*  So the foot soldiers, they never ran out of foot soldiers.
*  I mean, the US and its allies killed tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands
*  of Taliban fighters over the last 20 years.
*  But they just sprouted up again.
*  And part of that was kind of solidarity culture, the male bonding of martyrology,
*  of martyrdom, and of revenge, and a sense of the foreign invader.
*  I've heard, I mean, I haven't taught a ton of US military people, but through the Hoover,
*  they put officers in our classes sometimes and met a few wonderful army and marine officers who
*  I really enjoyed.
*  We came from the South like me, always had great rapport with them.
*  And they expressed a range of opinions about this.
*  I think that I learned a lot from someone who said, yeah, I mean, I get why they hate us.
*  I get why they're still fighting because last week we just killed 14 of their fellow villagers.
*  So the officers, the guys on the ground, fighting this war, we're not stupid about that.
*  I mean, they got the human dimension of that, and yet no one got off the exit, as you said.
*  People kept driving.
*  But going forward now, internationally, it's critical that they have,
*  and they've had meetings.
*  I mean, what the Taliban have done since August 15th is a lot of diplomacy.
*  They've had meetings, they've had people, they've had Tashkent come,
*  they've had Beijing come, they've had Moscow come.
*  I mean, they've had major visits from Islamabad, from security people, from diplomatic circles.
*  And they're counting on things being different this time.
*  I mean, the first time around, the only people who backed the Taliban by recognition,
*  giving them diplomatic recognition, were the Saudis, Pakistanis, and the UAE.
*  And because of Al-Qaeda, because of opium, because of some of the human rights stuff,
*  the US pushed everyone to like, let's not recognize the state.
*  Even though the US did, I mean, Colin Powell famously, in the summer of 2001,
*  we did give a few grants and aid to the Taliban.
*  As I kind of like massaging negotiations, they kept talking about bin Laden,
*  but they also wanted them to stop opium production.
*  I mean, Afghanistan throughout all this period we've talked about
*  is the global center of opium production.
*  I mean, over the years, more and more of the Afghan economy continued to today
*  is devoted to the opium trade.
*  Which is the thing that leads to heroin, some of the painkillers.
*  And even if Afghan poppies don't make it to Hoboken, they are not the source of American deaths.
*  They are part of a universal market, a global market, which I think any economist will tell
*  you is part of the story of our opium problem.
*  Something I read maybe a decade ago now, and I just kind of looked it up again
*  to bring it up to see your opinion on this, is a 2010 report by the International Council
*  on Security and Development that showed that 92% of Afghans in Helmand and Kandahar province
*  know nothing of the 9-11 attacks on US in 2001.
*  Is this at all representative of what you know? Is this possible?
*  So basically, put another way, is it possible that a lot of Afghans don't even know
*  the reason why there may be troops or the sort of American provided narrative for why there's troops,
*  American soldiers, and American drones overhead in Afghanistan.
*  Right. I mean, my gut response, not knowing the details of this actual poll, is that that's a
*  very unhelpful way to think about how Afghans relate to the world.
*  And I think it could be, if you go to my hometown in North Kiana, if you knock on some doors,
*  you may meet people who don't know all kinds of things. I could probably walk around this
*  neighborhood here in California and there'd be all kinds of people who don't know all kinds of things.
*  Kyrie Irving apparently thinks the earth is flat. I mean, so we could make a lot of
*  certain kinds of ignorance, I think. But I think what I would say, and then there's also a companion
*  point maybe that in thinking about the withdrawal, the collapse, the return of the Taliban,
*  there's been a big conversation about what Afghans think of us really. And this famous
*  piece in The New Yorker was about how many people liked the Taliban, that many women interviewed,
*  supposedly, in this piece, were sympathetic because they'd lost family members and all the
*  violence. And the idea was that we haven't thought about that at all when in fact,
*  of course, we have and lots of people have. But I think if you're just dropping into the conversation,
*  if you look at the immediate arc of coverage of Afghanistan in the United States, I mean,
*  the arc went from lots of coverage during, of course, 9-11 and its aftermath,
*  lots of coverage during Obama's surge, and then quickly dropped down. The last decade has been
*  almost nothing. So if you ask the same question about Americans or other Americans, I'm not sure
*  what they would say to you, what percentage would actually know why the US is in X, Y, or Z either.
*  But again, the Afghan side, just to return to that for a moment, I think that we can fetishize
*  these provinces. They are a place where Taliban support has been greatest, also where there's been
*  the most violence, where the Americans have been most committed to trying to root out the Taliban
*  movement. This is Hellman and Kanaan. Exactly. In the South. What are the other parts in the South
*  of Afghanistan? Yeah, it's mostly Pashtun, not exclusively, but mostly Pashtun, mostly rural.
*  What is Pashtun? That's the other group that the Taliban claim to represent.
*  What other groups are there? Yeah. Okay, sorry. Yeah, sorry. So in cities, you'll find
*  everything that is in Afghanistan. You'll find Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras. These are people who,
*  Uzbek is a Turkic language. Most Uzbeks live in Uzbekistan, but they
*  form majorities in some northern parts of the city. I'm sorry, of the country of Afghanistan.
*  But what I emphasize is that, and you can find online an ethnographic map of Afghanistan,
*  and you'll see green where Pashtuns live, red where Hazaras live, orange where Uzbeks live,
*  purple where Tajiks live. Then there are a bunch of other smaller groups of different kinds. There
*  are Noristanis, there are Baluch, there are different religious communities, there are Sunni,
*  Shia, different kinds of Shia. What are the key differences between them? Is it religious basis
*  from the origins of where they immigrated from? And how different are they?
*  Yeah. So they're all indigenous, I think. There's a kind of mythology that some groups have been
*  there longer, right? So they have a greater claim to power. But historically, I mean, it's like,
*  ethnic groups anywhere, people have different narratives about themselves. But many Pashtuns
*  would tell you, not all, but many would say, we are the kind of state builders of Afghanistan.
*  The dynasty that ruled much of the space, that was born in the mid 18th century, that ruled until
*  1973, more or less, generalizing, was a Pashtun dynasty. The Taliban have definitely said,
*  to some audiences, we are the rightful rulers, because we are Pashtun.
*  The trick though is, I don't mean to be evasive, but just to give some complexity,
*  one quick answer as well, the majority is minorities. I mean, one finds out a lot along
*  with those maps. But I would say, suspend any firm belief in that, because that could be entirely
*  wrong. In fact, there's never been a modern sense of Afghanistan. So when journalists say,
*  Pashtuns are the majority, or they're the biggest group, I would say, not so fast.
*  I would say, not so fast, because of migration is one major issue. No major modern census.
*  Actually, the Soviets got pretty close, but didn't quite find something comprehensive,
*  and didn't publicize it, knowing that modern times, ethnicity can be the source of political
*  mobilization. It's not innately so, but it's been part of the story. But then you have mixed
*  families. So a lot of people you'll encounter in the diaspora and around. I mean, well,
*  I am, my one parent is Tajik, one is Pashtun. Or I'm Pashtun, as I mentioned before, but I don't
*  speak Pashto. Or I am Hazara, but you read about us as Shi'i Hazaras, in fact, I'm a Sunni Hazara.
*  Or I'm a secular Hazara, or I'm an atheist Hazara. I mean, everything's possible.
*  Right? One of my friends, if he were here, he'd say, I'm Kabuli. I'm from Kabul. So
*  if you think about it in Russian terms, it means a lot if you're a Muscovitch,
*  if you're from Bisset or Muscovah, I mean, you know.
*  Yeah. Well, you can hear there's Bostonians, Texans, Californians.
*  Yeah, East Coast, West Coast, all that stuff. Those are all part of the mix here. So you ask
*  about Kandahar and Helmand, then I would say, yeah, if you go out to a pomegranate field,
*  you'll meet a guy who may reckon time differently from you and me, who may not be literate,
*  he may not have ever had a geography lesson. But if you go one door over, you may meet a guy
*  who, you know, whose life path has taken him to live in six countries. He may speak five languages.
*  And these are all things I'm not saying they're all these are just because people have money,
*  you can go fly around. I mean, they're people who are displaced by war from late 1970s, right?
*  Even already in the early 70s, people were traveling by the tens of thousands to Iran,
*  as labor migrants. And once you get to Iran, once you get to Pakistan, once you get to Uzbekistan,
*  you then connect to all kinds of cosmopolitan cultures. In fact, I think one of the themes of
*  the book that you may or may not have read, it may put you to sleep, you know, Afghan Modern was
*  about conceptualizing Afghanistan as a cosmopolitan place where for centuries people
*  went on the move and trade in this area. You think of, you know, I think this mischaracterization of
*  places like Helmand and Kandahar, you fly in, or you're part of a Marine battalion,
*  and you see people there and they look different. And I think in our imagination,
*  if I can generalize, you know, they look like they've been there for millennia, right? The dress,
*  the whatever, right? You think of technology, you think of the mud compounds and so on. You think of,
*  you know, animal drawn transportation, that kind of stuff, right? Or the motorbike, right, at most,
*  is what they have. But in fact, if you follow those families, their trade has taken them
*  to Northern India for centuries, right? The trade has connected them to cosmopolitan centers. You
*  know, say they have a scholar in the family, that scholar may have studied all over the Middle East,
*  South Asia, right? You know, the ancestors may have been horse traders who went all the way to
*  Moscow, right? I mean, we have the historical records of all these people traveling across
*  Eurasia, pursuing all kinds of livelihoods. And so Afghanistan is this paradox of visually looking
*  remote and looking like it's kind of stuck in time. But the family trajectories and the current
*  trajectories are astoundingly cosmopolitan and mobile. And so, and a conception of being a world
*  center is also quite strong. So, you know, another way to frame that question about like,
*  do they know about 9-11 would be like, why should we know about 9-11? Because we are at the center
*  of something important, right? We are the center of Asia. We are the heart of Asia. We have a kind
*  of historic greatness. We are, you know, a proud culture of our own achievements, right? So we're
*  not worried about that, right? That said, I mean, sure, there are different narratives about why
*  Americans are there, why people are being killed. You know, of course you'd find, you know, they
*  want to convert us. You know, they want our gold. They want our opium. They want X, Y, and Z, right?
*  There was a recent story about a Taliban official sitting in an office in Kabul and a journalist
*  asked him, can you find in this rotating globe, find your country, find where we're sitting right
*  now. And he was filmed not being able to do it. And so a lot of, you know, racists, Afghans,
*  the diaspora were saying, you know, ha ha, look at this. And that exists. I mean, I think
*  I could go to my Stanford classroom and there'd be a lot of kids who wouldn't know where Afghanistan
*  is too, right? But I wouldn't use those metrics to suggest that this is a place that doesn't have a
*  sense of its place in the world and of geopolitics. I think if anything, being a relatively small
*  country in a very complicated neighborhood, I mean, everybody, every cab driver, I mean, people have,
*  I mean, you know, this is where America is different because I don't think Americans have
*  this sense. You know, we're talking about Moscow and stuff. I think, you know, Moscow cab drivers,
*  I think a lot of them are going to tell you like what's happening in the world and why, right?
*  And it's just part of, it's part of their thing, right? You can find that in Ghana,
*  you can find that in Mexico City, right? You find that lots of places. So I think
*  Afghans are part of a very sophisticated kind of mapping of the world and where they fit in.
*  And a lot of them remarkably had done it firsthand, which is what struck me so much. And,
*  you know, relaying my experiences from the 1990s and Tashkent places that these guys had already
*  lived in more countries than I'd ever been. They already knew half those languages. I mean,
*  this one friend's Russian was impeccable. And of course it helped. They had Russian girlfriends.
*  They had, you know, they mixed with the police. They had run-ins. I mean, they,
*  this wasn't something you got from a book, right? This was like hard knock life. I mean, one friend
*  was from a wealthy family in the trading diaspora and he was imprisoned. I mean,
*  they sent him to prison in Pakistan and he talks about how he started like running,
*  running the jail, you know, taking cigarettes to people, doing little things and kind of, you know,
*  these are not stories of like, oh, I went to, I went to Harvard and so I'm so learned because of
*  this. I mean, it's a, it's a whole range of experiences. The interesting thing is the
*  survey is the survey and it doesn't reflect ignorance as you're saying perhaps,
*  but it may reflect a different geopolitical view of the world than the West has. So if,
*  you know, for a lot of the world, 9-11 was one of the most important moments of recent human history.
*  And for Afghanistan to not to know that, especially when they're part of that story,
*  means they have a very different, like there could be a lot of things said.
*  One is the spread of information is different. The channels of the way information is spread
*  and two, the things they care about, maybe they see themselves
*  in as part of a longer arc of history with the bickering of these superpowers. They seem to want
*  to go to the moon or not as important as the big sort of arc that's been the story of Afghanistan.
*  It is, you know, that's an interesting idea, but it's still a bit, if at all representative
*  of the truth, it's heartbreaking that they're not, do not see themselves as an active player
*  in this game between the United States and Central Asia, because they're such a critical player.
*  Obviously, in many ways, get the short end of the stick in this whole interaction with
*  invasion of Afghanistan for many years and then this rushed withdrawal of troops and now the
*  economic collapse and it's sad in some ways. AC It's true. I mean, another way to put it is this.
*  I mean, yeah, there's a range of knowledge and you're right, the information flows are
*  peculiar to different geographies and histories and stuff. I think that, you know,
*  plucking out one sample from some fairly remote area from one, like follow the agricultural products.
*  I mean, this is where, you know, I think urban-rural divides used to mean a lot more
*  in the 19th century, right? So a lot of like the nuts and bolts of history is about conceiving of
*  these kinds of distinctions, you know, but I think that if one has the privilege of traveling a bit,
*  you see that like urban areas are fed by rural hinterlands and if you look, think of who actually
*  brings the bread, the milk, you know, the pomegranates and so on, it creates these networks
*  and then, you know, mobility channels, information and so on. But yeah, but your broader point about
*  like the tragedy of this, I guess if I can quote a brain student of mine, an African American woman
*  who just received her PhD, who's now, you know, a doctor, he's a great scholar. You know, we've done
*  several events now trying to just think through what's happened and,
*  of course, she's very emotionally affected by it and she continues to ask a really great question.
*  If I can get her phrasing right, you know, if you think of the cycle of like the Taliban being
*  in power in 2001 in the way in which that affected women in particular, you know, half African,
*  half of the society, right? Then you think of this 20 year period of violence and, you know,
*  missed exits, right? And repeated tragedy that also it created a space. I mean, it created a space
*  for a whole generation, I'd say generationally, it created a sense, a space for people to realize
*  something new. I think so we have to attend to the dynamism of the society, right? So yeah,
*  this happened mostly in Kabul, other big cities, Mazar Sharif, Herat and Kandahar. But you can't
*  limit your analysis to that because things like radio, television, everyone got a TV channel.
*  There's a wonderful documentary called Afghan Star that I recommend to your listeners and viewers
*  that it's about a singing show, a singing contest show. But you see just for some things about like
*  connections. I mean, it's a show by an independent television network that did drama, it did
*  kind of infomercials for like men and huge American investment in it. So it wasn't politically
*  neutral, but it did talk shows, did all kinds of stuff. But it did the singing show that became
*  incredibly popular, modeled upon the British American, you know, American Idol kind of stuff,
*  you know, and you can vote. So it had a kind of democratic practice element. But it's fascinating
*  to see that, you know, people hooked up generators to televisions and watch this, you know, you think
*  of like literacy rates, literacy rates are imperfect. And, you know, people who study, you know,
*  medieval modern Europe talk about how, yeah, no one could read. And there weren't many books. But if
*  someone had a book, it'd be read aloud to a whole village potentially or gathering. So there was
*  much, you know, some of these metrics don't get what people actually perceive as information or
*  exposure, because there's a magnifying power of open spaces and hearing radio in group settings,
*  seeing television group settings, having telephone, you know, cheap telephones, which then
*  become an access point to the world and social media. Right. So all this stuff swept across
*  African society as it did elsewhere, you know, in the last decade or more. So African society became,
*  you know, in important ways, really connected to everything going on. And so you see that reflected
*  politically in what people wanted. So you had some people obviously back to return to the Taliban.
*  Some people wanted the status quo, but increasingly many more people wanted something else.
*  And one of the great failures was to expose people to democracy,
*  but only give them the rigged version. And so the US and the State Department in particular,
*  continue to double down on faked elections for the parliament and for the presidency in Afghanistan.
*  What kind of elections?
*  Faked fraudulent elections for parliament and for president in Afghanistan again and again,
*  from the very beginning. And those elections were partly theater for the US,
*  like for remaining on the road that you're describing, right? For not deviating,
*  for not exiting, because we were building democracy there. In reality, the US government knew it was
*  never really building democracy there. It was establishing control. And elections were one
*  means to gather control, right? But then you had on the ground, especially among young people,
*  going to university, having experiences that were denied to them before, they took these
*  problems seriously. So part of the disillusionment that we see today is that they believed what the
*  US told them, that they're constructing democracy. And of course, you know,
*  cynics like us may have been thinking, well, you're not really doing that. You're backing fraud.
*  They believed it when they were younger. And now they're actually smart enough to understand
*  that it's a farce. But indirectly had the consequence of actually working.
*  And that it taught the young, over a period of 20 years, young folks to believe that democracy is
*  possible and then to realize what democracy is not. Exactly. That's a beautiful side. But now look at
*  us. Now it's November. And so this whole period, and I wouldn't say, I wouldn't cast the last
*  20 years, if we're looking at all the achievements, I wouldn't put them in an American tally sheet,
*  like, oh, this is something we should pat ourselves on the back for. I think that
*  much has happened actually against what the Americans wanted. I mean, the kind of
*  free thinking, democracy wanting. I mean, even like, yeah, we could point out on the religious
*  sphere. I mean, the African religious landscape became very pluralistic.
*  Lots of young people wanted a different kind of secular politics. But the old guard who wanted
*  the status quo and wanted something that they fought for in the 1980s, tended to still get
*  American backing as the political leads. They still tended to monopolize political power.
*  So all that stuff was happening in different ways. I mean, the Americans established this
*  American university of Afghanistan, which is, I think, one of the best things the US did there.
*  And I regret that the US didn't fund 20 more, you know, sprinkling them across the country,
*  making them accessible to people because it was, you know, again, it wasn't an engine of
*  Americanization. It was just opportunity. And so the thirst for higher education is really
*  extraordinary. It was never really met. The US tended to put money in primary education,
*  which much of that too was fraudulent. But so you have all this interesting dynamism. You have,
*  you know, the arts, you have a critical space. I mean, I call it a public sphere and the classic
*  European sense, you know, the Afghans made of their own. And again, it wasn't Americanization.
*  It wasn't imposed. It was something that Afghans built across generations, but really with a
*  firm foundation among youth who wanted, importantly, a multi-ethnic Afghan society.
*  You asked about Pashtuns and that kind of stuff. And a lot of that language in recent years was,
*  they were aware that the US-backed government was playing ethnic politics and trying to kind of put
*  people on the blocks and mobilize people based on their ethnic identity. And there was a younger
*  cohort of people who said, you know, we are Afghan. And then there was interesting social media stuff
*  where people would say, I am Hazara, but I'm also Tajik. I'm also Uzbek. I mean, it was a way of
*  creating a multi-ethnic Afghan national identity that embraced everything. I mean, very utopian,
*  you know, super utopian, right? But symbolically, it was very important that they rejected
*  being mobilized politically, you know, voting as a Hazara or voting is whatever. And of course,
*  there were communities who wanted to vote as that ethnic community. But there are also people who
*  said, you know, let's put a kind of civic nationalism first, one that accommodates
*  ethnic pluralism in a way that rejected the kind of majoritarian politics of one ethnic group
*  dominating the thing. So all this stuff was quite interesting. I mean, women were asserting themselves
*  across multiple spheres. Of course, it remained patriarchal. Of course, there were struggles. Of
*  course, there was violence. Of course, you know, there's no utopia. But the door on all that shut
*  on August 15. So to go back to the quote that I wanted to offer from the student, now professor,
*  was that, you know, in trying to make sense of this, and you mentioned the tragic
*  arc here, you think of the 20 years, like, she asked you, why did you go to war in our country?
*  Basically, why did you do this to us for 20 years when this was never about us? You know,
*  you never asked us if you wanted to come. You never asked us what you wanted to build here.
*  You didn't ask us when you were coming. And you didn't ask us when you're leaving. You just did
*  this all on your own. And we tried to make the most of it. And then you pulled the rug out from under
*  us, you know, at the 11th hour and returned to power, partly by diplomacy. It wasn't, at the end,
*  just a military loss. I mean, it was a series of diplomatic decisions. I mean, the idea you asked
*  about alternatives, I mean, giving up Bagram, I mean, holding to the timeline. I mean, the Biden
*  people did not need to hold to the Doha agreement that Trump had signed. I mean, every American
*  president writes his or her own foreign policy, right? So the Biden administration acted as if,
*  and they tried to convince us that their hands were tied. And that it was either this or
*  21 years of war or some absurd kind of, you know, false alternative. But I think that's
*  important for American audiences to hear that, you know, they're like, you came here to experiment.
*  You came here to punish. You came here to kind of reassert, you know, your dominance, the world
*  stage, you know, to work out the fear and hurt of 9-11 that we talked about, which was so real,
*  you know, and palpable. And it's important for American politics since then. Like you did,
*  you worked out your problems, you know, on us, on our territory. And now what do we have for it?
*  You know, and then the people who had a stake in that system, imperfect as it was,
*  have been desperate to leave. And so this, I don't know how much people are aware of this, but,
*  you know, I'm a scholar. I work in California. You know, I have friends. I edit a journal on
*  Afghanistan. And, you know, but I'm not a politician. I'm not a soldier. But people assume that,
*  you know, Afghans have been desperately trying to reach me and anyone who is kind of on the
*  radar as an American to help get them out. You know, that's the kind of like, you know,
*  the symbol of voting with your feet, you know, is quite powerful. I mean, they,
*  there's a huge swath of society that doesn't want the system and is literally living in terror about
*  it. And actually women, you know, I mean, especially women of a certain age, I mean,
*  they feel like their lives are over. I mean, there is an epidemic of suicide.
*  They feel betrayed and some people have done some good things in getting people out. You know, I
*  mean, some, you know, the US military vets have been, you know, at the forefront of
*  working to get out people, you know, that they know they owe. But the US government doesn't
*  want these people. I mean, they have created all these obstacles to allowing a safety valve for
*  people to leave. Looking forward from a perspective of leadership, how do we avoid these kinds of
*  mistakes? So obviously some interests, some aspects of human nature led to this war.
*  How do we resist that in the future? I guess beyond my moral and intellectual capacity,
*  I'll just say this. I mean, looking at it again, looking at it from my home ground as the university
*  and I think of the intellectual, you know, ways of thinking that I think students should develop
*  for themselves as citizens, right? And maybe that's where to start is like historical thinking.
*  I mean, these are all, you know, I try to tell people, you know, if you want to do robotics,
*  computer science, you'd be a doctor, whatever. You should study history. Yeah. I mean, you don't
*  have to be an historian like me and it's, you know, my job isn't perfect. My profession is
*  deeply flawed, right? But as I get older, I'm like, there are fewer and fewer historians actually
*  like, you know, want to hang out with and stuff. So it's like, I'm not offering myself as like a
*  model for anything, but you know, whether you're a, you know, you carry the mail or you're a brain
*  surgeon, whatever. I mean, I think it's a way of civic engagement and the way of like, you know,
*  ethical being in the world that we need to familiarize ourselves with because if you're
*  an American or if you're from a rich country, you know, you need to be aware of your effect
*  on an industry-focused world. You can't say anymore that you don't know or care what's happening in
*  Afghanistan or really circle the globe and point to a place. I mean, we're all connected and we're
*  all, we have ethical obligations. That's one place to start. I would just say this though,
*  and this is a lot for self-critique and that is so much of my teaching in like the themes of my
*  research have been about empire, you know, how big States work not only on big territories like
*  the Russian empire and Soviet Union and stuff, but the way in which power often, you know,
*  is projected beyond those boundaries in ways that we don't see. So this is where things like
*  neoliberalism or just, you know, if you want to take capitalism or just things that, you know,
*  the idea of humanity or of liberalism or of humanitarianism, ideas that move beyond
*  state boundaries are all things that we think about as affecting power in some ways that
*  that often harm people, right? So I think part of, as I've seen my job so far is to think about,
*  you know, building upon the work of my people in grad school and, you know, scholars have affected
*  me. I mean, you know, we're all concerned with how power works and its effects and trying to
*  be attuned to understanding things that aren't visible, right? That we should be thinking about,
*  that should be known to us and as scholars, we can hopefully play some useful role in showing
*  effects that aren't, you know, obvious initially. So empire is a framework to think about this.
*  And so you think about evading foreign countries. Obviously, if you're a scholar of empire,
*  you've seen what that looks like and that's horrific, right? You look at things like racism
*  as one of the ideological pillars of empire. You know, that's horrific, it must be critiqued,
*  it must be, you know, we must be educated against. Some of the, you know, gender exploitation of
*  empire is also something to highlight, you know, to rectify and so on. You know, to be moral beings,
*  we need to think about past inequality and the legacies of violence and destruction that live on.
*  I mean, living in the Americas, I mean, look at, you know, we're all on stoned land. We're all in
*  the sense living with the fruits of genocide and slavery and all those things that are hard to
*  come to terms with, right? But the last few months in Afghanistan and thinking about empire,
*  I think made me more humble when I read people who say, to put it simply, have taken some joy
*  in this moment saying like, well, the Americans got kicked out of Afghanistan. You know, if you're
*  against empire, this is a good thing. This is a kind of victory of anti-colonial.
*  You could see from the perspective of Afghanistan that America is not some kind of place that has
*  an ideal of freedom and all the kinds of things that we Americans tell ourselves. But it's more,
*  America has the ideal of empire, that there's one place that has the truth and everybody else
*  must follow this truth. And so from a perspective of Afghanistan, it could be a victory against
*  this idea of centralized truth of empire. That's another way to tell this story. And then in that
*  sense, it's a victory. And in that sense also, I mean, you push back against this somewhat,
*  this idea of Afghanistan as the graveyard of empires.
*  Right. Right. And I'll say this, I'll say, you know, I mean, it's, I mean,
*  I'm a critic of empire. I mean, you know, colonialism is a political phenomenon that
*  stays with us. And I think, you know, we need scholars to point to the way in which it still
*  works and still does harm. But it's part of being an empire that you can just get up and leave a
*  place, right? That you can remake its politics on one day. And then because it fails to advance
*  your agenda at one moment, you simply walk away. I mean, you know, we can point to other moments.
*  I mean, 1947 on the subcontinent, you know, the way that the British withdrew played a significant
*  role in mass violence, you know, that accompanied partition. It wasn't all the actions of the British
*  that, you know, dictated that, right? There were lots of actors who chose to pick up, you know,
*  the knife to kill their neighbor and so on. I mean, there's lots of agency in that moment.
*  As there is now in what's happening in Afghanistan. But I think the capriciousness, I mean,
*  the ability to act as if your political decisions about others' lives, you know,
*  are something that can be made, you know, in secret. They can be made willy-nilly. They really
*  are beyond the accountability, you know, of those who are actually going to live with the consequences
*  of shifting the cards on a deck in a way that decides who rules and who doesn't.
*  I would love to hear your conversation with somebody I just talked to, which is Neil Ferguson,
*  who argues on the topic of empire that you can also zoom out even further and say,
*  weigh the good and the bad of empire. And he argues, I think he gets a lot of flack for this
*  from other historians that like the British Empire did more good than bad in certain moments
*  of history. And that's an uncomfortable truth. There's like levels. It's a cake with layers of
*  uncomfortable truths. And it's not a cake at all because none of it tastes good.
*  Right. I mean, I would continue to disagree with that for instance. I'm still working out where I
*  am and what this moment does to kind of, I think, qualify my understanding of the past.
*  And I think in a moment of humility, you know, I do. And I'm probably reacting to the kind of,
*  you know, as you put it, I mean, the idea that this is like a good thing that American power
*  has been defeated here. I mean, I do think American power should contract. And I don't think,
*  and again, if I had to create a tally sheet of what the Americans did in the US, I mean,
*  I mentioned the American University of Afghanistan, right? It could have done that
*  without invading the country and killing people. I've not now become an apologist for empire. I'm
*  not now a mini Ferguson, but you know, ending empire is, I mean, it does, how you, those decisions
*  you make are in some ways a continuation of imperial hubris, right? So you're not really out
*  of empire yet. You're not really contracting empire for those who are living it, you know?
*  But I think it's also, I mean, maybe I put it this way, it's be careful what you ask for.
*  You know, I mean, I wanted, I wanted the US out of Afghanistan, but I wanted there to be
*  a political settlement. I wanted, you know, I wanted my cake and I wanted to eat it too, right?
*  I wanted all kinds of things to be different, right?
*  RG But why is going to Afghanistan even needed for that? You can play all those games
*  of geopolitics without ever invading and taking ownership of the place. It feels like the war.
*  AC It's a bit of a issue, yeah. I mean-
*  RG It feels like, I mean, I'm not exactly sure what military force is necessary for,
*  except for targeted, intense attacks. It feels like to me, the right thing to do after 9-11
*  was to show, was a display of force unlike anything the world has ever seen for a very
*  short amount of time. Targeted at, sure, a terrorist, at certain strongholds and so on.
*  RG Yeah.
*  AC And then in and out, and then focus on education, on empowering women to,
*  into the education system, all those kinds of things that have to do with supporting
*  the culture, the education, the flourishing of the place. That has nothing to do with
*  military policing essentially. RG Right.
*  AC I think, yeah, if you look at it through that lens, I mean,
*  if any Afghanistan and then invading Iraq didn't end Al-Qaeda, it didn't end terrorism, right? It
*  didn't really deflate these ideologies entirely. If you like, you could say there were some
*  limited discrediting of certain kinds of ideas. But in fact, I mean, look at the phenomenon of
*  suicide bombing. I mean, it spread. I mean, it was never an Islamic thing. It was never a Muslim
*  thing. Some Muslims adopted it in some places, but the circuits of knowledge about how to do
*  these kinds of things only expanded with the insurgencies that emerged in Afghanistan and
*  Iraq. And then they kind of became connected. And then they became to the present. I mean,
*  the Islamic state is, it's the best thing that happened to the Taliban ever because
*  it's on the basis of its supposed new stance as a counterterrorism outfit that it will get
*  recognition from all its neighbors. It will get recognition from Russia. I mean, already with the
*  evacuation of the airport, the United States was collaborating with the Taliban against the Islamic
*  state and openly talking about the Taliban as if they were partners in this great operation.
*  And then Al-Qaeda remains present in Afghanistan. So-
*  RG Trillions of dollars spent.
*  Yeah.
*  The drones up above bombing places that result in civilian death, the death of children,
*  the death of fathers and mothers, and those stories, even at the individual level, propagate
*  virally across the land, creating potentially more terrorists. And a cynical view of the
*  trillions of dollars is the military industrial complex where there's just a momentum where
*  after 9-11, the feeling like we should do something led to us doing something. And then
*  a lot of people realizing they can make money from doing more of that something. And then it's just
*  the momentum where no one person is sitting there petting a cat in an evil way, saying,
*  we're going to spend all of this money and create more suffering and create more terrorism. But it's
*  just something about the momentum that leads to that. And it to me, honestly, I just, I'm still a
*  sucker. I believe in leadership. I believe in great charismatic leaders and the power of that
*  want to do evil and to do good. And it felt like I honestly put the blame on George Bush, Obama,
*  Trump and Biden for the lack of leadership.
*  Definitely. I agree. And yeah, there is the military industrial complex component, which is
*  huge. And there's also, I mean, speaking of government leadership, it's also, I'd say the
*  imbalance of power within Washington. I mean, the Pentagon used this moment, well, beginning in 2001,
*  I think to assert its authority at the expense of other institutions of national government.
*  I mean, the State Department diplomacy has become a shadow of what it was once capable of doing.
*  And of course, I mean, other historians, US historians, which I'm not formally a historian
*  of the United States, but we can go back to talk about Vietnam. We talk about lots of
*  Cold War and post-Cold War engagements. And I think we need a reckoning about how the United
*  States uses military power, why we devote so much to our military budget and what could be available
*  to us if we had a more sensible view of the value of military power, of its effectiveness.
*  And I think we're willing to hammer home that this is a defeat. I mean, I think there should
*  be accountability. And this could be a kind of opening for a kind of bipartisan conversation,
*  because if you are a kind of American militarist, I mean, you have to look at the leadership that
*  got you to a place where you were defeated by men wearing sandals firing AK-47s, right?
*  Yeah, there should be a humility with that. I mean, we should actually say that, literally.
*  No, we lost. You should say we lost. It wasn't just...
*  The American military lost.
*  Yeah. And I feel I have very mixed feelings and it's, I don't know, a ton of veterans, but I've
*  mentioned I've taught my share and have a student now and they are suffering because they look at
*  the sacrifices that they made that I didn't make. I mean, American society didn't make the
*  sacrifices. I mean, men and women lost limbs, they lost eyes, they lost lives. There's been this,
*  of course, quiet epidemic of suicide among veterans. And I've heard some stories, the
*  fact that the State Department is seeing a similar surge of suicides because they see their adult
*  life's work collapse. They've seen their relationships. I mean, they've seen, they've
*  received phone calls in the middle of the night from people who they trusted with their lives,
*  who they know are going to be targeted. I mean, some have already been killed.
*  They've seen the, I mean, I think just, I'd imagine just ideologically and professionally
*  what they believed in and what they sacrificed for has vanished. And I think that's bad. I mean,
*  historically, thinking of some of the precedents you were thinking of, I mean, if you think of,
*  you know, first of all, at a human level, I feel horrible for those people who, you know,
*  may not have agreed with everything they had done and their choices in life, but I respect the fact
*  that many good people went out of the best intentions as young people to do the right thing
*  and make things right. And I respect that. And I've met enough to know that there were people who
*  saw the gray in complexity and that's all you can hope for. But we don't want a generation
*  of disillusioned veterans. You know, if we look at the other post-war moments, and this is kind of
*  a post-war moment where, you know, I think we need a conversation with American veterans about
*  what they've gone through and what they're feeling. And they still have skin in the game,
*  you know, because their personal connections and their histories.
*  And they're also going to be future leaders. I mean, veterans, people who have served are
*  often great men and women. That's true.
*  And, you know, throughout history, whether you sacrifice, you served in fighting World War II,
*  in fighting Vietnam, that's going to mold you in different ways. That's going to mold
*  how you are as a leader that leads this country forward. And so you have to have an honest
*  conversation about what was the role of the war in Afghanistan, the war in the Middle East,
*  the war on terror in the history of America. If we just look at the full context,
*  at the end of this 21st century, how we're going to remember this and how that's going to result
*  in our future interactions with small and large countries, with China or some proxy war with China,
*  with Russia, or some proxy war with Russia. What's the role of oil and natural resources
*  and opium and all those kinds of things? What's the role of military power in the world?
*  And now with COVID, you know, it's almost like because of the many failures of the US government
*  and many leaders in science and politics to respond effectively and quickly to COVID,
*  we kind of forget that we fumbled this other thing too. And it's hard to know which is going
*  to be more expensive. They seem to be symptoms of something of a same kind of source problem.
*  Of leadership, of bureaucracy, of the way information and intelligence flows throughout
*  the US government, all those kinds of things. And that hopefully motivates young leaders to fix things.
*  Definitely. I mean, I think if there's one theme that jumps out to me and thinking about this moment,
*  I mean, if we recognize that we live in a kind of crisis of democracy in the United States and in
*  other countries that have long been part of their democratic traditions, if we see them being under
*  assault from certain quarters, I think military defeat is yet another addition to all the
*  aspects of this that you mentioned. I mean, the fact of military defeat is a giant match that
*  you're throwing on this fire potentially if we think of its legacies and other post-war environments
*  when the veteran angle is one, when you have people who feel betrayed. I mean, they have been
*  fodder for the far right in other settings. I mean, Interwar Europe is very much about
*  mobilizing disillusioned veterans in the name of right-wing fascist politics.
*  If one thing's two at this moment of really increasing xenophobia, our immigration debate
*  is now talking about whether or not Afghans should be permitted at all in the United States
*  after 20 years. And I think immediately the response in Europe, which I followed to some extent,
*  focusing on Germany, because it was really ramping up deportations of Afghans, leading up this
*  collapse. And now they have been, a lot of right-wing center-right politicians in Germany have
*  been watching all this with an eye to using it to their advantage for a domestic German audience
*  to say in the context of recent elections that we're the party who will defend you against these
*  Afghans who are going to be coming from this. So what I've tried to emphasize in talking to
*  different groups about this moment is that it won't be confined to Afghanistan or even the region.
*  Obviously, malnutrition, hunger will send Afghans to neighboring states. But where the European
*  right is resurgent, this has been a gift to say that the Afghans are coming, they're brown-skinned,
*  they're Muslim, they're uneducated, they're going to want your women. And they will take the odd
*  sexual assault case or the odd whatever dramatic act of violence that happens numerically in any
*  population. And they'll magnify that to say that our far-right group is going to save the nation.
*  And sorry, the main point I wanted to speak of leadership was that I think the serial,
*  well, there were many, many carnal sins, if you like, but if you go back to our analogy of all
*  the exits, I mean, what blocked some of those exits was an absence of truth and transparency
*  and the lying. And so, I mean, this is no secret, anyone has followed this, but
*  we've allowed, and you think of this general mistrust of government, mistrust of authority
*  across the board, of professors, of economists, of scientists, doctors, right?
*  Well, I actually think that's the hopeful thing to me about the internet, is the internet hates
*  inauthenticity. They can smell bullshit much better. And I think that motivates young leaders
*  to be transparent and authentic. So the very problems we've been seeing, this kind of attitude
*  of authority where, oh, the populace, they're too busy with their own lies. They're not smart
*  enough to understand the full complexities of the things we're dealing with. So we're not going to
*  even communicate to them the full complexities. We're just going to decide and then tell them
*  what we decided and conceive some kind of narrative that makes it easy for them to
*  consume this decision. As opposed to that, I really believe I see there's a hunger for authenticity
*  of when you're making decisions, when you're looking at the rest of the world and trying to
*  decide, untangle this complexity, the internet, the public, the world wants to see you as a leader
*  struggle with the tension of these ideas, to change your mind, to recognize your own flaws
*  and your own thinking from a month ago. All that, the full complexity of it, also acknowledge the
*  uncertainty as with COVID, also with the wars. I think there's a hunger for that. And I think
*  that's just going to change the nature of leadership in the 21st century.
*  I hope so. I think all the things you highlighted, I mean, accountability is part of that, right?
*  I mean, we need honesty, openness, and then acknowledgement of mistakes. Humility is the key
*  to all learning, right? But also, I mean, you think just the headline from yesterday, the horrible
*  drone strike, which was really the last kind of American military action on the day that the US
*  was, I think, mostly departing from Kabul wiped out an entire family, mostly children. The US
*  acknowledged that, yes, this was not the ISIS bombing outfit that they thought it was. But
*  yesterday, they did a quick review. I'm not an expert on drone strikes and their aftermath, but
*  those who looked at it more closely said it was basically whole cloth taken from what the US
*  government has been saying after all these strikes, you know, reproducing the same language and
*  basically pointing to technical errors, but denying that there were any procedural mistakes
*  or flaws or it was just kind of, they found little ways of acknowledging things that goes
*  plan, but we follow the policies essentially and that's it. It's not a crime. It's a way of
*  not even saying, you know, we screwed up. And it's kind of the legalese that suddenly makes
*  a war crime, not a war crime, you know? And that is a refusal to take accountability.
*  LW I think people are really sick of that in a way where the opposite is true, which is they get
*  excited for people who are not, for leaders who are not that. And so they're not going to punish
*  you for saying I made a mistake. I just had a conversation with Francis Collins, the director
*  of NIH and part of my criticism towards Anthony Fauci has been that it's like such subtle,
*  but such crucial communication of mistakes made. If you make a small mistake, it is so powerful
*  to communicate. I think we messed up. We thought this was true and it wasn't. So the obvious thing
*  there was with masks early in the pandemic, there's so much uncertainty. It's so understandable to
*  make mistakes or to also be concerned about what kind of hysteria, different statements you make
*  lead to just being transparent about that and saying we were not correct and saying the thing
*  we said before. That's so powerful to communicate, to gain trust. And the opposite is true.
*  When you do this legalese type of talk, it destroys trust. And again, I really
*  think the lessons of recent history teach us how to be a leader and teach young leaders how to be
*  leaders. So I have a lot of hope. Partially thanks for the internet.
*  Yeah, that's great. Humility, we need humility, accountability, honesty. And yes, studying the
*  past is an important way to do that, to learn from past mistakes. And obviously there's always
*  inspiration and courage and we can take some kind of assistance from that too. But also learning
*  how not to do things. And then analogies are never one-to-one. We talk about Vietnam. I think
*  many Vietnam veterans would say this is like deja vu. The visuals of the Kabul airport and of
*  the Saigon embassy were not the same, but close enough that people would juxtapose them.
*  All of us for now, but I would just ask people that over-analogizing is also a path down making
*  errors of judgment and comparison and then sameness. But it's stretch. I mean,
*  they like 9-11 itself. I think the idea that people lack the imagination within our security
*  apparatus to think this is even possible. And you think of the simplicity of having a $10 lock on a
*  cockpit door, could have wanted all this. And again, I'm not saying either the time or in
*  hindsight that I am omission about all this, but I had just been living in Germany the year before
*  and there was a plot there. This guy was hatching from Germany to blow up the mausoleum of Aditwerk
*  in Ankara with an airplane. And so if you kind of dig, it wasn't unimaginable that you would
*  use an airplane as a weapon. And the Bush was fishing up saying, no one had ever heard of this.
*  Who would do this? Well, not a lot of people do this. And then at that very moment, my wife
*  was teaching the Joseph Conrad novel, Secret Agent, which was about a conspiratorial organization
*  that wanted to bomb, actually in retrospect, it was kind of suicide bombing because I think
*  they tricked this guy into doing it, but they wanted to bomb the Greenwich Observatory for some
*  obscure political purpose. So that's an instance in which the novel, to go back to our kind of
*  humanities pitch, right? I guess my point was that as you mentioned, we need humanity, transparency,
*  but also imagination, right? I think part of expanding our imagination is by, obviously,
*  delving into your fields of engineering and the sciences and robotics and artificial intelligence
*  and all that rich landscape. But also we find this in film, poetry, literature, just the kind of
*  stretching that we need to do to really educate ourselves more fully across the spectrum of
*  everything humans need to imagine, to reimagine security. So much of what we talk about today,
*  our security is affected by others' perception of their insecurity, right?
*  Which unleashes a whole web of emotions. Can you tell me about the Afghan people,
*  what they love, what they fear, what they dream of for themselves and for their nation?
*  Is there something to speak to, to the spirit of the people that may humanize
*  them and maybe speak to the concerns and the hopes they have?
*  Yeah, I think as an outsider, I hesitate to make any grand statement, but I would say, listen,
*  I mean, there are a number of documentary films that are incredibly rich that will offer your
*  listeners a view of a snapshot. So there is Afghan Star, which really brings you to the homes of
*  a set of people who, they want stardom, they're artists, they want to express themselves,
*  some want to push political boundaries, cultural boundaries. There's a woman who gets into hot water
*  for dancing. But you realize that people, they love art, they love music, they love poetry,
*  they love expression. People want to care for their children, they want safety of their families,
*  they want to enjoy what everyone enjoys. I think it's a very humanizing portrait.
*  There's another great documentary film called Love Crimes of Kabul, which is a great snapshot
*  of the post-2000 world that the Americans shaped a lot of ways. And it's about a women's prison.
*  And it's incredibly revealing because it's about young girls and what they want. Well, not just
*  young, but young teenage and then some middle-aged people who are accused of moral crimes,
*  ranging from homicide, which one woman admits to, to having sexual relations outside of marriage.
*  And so it shows in a way continuity with the previous Taliban regime and that women are
*  imprisoned for things that you wouldn't be imprisoned for elsewhere and that Islamic law
*  operates as the kind of judicial logic for these punishments. But in letting these women
*  kind of speak for themselves, I mean, it's fascinating. I mean, I don't want to get too
*  much away, but women make very interesting choices in this film that land them in this predicament.
*  So they don't all profess innocence. Some are like, I'm guilty, but they're guilty for reasons.
*  In one case, one woman is guilty, she's in prison because it's a way to exert pressure on her
*  fiance to finally marry her. So you get ethnicity, you get kind of Romeo and Juliet things where
*  their families don't like each other necessarily, but they find each other. You have questions of
*  love, money, clothing, furniture. It's beautiful. I mean, the parts with it, I remember showing it
*  in class, there was a wonderful Afghan student who was a, I think a Fulbright at the Ed school
*  at Stanford and she's a genius. She's amazing. It was awkward for her because talking about young
*  women having sex and stuff and it was just, it wasn't, you know, the snapshot of Afghanistan
*  that she wanted. And obviously there's so much more. They're great writers and, you know, musicians
*  and I mean, you know, music is a huge thing. I mean, poetry, all these things are great.
*  So she found it, you know, I hear you. I mean, it's, it's a kind of taboo subject, but
*  I thought the American students seeing it really identified with these women because they're just
*  so real. And so, you know, young people trying to find like, I mean, relationships that are universal.
*  In circumstances that are very difficult. Love, love is universal.
*  Yeah. So it's, I mean, we do have resources to humanize. I mean, you know, you know, some of
*  your people will know Khaled Hussaini, you know, he's an African American. He's done his stuff,
*  but there are, there are a number of novelists and short story writers who do cool things.
*  And I think that another tragic aspect of this moment is that those people have now pretty much
*  had to leave the country. So there's a visual artist I would highlight for you named Khadim Ali,
*  who's a Hazara based in Australia. He does extraordinary work in blending a tradition of
*  Persian miniatures with contemporary political commentary. His work is between Australia and
*  Afghanistan, but he also, he had to flee. I mean, he was doing some work in Kabul, but it's a
*  extraordinary kind of visual language that he's adapted that has been shown all over the planet
*  now. He's got some of his work is in New York galleries, is in Europe. He's been shown in
*  Australia, but he talks about migration in a way that puts Afghans and Hazaras at the center,
*  but it's totally universal about, you know, our modern crisis of all the main people who are
*  displaced across our planet. And he attempts to kind of speak for some slice of them in a way
*  that like everyone can get. I mean, the visual imagery experts will know that it's from, you
*  know, like the, the Shahnameh, like an ancient Persian epic that Iranians were attached to,
*  that Afghans are attached to, that people can quote, you know, at length. It has mythical
*  figures of good and evil that kids grow up embodying. They're named the names of the characters
*  that are, it's called the book of Kings. The heroes and villains are the staple of conversation
*  and poetry. And, you know, like Russians, I mean, the kind of, the resort to literary references
*  and speak is something that, you know, Americans don't do. Most West European countries don't do,
*  but the fact that everyone's got to know this character, everyone knows this reference,
*  the wordplay, the linguistic finesse in multiple languages is, you know, a major value of
*  Afghan storytelling. As an outsider, I'm scratching it the surface of the surface.
*  There's a depth to it. It's just like, it is fascinating.
*  The layers, yeah.
*  With the layers of Russian language that's-
*  Exactly.
*  The culture, it's a, I've been struggling and this is kind of the journey I'm
*  embarking on to convey to an American audience what is lost in translation between Russian and
*  English. And it's, it's very challenging in some of the great translators of the CS gift Tolstoy,
*  of Russian literature struggle with this deeply and they work. It's an art form just to convey
*  that. And it's amazing to hear that Afghanistan with a full mix of cultures that are there have
*  the same kind of wit and humor and depth of-
*  I mean, the humor thing is that that's, you know, I'm so much our visual imagery is about like this
*  sad place and Dower and whatever, but the, I mean, socially, again, I'm going to engage in some
*  stereotypes about generalization stuff, but just the, you know, the Afghan friends that I've come
*  to be close with and really love. I mean, the humor, there's so much there of common stuff of like,
*  when I go to Ireland, it's one of my favorite places and just like the,
*  I feel a sense of pressure, like the humor all around me all the time. I feel like there's
*  something between Ireland, like Ireland and Russia with the humor stuff where it's like, you've,
*  you gotta be on your game if you want to be, you know, so it's-
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's like, you know what I mean?
*  The intensity of conversation in terms of, yeah, you have to be on your game in terms of wit and
*  so on. I mean, you have to, there's certain people I have, like when I talked on this podcast,
*  they're like that, certain people from the Jewish tradition have that, like where the wit is just
*  like, okay, I have to, oh yeah, I really have to pay attention. It's a game. It's like, you know
*  what it feels like? It feels like speed chess or something like that. And you really have to
*  focus and play. And at the same time, there's the body language and the,
*  and then there's a melancholy nature to it, at least in the Russian side.
*  Yeah.
*  The whole thing is just a beautiful mess.
*  Yeah. I mean, there's a funny TikTok video that went around that I got from like some Afghan
*  acquaintances that was a, he's an Irish comedian kind of highlighting, you know,
*  kind of Irish and German national stereotypes around hospitality. And this Afghan one was that,
*  I didn't know that the Irish were just white Afghans because the whole hospitality politics
*  of refusal, you know, you don't take something that's offered to you the first time. I mean,
*  it's the culture of receiving a guest. Americans aren't, I mean, that's not always, I mean,
*  they're different, they're regional cultures or that's the thing, there's whatever, but I mean,
*  the kind of like generosity and the kind of, you know, that's real. I mean, that's a cool thing
*  and that's amazing. That's, you know, the food, I mean, going off just the superficial things,
*  but all that, the warmth of hospitality and a wit and humanity. I mean, that's what we don't see
*  viewing the place just through war and geopolitics and the moving pieces of the map and stuff. And
*  that's hard to see when, you know, there are gaps in language and religious tradition and all that
*  stuff. And then, you know, being open to the fact that people do things differently, you know, and
*  it's, and the gender dimension is important, right? They're kind of, you know, arguably each
*  culture has a kind of gender dynamic that's different. And so I think it's helpful to have
*  humility and thinking that some Afghans will do some things differently, you know. But then
*  you'll also have Afghans who say, everyone should be educated, everyone should work and so on and so
*  on. So there's no, there's no single way of, yeah. And there is a gender dynamic in Russia too.
*  We need to be respectful of that. Like, that's not, that's not always what it looks like at first.
*  Yeah, exactly. There's layers. Where power is. I mean, that's definitely, I don't know. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's a whole nother conversation where the power is. Rumi, the 13th century Persian poet,
*  who was born on a land that is now Afghanistan. Is there something in his words that speaks to
*  you about the spirit of the Afghan people? I mean, everyone owns Rumi. I guess I'd say,
*  I mean, that's going to get me in trouble with certain Afghan fans of Rumi who
*  want to see him as, as an Afghan. I would say. Are they proud of Rumi? Yeah. Do they see him as
*  an Afghan? Do they? Yeah. I mean, so it depends. I mean, some, some people will be militant and say,
*  you know, the Iranians can have him. He's ours. But they're also say, you know, he's,
*  I mean, you can say, again, he's like a Rorschach plot. I mean, he's, he's a Sufi, he's a Muslim,
*  he's a Central Asian, he's Iranian, he's Afghan, he's a Turk. I'm trying to think of the analogy,
*  but he's, he's something special to everyone. So I guess I would, I would not walk into that
*  conversation and claim that he's one or another, but it's a cool thing. I mean, it's the, but I'm
*  glad you brought that up because that's a good way of seeing a, seeing something that Afghans,
*  I mean, we live in our country in Afghanistan and say, okay, Rumi's everyone, you know, Madonna
*  helped make a famous in the United States, you know, for better for worse. They used to sell
*  stuff at Starbucks and that's all complicated and embarrassing. And his, his transitions are very
*  much disputed where you have people be like, there's some awful Rumi translations and there are,
*  there are also a lot of speaking of the internet, there are lots of fake Rumi quotes. Yes. You know,
*  like Rumi said, I always be your best. We didn't say that, you know, that was, you know, I mean,
*  that's kind of so so with that, but, but then the cool thing is like the, I mean, I think you can
*  read Rumi as a religious thinker, but you can also, you know, read Rumi as, you know, in an Islamic
*  sense, but you can also read them as a kind of spiritualist, right? As someone who, or an
*  ethicist or moralist. And so I think that's, I like the lens of Rumi as a gateway to Afghan
*  ecumenicism and cosmopolitanism. You know, the theme I keep emphasizing of, of meeting
*  actual Afghans who were actually, you know, fluent in Russian, fluent in German, fluent Turkish.
*  They know Dari, they know Pashto. They've gone to university or sometimes they haven't. And yet,
*  I mean, they're, I like the category of the popular intellectual, you know, the intellectual who isn't,
*  isn't formally educated necessarily. Although of course that's represented too, especially
*  increasingly now with the generation of going to university all over the world, you know,
*  Stanford, MIT, everywhere. Afghans are well represented there, but just being, I don't know,
*  having kind of worldly knowledge that is not limited to a province, to a village, to a hamlet,
*  but it sometimes is, but sometimes it's not because of, again, not because of some fairy tale story of
*  curiosity, wanting the globe out of, you know, some sense of privilege, but out of necessity,
*  out of survival, of having to adapt. And it's really extraordinary that, I mean,
*  also let me think about like professions of like, you know, ask an Afghan, you know,
*  what does he or she do for a living? And what have they done in the past? I mean, the answer is one
*  gets shoe salesman, tax cab drivers, surgeons, all in one guy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's,
*  I mean, that's not just Afghan, but that's, you know, that's very common. But it's also Russia's
*  same. That's right. I think it's whenever there's complexities to the economic system and that's
*  right. A short term and the long term history of how the country develops. And it's basically the
*  people figuring out their way around a mess of a country politically, but a beautiful flourishing
*  culture and humanity. And that creates super interesting people. Yeah. Yeah. So we can often
*  see, okay, there's Taliban, there's war, there's economic malfunction, there's harboring of
*  terrorists, there's opium trade, all that kind of stuff. But there's humans there with intellectual
*  lies. And like I love the movie, Love Crimes, and the same kind of hopes, fears and desire to love
*  the old Romeo and Juliet story. And I think Rumi to me represents that,
*  the wit, the intelligence, but also the just eloquent and just beautiful representation
*  of humanity, of love. Some of the best quotes about love are from him. Half of them fake,
*  half of them real. But the best ones are real. The best ones are real. Yeah. The best ones are real.
*  Robert, this was an incredible conversation. Thank you for having me. Thank you for the
*  tour of Afghanistan and making me, making us realize that there's much more to this country
*  than what we may think. It's a beautiful country and it's full of beautiful people.
*  You made me think about a lot of new things too. So it was definitely great to be on my end too.
*  So thank you so much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Robert Cruz.
*  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Winston Churchill. History will be kind to me,
*  for I intend to write it. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
