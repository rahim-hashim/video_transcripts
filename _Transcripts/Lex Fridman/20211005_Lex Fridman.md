# RZA: Wu-Tang Clan, Kung Fu, Chess, God, Life, and Death | Lex Fridman Podcast #228
**Lex Fridman:** [October 05, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iau6W5pjy9Y)
*  The following is a conversation with RZA.
*  The rapper, record producer, filmmaker, actor, writer, philosopher, kung fu scholar, and
*  the mastermind of the legendary hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan.
*  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, here's my conversation with RZA.
*  In the Tao of Wu, you're right.
*  When my mother left the physical world, I lost one of my main links to the universe.
*  They say that you have an umbilical cord and an etheric cord, which is the invisible cord
*  that attaches you to your soul, your mother's soul, and all other souls.
*  When one passes away, you really lose something.
*  It's physical and mental.
*  It's real.
*  Part of you dies.
*  What have you learned about life from your mother?
*  I learned life itself from my mother.
*  You know, being one of 11 children and seeing the sacrifice that she gave to us, therefore
*  given to life, is really the greatest lesson of life.
*  The thing that shook me as I wrote those words was coming up young with arrogance, confidence,
*  knowledge of myself.
*  They called me the scientists.
*  We were taught you're the supreme being.
*  In order to be the supreme being, you've got to be supreme amongst other beings.
*  I understand that more now than I did then because then it was so literal.
*  The word God derived basically from the Greek language, as they say, and it meant wisdom,
*  strength, and beauty.
*  Yeah, we could have that.
*  But the power to control life and death is something that you would assume is a God trait.
*  Now here you are saying that you're a God.
*  You're reading the Bible, how Jesus brought back Lazarus.
*  Now it's your turn to do something.
*  When my mother was laying there in the hospital bed, and air was going on coming out of her
*  lungs and going into her lungs, where's my power to bring her back to life?
*  You can't truly be God.
*  You're powerless.
*  Yeah, or God is not the definition that we need to use to describe it because it's a
*  translation of wisdom, strength, and beauty.
*  You could be that.
*  I'm answering your question, what did my mother teach me about life?
*  I learned that day on her physical passing, okay.
*  I mean, there's a physical me.
*  Do you think about her?
*  Do you miss her?
*  Of course.
*  I keep my mother in my prayer every day.
*  And the thing I pray the most beyond giving thanks is I pray that her name is honored
*  by my family.
*  I don't know if the world's going to remember that, right?
*  Even though if you watch my movie, Love Beach Rhymes, I named the school in that movie after
*  my mother just to leave it somewhere else.
*  In physical space, yeah.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But yeah, painful.
*  The pain of my mother's passing is indescribable.
*  Only until it happens to a person they know, and then they won't describe it either.
*  Only the people that lost their mother, they can look at each other and they got this nod.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But one other thing happened to me was the joy of life hit me differently.
*  And I think it was the realization of my own mortality versus my immortality.
*  It's a big, big thing.
*  And I don't know if we'll get to expound on that, but there was a joy that overcame me
*  because I was kind of free of a certain illusion about the immortality of my physical being
*  versus the mortality of my physical being.
*  And I was like, okay, wow, I understand.
*  So that was the first or the hardest realization you've experienced that you're mortal.
*  Yeah, and I'll say mortal, and what you're looking at here physically, I wouldn't say
*  my soul is mortal.
*  I'll say it's immortal because at the end of the day, it's just like I could sit here
*  and I could just hum, please, please, please, by James Brown.
*  But James Brown is not going to come in here and do that.
*  So in some sense, James Brown is still here.
*  In another sense, he's gone.
*  His soul is here.
*  His soul is here.
*  Well, it lives through you by you singing it.
*  It lives through you by you listening to it, celebrating it.
*  And the hope is that the human species continues to celebrate the great minds and the great
*  creations of the past.
*  I would add this to that equation.
*  When I say it's immortal, I don't think it's not just only because somebody sings it, right?
*  It's like, where's the fire at right now?
*  It's in the air.
*  You just got to spark the spark.
*  So it's always there.
*  Are you afraid of death?
*  No, I'm not afraid of death.
*  I'm not trying to see it.
*  I'm not rushing that nowhere near me, right?
*  Because all I know is life.
*  My life is living.
*  I read a lot of ancient texts.
*  People probably know about me.
*  I love one of the great teachers named Bodhidharma.
*  And there was a thing written in one of the books of his or one of the teachings of his.
*  And somebody asked him a similar question.
*  Are you scared of death?
*  Or what are you going to be after you die?
*  And his answer was, I don't know.
*  He had answers to everything.
*  But he was like, I don't know.
*  They said, oh, he doesn't know that.
*  He said, yeah, because I haven't died yet.
*  Well, the uncertainty to some people is terrifying, not knowing what's on the other side of the door.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, especially when you're young.
*  You know, as a kid, fear permeated my life.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I was actually watching horror movies.
*  And I believed in all type of supernatural things that could or can happen.
*  I thought I saw things as well.
*  And whether it was being projected from my own mind or whether it was there visible to me, I don't know.
*  But life is beautiful.
*  And we have it.
*  And we should use it all the way to the last drop.
*  Realizing the mortality, the gift your mother gave to you is realizing the immortal.
*  And in so doing, help you realize that life is beautiful.
*  On this topic, Quincy Jones, I read, said to ODB and you, when it rains, get wet.
*  What do these words mean to you?
*  Well, I think what Quincy was saying at that time was, you know, I think I was more conservative,
*  like as a person and like, you know, had money.
*  Women wanted me.
*  Anything I kind of wanted, I probably could have had.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And he was just saying, when it rains, get wet.
*  Enjoy this, man.
*  It's raining on you.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Don't put up the umbrella.
*  Don't go back in the house.
*  Get wet.
*  Experience the moment.
*  Yeah, and enjoy it.
*  And I didn't take total heed to him at that time.
*  A couple of years later, I took some heed.
*  But at that time, I didn't take heed.
*  And when I took heed, I think that I may have misinterpreted by looking at his example of
*  getting wet versus my example of getting wet.
*  And I can tell you right now, I'm getting wet right now in my way.
*  In part thanks to your mother, but overall, you just learned how to appreciate the rain.
*  Just like the experience of every moment.
*  Yeah, and I'll share this with you because this is going to be a very open conversation
*  and I haven't had this conversation.
*  So definitely in part to my mother, then in part to my wife.
*  I meet my wife.
*  It's my second wife.
*  But I met her after my mother passed.
*  And she was just a friend.
*  You know, some girl I met, thought she was beautiful and actually built a friendship
*  with her.
*  A few years later, when the relationship became like, you know, this is going to be my woman.
*  It was actually when I was doing the middle of my divorce.
*  And I was like, you know, do I run wild?
*  And hey, you know, me and my wife already fell.
*  We were separated.
*  And do I run wild?
*  And I didn't run wild.
*  A little bit, but not too wild.
*  Right?
*  And, you know, I'm still a man.
*  I'm a hip hop guy.
*  I read you know how to party.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But the funny thing is that my wife now, her name is Tilani, my uncle said she reminds
*  me of your mother.
*  He knew my mother before I knew my mother.
*  And he saw that.
*  And we ended up dating, got engaged, and then her mother passed us.
*  And so now there's a total understanding of everything.
*  And we actually helped build each other back up.
*  So of course, I have to thank my mother for the awareness.
*  Then I thank my wife for bringing that awareness to actualization.
*  Like to actually feel, I don't think I'd be talking to you right now and talking as much
*  I do these days, if it wasn't for the security and peace and harmony that I was able to
*  gain at home.
*  You know, so.
*  And like you said, you now share that look of having both lost your mom.
*  What have you learned from Quincy about music, about business, about life?
*  Quincy Jones is a great mind, a great artist.
*  A treasure in all reality.
*  He's seen it from when he couldn't walk in the same place as he played his music at to
*  own in places bigger than ours.
*  So what a beautiful life, you know?
*  He's the type of guy, if you spend one hour with him, you got a lifetime of information.
*  And I was blessed to spend multiple hours with him and days with him.
*  You know, there's a certain period of time where we came across each other and he was
*  always there to share the knowledge.
*  Like that's another thing about him that I think is special.
*  And hopefully I picked that up is that he's always willing to share, share with his
*  experience, his knowledge.
*  I mean, I think he'll even share his home to the right person if he feels that that's
*  what they need to get back on their feet.
*  He's a very beautiful man.
*  So just the kindness, the goodness of the man is like the thing that really rubbed off
*  on you.
*  Yeah, I mean, minimum.
*  I mean, Quincy Jones also in his 50s as a producer produced one of the greatest albums
*  of all time and one of the greatest selling albums of all time.
*  Not just great critically, economically great.
*  And I mean, I think he did it at the age I am right now.
*  So I might have a great year coming up.
*  Timing well.
*  Yeah.
*  So now you got a taste of what greatness is.
*  You get to see what greatness is.
*  So, you know, what it's happy.
*  How to strive for yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  You have a few people you've worked with who are fascinating like yourself.
*  Quentin Tarantino.
*  You work with him.
*  When somebody asked you to describe him with one word, you said encyclopedia.
*  What have you learned from the guy?
*  About filmmaking, about life again.
*  A very generous man with his knowledge.
*  And for me, he shared it, I think in a way that was unique in a sense of, no, at a point
*  in time, you know, we just was super duper tight.
*  Like, you know, I don't go into his crib and watching movies and just having long
*  conversations about art and about life.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So I learned a lot.
*  I consider him, you know, especially when it comes to anything cinematic in my life,
*  I consider him the godfather of that for me.
*  I think, you know, I humbly asked him to mentor me, which is a very humbling thing to
*  do coming from my neighborhood, coming from who I am, coming from, I was already a
*  multi-platinum artist, you know, with, I mean, it was a year, it was past the year 2000
*  already. So like 2001, 2002 that I asked him to mentor me.
*  So I was delusional already, you know what I mean?
*  But I humbled myself because I saw in him a craft of brain power that to me resonated
*  with me. But I was just a Patamon at it.
*  I was a novice at it because I was trying to make movies and my music, you know, trying
*  to make videos. And here was a man who was a master of it and an encyclopedia of it as
*  well. And like film history, film history from whether it's the actor, the director,
*  the cinematographer, maybe even the costume designer.
*  He made no 50, 60, he made no 50 greatest costume designers in his memory.
*  I mean, this guy's brain.
*  Both of you have pretty good memory.
*  I'd love to be a fly on the wall of that conversation.
*  And kung fu movies, most of you guys.
*  We actually started, I think we started our relationship trying to outdo each other.
*  Knowledge wise or what?
*  Yeah, movie knowledge wise.
*  Movie knowledge.
*  Actually kung fu movie knowledge wise.
*  And I think that cat, if it wasn't another category, I wouldn't have had a chance.
*  But at least in that category, I was pretty holding my weight.
*  Who won?
*  You know what?
*  I'll be honest and say that I may have said a few he didn't see, but Quinn is older than me.
*  So he could go back further.
*  Yeah, he could go back to 72 when I didn't see one yet.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we he said Master of the Flying Gate Team that I got a chance to that you commentate
*  over today and I got a chance to see the screening of he said that's one of his favorites.
*  For you, the 36th Chamber of Shaolin, the Master Killer is your favorite.
*  Best best ever.
*  Would you say that's the greatest kung fu movie ever?
*  It's hard to say the greatest ever, right?
*  Because somebody may make another one and it depends on your own phase of life.
*  But I will put that first.
*  If I want to introduce somebody to kung fu movies, that's a beautiful entry.
*  You talk about knowledge, you talk about wisdom.
*  What what kind of wisdom do you draw from kung fu movies?
*  The you know what the martial art itself and the movies.
*  It's endless wisdom to be drawn and I draw it, you know.
*  I draw it in a way, you know, that I could decipher it in my own life.
*  So, for instance, in the movie Master Killer.
*  He basically, when he does kung fu, he does a really a style called the hangar technique.
*  And the director of the movie is actually a hangar expert who has a lineage that traces
*  all the way back to Shaolin temple.
*  And this director always wanted to keep his movies pure and to bring hangar to the world.
*  It's like he wanted to show the world this lineage.
*  In fact, you just said Master of the Flying Guillotine is Quentin's favorite movie.
*  And we mentioned in 36 Chambers, it's my favorite movie.
*  But the action director of Master of the Flying Guillotine is the director of 36 Chambers
*  of Shaolin.
*  Yeah.
*  And some of the things that's happening in Master of the Flying Guillotine is really
*  the infant stage of what this action director is going to learn and then use later on in
*  his movies.
*  So that's the beauty of it.
*  It's almost like Quentin is seeing him in his generation.
*  So Quentin might have been the same age I was watching that movie.
*  And then when he becomes a director, I'm at Quentin's age and I'm seeing his work.
*  So some symbiont relationship there.
*  And I'll end this question by saying hangar deals with the five animal technique, the
*  tiger, the crane.
*  The leopard, the snake, and the dragon.
*  Those are the five.
*  That's the five pattern.
*  Some people go seven, some go 12.
*  But it's a stick to the five pattern and fist.
*  How do a man emulate a tiger?
*  And you see a tiger's fist.
*  He curls before he spawns on you.
*  How does a man emulate a snake?
*  How does a man emulate a snake?
*  It doesn't have to be only in the kung fu move.
*  It's in the ideology of the snake.
*  It's in the agility of the crane.
*  At any moment, sometimes punching a person is not going to work, as they would say in
*  Leopard Fist or Tiger Paw.
*  So sometimes you might have to poke him in the eye with the crane's beak.
*  So having your mind able to adapt the instinct of the animal when you are being attacked
*  or when you are being the aggressor, that's something that you don't need a form for.
*  That's the mentality.
*  So kung fu, like I said, it informs me endlessly because at first I was trying to learn on
*  the whole, like I can't really hit you with that and really hurt you unless I've been
*  banging my hand a thousand times on some bricks and made it so callous or muscles are
*  so strong. But the idea that if me and you was to get into a fight and I'm going to tiger
*  up on you and take that instinct and prance when I'm a prance or fly away like the stalk.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, yo, that's the mentality.
*  It's much more than the technical moves.
*  It's much deeper.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's interesting.
*  I mean, when I see the kung fu movies, I love martial arts, all martial arts and competitive
*  ones too, like the actual competitions and so on.
*  It just seems like kung fu movies go much deeper than just like the techniques.
*  Yeah, they start.
*  I mean, if you see it right.
*  Even I watched a great MMA fight recently, you know, just interesting because he was on
*  top of the guy, you know, and the way he got from under him.
*  You know, it had to be, you know, his spirit got from under him.
*  It's some like mixture of crane and whatever.
*  Snake, ill, with the slippery ill technique.
*  Yeah, no, I love that when people become artists in the cage or they that's much bigger than
*  just like winning much bigger than particular techniques.
*  It's just art, especially at the highest level competition when millions of people are watching.
*  Which is pressure within itself.
*  Yes.
*  Yes, that's art under pressure is even more beautiful art.
*  You know, you look at some of these fights and you wonder like why somebody wins and lose.
*  And sometimes the less talented guy could win because he could deal with the pressure.
*  But the other guy, he could have beat him.
*  There was someone else, but not in this arena.
*  So you're a scholar of history, including hip hop history.
*  You've I've listened to so many of your interviews.
*  You've spoken brilliantly about some of the big figures in hip hop history.
*  Tupac, Biggie, Nas, many others.
*  Maybe let's look at Tupac and Biggie.
*  What made them special in the history of music?
*  That's a good question.
*  So I don't know if I'm the authority to answer it, but I'll just speak my piece on it.
*  Maybe I could just add on because I'm sure it's a lot of people that spent a lot of time with them
*  that could speak on it.
*  But just as a fellow artist, I think not only was Biggie a dope lyricist,
*  I think he had a voice that was really immaculate.
*  In the sense that some rappers get on top of music and you got to get used to them.
*  You got to vibe with them.
*  But he make a record sounds like a record immediately.
*  If you go back and listen to his music, you could take his voice and put it on anything.
*  And for some reason, it sounds like a record.
*  You mean just like the raw voice of the man?
*  You could just listen to it raw and it sounds like a record.
*  But if you take his voice and put it on any beat, he just has a voice.
*  It's immaculate.
*  So his lyrical skills and all that was great.
*  You got to think once again, he's doing all this.
*  He's not even 25 years old.
*  Then you go to Pac, once again, immaculate voice.
*  What Pac had, I think, was a way of touching us on all of our emotions.
*  Pac had the power to infuse your emotional thought like Brenda has a baby, their mama.
*  But then he had the power to arouse the rebel in you.
*  And those two things, actually, he was probably more dangerous than Big, Notorious B.I.G.
*  Notorious B.I.G., we could party with him to this day.
*  We are still, but Pac was probably going to a point, he was more going into the Malcolm X
*  of things and society fears that.
*  Yeah, so he was really good at communicating love and at starting revolutions.
*  And that's dangerous.
*  And Big communicated love, but he wasn't starting revolutions.
*  Well, it's interesting to think about what the world would be like if they were still with us.
*  But it's the way the world, Hendrix, a lot of those guys just go too soon.
*  Yeah, it's a peculiar thing.
*  You asked me earlier, am I scared of death?
*  And I answered, no, I'm not scared of death.
*  I'm not trying to see it, though.
*  That was the block of death.
*  I'm not really going right there right now.
*  I'm making a left or right turn.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Unless it was mandatory for some greaterness, greater good.
*  It's like, okay, I got to drive through that.
*  But it can still happen.
*  That's the meditation on death part where you could die at the end of today.
*  Yeah, you could die.
*  Well, dying and death, I think it's two different things, personally.
*  The process, you mean, of death or just?
*  Yeah, I mean, you could die.
*  Like I said, you could die every day.
*  You could die and not be yourself.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Which is crazy.
*  But to get to a point of no return, that's a whole other chamber.
*  I mean, there's some sense in which
*  Reza the producer becomes somebody else completely when you're making a film,
*  becomes somebody else completely when you're, I don't know, playing chess,
*  becomes completely something different when you do kung fu or watch kung fu
*  or when you're a family man.
*  All of those are little deaths when you transition from one place to another.
*  So it's not like you're one being.
*  You're many things.
*  Yeah, I would describe that as all life, though.
*  Yeah, it's fun.
*  Outside of you and anybody on Wu Tang,
*  who is the greatest rapper from a lyrics,
*  like a Wart Smith perspective in hip hop history?
*  Or some of the greatest, maybe some candidates?
*  Let's name a few.
*  I mean, you're going to have to start with Rakim.
*  You're going to have to pick Kooji Rap in there.
*  So going back.
*  You're going to have to pick up with those brothers first.
*  You might have to, if you want to get technical,
*  you might have to start with Grandmaster Kaz.
*  Who you might not even have heard of.
*  But you may have sung his lyrics every time you sang Sugarhill Rapper's Delight.
*  Because that was it.
*  They copied his and they made it theirs.
*  But point being made, but I'll name a couple more.
*  I got to pick Nas in that category.
*  We got a chess board in front of us and one of the greatest chess players,
*  the youngest Grandmaster before, I think, Carlson was Bobby Fischer.
*  So just use Bobby Fischer as American, one of the greatest American chess players.
*  Of course, Susan Polgar may have tied his record as the youngest Grandmaster,
*  and she's the youngest female Grandmaster, I think, to date.
*  But he was a master at what, 14?
*  Yeah, something like that.
*  So now, to me, I met Nas when he was 15.
*  He was already a master lyricist.
*  It takes about 10 years to become a master lyricist.
*  So by the time the world heard Wu-Tang,
*  most of us had 10 years of rapping in us already.
*  So that's why you met us at mastery level.
*  The Jizzle was already a master when Nas was a master, but Jizzle was 21.
*  Nas was 15.
*  Nas is like the Mozart of rap.
*  Bobby Fischer.
*  Bobby Fischer just born something in him or maybe those early years.
*  Because he's not just good at the lyrics.
*  He goes deep with it, just like you.
*  So there's depth.
*  It's not just mastery of the word smithing.
*  It's just the message you actually send across.
*  It's information into a small phrase.
*  That's the whole thing of energy.
*  How do we condense all that energy into this so that it can feel that?
*  He's definitely one of those artist MCs that does that.
*  He was doing it at 15.
*  Like I said, I'm thinking five years or four or five years older than Nas.
*  I was always feeling my confidence of what I was doing, but I was like,
*  this kid is only 15.
*  I got to step up my game.
*  When he turned 19, then we got Illmatic.
*  From you, what are the best and most memorable lyrics you've ever written?
*  That's a hard question for me.
*  The stuff stand out, stuff you're really proud of that was important in your career?
*  Yeah.
*  I did a song called Sunshower.
*  I don't know if we put it on the Wu-Tang Forever double CD, but only on the international version.
*  But if anybody could go get those lyrics and write those lyrics down,
*  you could just put that in your pocket and I'm sure it'll answer at least about 25% of your
*  life's problems.
*  Well, there's a good one, Sunshine, where you talk about religion and God.
*  That's good.
*  Tomorrow, I think it's on A Diagram.
*  I'm not a record guy.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm a song guy.
*  Might have been A Diagram.
*  Do you have a lyric from it?
*  Yeah.
*  The answer to all questions.
*  You're talking about God.
*  Yeah.
*  This is so good.
*  A Mission Impossible is purely philosophical, but you can call on your deathbed when you're
*  laying in the hospital.
*  You will call them on your deathbed.
*  I have a scientist friend.
*  Well, my wife's best friend, Rebecca, they both scientists.
*  They both were scientists and she married Dr. Neal.
*  I ain't going to say their last names.
*  But Neal and Rebecca, they're my wife's best friend, so they come over.
*  And me and Neal, we go through the longest debates of science and religion.
*  We just go.
*  We could go break day with it.
*  Before he had a child, he was more adamant and there's an unbelieving God.
*  After a child, he still kept his thing, but I just hit him with the question.
*  If you was about to die, because now you got a child to think about, right?
*  It's different when you thinking about yourself.
*  I said, if you was about to die, you don't think you're going to make that call?
*  He's like, I'll make that call.
*  And it kind of inspired my lyric because it was like, yeah, who you gonna?
*  And I just want to say, so you mentioned lyric.
*  That is one of my favorite lyrics, but that's part two.
*  To Sunshower was the prequel to Sunshine.
*  So if you ever get a chance to check out Sunshower,
*  it starts off with Trouble Follows a Wicked Mind.
*  2020 vision of the prism of life, but still blind because you lack the inner.
*  So every sinner could end up in the everlasting winter of hell fire.
*  With thorns and splinters prick your eye out.
*  You cry out.
*  Your words fly out.
*  But you remain unheard.
*  Suffering internal and external, along with the wicked fraternal of generals and colonels,
*  letting off thermonuclear heats that burns you firmly and permanently upon the journey
*  through the journal of the book of life.
*  For those who took a life without justice will become just ice.
*  It's been taught your worst enemy couldn't harm you as much as your own wicked thoughts.
*  But people ought be not and listen wrought.
*  So they find themselves persecuted inside their own universal court.
*  So that is a long one.
*  That's like a three pager.
*  Wow.
*  That is about life.
*  That's like character integrity, how to be, how to be in this world, and that ultimately connects to God.
*  Who's God to you?
*  I'm glad you just asked that question because I actually, I'm going to have to make a
*  distinguishable separation here.
*  All right.
*  All right.
*  And it's funny because I heard recently, I heard a rabbi was debating with this historian,
*  Dr. Ben, I can't pronounce Dr. Ben name, but they was debating.
*  And in the debate, they started going back through the etymology.
*  They went way back beyond antiquity because they was debating.
*  And so there was, you know, some things, they was going deep.
*  And they really went far, far back to kind of the first word of God.
*  And it was, when they pronounced it on this particular debate, it was Allah.
*  And they said from that, they got Allahin.
*  I've already agreed in my heart and my life that the father of this universe proper name is Allah.
*  And of course in Allah, I get all.
*  You know, and I don't think that God is the same as that.
*  I think Allah gets birth to God.
*  In fact, if you take the word Allah, A-L-L-A-H, and you take it through numerology or numbers,
*  the number A being, letter A being one, L being 12, and you add it all up to its lowest,
*  to the last denominator, you're going to get the number seven.
*  And the number seven is going to bring you right back to that letter G.
*  So Allah borns God, but God don't born Allah.
*  How does that God, how does Allah connect to the oracle
*  that you're going to be calling for when you're laying in the hospital?
*  Well, what I was saying in that particular verse was that we're looking for the oracle.
*  We're looking for somebody else or something to help us that nobody could really help you
*  at the end of the day.
*  And we're speaking on religion, but we're speaking on a way of life and a way of thinking.
*  And I've read many books, of course, and I can say there's no book that,
*  the book that is the most strongest book I've ever read is actually the Holy Quran.
*  It's stronger to me than the Bible, which I've read.
*  It's stronger than quantum physics, which I've read.
*  It's stronger than the Bhagavad Gita.
*  And I read once a British scholar said it's the most stupidest book ever written
*  and it doesn't make sense.
*  And so I said, oh, I see why he says that.
*  I understand exactly why he said that as well.
*  Why is that?
*  Because the structure of the words are just, it's peculiar.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But it's almost like how some people's songs, you don't really
*  know exactly what they're saying until years later.
*  Yeah, you have, actually with Joe Rogan, I think you talked about how
*  a joke of Dave Chappelle's hit you like a long time after.
*  So this is kind of like the Quran.
*  I tend to believe that we,
*  human beings cannot possibly understand anything as big as these ideas.
*  So just, I don't know.
*  Did you think that, like, are you humble in the face of just the immensity of it?
*  To be honest, yes.
*  I'm humble in the face of the,
*  you can say the word again, I pronounce words funny.
*  The omnipotence, the omniscience, the magnitude.
*  I'm humble in the face of Allah.
*  The problem that I may have had was that
*  I wasn't humble in the face of God because it's just a definable thing.
*  And that's why I think a lot of us, and I'm not saying that, you know,
*  I know when we say God, we're trying to say Allah.
*  Like people was saying that, but you're actually not saying the same thing
*  because you're actually putting something beside him.
*  And that's the reason why you can have all these mini-gods.
*  You can find a whole bunch of them.
*  But you're not going to find many.
*  There's no body beside Allah.
*  Allah is one.
*  So I know it's the whole thing, but that's my heart is there.
*  I'm humbled by it.
*  I'm at peace with it.
*  And it doesn't take nothing or demerit anything from myself.
*  That's the beauty of it.
*  It doesn't take nothing from me, from being who with him.
*  So if I say, if somebody woke up, yo, peace, God, I could take that.
*  Because they're telling me that, yo, I'm a man of wisdom.
*  I'm a man of strength.
*  I'm a man of beauty or some attribute of that.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So Wu-Tang, they the gods of rap.
*  There's wisdom there.
*  There's strength there.
*  There's beauty.
*  They will take that.
*  So Wu-Tang is one of the greatest musical, artistic, philosophical groups ever.
*  Let's look hundreds of years from now when humans or robots or aliens
*  or whatever that's left here, they look back.
*  What do you hope they remember about Wu-Tang?
*  What do you hope the legacy is?
*  Well, even if it's thousands of years, I hope we don't get rid of the humans.
*  But you know, look, whatever happens is going to happen.
*  But I think that my philosophy on it is that we're going to continue to advance
*  and continue to advance things around us.
*  But I don't see us becoming extinct.
*  Well, I mean, the reason I bring up sort of Wu-Tang in that context,
*  and this is a special moment in human history.
*  It's like a hundred years and we've created all of this music.
*  Just if you think of all the richness of music that's been created over a hundred years,
*  it's not obvious to me that that's not going to stop.
*  There's a flourishing here.
*  So it's funny because I could see where the book of human history is written.
*  There's a chapter on this period of time.
*  And one of the things we did well is all the technological innovation with rockets and with
*  the internet.
*  But then there's also the musical innovation and film innovation.
*  Just so much art that's being created.
*  And Wu-Tang is a huge part of that.
*  So I just wonder if there's a few sentences written about Wu-Tang.
*  It just makes me wonder how they remember.
*  I would hope that people will, no matter how many years are inspired by us,
*  but I will say if I could just use Wu-Tang as itself.
*  So we first started off the witty, unpredictable talent and natural game.
*  Natural game meaning natural wordplay.
*  And then we went to the wisdom of the universe.
*  The truth of Allah for a nation of God.
*  Wisdom universal, truth, Allah, nation, God.
*  So this is go back to a nation of God.
*  Let's just take the last two letters.
*  A nation of wisdom, strength and beauty.
*  Right?
*  And I'm going to go a little political here, but not going political.
*  As we say, we're the greatest country in the world.
*  What makes us the greatest?
*  That's to be a question we ask.
*  Is it our wisdom?
*  Is it our strength?
*  Is it our beauty?
*  Now, let's just say off the easiest answer, you know it's our strength.
*  We got the nukes.
*  Nobody can really, you know, between America and Russia,
*  that's the argument.
*  Who could beat them?
*  But where's the wisdom?
*  Then they can argue, well, we got the technology.
*  All right, but then where's the beauty when there's so much suffering in the people?
*  So it's not complete?
*  The hope is that the wisdom is in the founding documents, in the imperfect,
*  but wise founding documents of that celebrated freedom, that celebrated all the ideas,
*  sort of having a lot of nukes, having a lot of airplanes and tanks.
*  That's not important.
*  The hope is whatever we're doing here with this,
*  quote, greatest country on earth, that we preserve the ideas and help them flourish.
*  Well, that's what I mean.
*  So if you go back to the Wu-Tang, you know what I'm saying?
*  That's what we're striving for.
*  We're striving for that.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But you started on Predictable and just like...
*  Yeah.
*  But like got deep pretty quick.
*  I got to talk to you about Bruce Lee.
*  Bruce Lee.
*  Who's Bruce Lee to you?
*  Who is he to the world?
*  What ideas of his were interesting to you?
*  You talk about like Hendrix and music.
*  Bruce Lee is that in martial arts.
*  He just seems to have changed the game.
*  You know, I went as...
*  I guess I don't know what the word bold is the right word to say,
*  but I went as bold as to say that he was a minor prophet.
*  And I got that concept from the Holy Quran where it says
*  we send prophets to every nation, every village.
*  We don't let nobody not hear the word in some form
*  because it won't be fair.
*  And so if a law is merciful, even a man who's deaf has to somehow get a sign.
*  I don't know if Moses saw a burning bush.
*  It was nobody else to talk to, so he had to talk to the bush.
*  I don't know.
*  It could have been the bush.
*  This man too, right?
*  Yeah, the kind of bush, yeah.
*  But point being made, it says that they are minor prophets
*  and I see Bruce Lee as one of them.
*  Because what he brought to the world through martial art
*  was a whole shift in the dynamic of thinking.
*  You know, and that happens when certain entities are born,
*  but he didn't do it only in a physical sense.
*  He was also philosophizing in the same process.
*  And he was also striving to be the best of himself.
*  So you got three things going on.
*  I studied Bruce Lee multiple times.
*  And first, of course, when I saw my first kung fu movie,
*  it was the fake, it wasn't really Bruce Lee.
*  It was a few green hornet clips cut together.
*  And then I saw Black Samurai.
*  Then my following kung fu movies was like Fearless Fighters,
*  The Ghostly Face, the Fist of Double K.
*  But basically, in Fearless Fighters,
*  the lady put the little kid on her back
*  and flew across the lake, right?
*  So Bruce wasn't doing that.
*  And then I went on to Five Deadly Venoms and Spearman
*  and 36 Chambers.
*  And these movies are beautiful, and yet they're all heightened.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Bruce, they're heightened beyond doable.
*  You're not going to...
*  Yeah, it's like surreal.
*  They play with the world that's not of this world.
*  Yeah. Bruce played with this world.
*  So when I first saw Bruce, I honestly didn't think he was as good as these guys.
*  He can't fly.
*  He's not flying in the movies, right?
*  Right? But then when I saw...
*  Because the first one I saw was The Big Boss, which they retitled Fist of Fury.
*  But then when I saw Chinese Connection, which is the real Fist of Fury, right?
*  I saw something different there.
*  And I got enamored.
*  And then, of course, Enter the Dragon, right?
*  Just really complete.
*  That's why my first album was Enter the Wu Tang, 36 Chambers of Shaolin.
*  So it's Enter the Dragon and 36 put together, because those are the two epitomes.
*  So what happened is that's young me.
*  Then teenage me studies him again.
*  And I realized, wow, look at his physicality.
*  Look how he's really...
*  He's moving for real.
*  And then I studied him again.
*  Wow, look at what he's saying.
*  Then I studied him again.
*  Wow, look at what he stands for.
*  Which do you like in the realm of martial arts?
*  The real or the surreal?
*  Or the dance between the two?
*  Yeah, I like the dance between the two, because a movie, to me, is to entertain you.
*  So I'm cool with Obi-Wan Kenobi disappearing out of the cloak when Vader strikes him down.
*  And then I'm like, yo, what happened?
*  He's like, run, Luke, run.
*  I'm cool with that, right?
*  Because that's the imagination.
*  And the imagination gets stimulated to the point to where things that we saw,
*  imagined by an artist, we strive to create in our real world.
*  Thus, Star Trek, to me, is just a precursor to our cell phones.
*  So for me, I like the mix of the two.
*  Yeah, it's funny how science fiction, pushing into the impossible,
*  actually makes it realize eventually.
*  Yeah, we humans, once we see a idea on screen, no matter how wild it is, we...
*  We're trying to make it.
*  Yeah, we're trying to make it.
*  It's when we're a young kid, it gets inspired.
*  We watch that.
*  I'll be like, I'm going to build that.
*  Exactly.
*  So I don't know who's going to come with the Back to the Future time machine,
*  but do you have any classmates that you think...
*  Time machine?
*  I thought you were going to Back to the Future, like the, what is it, the hoverboard?
*  We're there at least.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Somebody, they got...
*  You seen the one on the water?
*  No.
*  No, you know the...
*  It's just close on the water?
*  Wait.
*  No, the surf hover.
*  Oh, no.
*  It's dope.
*  Nice.
*  It's dope.
*  It actually...
*  If you were Back to the Future fan, you feel like you made it.
*  Well, now we just got to work on the time travel.
*  And it was cool to hear you talk about the Master of the Flying Geese today,
*  that that inspired the lyric for the Wu-Tang Clan and nothing to eff with.
*  Yeah.
*  How does that go again?
*  With the curse word or the lyric?
*  I am Russian, but the lyric...
*  I said I be tossing and forcing.
*  My style is awesome.
*  I'm causing more family feuds than Richard Dawson.
*  And the survey said, you're dead.
*  The fatal flying guillotine chopped off your head.
*  And it was interesting to see the guillotine in the movie today.
*  How...
*  I don't know.
*  That's surreal, right?
*  But it's not.
*  It's engineering.
*  It's both surreal and it just...
*  It adds this chaos into this real world that...
*  And then challenges everybody to think what you're going to do with that.
*  Yeah.
*  How you going to beat it?
*  Yeah.
*  How you going to beat it?
*  Both when you have the good and the evil and the mix of the bad guys and the good guys,
*  and you're not sure who the bad guys are.
*  The old question of good versus evil, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Like you said, then the question of who was good, who was evil,
*  but they all had a similar problem when the guillotine came.
*  But in terms of the real, you mentioned The Godfather, good and evil.
*  That's your favorite movie.
*  Yeah.
*  What makes it great, do you think?
*  The characters, the study of family.
*  Of justice, of power.
*  What connects with you?
*  Oh, I mean, every one of those themes connects in the real,
*  and it connects in a cinematic way as well.
*  The difference I think with me and The Godfather was
*  I seen it during the period of time when my father was absent.
*  And therefore, family structure and family values was actually adopted
*  in my family because of that.
*  Me and my brother Devon, we actually took so much heed to that movie in our family life.
*  And we kind of mimic that family in its structure of somebody has to be the leader of the family,
*  even if it was the younger.
*  Michael was younger than Sonny and Fredro.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But he was worthy.
*  And my brother Devon is older than me, and my brother King is older than me.
*  And it's funny, sometimes Devon calls King Fredro, and I know King wants to.
*  Because King, he actually was, he could beat our ass, see my language.
*  But you're Michael.
*  Yeah.
*  And not by choice, just by definition of that's what I am.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And it's just a blessing for me to have my older sister, my older brothers,
*  and my younger brothers look to me as just as a good light in the family.
*  And like I said, that movie helped us.
*  My sisters too.
*  The cool thing about my family, I don't know if I share this a lot,
*  we all watch these movies together.
*  And so the eight diagram, Pole Fighter, Master Killer,
*  Five Deadly Vinners, my family knows these movies.
*  It's not just I know them.
*  And then you extend it further, my friends know them too.
*  So there's a language that we all can have
*  that actually film has informed a communication.
*  So The Godfather, which also is still a fictitional story of
*  something.
*  But since it was based in reality, based on something real,
*  and it was human, it wasn't so heightened.
*  I think the privity of it resonates.
*  And the privity of it is something that resonates with me.
*  You got to plan ahead.
*  He didn't want to deal with the drugs, but that time of business was upon him.
*  It's almost like, this is a tough one, sometimes when the Muslim brothers come from
*  the Middle East to America, and they open up delis, they would sell ham.
*  And we would go in there and complain to them, and they used to get mad at us when we came.
*  That's as a kid, but as a man, I'm like, yo, he's here to sell.
*  Now he still don't have to sell to him.
*  Fido Coleon didn't want to sell the drugs.
*  Okay, he didn't have to do it.
*  He didn't do it.
*  And it cost him some bullets to eventually somebody in the family ended up doing it.
*  What about this idea that family before everything else?
*  So there's different laws you live according to in this world, and family is first.
*  Yeah, that's mathematically correct.
*  I don't like that.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I mean, there's a certain sense of, you look at powerful people, you look at Putin,
*  there's a certain sense in which the people who are in the inner circle,
*  that's who you take care of, that's family.
*  And anyone else that crosses you, that there's a different set of ethics
*  under which you operate for those people.
*  Well, Jesus said the same thing.
*  When he said love thy neighbor and thy brother, he was talking about that community.
*  When the other lady, the Samaritan, say, hey, Jesus, I'm not feeling,
*  my brother not feeling so well, and he say, give not that which is holy unto the dogs.
*  If you're going to tell a woman, give not that which is holy unto the dogs,
*  and she's a woman, you just called her a dog.
*  If I translate that into hip hop, she's a female, he called her a dog.
*  I know how that goes.
*  But she said to him, but even a dog is allowed to eat the crumbs
*  that falls from the master's table.
*  And he went and helped.
*  Now let's go back to what you said about Putin or Vito Kodalono, myself and my family.
*  Of course, the family is first.
*  But once the family is good, it has to then spread to the community,
*  then to the state, country, world.
*  The problem we have sometimes is that, and this is the reason why a lot of powerful families
*  was overthrown, why do they behead their own king with the guillotine?
*  Once the family was strong, they didn't let the wealth, the opportunity, expand out.
*  You know, you look at Wu Tang, yes, our family was made strong first, but then
*  all the Wu members able to form their own corporations, and they had their own subfamilies.
*  It has to grow out.
*  And they took over the world.
*  You've talked about being vegan.
*  I don't think I heard you explain this because it connects somehow about how you think about life.
*  So you talk about when your family's good, you grow that circle of empathy, you grow the community.
*  Is that how you think about being vegan?
*  That just the capacity of living beings on earth to suffer,
*  that you just don't want to add suffering to them?
*  Yeah. I mean, you said it clear.
*  It's like nothing in all reality.
*  In all reality, I came to a realization that nothing really has to die for me to live.
*  No animal.
*  The plants themselves, right?
*  So let's just say, you want a steak, which is probably the most,
*  I don't know the most expensive piece of meat, but let's just say the steak is top of the line,
*  nice steak.
*  And you eating the steak for the protein to help build your muscle.
*  And I don't know if you got it from a cow or a bull,
*  whether it's the cow or the bull, they grow to about 1500 pounds.
*  And if it's a bull, it's all muscley muscle.
*  And it's only eating grass.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's possible to both as an athlete and just as a human being to perform well without eating meat.
*  There's something, especially in the way we're treating animals,
*  to deliver that meat to the plate.
*  I think about that a lot.
*  So I'm a robotics person, AI person, and I think a lot about,
*  I don't know if you think about this kind of stuff, but building AI systems as they become
*  more and more human-like, you start to ask the question of, are we okay?
*  If we give the capacity for AI systems to suffer, first to feel, but then to suffer,
*  to hate and to love, to feel emotion, how do we deal with that?
*  It starts asking the same question as you ask of animals.
*  Are we okay adding that suffering to the world?
*  Right. And I don't think we should add the suffering because it's not necessary.
*  Like, look, if it's necessary, right, because we're survival or the first law of nature is
*  self-preservation, if you are in a desert and there's nothing else to eat but that lizard,
*  yeah, okay, you got to do what you got to do.
*  Lizard's got to go.
*  Yeah, you got to go. You got to do what you got to do because at the end of the day,
*  man is, when they say man has dominion over these things, his dominion is almost like a caretaker.
*  The way we do our dominion, we dominate it, eat it, cook it.
*  Who's the first guy that looked at the lobster?
*  He was like, I'm going to eat this thing.
*  First of all, it's hard to eat it. You got to go through a process to get that.
*  A crab, I remember we used to eat crabs when we was kids,
*  and I didn't know why I was always getting itchy throats and all that. You know, you care,
*  you don't know, just eat. But at the end of the day, a crab didn't provide no more than
*  a finger worth of meat maybe. And it's hell getting that thing, getting it out.
*  It's like, it's not worth it in all reality. You could have gave me a banana and did better for my
*  body and my appetite and my being fulfilled as full. Look at the blessings of life, right?
*  If you take a seed, when you get an apple and you eat it,
*  in that apple, there's multiple seeds in it. If you plant that seed, it'll give you a whole tree
*  with a whole bunch of apples with all multiple seeds. But if you kill a fish,
*  it can't reproduce, it's done. If you kill a cat, it's done. It's nothing coming back.
*  But when you deal with the plants, even after you eat the apple and then you defecate,
*  your defecation is what feeds the ground, the cause of apple to grow more.
*  Yeah, it's a circle of life. And especially there's a guy named David Foster Wallace,
*  he wrote a short story called Consider the Lobster. If you actually think philosophically
*  about what, from a perspective of a lobster, that's symbolic of something because you're
*  basically put in the water, like cold water, and then it heats up slowly until it's no more.
*  It's torture, yeah. It must have been like... Then they started eating lobsters in the Inquisition.
*  Yeah, yeah. They just enjoy... They probably enjoyed torturing animals and they realized
*  they're also delicious after the torture is finished. That's probably how they discovered it.
*  Let me ask you a question. I know you're asking me the questions, but I just want to talk a little
*  bit about the AI and you said something about trying to put the emotion in it.
*  Yeah.
*  Right? So are you thinking there's an algorithm for emotion?
*  Yes. But I think emotion isn't something that there's an algorithm for for a particular system.
*  We create emotions together. So emotion is something, like this conversation,
*  it's like magic we create together. So I've worked with quite a few robots. I've a very simple version
*  of that. I've had Roomba vacuum cleaners. I've had them make different sounds and one of them is
*  screaming in pain lightly. And just having them do that when you kick them or when they run into
*  stuff. Immediately, I start to feel something for them.
*  Right. So the emotion, okay, so the emotion you're saying is
*  imposed back on the human. But I'm asking, do you think there's an algorithm for the emotion to
*  be imposed from machine to machine? Yeah, that's a really good way to ask it.
*  It's difficult because I think ultimately I only know how to exist in the human world.
*  So it's like, it's the question of if a tree falls in the forest, nobody's there to see it,
*  does it still fall? I still think that ultimately machines will have to show emotion to other humans
*  and that's when it becomes real. I've been thinking about this a lot too. And I just, okay.
*  Now I'll come here to with this because I've been thinking about this and this is your field.
*  Yeah. Well, do you think emotion is wave?
*  Like light is wave or think it's particle?
*  So emotion is just a small, it's like a shadow of something bigger. And I think that bigger thing
*  is consciousness. So emotion is just- I don't know if it's a wave or a particle.
*  Y'all haven't thought about that? I have thought about it, whether it's,
*  there's something like, well, the consciousness or emotion is a law of physics. Like if it's
*  that fundamental to the universe. I had a lyric that said this. It comes out,
*  they did this documentary about the planet and I wrote a song, it's called The World of Confusion.
*  And I'll try to paraphrase the lyric, but in the world of the confusion where there's so
*  much illusions, we suck the blood from the planet. Now it needs a transfusion and the
*  redistribution of wealth, of health and wealth of self and a deeper understanding about mental
*  health. The doctor prescribed the physical solution. The psychiatrist wants to build a bigger
*  institution, but neither have the solution or the equation to make an instrument to measure the weight
*  of the hate vibration. What is the weight of hate? Is it heavier than the weight of love?
*  Is it heavier than the weight of lead inside of a slug with just 10 milligrams is all it takes to
*  kill a man? But anyways, then I go on from there. But the question, you see the question there.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can be measured. Can that be measured? I think so. I think so.
*  Just don't got the instrument yet. Yeah. We're in the dark ages of that, but I think it could
*  be measured. I think there's something physical, like something that connects us all this much.
*  We tend to think we humans are distinct entities and we move about this world, but I think there's
*  some deeper connection. But we're so, listen, science is in the, we just had a few breakthroughs
*  in the past hundred years from Einstein on the theoretical physics side. We don't know anything
*  about human psychology. We barely know much about human biology. We're trying to figure it all out.
*  Yeah. I had another theory because you think about quantum, right? As long as you say that
*  there's an uncertainty and you have me believe there's an uncertainty, then there's an uncertainty.
*  But if there's not an uncertainty, what happens? So I'm only saying that it's not sad. Because
*  you look at quantum computers, they're going to give you the O, the one, the one, the O. They're
*  going to take two things and make it eight things. And by the time you multiply four of those things
*  together, it's like this chess board, right? The moves goes into the millions. But
*  the thing that's introduced is the uncertainty, right? You're going to make a move.
*  You know this already, right? Because this has been played a thousand times, but sooner or later,
*  something uncertain is going to come in or make your next move.
*  I like the weight of these. They add the certainty. I think just like Kootenai,
*  unpredictable. There's something about us humans that really doesn't like everything to be fully
*  predictable. I mean, chess too is perfectly solvable. There's nothing unpredictable about
*  chess. Right. I could agree to that because Bobby Fischer said in one of his books, which I actually
*  love what he said. He said, every game of chess is a draw. The only way somebody wins is when one of
*  us makes a mistake. It doesn't get any better than that. What is chess? Like, how do you think about
*  chess? What's at the core of your interest in chess? Do you see kung fu, music, film, all of it,
*  life, all just living through chess? Yeah. It's the most stimulating passage of time for me.
*  That's also, it's like, it's a pastime that stimulates my mind, my music, my thoughts about
*  life at the same time. So while some pastimes, like say baseball is a pastime,
*  and baseball can stimulate you depending on how you look at it. But most likely,
*  you're not going to get this much brain activation, this much calculation,
*  and this much thinking about yourself in a game of baseball. I mean, the player maybe, but not the
*  viewer. Chess is something that I can engage in too. And even though it's a pastime,
*  it's giving me all the stimulation of real time in my life.
*  It's funny because it's also, it's a funny game because it's connected through centuries of play.
*  Just some of the most interesting people in the history of the world have played this game
*  and have struggled with whatever, have projected their struggles onto the chessboard and thought,
*  and the nations have fought over the chessboard. The Soviet Union versus the United States,
*  Bobby Fischer represented the United States. Spassky represented the Soviet Union.
*  Yeah. I gotta, before I lose track of it, when we were talking about The Godfather,
*  you were in American Gangster, great film. You said it's one of your favorites too.
*  You were in it with Denzel Washington. What makes that movie meaningful to you?
*  What was it like making that movie? Because it's a great, great American film.
*  That was a great American film. There was so many things in that film. Being a part of that film was
*  probably a blessing or a treasure. Because even if I wasn't a part of it, this court sets great
*  filmmaking and to me, a really cool, great story. The thing that I love about it the most
*  really is the process of it.
*  Which part of the process?
*  I wouldn't have known the process if I wasn't part of it. So as a film, Joy, it was a great film.
*  But even the process of making it was like high level education for me on multiple levels.
*  I'm working with Ridley Scott, which is, and this is a bold statement if I say this here,
*  because I got a lot of friends that's going to probably, but he's probably the best living director.
*  Because watching him allowed me to understand a principle that I've coined to him,
*  and I don't know if people use it yet, called multi-vision.
*  He seems to have the capacity to see eight things at one time. I heard on Robin Hood he had 18 cameras.
*  I wasn't there for that.
*  And you think he keeps them all in his mind, just see-
*  I seen him do it when he went to the monitors with the video playback guy.
*  I seen him bring everything back to a point, but nothing was the same on the frame.
*  He was already there. And he knew if he had what he was or not.
*  And he placed the cameras there. And he saw it in his own way. And I peeped it.
*  And I peeped it. And I said, yo. And I just humbly asked him. He was like,
*  he was gracious enough to speak to me and talk to me and confirm what I thought I saw.
*  He confirmed it?
*  He confirmed it. And I was able to utilize it, as I'm a filmmaker now.
*  And I see, I can at least see three or four things. I can't see eight yet. I'll be there though.
*  But I could definitely, even right now, I could go like this in the room.
*  Boom. Okay. I got it now. I got like, how to make this right here, which is just us all sitting.
*  How do I make this, look. Boom. Come on on, him.
*  There's a story there.
*  There's a story there. And I might just go off his hanging watch or his hanging wristband.
*  Because there's something else there too.
*  Is he dead? We don't know.
*  Exactly. So he has this. And even though this is the scene-
*  Yeah. You keeping that in mind, all of this in mind.
*  Yeah.
*  What about, can you give an inkling of other parts of the process, like the editing?
*  Another thing.
*  Another thing. Pedro, I don't pronounce Pedro last name right. He's a cool guy. I had a chance to
*  play rugby with him. He was on, was he on my team? Yeah. Well, we were in both teams.
*  But Pedro, the editor who edit many great films, once again, he has,
*  I will call it the ciphering power. A good editor is a decipher, almost like breaking the enigma.
*  Because he's dealing with thousands or we'll call it a film with millions of feet of film,
*  at least a million feet of film. That's a lot of film for a feature. He's dealing with that.
*  But he's dealing with multiple cameras.
*  Yeah.
*  So it ain't like it's like two cameras. He got an A, B, and he could just go back. No. He may have
*  six cameras and he has to go back and deal with that process. And you know what? He knows how to
*  tell the story again. And he proved it on American Gangster as me being a witness,
*  because it's so much information. Even when the brothers all start getting their little business
*  and he picked one of the Bronx, and he just captured every neighborhood within one minute.
*  And you knew what would happen. You knew it all. You saw the whole rise of fame. You watched the
*  Palmer and Scarface who does it in two minutes, but it's only one character. So you see him go to
*  the bank. He drops the money off. You see him by the lion. You see him against his wife or the tiger.
*  You see him against his wife. You see all that. And then it ends on a big shot of him in the big
*  house with all the TV screens. And you seen him go through it. But in American Gangster, you're
*  going to tell that story of rising, but you also got to include these five brothers.
*  Yeah. And that's all in the edit. Oh man.
*  But also all in the director, knowing that as well.
*  And you got to keep track. You got to keep thinking about them because that was a story
*  right there. Yeah. While I was hearing it, I don't know if they was taking pictures of him or
*  everybody's having a little party over there. Yeah. Jess, I think. Yeah, I like it. They're playing
*  chess. This is great. You said that you were always an old soul and see the world as if you're
*  200 years old. I like this because your creative vision allows you to see the final piece you've
*  created or you're creating very quickly, quicker than others. I heard that as if you've almost like
*  lived many lives. So you have this experience that allows you to see the vision. So let me ask you
*  on creativity. Where does this creativity behind, where does it come from? Both musically and film
*  wise. I don't know if I have the answer to that one. Seriously, where does it come from?
*  Only thing I could say about that is that for some reason it seems endless.
*  It seems endless. And that's peculiar when I think about it myself because I was taught
*  a lot of things from the jizzer. He introduced me to mathematics. He introduced me to hip hop itself,
*  to break dancing. I got other cousins that introduced me to graffiti,
*  the cousins that introduced me to DJing. I realized that I had a lot of introductions,
*  but the jizzer definitely, my older cousin gave me a lot of early inspirations.
*  Not saying that he's not as creative as he was then or now, I just didn't see the wide span of
*  creativity. I don't see him doing that. And I don't see the cousins that taught me how to DJ.
*  I didn't see them move from DJing to making the beats. My cousin that actually got me into
*  instruments, I didn't see him leave funk and rock. He didn't go, like I'm an orchestra
*  composer now. So I just said to myself, I just accept myself as an artist, as a creative artist.
*  That's what I am. I have to accept that. Now where it comes from, I don't know if I was to
*  try to say where it comes from. Like, hey, give me some type of answer. I would say from life itself.
*  But what does it feel like? Because you mentioned during this pandemic, for example,
*  some reason more came to you in terms of writing. And so do you feel like you're just receiving
*  signals from elsewhere or do you feel like it's hard work or you're just waiting?
*  Wow. It's not even waiting. No, it's hard work. It's almost like I said in one of my other lyrics,
*  this is for the MC part of it. I said MCing to me is easy as breathing.
*  So it's like breathing.
*  Yeah. It's just like, in fact, there's actually was a scientific thing I read about that.
*  Now that you said that, you heard this, I know you've had to hear this. They say that
*  the atoms in our atmosphere, which seem to be infinite in number, are not infinite in the space
*  they occupy. Right? Because they're in our atmosphere. And so there's a chance that at
*  least one million atoms that you breathe in your life was breathed by Galileo. You heard this
*  before, right? Yeah. Okay. It's very accurate. Okay. How does your body digest it?
*  Well, let's start at the fact that most of the atoms that we're made of is from stars,
*  right? Stars bursting. So we're all really connected fundamentally somehow. And then
*  the atoms that make up our body come and leave. And the same with the cells that are in our body.
*  They die and are reborn and we don't pay attention to any of that. That all just goes through us.
*  I don't know. That makes me feel like I'm not an individual. I'm just a finger of something much
*  bigger, some much bigger organism. Well, because you're drinking the coffee there. Yeah. Right?
*  You want to digest that. You want to digest those atoms, whether you want to put them through the
*  bowel or through the urination, you want to digest that. You want to digest that. You want to digest
*  the bowel or through the urination. It's coming out. Or maybe you'll sweat it out. Yeah. You might
*  sneeze it out. Yeah. But they're going to make their way out. How do you digest the atoms if
*  you just breathed in Galileo? Right? How do... And that's what I think an artist does. I think
*  something in the artist... It's like some people eat things and they're going to gain weight. Some
*  people ain't going to gain weight. They're going to gain muscle. I'm just giving you an analogy
*  here. I'm thinking that the artist breathes in and translates it into the art. First, they got to
*  hear it. I think most of us don't hear that. Don't... We receive it, but it just isn't...
*  Right. Yeah. We not have the frequency. I said this to a lot of artists. We all could consider
*  ourselves artists in a certain way, but not... But let's just say there's only
*  one million artists in the world. Good. If you divide that into the population,
*  what part of the table would it be? A tiny part.
*  It might be that, right? Yeah. And yet it's that that inspires that.
*  Oh yeah. And you know what's so crazy about that though? There's also a chance... I'm just
*  going numbers and I'm just hypothesizing with you, but there's also a chance that all of this
*  is actually informing that. Yeah. The artist is just watching this, all of this,
*  all the chaos of this. Yeah. So it's hard to know where the beauty comes from. Is it the artist or
*  the chaos from the... So I just... I don't have the answer, but if I was to be forced to say
*  a something, you know, I'll twist my arm, but... Yeah. I can if you want me to.
*  No, thank you. I'll say life. Yeah. Life.
*  In Tao of Wu, you write something about confusion, which I really like.
*  Confusion is a gift from God. Those times when you feel most desperate for a solution, sit,
*  wait. The information will become clear. The confusion is there to guide you.
*  Seek detachment and become the producer of your life. So I got to ask you advice. If
*  a young person today in high school, college is looking for some advice, what advice could you
*  give them to be a producer of a life that can be proud of? Read the Tao of Wu.
*  Let's start with the Wu Tang manual first. Yeah. No, you can do that second.
*  Second? Yeah. I think you can read the Tao of Wu first and then do the manual.
*  Because the manual is not to put the two books against each other, but the manual is talking
*  about things that is so deeply connected to the music and the people and the Tao of Wu
*  goes beyond that. So I would actually start there, which is not normally how I prescribe.
*  I always tell people, start in knowledge, then go to wisdom. Yeah. But since the Tao...
*  Skip ahead to the wisdom. I like it. Yeah. I think for a young man in high school,
*  go to the Tao of Wu and then go back. It's just like sometimes,
*  my son's generation, they had to watch the second round of Star Wars.
*  Then go back. This generation is watching The Force Awakens and then they go back.
*  Because if you just look at your life as an example, that's one heck of a life.
*  There's very few lives like it. You've created some of the most incredible things artistically
*  in this world. You talk about that one million, right? At the corner of the table.
*  If somebody once strives, dreams to become one of those, how do they do it?
*  Well, the beautiful thing is that there are footprints left by those who've done it.
*  It's the best way is to study that. To study those who've already done what you want to do.
*  We live on the civilizations. We say this is the greatest country in the world, but our seal is a
*  pyramid with an eye on it. Because they did it before and they may have failed for some reason
*  or something happens, but it was just a strong enough example to take us further.
*  Elon Musk is sitting here trying to do better than what the rocket builders did before. He's
*  not the first one to build the rocket. He's not the first guy to think of the electric car.
*  He's doing it better. He's advancing it to the point that whoever picks up after him,
*  maybe they'll get to that flying car. So that's the beauty. There's a good verse. I love finding
*  verses that say things to confirm because this way people could take it verbally, physically,
*  and then maybe even spiritually. But Christmas has said a verse. He said,
*  the fastest way to heaven is by spending time or studying the wise people. Meaning the wise people
*  who was living and those who lived before you. Study the masters. Let me ask you a big,
*  perhaps ridiculous question, but give it a shot. What is the meaning of this whole thing? What's
*  the meaning of life? Big question. I'm not going to rush into the answer.
*  I'm going to give you somebody else answer first and I'll give you my answer. I remember acting this
*  in, I don't know, I was 15, 16 years old. One of the brothers, we're studying in mathematics
*  and the letter I itself means I, Islam. I meaning the individual being a total accord with Islam.
*  And let me just finish this. Then they took the word Islam and they defined it.
*  That Islam is an Arabic word for peace. Then they said peace is the absence of confusion.
*  So then they took, this is something that really hit me when I was, I never forgot it and I'm
*  going to decipher it. But then they took the word Islam and they broke it down by the letter
*  into an acronym like cash rule, everything around me. And they broke it down to I
*  stimulate light and matter. Because what hit me is that if you're not here,
*  then light and matter don't exist to you. So you're stimulating it or it ain't here for you.
*  So anyway, taking all that. So then I said, so what's the meaning of life?
*  And the brothers just said, love Islam forever.
*  Right. I'm not saying the religious point of it. I'm just saying all those other elements I just
*  spoke about in front of it. I stimulate light and matter. I love that. That's powerful.
*  That's powerful. And let me give you my definition of life.
*  I think life is that simple for each and every one of us to add on to.
*  Build, like you said, the masters build on top.
*  Life gave you life, give life back.
*  I don't think there's a better way to end it than talking about the meaning of life.
*  RZA, I'm a huge fan. It's such a huge honor that you spend your valuable time with me.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Bye, Amy. Peace.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with RZA. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from
*  Plato. Poetry is nearer to vital truth than history. Thank you for listening and hope to
*  see you next time.
