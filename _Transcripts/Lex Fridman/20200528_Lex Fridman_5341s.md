*  around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Carl Friston. How much of the human brain
*  do we understand from the low level of neuronal communication to the functional level,
*  to the highest level, maybe the psychiatric disorder level?
*  Well, we're certainly in a better position than we were last century.
*  How far we've got to go, I think, is almost an unanswerable question. So you'd have to set the
*  parameters. What constitutes understanding? What level of understanding do you want? I think
*  we've made enormous progress in terms of broad brush principles. Whether that affords a detailed
*  cartography of the functional anatomy of the brain and what it does right down to the microcircuitry
*  in the neurons, that's probably out of reach at the present time.
*  So the cartography, so mapping the brain, do you think mapping of the brain, the detailed,
*  perfect imaging of it, does that get us closer to understanding of the mind, of the brain? So how far
*  does it get us if we have that perfect cartography of the brain?
*  I think there are lower bounds on that. It's a really interesting question.
*  And it would determine the sort of scientific career you'd pursue if you believe that knowing
*  every dendritic connection, every sort of microscopic synaptic structure right down
*  to the molecular level was going to give you the right kind of information to understand
*  the computational anatomy. Then you'd choose to be a microscopist and you would study little
*  cubic millimetres of brain for the rest of your life. If on the other hand, you were interested
*  in holistic functions and a sort of functional anatomy of the sort that a neuropsychologist
*  would understand, you'd study brain lesions and strokes, just looking at the whole person.
*  So again, it comes back to at what level do you want understanding?
*  I think there are principled reasons not to go too far. If you commit to a view of the brain
*  as a machine that's performing a form of inference and representing things,
*  and there are that understanding, that level of understanding is necessarily cast in terms
*  of probability densities and ensemble densities, distributions. And what that tells you is that
*  you don't really want to look at the atoms to understand the thermodynamics of probabilistic
*  descriptions of how the brain works. So I personally wouldn't look at the molecules or
*  indeed the single neurons in the same way if I wanted to understand the thermodynamics of some
*  non-equilibrium steady state of a gas or an active material. I wouldn't spend my life looking at the
*  individual molecules that constitute that ensemble. I'd look at their collective behaviour.
*  On the other hand, if you go too coarse grain, you're going to miss some basic canonical
*  principles of connectivity and architectures. I'm thinking here this bit colloquial, but
*  there's current excitement about high field magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla. Why? Well,
*  it gives us for the first time the opportunity to look at the brain in action at the level of a few
*  millimetres that distinguish between different layers of the cortex that may be very important
*  in terms of evincing generic principles of canonical microcircuitry that are replicated
*  throughout the brain that may tell us something fundamental about message passing in the brain
*  and these density dynamics of neuronal or some of the population dynamics that underwrite our
*  brain function. So somewhere between a millimetre and a metre.
*  Lingering for a bit on the big questions, if you allow me, what to you is the most beautiful
*  or surprising characteristic of the human brain? I think it's hierarchical and recursive aspect,
*  it's recurrent aspect. Of the structure or of the actual representation of power of the brain?
*  Well, I think one speaks to the other. I was actually answering in a dull-minded way from
*  the point of view of purely its anatomy and its structural aspects. I mean, there are many marvelous
*  organs in the body. Let's take your liver, for example. Without it, you wouldn't be around for
*  very long. And it does some beautiful and delicate biochemistry and homeostasis and evolved with a
*  finesse that would easily parallel the brain, but it doesn't have a beautiful anatomy. It has
*  a simple anatomy, which is attractive in a minimalist sense, but it doesn't have that
*  crafted structure of sparse connectivity and that recurrence and that specialisation that the brain
*  has. So you said a lot of interesting terms here. So the recurrence, the sparsity, but you also
*  started by saying hierarchical. So I've never thought of our brain as hierarchical.
*  Sort of, I always thought it's just like a giant mess, interconnected mess where it's very difficult
*  to figure anything out. But in what sense do you see the brain as hierarchical?
*  Well, I see it as it's not a magic soup. Which of course is what I used to think before I
*  studied medicine and the like. So a lot of those terms imply each other. So hierarchies,
*  if you just think about the nature of a hierarchy, how would you actually build one? And what you
*  would have to do is basically carefully remove the right connections that destroy the completely
*  connected soups that you might have in mind. So a hierarchy is in and of itself defined by a sparse
*  and particular connectivity structure. I'm not committing to any particular form of hierarchy.
*  But your sense is there is some.
*  Oh, absolutely. Yeah. In virtue of the fact that there is a sparsity of connectivity,
*  not necessarily of a qualitative sort, but certainly for quantitative sort. So
*  there are, it is demonstrably so that they're further apart, two parts of the brain are,
*  the less likely that they are to be wired, to possess axonal processes, neuronal processes
*  directly communicate one message or messages from one part of the brain to the other part of the
*  brain. So we know there's a sparse connectivity. And furthermore, on the basis of anatomical
*  connectivity and tracer studies, we know that sparsity underwrites a hierarchical and very
*  structured sort of connectivity that might be best understood a little bit like an onion.
*  There is a concentric, sometimes referred to as centripetal by people like Marcel Masulam,
*  hierarchical organization to the brain. So you can think of the brain as in a rough sense,
*  like an onion and all the sensory information and all the afferent outgoing messages that supply
*  commands to your muscles or to your secretory organs come from the surface. So there's a massive
*  exchange interface with the world out there on the surface. And then underneath there's a little
*  layer that sits and looks at the exchange on the surface. And then underneath that there's a layer
*  right the way down to the very center, to the deepest part of the onion.
*  That's what I mean by a hierarchical organization. There's a discernible
*  structure defined by the sparsity of connections that lends the architecture a hierarchical
*  structure that tells one a lot about the kinds of representations and messages. So coming back to your
*  earlier question, is this about the representational capacity or is it about the anatomy? Well,
*  one underwrites the other. If one simply thinks of the brain as a message passing machine,
*  a process that is in the service of doing something, then the circuitry and the connectivity
*  that shape that message passing also dictate its function.
*  So you've done a lot of amazing work in a lot of directions. So let's look at one aspect of that,
*  of looking into the brain and trying to study this onion structure. What can we learn about the brain
*  by imaging it, which is one way to sort of look at the anatomy of it, broadly speaking. What are the
*  methods of imaging, but even bigger, what can we learn about it? Right. So well, most imaging,
*  human neuroimaging that you might see in science journals that speaks to the way the brain works
*  measures brain activity over time. So that's the first thing to say that we're effectively looking
*  at fluctuations in neuronal responses, usually in response to some sensory input or some instruction,
*  some task. Not necessarily, there's a lot of interest in just looking at the brain
*  in terms of resting state and dodging this or intrinsic activity. But crucially, at every point,
*  looking at these fluctuations, either induced or intrinsic in the neural activity and understanding
*  them at two levels. So normally people would recourse to two principles of brain organization
*  that are complimentary, one functional specialization or segregation. So what does that mean? It simply
*  means that there are certain parts of the brain that may be specialized for certain kinds of
*  processing. For example, visual motion, our ability to recognize or to perceive movement
*  in the visual world. And furthermore, that specialized processing may be spatially or
*  anatomically segregated, leading to functional segregation, which means that if I were to compare
*  your brain activity during a period of static viewing, a static image, and then compare that to
*  the responses of fluctuations in the brain when you were exposed to a moving image, say a flying
*  bird, we'd expect to see restricted segregated differences in activity. And those are basically
*  the hotspots that you see in the statistical parametric maps that test for the significance
*  of the responses that are circumscribed. So now basically we're talking about some people have,
*  perhaps unkindly called a neocartography. This is a phrenology augmented by modern day
*  neuroimaging, basically finding blobs or bumps on the brain that do this or do that. I'm trying to
*  understand the cartography of that functional specialization. So how much is there such,
*  that's such a beautiful sort of ideal to strive for. We humans, scientists would like this
*  to hope that there's a beautiful structure to this, whereas like you said, there's segregated
*  regions that are responsible for the different function. How much hope is there to find such
*  regions in terms of looking at the progress of studying the brain?
*  Oh, I think enormous progress has been made in the past 20 or 30 years. So this is beyond incremental.
*  At the advent of brain imaging, the very notion of functional segregation was just a hypothesis
*  based upon a century, if not more of careful neuropsychology, looking at people who had lost
*  via insult or traumatic brain injury, particular parts of the brain and then say, well, they can't
*  do this or they can't do that. For example, losing the visual cortex and not being able to see
*  or losing particular parts of the visual cortex or regions known as V5 or the middle temporal
*  region MT and noticing that they selectively could not see moving things. And so that created the
*  hypothesis that perhaps movement processing, visual movement processing was located in this
*  functionally segregated area. And you could then go and put invasive electrodes in animal models
*  and say, yes, indeed, we can excite activity here. We can form receptive fields that are sensitive
*  to or defined in terms of visual motion. But at no point could you exclude the possibility
*  that everywhere else in the brain was also very interested in visual motion.
*  By the way, I apologize to interrupt, but it's a tiny little tangent. You said animal models,
*  just out of curiosity from your perspective, how different is the human brain versus the other
*  animals in terms of our ability to study the brain?
*  Well, clearly the further away you go from a human brain, the greater the differences,
*  but not as remarkable as you might think. So people will choose their level of
*  approximation to the human brain depending upon the kinds of questions that they want to answer.
*  So if you're talking about sort of canonical principles of microcircuitry, it might be
*  perfectly okay to look at a mouse. Indeed, you could even look at flies, worms. If on the other
*  hand, you wanted to look at the finer details of organization of visual cortex and V1, V2,
*  these are designated sort of patches of cortex that may do different things, indeed do.
*  You probably want to use a primate that looked a little bit more like a human because there are
*  lots of ethical issues in terms of the use of non-human primates to answer questions about
*  human anatomy. But I think most people assume that most of the important principles are conserved
*  in a continuous way, right from worms right through to you and me.
*  So now returning to this, that was the early ideas of studying the functional regions of the brain
*  by if there's some damage to it to try to infer that that part of the brain might be somewhat
*  responsible for this type of function. So where does that lead us? What are the next steps beyond
*  that? Well, this actually is reverse a bit, come back to your sort of notion that the brain is a
*  magic soup. That was actually a very prominent idea at one point, notions such as Lashley's law
*  of mass action inherited from the observation that for certain animals, if you just took out
*  spoonfuls of the brain, it didn't matter where you took these spoonfuls out, they always show
*  the same kinds of deficits. So it was very difficult to infer functional specialisation
*  purely on the basis of lesion deficit studies. But once we had the opportunity to look at the
*  brain lighting up in its excitement, neuronal excitement, when looking at this versus that,
*  one was able to say, yes, indeed, these functionally specialised responses are very restricted and
*  they're here or they're over there. If I do this, then this part of the brain lights up.
*  And that became doable in the early 90s. In fact, shortly before with the advent of
*  post-traumatic emission tomography, and then functional magnetic resonance imaging came along
*  in the early 90s. And since that time, there has been an explosion of discovery, refinement,
*  and confirmation. There are people who believe that it's all in the anatomy. If you understand
*  the anatomy, then you understand the function at some level. And many, many hypotheses were predicated
*  on a deep understanding of the anatomy and the connectivity, but they were all confirmed and
*  taken much further with neuroimaging. So that's what I meant by we've made an enormous amount of
*  progress in this century indeed, and in relation to the previous century, by looking at these
*  functionally selective responses. But that wasn't the whole story. So there's this sort of near
*  phrenology, but finding bumps and hotspots in the brain that did this or that. The bigger question
*  was, of course, the functional integration, how all of these regionally specific responses were
*  orchestrated, how they were distributed, how did they relate to distributed processing and indeed
*  representations in the brain? So then you turn to the more challenging issue of the integration,
*  the connectivity. And then we come back to this beautiful, sparse, recurrent, hierarchical
*  connectivity that seems characteristic of the brain and probably not many other organs.
*  And, but nevertheless, we come back to this challenge of trying to figure out how everything
*  is integrated. But what's your feeling? What's the general consensus? Have we moved away from
*  the magic soup view of the brain? So there is a deep structure to it. And then maybe
*  further question, you said some people believe that the structure is most of it, that you can
*  really get at the core of the function by just deeply understanding the structure. Where do you
*  sit on that? I think it's got some mileage to it. Yes. Yeah. So it's a worthy pursuit of going,
*  of studying through imaging and all the different methods to actually study.
*  No, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I'm just noting you were accusing me of using lots of long words
*  and then you introduced one there, which is deep, which is interesting. Because deep is the sort of
*  millennial equivalent of hierarchical. So if you put deep in front of anything,
*  you're very millennial and very trending, but you're also implying a hierarchical architecture.
*  So it is a depth, which is for me, the beautiful thing. That's right. The word deep kind of,
*  yeah, exactly. It implies hierarchy. I didn't even think about that. That indeed the implicit
*  meaning of the word deep is a hierarchy. Yep. Yeah. Yep. So deep inside the onion is the center
*  of your soul. That's a beautiful put maybe briefly, if you could paint a picture of the kind of methods
*  of neuroimaging, maybe the history, which you were a part of, you know, from statistical parametric
*  mapping. I mean, just what, what's out there that's interesting for people, maybe outside the field
*  that to understand of what are the actual methodologies of looking inside the human brain?
*  Right. Well, you can answer that question from two perspectives. Basically it's the modality,
*  what kind of signal are you measuring? And they can range from, and let's limit ourselves to some
*  imaging based non-invasive techniques. So you essentially got brain scanners and brain scanners
*  can either measure the structural attributes, the amount of water, the amount of fat or the amount of
*  iron in different parts of the brain. And you can make lots of inferences about the structure of the
*  organ of the sort that you might have, um, have to use from an X ray, but a, you know, a very nuanced
*  X ray that there's looking at this kind of property of that kind of property. Uh, so looking at the
*  anatomy, not invasively is, would be the first sort of neuroimaging that people might want to employ.
*  Then you move on to the kinds of measurements that, um, reflect dynamic function. Um, the
*  most prevalent of those fall into two camps. You've got these, um, metabolic, sometimes
*  hemodynamic blood related signals. So these metabolic, um, and, or hemodynamic signals
*  are basically proxies for, um, elevated activity and message passing and, and, you know, um,
*  neuronal dynamics in particular parts of the brain. Characteristically though, the time constants of
*  these hemodynamic or metabolic responses to neural activity are much longer than the neural
*  activity itself. And this is, um, this is referring, forgive me for the dumb questions,
*  but this would be referring to blood route, like the flow of blood. Absolutely. So there's a ton of,
*  it seems like there's a ton of blood vessels in the brain. So what, what's the interaction between
*  the flow of blood and the function of the new neurons? Is there an interplay there or?
*  And that interplay, um, accounts for several careers of world renowned scientists. Yes,
*  absolutely. Um, so this is known as neurovascular coupling is exactly what you said. It's how,
*  how does the neural activity, the neural infrastructure, the actual message passing that
*  we think, um, um, underlies our capacity to perceive and act, how is that coupled to the
*  vascular responses that supply the energy for that neural processing? So there's a delicate web
*  of large vessels, arteries and veins that gets progressively finer and finer in detail until it
*  perfuses at a microscopic level, the machinery where little neurons lie. So coming back to this
*  sort of onion perspective, we were talking before using the onion as a metaphor for a deep hierarchical
*  structure, but also I think it's just an anatomical anatomically quite a useful metaphor.
*  All the action, all the heavy lifting in terms of neural computation is done on the surface of the
*  brain. And then the interior of the brain is constituted by, um, fatty wires, essentially
*  external processes that are enshrouded by myelin sheaths. And these give the, uh, when you dissect
*  them, they look fatty and white. And so it's called white matter, as opposed to the actual
*  neuro pill, which does the computation constituted largely by neurons. And that's
*  known as gray matter. So the gray matter is a, a, um, a surface or a skin that sits on top of this
*  big ball. Now we are talking magic soup, but it's a big ball of connections like spaghetti,
*  very carefully structured with a sparse connectivity that preserves this deep hierarchical
*  structure. But all the action takes place on the surface, on the cortex of the onion. Um, and that
*  means that you have to supply the right amount of blood flow, the right amount of nutrient,
*  which is rapidly absorbed and used by neural cells that don't have the same capacity that
*  your leg muscles would have to, um, basically spend their energy budget and then claim it back
*  later. Um, so one peculiar thing about cerebral metabolism, brain metabolism is it really needs
*  to be driven in the moment, which means you basically have to turn on the taps. So if, um,
*  there's lots of neural activity in one part of the brain, a little patch of a few millimeters,
*  even less possibly, you really do have to water that piece of the garden now and quickly. And that
*  by quickly, I mean, within a couple of seconds. So that contains a lot of that. Hence the imaging
*  could tell you a story of what's happening. Absolutely. But it is slightly compromised
*  in terms of the resolution. So the, the deployment of these little micro vessels that water the
*  garden to enable the activity to, to, um, the neural activity to play out the spatial resolution
*  is in order of a few millimeters. Um, and crucially the temporal resolution is the order of a few
*  seconds. So you can't get right down and dirty into the actual spatial and temporal scale of
*  neural activity in and of itself. To do that, you'd have to turn to the other big image of
*  modality, which is the recording of electromagnetic signals as they're generated in real time.
*  So here the temporal bandwidth, if you like, or the temp, the low limit on the temporal resolution
*  is incredibly small. You're talking about, you know, nanoseconds, milliseconds,
*  and then you can get into, um, the phasic fast responses that is in of itself, the neural activity
*  and, um, start to see the succession or cascade of hierarchical recurrent message passing
*  evoked by a particular stimulus. But the problem is you're looking at electromagnetic signals
*  that have passed through an enormous amount of magic soup or spaghetti of connectivity
*  and through the scalp and the skull. And it's become spatially very diffused. So it's very
*  difficult to know where you are. So you've got this sort of, um, um, catch 22. You can either
*  use an imaging modality. It tells you within millimeters, which part of the brain has activated
*  to be done a when, or you've got these electromagnetic EEG MEG, um, um, setups that tell you to within a
*  few milliseconds when things, something has responded, but you're not aware. So you've got
*  these two complimentary measures, either indirect via the blood flow or direct via the electromagnetic
*  signals caused by neural activity. Uh, these are the two big imaging devices. And then the second
*  level of responding to your question, what, what are the, you know, from the outside, what are the
*  big ways of, of, of using this, this, this technology? Um, so once you've chosen your,
*  the kind of mirror imaging that you want to use to answer your set questions, and sometimes it
*  would have to be both, um, then you've got a whole raft of analysis, time series analysis, usually
*  that you can bring to bear in order to answer your questions or address your hypothesis about those
*  data. And interestingly, they, they both fall into the same two camps we're talking about before,
*  you know, this dialectic between specialization and integration, differentiation and integration.
*  So it's the cartography, the blobology analysis. I apologize. I probably shouldn't interrupt
*  so much, but just, uh, heard a fun word, uh, the blah, the blobology, it's a neologism,
*  which means the study of blobs. So nothing. Are you being a witty and humorous or is there an
*  actual, does the word blobology ever appear in a textbook somewhere? It would appear in a popular
*  book. Uh, it would not appear in a worthy, um, um, specialist journal. Yeah. But it's the fond
*  word for the study of literally little blobs on brain maps showing activations. So the kind of
*  thing that you'd see in the newspapers on, um, on ABC or BBC reporting the latest finding from,
*  from brain imaging. Um, interestingly though, the maths involved in that stream of analysis
*  does actually call upon the mathematics of blobs. So seriously, they actually called, um,
*  Euler characteristics and, um, you know, they have a lot of fancy names in mathematics.
*  We'll talk about it, but your ideas in free energy principle, I mean, there's a
*  echoes of blobs there when you consider sort of, uh, entities, so mathematically speaking.
*  Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the first circumscribed, well-defined,
*  the entities of, uh, uh, well, from the free energy point of view,
*  entities of anything, but from the point of view of, um, the analysis, the cartography of,
*  you know, of the brain, uh, these are the entities that constitute the evidence for this functional
*  segregation. You have segregated this function in this blob and it is not outside of the blob.
*  And that, that that's basically the, uh, if you were a map maker of America, um, and you did not
*  know it's structured, the first thing you're doing constituting or creating a map would be
*  to identify the cities, for example, or the mountains or the rivers, all of these uniquely
*  spatially localizable features, possibly topological features have to be placed somewhere.
*  Because that requires a mathematics of identify what does a city look like on the satellite image?
*  Or what does a river look like? Or what does a mountain look like? What would it, um, you know,
*  what data features would it, um, would evidence that particular top, you know, that particular
*  thing that you wanted to put on the map. And they normally are characterized in terms of
*  literally these blobs or these sort of, um, now the way looking at this is a, a certain, um,
*  statistical measure of the degree of activation crosses a threshold and in crossing that
*  threshold, uh, in the spatially restricted part of the brain, it creates a blob.
*  And that's basically what statistical parametric mapping does. It's basically, um,
*  mathematically finessed blobology. Okay. So those, the, you kind of describe these two
*  methodologies for one is a temporally noisy one, a spatially noisy, and you kind of have to play
*  and figure out what, uh, what can be useful. It'd be great if you can sort of comment. I,
*  I got a chance recently to spend a day at a company called Neuralink that uses brain
*  computer interfaces and their dream is to, well, there's a bunch of sort of dreams,
*  but one of them is to understand the brain by sort of, um, you know, getting in there past the so
*  called sort of factory wall, getting in there and be able to listen, communicate both directions.
*  What are your thoughts about this, the future of this kind of technology of brain computer
*  interfaces to be able to now have a, have a window or direct contact within the brain,
*  to be able to measure some of the signals, to be able to send signals, to understand
*  some of the functionality of the brain. Ambivalent. My sense is ambivalent. So it's
*  a mixture of good and bad, and I acknowledge that freely. Um, so the good bits, if you just look at
*  the legacy of that kind of, um, reciprocal, but invasive, uh, your brain stimulation,
*  I didn't paint a complete picture when I was talking about. So the ways we understand the
*  brain prior to neuroimaging, it wasn't just leave lesion deficit studies. Some of the early work,
*  in fact, literally a hundred years from where we're sitting at the institution of neurology
*  work was done by, um, stimulating the brain of say dogs and looking at how they responded either
*  with them, uh, the muscles or with the salivation and imputing what that part of the brain must be
*  doing. If I stimulate it, then I, you know, and I vote this kind of response, then that tells me
*  quite a lot about the functional specialization. So there's a long history of brain stimulation,
*  which continues to enjoy a lot of attention nowadays. Um, positive attention. Oh yes,
*  absolutely. Um, you know, deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease is now standard treatment
*  and also a wonderful vehicle to try and, um, understand the neuronal dynamics underlie
*  movement disorders like Parkinson's disease. Um, even interest in, um, trans magnetic stimulation,
*  stimulating the magnetic fields and will it work in people who are depressed, for example,
*  quite a crude level of understanding what you're doing, but, um, you know, there are, there is
*  historical evidence that these kinds of brute force interventions do change things. They,
*  you know, a little bit like banging the TV, but the valves aren't working properly, but
*  it's still, it works. Uh, so, uh, you know, there is a long history, uh, brain computer
*  interfacing or BCI, um, I think is a, is a beautiful example of that. It's sort of carved
*  out its own niche and its own aspirations. Uh, and there've been enormous, uh, advances within
*  limits, um, um, advances in terms of our ability to understand, um, how the brain, the embodied brain
*  in engages with the world. Um, I'm thinking here of sensory substitution, the augmenting
*  our sensory capacities by giving ourselves extra ways of sensing and sampling the world, um,
*  ranging from sort of trying to replace lost visual signals through to giving people
*  completely new signals. So, uh, um, the, um, well, I think most engaging examples of this is equipping
*  people with a sense of magnetic fields. So you can actually give them magnetic sensors that enable
*  them to feel, should we say tactile pressure around their tummy, where they are in relation to the,
*  to, to the magnetic field of the earth. And after a few weeks, they take it for granted. They
*  integrate it. They imbibe it, simulate this new sensory information into the way that they feel,
*  literally feel their world, but now equipped with this sense of magnetic direction. So that tells
*  you something about the brain's plastic potential to remodel to, um, and its plastic capacity to
*  suddenly try to explain the sensory data at hand by augmentating or augmenting the, uh, the sensory
*  sphere and the kinds of things that you can measure. Uh, clearly that's purely for entertainment
*  and understanding that the, or the nature of the, and the power of our brains. I would imagine that
*  most BCI is pitched at solving, um, clinical and, um, human problems such as locked in syndrome,
*  such as paraplegia or replacing lost, um, sensory capacities like blindness and deafness.
*  So, um, then we come to the more, um, the negative part of my ambivalence, the other side of it. Um,
*  so I, you know, um, I don't want to be deflationary because much of my deflationary comments is
*  probably a large out of ignorance than anything else. But, uh, generally speaking, the bandwidth
*  and the bit rates that you get from, um, brain computer interfaces as we currently know them,
*  we're talking about bits per second. So that would be like me, um, only being able to communicate
*  with any world or with you using very, very, very slow Morse code. And it is not in the,
*  in even within an order of magnitude near what we actually need for an inactive realization
*  of what people aspire to when they think about sort of, um, curing people with paraplegia or
*  replacing sight, um, despite heroic efforts. So one has to ask, is there a lower bound on the kinds
*  of, um, recurrent information exchange between a brain and some augmented or artificial, um,
*  interface? Um, and then we come back to interestingly what I was talking about before,
*  which is, you know, if you're talking about function in terms of inference, and I presume
*  we'll get to that later on in terms of the free energy principle, but at the moment there may be
*  fundamental reasons to assume that is the case. We're talking about ensemble activity. We're
*  talking about basically, um, for example, let's paint the challenge facing, um, brain computer
*  interfacing in terms of controlling another system that is highly and deeply structured,
*  very relevant to our lives, very nonlinear that rests upon, um, the kind of non-equilibrium steady
*  states and dynamics, uh, that the brain does the weather. Right. So good example. Yeah.
*  Imagine you had some, um, very, um, aggressive satellites that could produce signals that could
*  perturb some little, um, parts of the, um, of the weather system. And then what you're asking now
*  is can I meaningfully get into the weather and change it meaningfully and make the weather
*  respond in a way that I want it to you're talking about chaos control on a scale, which is almost
*  unimaginable. So there may be fundamental reasons why BCI, as you might read about it in a science
*  fiction novel, um, aspirational BCI may never actually work in the sense that to really
*  be integrated and be part of the system, um, is an imp a requirement that requires you to have
*  evolved with that system that you, you know, you, um, you have to be part of, um, a very
*  delicately structured, deeply structured, dynamic ensemble activity that is not like rewiring a
*  broken computer or plugging in a peripheral interface adapter. It is much more like getting
*  into the weather patterns or a come back to your magic soup is getting into the active matter. Um,
*  and meaningfully relate that to the outside world. So I think there are enormous challenges there.
*  So I think, uh, the example of the weather is a brilliant one. And I think you paint a really
*  interesting picture and it wasn't as negative as I thought. It's essentially saying that it's,
*  it might be incredibly challenging, including the low bound of the bandwidth and so on.
*  I kind of, so just to full disclosure, I come from the machine learning world.
*  So my, my natural thought is the hardest part is the engineering challenge of controlling the
*  weather, of getting those satellites up and running and, and so on. And once they are,
*  then the rest is a fundamentally, uh, the same approaches that allow you to be,
*  to win in the game of go will allow you to potentially play in this soup, in this chaos.
*  So I have, I have a hope that sort of machine learning methods will,
*  will help us play in this soup. But perhaps you're right that it is a biology in the
*  brain is just an incredible, an incredible system that, um, maybe almost impossible to get in. But
*  for me, what seems impossible is, is the incredible mess of blood vessels that you also described
*  without, you know, we also value the brain. You can't make any mistakes. You can't damage things.
*  So to me, that engineering challenge seems nearly impossible. One of the things I was really
*  impressed by at Neuralink is, uh, just, just, just talking to brilliant neurosurgeons and the
*  roboticists that, uh, it made me realize that even though it seems impossible, if anyone can do it,
*  it's some of these world-class engineers that are trying to take it on. So, um, so I think the
*  conclusion of our discussion here is, uh, of, of this part is, uh, is basically that the problem is
*  really hard, but hopefully not impossible. Absolutely. So if it's okay, let's start with
*  the basics. So you've also formulated a fascinating principle, the free energy principle. Can we maybe
*  start at the basics and what is the free energy principle? Well, in fact, the free energy principle,
*  um, inherits a lot from, um, the building of these data analytic approaches to these, you know,
*  very high dimensional time series you get, get from the brain. So I think it's interesting to
*  acknowledge that. And in particular, the analysis tools that, um, try to address the other side,
*  which is a functional integration. So the connectivity analysis, um, on the one hand,
*  but I should also acknowledge it inherits an awful lot from machine learning as well. Uh, so, um,
*  the free energy principle, um, is just a formal statement that the, um, the existential imperatives
*  for any system that manages to survive in a changing world is, um, can be cast as, um,
*  a, an inference problem, uh, in the sense that you can interpret the probability of existing
*  as the evidence that you exist. And if you can write down that problem of existence as a statistical
*  problem, then you can use all the maths that has been developed for inference to understand and
*  characterize the ensemble dynamics that must be in play in the service of that inference.
*  So technically what that means is you can always interpret anything that exists
*  in virtue of being separate from the environment in which it exists as trying to, um, minimize
*  variational free energy. And if you're from the machine learning community, you will know that
*  as a negative evidence, lower bound or a negative elbow, um, which is the same as saying you're
*  trying to maximize, or it will look as if all your dynamics are trying to maximize the complement of
*  that, which is the marginal likelihood or the evidence for your own existence. So that's
*  basically the, you know, the, uh, the free energy principle. But to even take a s sort of a small
*  step backwards, you said the existential imperative. There's a lot of beautiful poetic
*  words here, but sort of to put it crudely, it's a, it's a, it's a fascinating idea of basically
*  just of trying to describe, if you're looking at a blob, how do you know this thing is alive?
*  What does it mean to be alive? What does it mean to be, to exist? And so you can look at the brain,
*  you can look at parts of the brain, or you, this is just a general principle that applies to
*  almost any, any, any system. That's just a fascinating sort of philosophically at every level
*  question and the methodology to try to answer that question. What does it mean to be alive?
*  Yes. So, so that, uh, that, that's a huge endeavor and it's nice that there's at least some,
*  from some perspective, a clean answer. So maybe can you talk about that optimization view of
*  it? So what, what's trying to be minimized and maximize a system that's alive? What is it trying
*  to minimize? Right. You've, you've made a big move there. Um, first of all, I apologize.
*  Good to make big moves. Um, uh, but you've assumed that the, the, the things, the thing exists
*  before the, in a state that could be living or non-living. So I may ask you, well, what licenses
*  you to say that something exists? That's why I use the word existential. It's beyond living.
*  It's just existence. So if you drill down onto the definition of things that exist,
*  then they have certain properties. If you borrow the maths from non-equilibrium steady state physics
*  that enable you to interpret, um, their existence, um, in terms of this optimization procedure.
*  So it's good you introduce the word optimization. So, um, what the free energy principle in its
*  sort of, um, most ambitious, but also most deflationary and simplest says is that if
*  something exists, then it must buy the mathematics of, um, non-equilibrium steady state,
*  exhibit properties that make it look as if it is optimizing a particular quantity.
*  And it turns out that particular quantity happens to be exactly the same as the evidence lower
*  bound in machine learning or Bayesian model evidence in Bayesian statistics, or, and then
*  I can list a whole other list of ways of understanding this, this, this key, um, quantity,
*  which, um, is a bound on, on, uh, surprise or self-information. If you have information theory,
*  there are a whole, um, there are a number of different perspectives on this country.
*  It's just basically the log probability of, uh, being in a particular state.
*  I'm telling this story as an honest, an attempt to answer your question. Um, and I'm answering it as
*  if I, uh, um, was pretending to be a physicist who was trying to understand the fundamentals of
*  non-equilibrium, um, um, steady state. Um, and I shouldn't really be doing that because the last
*  time I was taught physics, I was in my twenties. What kind of systems, when you think about the
*  free energy principle, what kind of systems are you imagining as a sort of more specific kind of
*  case study? Uh, I'm imagining, um, a range of systems, but yeah, at its simplest, um, a sim,
*  a single celled organism, um, that can be identified from its Econ issue or its environment.
*  So, um, so at its simplest, that, that's basically what, what I always imagined in my head.
*  And you may ask, well, is there any, how on earth can you even elaborate questions
*  about the existence of a, a sim, a single drop of oil, for example? Yeah. Well,
*  but there are deep questions there. Why doesn't the oil, why doesn't the thing, the interface
*  between the drop of oil that contains an interior and the thing that is not the drop of oil, which
*  is the solvent in which it is immersed, how does that interface persist over time? Why doesn't the
*  oil just dissolve into solvent? Um, so what special properties of the exchange between the surface of
*  the oil drop and the external states in which it's immersed, if you're a physicist, say it would be
*  the heat bath, you know, you've got a, you've got a physical system, an ensemble again, we're talking
*  about density dynamics, ensemble dynamics, um, an ensemble of, of atoms or molecules immersed in the
*  heat bath. But the question is how did the heat bath get there and why is it not dissolved? How
*  is it maintaining itself? Exactly. What actions is it? I mean, it's such a fascinating idea of a drop
*  of oil and I guess it would dissolve in water, it wouldn't dissolve in water. So what precisely.
*  So why not? So why not? Why not? And how do you mathematically describe, I mean, it's such a
*  beautiful idea. And also the idea of like, where does the thing, where does the drop of oil end
*  and where does it begin? Right. So I mean, you're asking deep questions deep in a non-millennial
*  sense here. But what you can do, you see, so this is the deflationary part of it. Um, can I just
*  qualify my answer by saying that normally when I'm asked this question, I answer from the point of
*  view of a psychologist, we talk about predictive processing and predictive coding and, and, and,
*  you know, the brain is an inference machine, but you haven't asked me from that perspective. I'm
*  answering from the point of view of a physicist. So you, you know, the question, um, is not so much
*  why, but if it exists, what properties must it display? So that's the deflationary part of the
*  free energy principle. The free energy principle does not supply an answer as to why it's saying,
*  if something exists, then it must display these properties. That's, that's the, you know, the sort
*  of the thing that's on offer. And it so happens that these properties, it must display are actually
*  intriguing and have this, um, inferential gloss, this, this, this, this sort of self-evidencing
*  gloss that inherits on the fact that the very preservation of the boundary between the oil drop
*  and the not oil drop requires an optimization of a particular function or a functional, um, that's
*  the, the, the defines the presence of the existence of, of this oil drop, which is why I started with
*  existential imperatives. It is, it is a necessary condition for existence that this must occur
*  because the thing, the boundary basically defines the things that's, that's existing. So it is that
*  self-assembly aspect. It's that, um, um, that you were hinting at, um, in biology, sometimes known
*  as, um, autopoiesis, um, in, uh, computational chemistry with self-assembly. It's the, uh, what,
*  what does it look like? Sorry. How would you describe things that configure themselves out
*  of nothing? The way they clearly demarcate themselves from the States or the soup in which
*  they are immersed. Um, so from the point of view of computational chemistry, for example,
*  you would just understand that as a configuration of a macro molecule to minimize its free energy,
*  its thermodynamic free energy is exactly the same principle that we've been talking about that
*  thermodynamic free energy is just the negative elbow. It's the same mathematical con construct.
*  So the very emergence of existence of structure of form that can be distinguished from the
*  environment or the thing that is not the thing, um, uh, necessitates the, the, um, existence
*  of an objective function that it looks as if it is minimizing. It's finding a free energy minima.
*  And so just to clarify, I'm trying to wrap my head around, um, so the, the free energy principle
*  says that if something exists, these are the properties that should display.
*  So what, what that means is we can't just look, we can't just go into a soup and there's no
*  mechanism. Free energy principle doesn't give us a mechanism to find the things that exist.
*  Is, is that what it, what's implying is being applied that you can kind of, uh, use it to reason
*  to think about, like study a particular system and say, dude, does this exhibits these qualities?
*  That's an excellent question. Um, but to answer that, I'd have to, I have to return to your
*  previous question about what's the difference between living and non-living things. Um,
*  things. Um, but actually, sorry. So yeah, maybe we can go there. You kind of drew a line
*  and forgive me for the stupid questions, but the, you kind of drew a line between living and
*  existing. Is there an interesting sort of, um, distinction, distinction? Yeah, I think there is.
*  Um, so, um, you know, things do exist. Grains of sand, rocks on the moon, trees, um, you,
*  so all of these things, um, can be separated from the environment in which they are immersed. And
*  therefore they must at some level be optimizing, um, their free energy, um, taking this sort of,
*  um, model evidence interpretation of this quantity that basically means that self-evidencing
*  another nice little twist of, uh, phrase here is that you are your own existence proof,
*  you know, statistically speaking, which, uh, I don't think I, I, I said that somebody did,
*  but I love that phrase. Um, you are your own existence proof. Yeah. So it's so existential,
*  isn't it? He's, uh, I'm gonna have to think about that for a few days. Um, so yeah, that's a
*  beautiful, that's a beautiful line. So the, the, the, the, the step through to answer your question
*  about, you know, what's it good for? Um, it would go along the following lines. First of all, um,
*  you have to define what it means to exist, which now, as you rightly pointed out, you have to define
*  what probabilistic properties must the states of something possess so that it has, so it knows where
*  it finishes. And then you write that down in terms of statistical independences, again, sparsity,
*  again, it's not what's connected or what's correlated or what depends upon what it's,
*  it's what's not correlated and what doesn't depend upon something. Again, it comes down to the,
*  the deep structures, not in this is as hierarchical, but the certainly the structures that emerge from
*  removing connectivity and dependency. And in this instance, um, basically being able to identify the
*  surface of the oil drop from the water in which it is immersed. And when you do that, you start
*  to realize, well, there are actually four kinds of states in any given universe that contains
*  anything. The things that are internal to the surface, the things that are external to the
*  surface and the surface in and of itself, which is why I use a metaphor, a little single celled
*  organism that has an interior and exterior, and then the surface of the cell. And that's
*  mathematically a Markov blanket. Just to pause. I'm in awe of this concept that there's the stuff
*  outside the surface stuff inside the surface and the surface itself, the Markov blanket. It's just,
*  um, the most beautiful kind of notion about trying to explore what it means to exist
*  mathematically. I apologize. It's just, uh, it's just a beautiful idea. It came out of California.
*  I changed my mind. I take it all back. Uh, so, so anyway, so what, uh, you were just talking
*  about the surface, about the Markov. Yeah. So, uh, this surface or this blanket,
*  these blanket states that are the, you know, the, um, because they are now defined in relation to,
*  um, uh, these, uh, uh, independences and, and, you know, what can, what different states,
*  internal or blanket or external states can, uh, which ones can influence each other and
*  which cannot influence each other. You can now apply standard results that you would find in
*  non-equilibrium physics or steady state or, um, thermodynamics or hydrodynamics, um, usually
*  out of equilibrium, uh, solutions and apply them to this partition. And what it looks like
*  is if all the Norman normal gradient flows that you would associate with any non-equilibrium system
*  apply in such a way that to part of the Markov blanket and the internal states
*  seem to be Hill climbing or doing a gradient descent on the same quantity.
*  And that means that you can now describe the very existence of this oil drop.
*  You can write down the existence of this order in terms of flows, dynamics, equations of motion,
*  where the blanket states or part of them, we call them active states and the internal states
*  now seem to be, and it must be trying to look as if they're minimizing the same function,
*  which is a lot of probability of occupying this, these states. The interesting thing is that
*  what would they be called if you were trying to describe these things? So
*  what we're talking about are internal states, external states and blanket states. Now let's
*  carve the blanket states into two sensory states and active states. Operationally,
*  it has to be the case that in order for this carving up into different sets of states to exist,
*  the active states, the Markov blanket cannot be influenced by the external states.
*  And we already know that the internal states can't be influenced by the external states because
*  the blanket separates them. So what does that mean? Well, it means the active states, the internal
*  states are now jointly not influenced by external states. They only have autonomous dynamics.
*  So now you've got a picture of an oil drop that has autonomy. It has autonomous states.
*  It has autonomous states in the sense that there must be some parts of the surface of the oil drop
*  that are not influenced by the external states and all the interior. And together, those two states
*  endow even a little oil drop with autonomous states that look as if they are optimizing
*  their variational free energy or their negative elbow, their model evidence.
*  And that would be an interesting intellectual exercise. And you could say, you could even go
*  into the realms of panpsychism, that everything that exists is implicitly making inferences on
*  self-evidencing. Now we make the next move, but what about living things? I mean,
*  so let me ask you, what's the difference between an oil drop and a little tadpole or a little lava
*  or plankton? The picture was just painted of an oil drop just immediately in a matter of minutes
*  took me into the world of panpsychism, where you've just convinced me, made me feel like an oil drop
*  is a living, certainly an autonomous system, but almost a living system. So it has a capability,
*  sensory capabilities and acting capabilities and it maintains something. So what is the difference
*  between that and something that we traditionally think of as a living system? That it could die
*  or it can't, I mean, yeah, mortality. I'm not exactly sure. I'm not sure what the right answer
*  there is because they can move, like movement seems like an essential element to being able
*  to act in the environment, but the oil drop is doing that. So I don't know. Is it? The oil drop
*  will be moved, but does it in and of itself move autonomously? Well, the surface is performing
*  actions that maintain its structure. You're being too clever. I was, I had in mind a passive little
*  oil drop sitting there at the bottom of the top of a glass of water. Sure. I guess what I'm trying
*  to say is you're absolutely right. You've nailed it. It's movement. So where does that movement
*  come from? If it comes from the inside, then you've got, I think, something that's living.
*  What do you mean from the inside? What I mean is that the internal states that can influence the
*  active states, where the active states can influence, but they're not influenced by the
*  external states can cause movement. So there are two types of oil drops, if you like. There are oil
*  drops where the internal states are so random that they average themselves away and the thing cannot
*  on balance on average when you do the averaging move. So a nice example of that will be the sun.
*  The sun certainly has internal states. There's lots of intrinsic autonomous activity going on,
*  but because it's not coordinated, because it doesn't have the deep in the millennial sense,
*  a hierarchical structure that the brain does, there is no overall mode or pattern or organization
*  that expresses itself on the surface that allows it to actually swim. It can certainly have a very
*  active surface, but en masse at the scale of the actual surface of the sun, the average position
*  of that surface cannot in itself move because the internal dynamics are more like a hot gas.
*  They are literally like a hot gas, whereas your internal dynamics are much more structured and
*  deeply structured. And now you can express on your Markov and your active states with your muscles
*  and your secretory organs, your autonomic nervous system and its effectors. You can actually move,
*  and that's all you can do. And that's something which if you haven't thought of it like this
*  before, I think it's nice to just realize there is no other way that you can change the universe
*  other than simply moving. Whether that moving is articulating with my voice box or walking around
*  or squeezing juices out of my secretory organs. There's only one way you can change the universe.
*  It's moving. And the fact that you do so non-randomly makes you alive.
*  Yeah. So it's that non-randomness. And that would be manifested, we realize, in terms of essentially
*  swimming, essentially moving, changing one shape, a morphogenesis that is dynamic and possibly
*  adaptive. So that's what I was trying to get at between the difference between the oil drop and
*  the little tadpole. The tadpole is moving around. Its active states are actually changing the
*  external states. And there's now a cycle, an action perception cycle, if you like, a recurrent
*  dynamic that's going on that depends upon this deeply structured autonomous
*  behaviour that rests upon
*  internal dynamics that are not only modelling the data impressed upon their surface or the blanket
*  states, but they are actively resampling those data by moving. They're moving towards chemical
*  gradients and chemotaxis. So they've gone beyond just being good little models of the kind of world
*  they live in. For example, an oil droplet could, in a panpsychic sense, be construed as a little
*  being that has now perfectly inferred it's a passive non-living oil drop living in a bowl of water.
*  No problem. But to now equip that oil drop with the ability to go out and test that hypothesis
*  about different states of beings. So it can actually push its surface over there, over there,
*  and test for chemical gradients. Or then you start to move to much more lifelike form.
*  This is all fun, theoretically interesting, but it actually is quite important in terms of reflecting
*  what I have seen since the turn of the millennium, which is this move towards an
*  inactive and embodied understanding of intelligence. You say you're from machine learning.
*  What that means, the central importance of movement, I think has yet to really hit machine
*  learning. It certainly has now diffused itself throughout robotics. And perhaps you could say
*  certain problems in active vision where you actually have to move the camera to sample this
*  and that. But machine learning of the data mining deep learning sort simply hasn't contended with
*  this issue. What it's done, instead of dealing with the movement problem and the active sampling of
*  data, it's just said, we don't need to worry about, we can see all the data because we've
*  got big data. So we need no movement. So that for me is an important omission in current machine
*  learning. The current machine learning is much more like the oil drop. Yes. But an oil drop that
*  enjoys exposure to nearly all the data that it will ever need to be exposed to, as opposed to
*  the tadpoles swimming out to find the right data. For example, it likes food. That's a good
*  hypothesis. Let's test it out. Let's go and move and ingest food, for example, and see what that
*  is that evidence that I'm the kind of thing that likes this kind of food. So the next natural
*  question, and forgive this question, but if we think of sort of even artificial intelligence
*  systems, which has just painted a beautiful picture of existence and life. So do you
*  ascribe or do you find within this framework a possibility of defining consciousness
*  or exploring the idea of consciousness? Like what, you know, self-awareness
*  and expanded to consciousness. Yeah. How can we start to think about consciousness within this
*  framework? Is it possible? Yeah. I think it's possible to think about it, whether you'll get
*  it. And again, I'm not sure that I'm licensed to answer that question. I think you'd have to
*  speak to a qualified philosopher to get a definitive answer there. But certainly there's a lot of
*  interest in using not just these ideas, but related ideas from information theory to try and tie down
*  the maths and the calculus and the geometry of consciousness, either in terms of
*  sort of a minimal consciousness, even less than a minimal selfhood. And what I'm talking about is
*  the ability effectively to plan, to have agency. So you could argue that a virus
*  does have a form of agency in virtue of the way that it selectively finds hosts and cells to live
*  in and moves around. But you wouldn't endow it with the capacity to think about planning and
*  moving in a purposeful way where it counted as the future. Whereas you might an ant. You might
*  think an ant's not quite as unconscious as a virus. It certainly seems to have a purpose.
*  It talks to its friends on route during its foraging. It has a different kind of
*  autonomy, which is biotic, but beyond a virus. So there's something about, so there's something
*  there's some line that has to do with the complexity of planning that may contain an
*  answer. I mean, it would be beautiful if we can find a line beyond which we can say a being is
*  conscious. These are wonderful lines that we've drawn with existence, life and consciousness.
*  It will be very nice. One little wrinkle there, and this is something I've only learned in the
*  past few months, is the philosophical notion of vagueness. So you're saying it would be
*  wonderful to draw a line. I had always assumed that that line at some point would be drawn
*  until about four months ago, and the philosopher taught me about vagueness. So I don't know if
*  you've come across this, but it's a technical concept. And I think most revealingly illustrated
*  with at what point does a pile of sand become a pile? Is it one grain, two grains, three grains,
*  or four grains? So at what point would you draw the line between being a pile of sand and a
*  collection of grains of sand? In the same way, is it right to ask where would I draw the line
*  between conscious and unconscious? And it might be a vague concept. Having said that, I agree with
*  you entirely. Systems that have the ability to plan. So just technically what that means is
*  your inferential self-evidencing, by which I simply mean the dynamics, literally the thermodynamics
*  and gradient flows that underwrite the preservation of your oil droplet-like form
*  are described as an optimization of log-basian model evidence, your elbow.
*  That self-evidencing must be evidence for a model of what's causing the sensory impressions on the
*  sensory part of your surface or your Markov blanket. If that model is capable of planning,
*  it must include a model of the future consequences of your active states or your action.
*  Just planning. So we're now in the game of planning as inference. Now notice what we've made,
*  though. We've made quite a big move away from big data and machine learning because again,
*  it's the consequences of moving. It's the consequences of selecting those data or those
*  data or looking over there. And that tells you immediately that even to be a contender for a
*  conscious artifact or a strong AI or generalized AI, then you've got to have movement in the game.
*  And furthermore, you've got to have a generative model of the sort you might find in say a
*  variational autoencoder that is thinking about the future conditioned upon different courses
*  of action. Now that brings a number of things to the table, which now you start to think,
*  those who've got all the right ingredients to talk about consciousness. I've now got to select
*  among a number of different courses of action into the future as part of planning. I've now got free
*  will. The act of selecting this course of action or that policy or that policy or that action
*  suddenly makes me into an inference machine, a self-evidencing artifact that now looks as if
*  it's selecting amongst different alternative ways forward as I actively swim here or swim there or
*  look over here and look over there. So I think you've now got to a situation, if there is planning
*  in the mix, you're now getting much closer to that line, if that line were ever to exist.
*  I don't think it gets you quite as far as self-aware though. I think you have to, I think,
*  grapple with the question, how would formally you write down countless or a maths of self-awareness?
*  I don't think it's impossible to do, but I think there would be pressure on you to actually commit
*  to a formal definition of what you mean by self-awareness. I think most people that I know
*  would probably say that a goldfish, a pet fish was not self-aware. They would probably argue
*  about their favourite cat, but would be quite happy to say that their mum was self-aware.
*  But that might very well connect to some level of complexity with planning.
*  It seems like self-awareness is essential for complex planning.
*  Do you want to take that further? I think you're absolutely right.
*  Again, the line is unclear, but it seems like integrating yourself into the world, into your
*  planning is essential for constructing complex plans.
*  Mathematically describing that in the same elegant way as
*  you have with the free energy principle might be difficult.
*  Well, yes and no. Can we just go back? That's a very important answer you gave. I think
*  if I just unpacked it, you'd see the truisms that you've just exposed for us.
*  I'm mindful that I didn't answer your question before. What's the free energy principle good for?
*  Is it just a pretty theoretical exercise to explain non-equilibrium steady-states? Yes, it is.
*  It does nothing more for you than that. It can be regarded – it's going to sound very arrogant,
*  but it is all the sort of theory of natural selection or a hypothesis of natural selection.
*  Beautiful, undeniably true, but tells you absolutely nothing about why you have legs and eyes.
*  It tells you nothing about the actual phenotype and it wouldn't allow you to build something.
*  The free energy principle by itself is as vacuous as most tautological theories. By tautological,
*  of course, I'm talking to the theory of natural survival, the fittest. What's the fittest?
*  Survival. Why do they cycle? The fitter. It just goes around in circles. In a sense,
*  the free energy principle has that same deflationary tautology under the hood.
*  It's a characteristic of things that exist. Why they exist? Because they minimize their
*  free energy. Why they minimize their free energy? Because they exist. You just keep on going round
*  and round and round. But the practical thing, which you don't get from natural selection,
*  but you could say has now manifested in things like differential evolution or genetic algorithms
*  or MCMC, for example, in machine learning. The practical thing you can get is if it looks as
*  if things that exist are trying to have density dynamics and look as though they're optimizing
*  a variation of free energy. And a variation of free energy has to be a functional of a
*  generative model, a probabilistic description of causes and consequences, causes out there,
*  consequences in the sensorium on the sensory parts of the Markov blanket.
*  Then it should, in theory, be possible to write down the generative model, work out the gradients,
*  and then cause it to autonomously self-evidence. So you should be able to write down oil droplets.
*  You should be able to create artifacts where you have supplied the objective function that supplies
*  the gradients, that supplies the self-organizing dynamics to non-equilibrium steady state. So there
*  is actually a practical application of the free energy principle when you can write down your
*  required evidence in terms of, well, when you can write down the generative model,
*  that is the thing that has the evidence. The probability of these sensory data or this data
*  given that model is effectively the thing that the elbow of the variational free energy bounds
*  or approximates. That means that you can actually write down the model and the kind of thing that
*  you want to engineer, the kind of AGI or artificial general intelligence
*  that you want to manifest probabilistically. And then you engineer, not a lot of work,
*  but you would engineer a robot and a computer to perform a gradient descent on that objective
*  function. So it does have a practical implication. Now, why am I wittering on about that? It did seem
*  relevant to, yes. So the answer to the, would it be easy or would it be hard? Well, mathematically
*  it's easy. I've just told you, all you need to do is write down your perfect artifact probabilistically
*  in the form of a probabilistic generative model, probability distribution over the causes and
*  consequences of the world in which this thing is immersed. And then you just engineer a computer
*  and a robot to form a gradient descent on that objective function. No problem. But of course,
*  the big problem is writing down the generative model. So that's where the heavy lifting comes in.
*  So it's the form and the structure of that generative model, which basically defines the
*  artifact that you will create or indeed the kind of artifact that has self-awareness.
*  So that's where all the hard work comes in very much like natural selection doesn't tell you in
*  the slightest why you have eyes. So you have to drill down on the actual phenotype, the actual
*  generative model. So with that in mind, what did you tell me that tells me immediately the kinds
*  of generative models I would have to write down in order to have self-awareness? What you said to me
*  was I have to have a model that is effectively fit for purpose for this kind of world in which I
*  operate. And if I now make the observation that this kind of world is effectively largely populated
*  by other things like me, i.e. you, then it makes enormous sense that if I can develop a hypothesis
*  that we are similar kinds of creatures, in fact, the same kind of creature, but I am me and you are
*  you, then it becomes a game mandated to have a sense of self. So if I live in a world
*  that is constituted by things like me, basically a social world, a community,
*  then it becomes necessary now for me to infer that it's me talking and not you talking.
*  I wouldn't need that if I was on Mars by myself or if I was in the jungle as a feral child.
*  If there was nothing like me around, there would be no need to have an inference that a hypothesis,
*  oh yes, it is me that is experiencing or causing these sounds and it is not you.
*  It's only when there's ambiguity in play induced by the fact that there are others in that world.
*  So I think that the special thing about self-aware artifacts is that they have learned
*  to, or they have acquired, or at least are equipped with, possibly by evolution, generative models
*  that allow for the fact that there are lots of copies of things like them around
*  and therefore they have to work out it's you and not me.
*  That's brilliant. I've never thought of that. I never thought of that, that the purpose of
*  the really usefulness of consciousness or self-awareness in the context of planning
*  existing in the world is so you can operate with other things like you.
*  It doesn't have to necessarily be human, it could be other kind of similar creatures.
*  Absolutely. Well, we've imbued a lot of our attributes into our pets, don't we?
*  Or we try to make our robots humanoid. I think there's a deep reason for that,
*  that it's just much easier to read the world if you can make the simplifying assumption that
*  basically you're me and it's just your turn to talk. When we talk about planning,
*  when you talk specifically about planning, the highest if you like manifestation or realization
*  of that planning is what we're doing now. I mean, the human condition doesn't get any
*  higher than this talking about the philosophy of existence and the conversation. But in that
*  conversation, there is a beautiful art of turn-taking and mutual inference, theory of mind.
*  I have to know when you want to listen, I have to know when you want to interrupt,
*  I have to make sure that you're online. I have to have a model in my head of your model in your
*  head. That's the highest, the most sophisticated form of generative model where the generative
*  model actually has a generative model of somebody else's generative model. And I think that and what
*  we are doing now evinces the kinds of generative models that would support self-awareness.
*  Because without that, we'd both be talking over each other or we'd be singing together in a choir,
*  which is probably not, that's not a brilliant analogy for what I'm trying to say. But
*  we wouldn't have this discourse.
*  Yeah, the dance of it. Yeah, that's right. You have to have, as I interrupt,
*  I mean, that's beautifully put. I'll re-listen to this conversation many times. There's so
*  much poetry in this and mathematics. Let me ask the silliest or perhaps the biggest question
*  as a last kind of question. We've talked about living in existence and the objective function
*  under which these objects would operate. What do you think is the objective function of
*  our existence? What's the meaning of life? What do you think is the, for you perhaps, the purpose,
*  the source of fulfillment, the source of meaning for your existence as one blob in this soup?
*  I'm tempted to answer that again as a physicist. Free energy, I expect, consequent upon my behaviour.
*  So technically that, and we can get a really interesting conversation about what that comprises
*  in terms of searching for information, resolving uncertainty about the kind of thing that I am.
*  But I suspect that you want a slightly more personal and fun answer,
*  but which can be consistent with that. I think it's reassuringly simple and harps back to what you
*  were taught as a child, that you have certain beliefs about the kind of creature and the kind
*  of person you are and all that self-evidencing means, all that minimising variational free energy
*  in an inactive and embodied way means is fulfilling the beliefs about what kind of thing you are.
*  And of course we're all given those scripts, those narratives at a very early age, usually in the
*  form of bedtime stories or fairy stories that I'm a princess and I'm going to meet a beast who's
*  going to transform and it's going to be a prince. So the narratives are all around you from your
*  parents to the friends, to the society feeds these stories and then your objective function is to
*  fulfil. Exactly. That narrative that has been encultured by your immediate family, but as you
*  say also the sort of the culture in which you grew up and you create for yourself. I mean again,
*  because of this active inference, this inactive aspect of self-evidencing,
*  not only am I modelling my environment, my Econish, my external states out there, but I'm
*  actively changing them all the time and external states are doing the same back,
*  we're doing it together. So there's a synchrony that means that I'm creating my own culture over
*  different timescales. So the question now is for me being very selfish, what scripts were I given?
*  It basically was a mixture between Einstein and Sherlock Holmes. So I smoke as heavily as possible,
*  tried to avoid too much interpersonal contact, enjoy the fantasy that you're a popular scientist
*  is going to make a difference in a slightly quirky way. So that's what I grew up on. My father was an
*  engineer and loved science and he loved things like Sir Arthur Eddington's Space, Time and
*  Gravitation, which was the first understandable version of general relativity. So all the fairy
*  stories I was told as I was growing up were all about these characters, keeping the Hobbit out
*  of this because that was quite fitting my narrative. There's a journey of exploration,
*  I suppose, of sorts. So yeah, I've just grown up to be what I imagine a mild-mannered Sherlock Holmes
*  slash Albert Einstein would do in my shoes. And you did it elegantly and beautifully,
*  Karl. It was a huge honor talking to you today. It was fun. Thank you so much for your time.
