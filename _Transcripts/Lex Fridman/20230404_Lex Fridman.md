# Paul Rosolie: Amazon Jungle, Uncontacted Tribes, Anacondas, and Ayahuasca | Lex Fridman Podcast #369
**Lex Fridman:** [April 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPfriiHBBek)
*  it was just like one of those moments where we saw it at the same time. And we're standing by the
*  tail and the snake was so big that, I mean, this must've been a 25 foot Anaconda, dead asleep,
*  with a, probably a 16 foot Anaconda like sprawled across her. And they're laying in the starlight
*  and we're floating on top of a lake standing there in the middle of the Amazon. And JJ just,
*  I just, I could feel the blood drain out of his face. And as like a, however old I was,
*  maybe 20 years old, I just said, if we could somehow show people this, we'll be on the front
*  cover in National Geographic and we can protect all the jungle that we want. And so I tried to
*  catch it. So I jumped on the snake and the only measurement I have of this animal is that when I
*  wrapped my arms around it, I couldn't touch my fingers. And so I was, you know, my feet were
*  dragging and to her credit, this Anaconda did not turn around and eat me because her head was, you
*  know, this big. And she went and she reached the edge of the grass island and she starts plunging
*  into the dark. And so I'm watching the stars vibrate as this Anaconda is going. And I had to
*  make the choice of either going head first down into the black, which no thank you, or stopping
*  and just keeping my hand on this thing as it raced by me. And I just felt the scales and the
*  muscle and the power go by and then eventually taper down to the tail until it slipped away into
*  the darkness. And I was laying there just panting. The following is a conversation with Paul Rosley,
*  a conservationist, explorer, author, filmmaker, and real life Tarzan. Since for much of the past
*  17 years, Paul has lived deep in the Amazon rainforest, protecting endangered species and
*  trees from poachers, loggers, and foreign nations funding them. He is the founder of Jungle Keepers,
*  which today protects over 50,000 acres of threatened habitat. And Paul is one of the most
*  incredible human beings I've ever met. I hope to travel with him in the Amazon jungle one day,
*  because in his eyes, I saw a truth that can only be discovered directly by spending time among the
*  immensity and power of nature at its purest. This is the Lex Freedman podcast. To support it,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Paul Rosley.
*  In 2006, at 18 years old, you fled New York and traveled to the Amazon. This started a journey
*  that I think lasts to this day. Tell me about this first leap. What in your heart pulled you
*  towards the Amazon jungle? From the time I was three years old, I'd say. It was dinosaurs,
*  wildlife documentaries, Steve Irwin, you name it. And when my parents said nature versus nurture,
*  they nurtured my nature. I was always just drawn to streams, forests. I wanted to go explore where
*  the little creek led. I wanted to see the turtles and the snakes. And so, I was a kid that hated
*  school, did not get along with school. I was dyslexic and didn't know it, undiagnosed. I didn't
*  read until I was like 10 years old, like way behind. And so, for me, the forest was safety.
*  I remember one time in first grade, they had you doing those multiplication sheets. That was pure
*  hell for me. And so, I actually got so upset that I couldn't do it that I ran out the classroom,
*  ran out the door and went to the nearest woods and I stayed there because that was safe.
*  And so, for me, once I got to the point where I was like high school isn't working out,
*  I had incredibly supportive parents that were like, look, just get out. Take your GED, get out of
*  high school after 10th grade. You got to go to college, but start doing something you love.
*  And so, I saved up and bought a ticket to the Amazon and met some indigenous guys. And
*  the second I walked in that forest, it was like the first scene in Jurassic Park when they see
*  the dinosaurs and they go, oh, this is it. I walked in there and just I looked at those giant
*  trees. I saw leaf cutter ants in real life and I just went, oh, it was like the movie just started.
*  That was when I came online. Can you put into words, what is it about
*  that place that felt like home? What was it that drew you? What aspect of nature, the streams,
*  the water, the forest, the jungle, the animals, what drew you?
*  It's just, it's always been in my blood. I mean, for any forest, I mean, whether it's
*  upstate New York or India or Borneo, but the Amazon, it's all of that turned up to this level
*  where everything is superlatively diverse. You have more plants and animals than anywhere else
*  on earth, not just now, but in the entire fossil record. It's the Andes Amazon interface. Terrestrially,
*  that's where it is. That's the greatest library of life that has ever existed. And so, you're so
*  stimulated. You're so overwhelmed with color and diversity and beauty and this overwhelming
*  sense of natural majesty of these thousand year old trees and half the life is up in the canopy
*  of those trees. We don't even have access to it. There's stuff without names walking around on
*  those branches and it's like, it just takes you somewhere. And so, going there, it was like,
*  the guys I met just opened the door and they were like, how far do you want to go down the
*  rabbit hole? How much of this do you want to see? You mentioned Steve Irwin. You list a bunch of
*  heroes that you have. He's one of them. And you said that when you're unsure about a decision,
*  you ask yourself, WWSD, what would Steve do? Why is that such a good heuristic for life? What would
*  Steve do? He's a human being that like everything we saw from Steve Irwin was positive. Everything
*  was with a smile on his face. If he was getting bitten by a reticulated python, he was smiling.
*  If he was getting destroyed in the news for feeding a crocodile with his son too close,
*  he was trying to explain to people why it's okay and why we have to love these animals.
*  And everything was about love. Everything was about wildlife and protecting. And to me,
*  a person like that, where you only see positive things, that's a role model.
*  And it's just like an endless curiosity and hunger to explore this world of nature.
*  Yeah. And then insatiable madness for wildlife. I mean, the guy was just so much fun.
*  If it's okay, read to you a few of your own words. You opened
*  the book Mother of God with a passage that I think beautifully paints the scene.
*  Before he died, Santiago Duran told me a secret. It was late at night in a palm-thatched hut on a
*  bank of the Tembopata River, deep in the southwestern corner of the Amazon Basin.
*  Besides a mud oven, two wild boar heads sizzling, sizzled in a cradle of embers,
*  their protruding tusks curling in static agony as they cooked. The smell of burning,
*  sacropia wood, and cinched flesh filled the air. Woven basket containing monkey skulls hung from
*  the rafters, where stars peeked through the gaps in the thatching. A pair of chickens huddled in
*  the corner, conversing softly. We sat facing each other on sturdy benches, across a table
*  hewn from a single cross section of some massive tree, now nearly consumed by termites. The song
*  of a million insects and frogs filled the night. Santiago's cigarette trembled in the aged fingers
*  as he leaned close over the candlelight to describe a place hidden in the jungle. That line,
*  the songs of a million insects and frogs filled the night, for some reason hit me.
*  What's it like sitting there conversing among so many living creatures all around you?
*  Every night in the jungle, you live in constant awareness of that out there in the darkness
*  are literally millions of heartbeats around you. And so like, we exist in this domesticated,
*  paved world most of the time, but when you go out there past the roads and the telephone poles and
*  the hospitals and you make it out into earth, just wild earth, and there's no, there's no,
*  there's not, it's not like this is a national park. There's no rescue helicopter waiting to
*  come get you. You are out there and you're surrounded at night by, I mean, there are snakes
*  and jaguars and frogs and insects and all this stuff just crawling through the swamps and through
*  the trees and through the branches. And we put on headlamps and go out into the night and just
*  absolutely fall to our knees with wonder of the things that we see. It's absolutely incredible.
*  And most of it doesn't make sounds like the insects do.
*  The insects do, the frogs do. You have some of the night birds making sounds, but a lot of it,
*  everything has evolved to be silent, invisible. I mean, everything there is in the, on the list,
*  like, like I, there's another line in mother of God where I said, like, you know, like life is
*  just like a temporary moment of stasis and like the churning recycling death march that is the Amazon.
*  Like it's, it's been called the greatest natural battlefield on earth. I mean,
*  if any, in any square acre, there's more stuff eating other things than anywhere else. And,
*  and you go through a swamp in the Amazon and there's like, there's tarantulas floating on
*  the water. There's frogs in the trees. There's, there's, there's tadpoles hanging from leaves
*  waiting to drop into the water. There's fish waiting to eat them. There's birds in the tree.
*  You sit, you literally are surrounded by so many things that your brain can't process it.
*  It's, it's just overwhelming life. Churning death march. Some of the creatures are waiting
*  and some of them are being a bit more proactive about it. What do you make of that churning
*  death march that the amount of murder that's happening all around you at all scales? What is
*  that? You know, we, uh, we dramatize wars and the millions of people that were lost in world war two,
*  uh, some of them tortured, some of them dying, uh, with a gun in hand, some of them civilians,
*  but it's just millions of people. What about the billions and billions and billions of
*  organisms that are just being murdered all around you? Does that, um, do you,
*  does that change your view of nature of life here?
*  I've always kind of wondered like that. Like when you see like a, you know,
*  wildebeest taken down by lions and, and eaten from behind while it's alive.
*  And it makes you question God, you know, you go, how could, how could, how could they let this happen?
*  In the Amazon, I find personally that these natural processes make up
*  almost a religion that it reminds you how temporary we are, that, you know, the, the,
*  the bot flies that are trying to get into your skin and the mosquitoes that are trying to suck
*  your blood and the, you know, that when you sweat, you see, you see the, you literally can like hold
*  out your arm and watch the condensation come off of your skin and rise up into the canopy and join
*  the clouds and rain back down in the afternoon. And then you drink the river and start it all
*  over again. And it's like, it's flowing through you. So the Amazon reminds me that, that there's a
*  lot that we don't understand. And so when it comes to that overwhelming and collective murder, as
*  Werner Herzog put it, it's just, it's just part of the show. It's part of the freak show of the
*  Amazonian night. I see you, I, you in certain moments able to feel one with a mosquito that's
*  trying to kill you slowly. One with the mosquito is a stretch. Is it always the enemy? What I mean
*  is like, you're part of the machine there, right? Yeah. And it's like fair play. It's like fair
*  place. Like we have bullet ants and like, you know, you get, you get nailed by a bullet ant and you
*  just go, yeah, well, well done. Today's over. I'm going back to bed and I'm taking a pile of Tylenol.
*  Do you think in that sense, when you're out there, are you a part of nature or are you separate from
*  nature? Is man a part of nature or separate? I think that's what's so refreshing about it is
*  that out there you truly are. And so whether we're bringing researchers or film crews or,
*  or whether we're just out there ourselves on an expedition, you truly are a part of nature. And so
*  one of the things that the, my team and I started doing when I became friends with these guys,
*  you know, this is a family of indigenous people from the community of Infierno and they took me in
*  and as we got close, they started saying, you know, you can come with us on our like annual
*  hunting trip. And I went, okay. And it's four guys in a boat and you don't want to get your clothes
*  wet. So we're all in like our boxers in a canoe with a motor going out past the places that have
*  names and you're out in the middle of the jungle. And the thing is like, when your,
*  when your motor breaks, you are so quickly reminded of the inerrant truths, like the things that
*  nobody can argue with. And we live in such a human world where everything is debatable,
*  religion and politics and perspectives on everything. And then you get down to this point
*  where it's like, if we don't figure something out, the river is going to rise and take the boat.
*  That's the truth. And ain't nobody going to like argue with that. And it's like, to me,
*  there's a beauty in that truth because then all of us are united there in that, in that truth
*  against like the natural facts around us. And so to me, I, that's, that's, that's a state where I
*  feel very, very at home. And the Amazon is more efficient than most places on earth at swallowing
*  you up. Oh God. Yeah. Okay. So just to linger on that, because you've spoken about Francisco
*  de Aralana, who's this explorer in, in 1541 and 42 that's still the length of the Amazon.
*  Yeah. Probably one of the first. And there's just a few things I should probably read. I should
*  probably find a good book on him because the guy seems like a gangster. Yes. Some great books on
*  him. So he sailed, he led the expedition that sailed all the way from one end to the other.
*  There's like a rebuilding of a ship, which is insanity. Yeah. Yeah. So you, cause it speaks
*  to the thing is like, nobody's going to come and rescue you. No, you have to, if your boat dies,
*  you got to have to rebuild it. Yeah. So they came down the Andes, entered in the headwaters of the
*  Amazon, constructed some sort of raft, boat, craft, something, and made it down the entire
*  Amazon basin. Of course, his stories are the ones that led to the Amazon being called the Amazon
*  because he reported tribes of women. He reported these large cities, places where the tribes lived
*  on farms of river turtles that they corralled and they lived off of that protein. And then when they
*  came out to the mouth of the Amazon, if I remember it correctly, that just through navigation and the
*  stars, they were able to calculate where the way was back to Spain and make a boat sea worthy
*  enough to bring them home. Incredible. Absolutely. Do people like that inspire you, your own journey?
*  Like what gives you kind of strength that in these harshest of times and harshest of conditions,
*  you can persevere? Yeah. I mean, you look at the stories of people that are so, you know,
*  these stories of people that have overcome incredible suffering like that, or like, you
*  know, what Shackleton did or something like that. And so like when you're, you know, I've been,
*  you know, your tent gets washed away, you go to sleep and the river rises 20 feet and washes
*  away your tent and you crawl out and all you have is a machete and a headlamp, literally no bag,
*  no food, no nothing. And you go, wow, the next six days before I reach back to a town is going to be
*  just pure hell. I'm going to be sleeping on the ground covered in ants, destroyed by mosquitoes.
*  And then it becomes, you know, am I in any capacity, any percentage as tough and resilient
*  as the people that I've read about that have made it through things far worse than this? And then
*  that's the game you play. What goes through your head? I mean, all you got is the headlamp and the
*  machete. So are you thinking at all? Like I've gotten a chance to interact quite a lot with Elon
*  Musk and he constantly puts out fires, having to run several companies. There's never a kind of
*  whiny deliberation about issues. You just always, one step forward, how to solve, right? This is the
*  situation, how do you solve it? Or do you also have a kind of self-motivating, almost egotistical,
*  like I'm a bad motherfucker. I can handle anything. Almost like trying to fake it till you make it
*  kind of thing. There was a little bit of that. With your machete and a headlamp. I got a sword.
*  Yeah, there may have been a little bit of that when I was like 14, 15 years old. I'd have a
*  hunting knife and my dog and I'd go out into the woods or the Catskills and survive for a weekend.
*  My rule was one match. You get one match and you got to make shelter and then I'd bring a steak and
*  make a fire and stuff. And at that point there may be with some ego, but in the Amazon,
*  you get stripped down so completely that you... It's like that thing, watch the atheism leave
*  everyone's body when they think they're about to die. It's like when you find yourself staring up
*  at the Amazon at night and you go, there is no hope of getting out of here. I mean, I was once
*  lost in a swamp where it took me days to get out of there. And there was moments where I just said,
*  this is clearly it. There's no ego there. There's just hope. You start realizing what you believe in
*  and praying that you'll be okay and then trying to summon whatever you know about how to survive.
*  And that's it. And so it's actually, again, it's kind of a blissful state if you can walk that line
*  between adventure and tragedy and keep yourself right at that very, very fine line without going
*  over. Ever fear of death, fear, ever fear, terror? No, I don't want to die. I love the people in my
*  life and there's a lot of things I want to do, but every time I've been certain that I'm going to
*  die, I've been very, very calm. Very calm and just sort of like, okay, well, if this is how the movie
*  goes, then this is how it goes. Almost accepting. Yeah. Which is reassuring. You mentioned Herzog,
*  just to venture down this road of death and fear and so on. There's been a few madmen like you
*  in this world. He's documented a couple of them. What lessons do you draw from Grizzly Man
*  or Into the Wild, those kinds of stories? Were you ever afraid that you would be one of those stories?
*  Oh yeah. I actually think that that's in Mother of God where I said I almost
*  into the wilded myself. I went out there and really I got so lost and so destroyed that
*  I said, this is going to be the next one. This is going to be the next story of some idiot kid
*  from New York who went to the Amazon thinking he was Percy Fawcett and then vanished. Because if you
*  do vanish out there, your body's going to be consumed in a matter of days, like two. If we see
*  an animal dead on a trail, you got dung beetles and fly larva and vultures and there's a whole
*  pecking order. You get the black vultures, the yellow vultures, the king vulture, they all come
*  in. That thing is picked clean in a couple of days. What would be the creature that eats most
*  of you in that situation? Probably the vultures. Probably the vultures and the maggots. It's really
*  quick. It's really, really quick. Even as far as you can't leave food out. If you have a piece of
*  chicken, you say, I'll eat it in the morning. You leave it out. You can't do that. It's not good by
*  morning. Grizzly Man, for example, because that's a beautiful story. It's both comical and genius,
*  and especially the way Herzog tells it. First, do you like the way he told the story? Do you
*  like Herzog? I do. I love Herzog and I love his documentary, The Burden of Dreams, which is in the
*  Amazon, not very far from where I work. The sheer madness that you see this man undergoing of just
*  trying to recreate hauling a boat over a mountain is wild. The extras that he hired to play the
*  natives are the, I think they're Machiganga tribesmen and they just look like all the guys
*  that I hang out with. They're doing all this stuff in the jungle that months and months and months,
*  and you can just see him deteriorating with madness because the jungle, your boat,
*  you know how many times I've tied up a boat to the side of the river? This just happened a year
*  and a half ago. I tied up, through COVID, I pretty much just lived in the jungle for a while.
*  There was nobody there and there was no support. I tied up my boat and the rain is just hammering.
*  The universe is trying to rip the earth in half. The rain is just going and the river is rising.
*  I tied up the boat, but then you go to sleep and you got to wake up every two hours to go check the
*  boat. The boat is thrashing back and forth. All night, every two hours, I'd wake up barefoot
*  in driving rain, like golf ball raindrops, and just go down and check the boat. Then by morning,
*  I was like, I fell asleep, woke up, checked the boat, and then I was like, I'm just going to go
*  make coffee. I was so done. I was so at the end of my rope every time bailing the boat out and stuff.
*  And then we got 15 minutes of heavy rain that filled the boat, sank it.
*  Now I'm stuck up river with no boat. It's like that type of thing where it's like,
*  no matter how hard you try, the jungle is just like, listen, you're nothing. You are nothing.
*  It's that constant reminder. Herzog really threw himself into that in that film and it's brilliant
*  to watch. What do you think he meant by the line that you include in your book? It's a land that
*  God, if he exists, has created in anger. Said in German accent.
*  Yeah. Overwhelming and collective murder.
*  So he didn't really appreciate the beauty of the murder.
*  I think he appreciated it, but to him, it was very dark. I think he saw the darkness in it,
*  and that's there. It sure is. As soon as you do ayahuasca, that door opens and you see the
*  darkness because it brings you right into the jungle, the heart of it. But I think that for him,
*  I think that darkness is something that he embraces and that he loves. There's another film of his,
*  and I don't know if this is accurate, but my memory has it, that there's a penguin,
*  and I think it's in Antarctica, and the penguin's going in the wrong direction,
*  away from the ocean. And I feel like he goes on this monologue about how he's just had enough.
*  He's just, you know, this one penguin is just marching towards, you know.
*  Yeah. Well, because I remember that clip from that documentary, and what Werner says is that the
*  penguin is deranged. He's lost his mind. And I took offense to that because maybe that's a
*  brave explorer. How do you know there's not a lot more going on? It could be a love story.
*  Those penguins get super attached. Maybe his mate was over there and he had to go find her.
*  Or it's a lost mate and he last time he saw her was going in that direction. So this is like the
*  great explorer. We assume animals are like the average of the bell curve. Like every animal
*  we interact with is just the average, but there's special ones. Just like there's special humans.
*  Yeah. That could be a special penguin. It could have been. And I had the same thought where I was
*  like, I found it beautiful how he interpreted it. What I took away from that was I found that
*  Werner Herzog's monologue there was brilliantly dark and also comedic, but maybe irrelevant
*  biologically speaking towards penguins. Which happens a lot with animals. I find there's so
*  many times where I'll find people be like, do you think that animals can show compassion? And you
*  hear a bunch of people that have never left the pavement talking about like, wow, this one animal
*  helped another animal. It's like, go ask Jane Goodall if animals can show compassion. Go talk
*  to anybody that works on a daily basis with animals. And so to me, there's always a little
*  bit of frustration and hearing people sort of pleasantly surprised that animals aren't just
*  these automatons of just, what's the word, programmed nothingness.
*  First of all, what have you learned about life from Jane Goodall? Because she spoke highly of
*  your book and you listed as one of the mentors, but what kind of wisdom about animals do you
*  draw from her? The wisdom from Jane is so diverse. First of all, she's someone that, the work that
*  she did at the time she did it was so incredible because she was out there at a very young age
*  doing that field work. She was naming her subjects, which everyone said you shouldn't do.
*  She broke every rule. She broke every rule. She was assigning and everyone said, you're
*  anthropomorphizing these animals by saying that they're doing this and that. And she was like,
*  no, they're interacting. They're showing love, they're showing compassion, they're showing hate,
*  they're showing fear. And she broke straight through all of those things and it paid off in
*  dividends for her. Do you see the animals as having all those human-like emotions of anger,
*  of compassion, of longing, of loneliness from what you've seen, especially with mammals,
*  or with different species out there? Do they have all of that?
*  It depends on the animal. If you're talking on the scale of a cockroach to an elephant,
*  it's like a lot of these things. And I wonder about this stuff all the time. I'll have a praying
*  mantis on my hand and just go, what is going through your mind? Or you'll see a spider make
*  a complex decision and go, I'm going to make my web there. And you go, how are you doing this?
*  Because he made a calculation there. It's smart. I was in the jungle not that long ago and I was
*  walking and all of a sudden this dove comes flying through the jungle right up to my face,
*  lands on a branch right here, right next to me. I look at the dove, the dove looks at me
*  and she's like, hey. And she's clearly panting. And I'm like, why are you so close to me? This
*  is weird. And she's like, I know. And then an ornate hawk eagle flies up 10 feet away,
*  looks at both of us and just scowls and sticks up its head feathers and then just
*  flies off. And the dove was like, sweet, thanks. And then flew in the other direction. And I was
*  like, dude, you just used me to save your life. The dove knew. See, this is what,
*  because there's Mike Tyson and there's Albert Einstein. And sometimes I wonder when I look at
*  different creatures, even insects, is this Mike Tyson or is this Einstein? Or other kinds of
*  personality? Is this a New Yorker or is this a midwesterner or is this a San Francisco barista
*  of the insects? There's all kinds of personalities you never know. So you can't project.
*  If you run into a bear and it's very angry, it could be just the asshole New Yorker.
*  Yeah, sure. What are you saying about New Yorkers, man?
*  Exactly. Point well made. So speaking about communicating with a dove,
*  first met the crew in the Amazon, you talk about JJ as somebody who can communicate with animals.
*  What do you think JJ is able to see and hear and feel that others don't, that he's able to
*  communicate with animals? When I say this is the most skilled jungle man I've ever seen, and I know
*  so many guys in the region, he has libraries of information in his cranium that we cannot fath-
*  It's just stunning. I have seen him use medicinal plants to cure things that
*  Western doctors couldn't cure. I've seen him navigate in such a way that he's not using the
*  stars. He's not using any discernible. It's like when elephants, sometimes you'll watch a herd of
*  elephants and they'll be like, yo, let's go, we're going this way. And you'll see them sort
*  of communicate, but there's no audible sound. They'll just decide that they're going that
*  way. They all do it. JJ has this way in the jungle of, he'll stop and he'll go wait. And you go,
*  what is it? And he goes, there's a herd of peccary coming. And I'm like, where? Based on what? And
*  he's like, just wait, you'll see. And he'll sit there. You think that's just experience?
*  It's incredible experience. It's growing up barefoot in the Amazon. And the gift is that he can
*  speak fluent English. And so when I bring tourists and scientists or news reporters down there,
*  he can communicate with them. He's actually good on camera because he doesn't care about cameras.
*  And for instance, we were walking up a stream a few months ago and I went, hey, look, Jaguar
*  tracks. And he went, oh, and I was like, what? Jaguar tracks. And he's like, no, look, look harder.
*  And I was like, the toes are deeper than the back. And he was like, uh-huh. And where are they? And
*  I was like, by the water. And I was like, the Jaguar is drinking. It was leaning to drink. And
*  he was like, that's right. He's like, now look behind you. I look behind me and there's scat.
*  There's a big log of Jaguar shit sitting there. It's got butterflies all over it.
*  Mm-hmm. Fresh?
*  Pretty fresh. And then there's another one that's less fresh. And so he's teaching me as he does,
*  he's going, look at this, look at this. Is that one as fresh as this one? No. And then he goes,
*  now look up, look up. There's three vultures above us. The kill is near us. The Jaguar has
*  been coming multiple times to the river to drink as it's feasting on whatever it killed. And he's
*  going, it's within 30 feet of us right now. And it's like, I'm like, oh, look, impressions in the
*  sand. He's like, I just drew 19 conclusions from that. It's like watching Sherlock Holmes at work.
*  It's just- Constructing the crime scene.
*  Incredible. Does that apply also to be able to communicate with the actual animals?
*  Read into their body movements directly into their, whatever that dove was saying to you,
*  you'd be able to understand. Or is that all just kind of taking in the complex
*  structure of the crime scene, of the interactions of the different animals,
*  of the environment, and so on? What is that that you're able to communicate with another creature,
*  that he was able to communicate with another creature?
*  He knows the intention of pose. He knows the habits. He knows the perspective. When
*  when he talks about animals, he'll talk about each species as if it's a person. So he'll say,
*  oh, the jaguar, she never likes to let you see her. And so he'll come back from the jungle and
*  he'll go, oh, I was watching monkeys and this jaguar was also watching the monkeys, but I was
*  being so quiet. She didn't see me. And then when she see me, she feels so embarrassed and she go.
*  And he'll tell you this story like, as if he had this interaction with like his neighbor.
*  And he'll be like, oh, the puka kunga, it never does that. You won't see it do that. And so one
*  time he caught a fish and I was such a big fish. It was this big, beautiful Pseudo-pladistoma,
*  this tiger catfish, this amazing old fish, and they're all excited to eat it. And I felt so bad
*  watching this thing gasp on the sand. And I went, you know what? We don't need this. This is for fun.
*  I threw it back. And then I took my hand and I went and I made like drag marks. So I could say,
*  oh, it snuck back in the water. And so he walks up, he looks at it and he was like,
*  I hate you. And I went, what? No, I said, I mean, it must've, it must've just, he went,
*  that's not what happens. He goes, it goes like this when it goes, he knew the track of a fish.
*  And I was like, oh yeah. I was like, all right, JJ, I'm sorry. I'll catch you another fish.
*  So stepping back to that way you opened mother of God. Yeah. Who was Santiago Duran and what
*  secret did he tell you? JJ's father was, at some point he was a policeman. At some point,
*  when he was a teenager, he was working on the boats that before this little gold mining city
*  of Puerto Maldonado grew, the only way to get supplies in was to take canoes up the Tempopada
*  river up to the next state, which is Puno and, and where the mules would come down from the mountains
*  with supplies and then he'd pilot the boats down, but they didn't have motors at that time. So he
*  would be pulling the boat. So he was, he became this physically terrifying man. And I met him
*  in, when he was in his eighties and he was still living out in the jungle by himself. And I mean,
*  he's seen an Anaconda eat a taper, which is the, you know, a cow sized mammal on the Amazon.
*  He'd seen uncontacted tribes face to face. He once killed an 11 foot electric eel,
*  opened the back of the thing's neck, removed the nerve that he says was the source of the electric.
*  Then he cut his forearm, placed that nerve into his forearm, wrapped it with a dead toad and
*  claimed that it would give him strength through the rest of his life and continued to be a jungle
*  bad-ass until the day he quietly leaned back at a barbecue and ceased to be alive.
*  The man was incredible, but the secret that he told us was that if you want to find big Anacondas,
*  if you want to see the Yakumama, he was like, you have to go to the bow, the place of Boas,
*  the place that we came to call the floating forest. And so he sent us there and it became like this,
*  this pilgrimage and, you know, in the Amazon, the, a lot of the creation myths are based around the
*  Anaconda coming down from the heavens and carving the rivers across the jungle. And if you look at
*  the rivers, it looks like that. It looks like the path of an Anaconda crawling through the jungle.
*  It's even the right color. And so from the reference to the tribes of women, the Amazons,
*  to the Anaconda mother, everything in the Amazon is very feminine based. Even the,
*  even the trees, the largest trees in the jungle, the mother of the forest, the Madre de la Selva
*  is the K-Pak tree. And it's just this monster tree, these beautiful ancient trees.
*  And that was the beginning of the transition that we made from me being like, I hate school. I want
*  to go on adventures. You know, Jane Goodall got to do all this amazing stuff. I'm just a kid stuck
*  here to, to eventually becoming something that had to do with where my identity became the jungle,
*  where my life became the jungle. The secret that he told us opened that door because when we started
*  working with these giant snakes, it started getting attention. It started getting people to go,
*  what are you doing? And it started, it started allowing me to have experiences that, that
*  solidified and nailed down the fact that this wasn't just like a weekend retreat. This was,
*  this was something that, that I was born to do.
*  RG And gave you more and more motivation to go into these uncharted territory
*  of the Yak, Yakamama. Which just to step back, what nations are we talking about here? Is this
*  some geography? What are we talking about? Where is this?
*  AC So I'm in Peru. We're in Peru. And so Peru-
*  RG Which is a South American nation.
*  AC Peru is a South American nation. Brazil has 60% of the Amazon, which is unfortunate
*  because anything that happens politically in Brazil has a massive impact on the Amazon. Peru
*  has the Western Amazon and Ecuador has a little bit of the Western Amazon. And
*  AC the Western Amazon is where the Andes Mountains,
*  the cloud forests, which is a mega biodiverse biome falls into the Western Amazon lowlands.
*  And so you have these, the meeting of these two incredible biomes. And that's what makes this
*  like superlative, incredible, you know, glowing moment of life on earth. So yeah, we're in Peru
*  in the Madre de Dios, which is the mother of God, which I always thought was such a beautiful,
*  you know, the jungle is the source of all life. And so we were with the Eseaha people and they
*  belong to a community that's called Infierno, which was given by the missionaries who, when they
*  tried to go bring these people, Jesus got so many arrows shot at them that they just called it hell.
*  And so Santiago Duran helped unite these tribes that were sort of scattered through the jungle
*  and get them status, government recognized status as indigenous people. So he was sort of a hero.
*  He was sort of a legend for a lot of the stuff he'd done out barefoot with just like a rifle
*  and a machete in the jungle. He had 19 children and the last one, I think the 20th child that he
*  adopted was a refugee from the shining path that floated down the river. And he just took him in.
*  And you know, this is just a guy that was a, you know, everything he did, like when he died,
*  the whole region showed up. It was, he was somebody. So just the fact that I know him gives
*  me street credit. Like the fact that I knew him, I can go like, oh, I knew Santiago and people like,
*  no. I'm like, yeah. So you have to get integrated to the culture, to the place that me in every
*  single way, which is, which is tough for you for the being from, from New York. Yeah. Yeah. It
*  could have been tough, but it was, I took to it, you know, the jungle, they, they were very,
*  you know, JJ is teaching me about medicines and we were doing bird surveys and, you know, taking
*  data on macaw populations. And JJ was just like, you really want to like, he goes, you got to sleep.
*  And I was like, I only have a few weeks here. I know, I don't know if I'm ever going to come back.
*  I'm never going to sleep. So we'd be out every night looking for all the wildlife we could. I
*  wanted to take photos. I wanted to see things. And, and then, you know, the, the exchange came
*  with that. He was like, you know, I'm terrified of snakes. And I said, well, I've always worked
*  with snakes. I said, I'll teach you how to handle snakes. And then we just had this like little
*  exchange. And when I left after my first time back in 2006, you know, I said, I said, how can I help?
*  And, and they were like, look, you know, we're out here trying to protect this,
*  this little island of forest that is going to be bulldozed. And, and the more people that you can
*  bring, the more knowledge and the more awareness that you can bring to this, it'll help. And so
*  really at that age, at 18 years old, I sort of started dabbling with the idea of that. I could be
*  part of helping these people to protect this place that I loved. And of course, at that time,
*  that idea seemed like too large of a dream or too large of a, of a, of a challenge to that I could
*  actually impact it. So what was the journey of looking for these giant snakes of looking for
*  anacondas? What are anacondas? Anaconda is the largest snake on earth. So you have
*  reticulated pythons in Southeast Asia. They're actually longer, but anacondas are these massive
*  boas. They give live birth and unlike a lot of other species. So an anaconda starts off,
*  you know, a little two foot anaconda, just a little thicker than your finger, a little baby.
*  And their food for cane toads, herons, crocodiles, you name it. They're pretty harmless,
*  defenseless, but as they grow, they're eating the fish, they're eating the crocs, and then they grow
*  a little more and they're eating things like capybara and they're eating larger prey. And then
*  at the end of their life, a female anaconda, you're talking about a 25, 30 foot, 300, 400 pound snake
*  with a head bigger than a football. And these things, that means that they impact the entire
*  ecosystem, which is very unique. Moves up the food chain to become basically.
*  An apex predator. Yeah, apex predator.
*  Yeah. The apex predator of the rivers. And so-
*  That's how interesting it's just eating your way up the food chain.
*  Eating your way up the food chain. If you can survive and like they, you know,
*  they're constantly at war with everything else, but you know, so I showed up in the Amazon,
*  I was like, so where the anaconda is at? And they were like, oh, no, no, no, it's not like that.
*  They're like, it's you, you have to find these things. They're, they're subterranean. They're
*  living in the special swamps. They're people kill them. And so we went to the floating forest after
*  we'd come back from an expedition, we'd called like a 12 foot anaconda and it's now it's become
*  like this like classic photo of me and JJ with this anaconda over our shoulders. And we were like,
*  we, you know, we 12 days out in the jungle on a hunting trip. And we, we came back and we showed
*  his dad and Santiago looked at us and he was like, that's the smallest anaconda I've ever seen.
*  He's like, you guys are pathetic. And he was like, look, you go to the, go. He was like, go. He's
*  like, I'm giving you permission. Go to the boy or go to the floating forest. And so we went to this
*  place and we reached there at night and it was me, JJ and one of his brothers and his brother took
*  one look at it and was like, I'm out. And he started walking back and me and JJ get to the edge of
*  this thing. And this is our friendship. It's both this two idiots pushing each other farther and
*  farther. And like, I like put a foot on the, on the ground and it all shook and the stars are
*  reflecting on the ground. And what we realized is that it's a lake with floating grass on top of it.
*  And there's islands of grass floating on this lake, very life of pie. And the tops of trees
*  are coming out of the surface of the water. And so we start walking across this and JJ is going,
*  these are big anacondas. And I'm going, JJ, that's a two foot wide, smooth path,
*  snaking through the grass. There's no anaconda that big. He was going, they're listening. I said,
*  they don't have ears. He goes, they're listening. And it's like, we're walking and we're walking.
*  And then it's like, maybe it's like 1 AM or something. And it was just like one of those
*  moments where we saw it at the same time and we're standing by the tail and the snake
*  was so big that, I mean, this must've been a 25 foot anaconda dead asleep with a,
*  with a, probably a 16 foot anaconda like sprawled across her. And they're laying in the starlight
*  and we're floating on top of a lake standing there in the middle of the Amazon. And JJ just,
*  I just, I could feel the blood drain out of his face. And as like a, however old I was,
*  maybe 20 years old, I just said, if I, if we could somehow show people this,
*  we'll be on the front cover in national geographic and we can protect all the jungle that we want.
*  And so I tried to catch it. Yeah. So I jumped on the snake and the only measurement I have
*  of this animal is that when I wrapped my arms around it, I couldn't touch my fingers.
*  And so I was, my feet were dragging and to her credit, this anaconda did not turn around and
*  eat me because her head was, you know, this way and, and she went and she reached the edge of the,
*  the grass Island and she starts plunging into the dark. And so I'm watching the stars vibrate as
*  this anaconda is going and I had to make the choice of either going head first down into the black,
*  which no thank you, or stopping and just keeping my hand on this thing as it raced by me. And I
*  just felt the scales and the muscle and the power go by and then eventually taper down to the tail
*  until it slipped away into the darkness. And I was laying there just panting.
*  And then I turned around and went, JJ, what the fuck? Like, where were you, man?
*  He was just like completely white circuits blown. And I had to go then like, kind of like take care
*  of him. I was like, are you okay? And he was like, no, he, you know, he just couldn't. And so we came
*  back with that. And then after that, we were like, okay, we have clearly, clearly the parameters of
*  reality that we thought were possible are, are, are just a tiny fraction of what's out there.
*  Like we, we now that, that sort of recalibrated us. We were like, okay,
*  we're, we're rubbing up against things that are bigger than we thought were ever possible.
*  And so we were like, okay, now we need to, we need to concentrate on this.
*  So how dangerous is that creature to you, to, to humans?
*  To humans, not at all. I mean, Mike, um, one, our, our cook's, uh, father-in-law was,
*  was eaten by an anaconda, but like, you know, then again, like the way you say that story,
*  sometimes it happens. It happens. I mean, come on. Every now and then somebody gets stung by a bee
*  and dies. Like, you know, it's it once in a while it happens, but you gotta have a really big
*  anaconda, really hungry and like anybody that works in the wild. I mean, just, you know, if you,
*  you walk up to a crocodile, even a giant Nile crocodile, you walk up to the most of the time,
*  they're going to run into the water. They don't want confrontation. They hunt in their way on
*  their terms, sneaky. You're not going to see him. And so with an anaconda, it's like, yeah, if you're,
*  I mean, the guy who got eaten, like if you're drunk and you go to the edge of the water and
*  you go for midnight swim by yourself in an Amazonian lake, I mean, whose fault is that?
*  But if you jump on an anaconda and try to, uh, hold on, then you're safe.
*  Apparently. I mean, I think I've, I think at this point we've, you know, the research we've done,
*  I think I've, I've handled or caught, you know, over 80 anacondas in the field and, um, not one of
*  them has bitten me. They always choose flight over fight. They're like, just let, leave me alone.
*  Let me go. I'm just going to crawl under this thing. Um, they're not an aggressive animal.
*  I mean, no snake, no. So I actually like, I kind of like the only time I get particular with like,
*  you know, the words is like people go, that's an aggressive black mambas are aggressive. And I go,
*  no snake is aggressive. The rattlesnake is going to rattle to say, Hey, back up.
*  Cobra is going to stand up and show you its hood. And people go, Oh, look, he's being aggressive.
*  No, he's not being aggressive. He's going, don't step on me. Don't make me do this.
*  They're actually being very peaceful. That's the way I look at it. Cause if there was a Cobra in
*  the corner of this room right now, he would crawl under the curtain and we'd never see him again.
*  Yeah. It's like a Genghis Khan before conquering the villages. He always offered
*  for them to join the army. It doesn't need to be like this. Yeah. Join us. Nobody gets destroyed.
*  If you want to be proud and fight for your country, then, uh, then we're going to do
*  a live jam. Exactly. Okay. So how do you, how do you catch, uh, actually let's step back because
*  there is in part, you are a bit of a snake whisperer. So what, what is it that,
*  that others don't understand that you do about snakes? What's maybe a misconception or what,
*  what is, uh, what have you learned from the language you speak that snakes understand?
*  I don't know. It's just, it's an animal that has, has many times in my life,
*  I've been responsible for helping. Um, the, you know, I started catching snakes when I was very
*  young. I'd watched Dver when he go out and catch a garter snake or a black rat snake in New York. And,
*  um, and then I had a rule. I said, I have to catch a hundred nonvenomous snakes before I'm
*  allowed to handle a venomous snake. If I ever need to handle a venomous snake. And then,
*  you know, I was on a trail one time, I think in Harriman state park and some guy, you know,
*  like some big hero, he tells us, you know, he's like, back up, I'm going to get this. And he like
*  picks up a stick and he like goes to like assault this poor copperhead that's sitting on the trail.
*  And so like at like 16 years old, I had to go and like shoulder this guy out of the way. And I like
*  got the thing by the tail and used a stick to very gently just put it off the trail. Copperhead was
*  not going to do anything to him, but he wanted to, you know, beat his chest and show his wife that
*  he was tough. Um, but then in India, you know, I've lived in India for five years at this point in and
*  out, you know, periodically and, and snakes are always getting into people's kitchens. Um, one time
*  we had a King Cobra get into someone's kitchen, an 11 foot snake, like a monster, like a God of a
*  snake. This thing stood up, you know, it would stand up. It'd be able to look at you over the table
*  and this terrifying monster thing. Um, it's a giant gorilla dog thing. Like we caught it with one of
*  the local snake catchers and we brought it out and he goes, you know, I wonder why it was in the
*  kitchen. Yeah. Looking for food and they go, no, they eat snakes, King Cobra, Ophiophagus hana.
*  They eat snakes. And he goes, she's thirsty. And so we got a bottle of water and we got footage of
*  this and we, she's standing up. She's going, don't make me kill you. Don't make me kill you. You're
*  scaring me right now. I don't want to kill you. We took the bottle of water and we poured it on her
*  nose and she started, she started drinking. You could see, you could see her just drinking and
*  the snake just took this long drink. She drank a whole water bottle and then said, thank you so much
*  and crawled off. And it's like, to me, the fact that people are scared of snakes, they have symbolic
*  hatred of snakes, you know, you, you know, someone's evil and sneaky. We call them a snake.
*  And like, to me, it's like, when I take volunteers or researchers or students out into the jungle and
*  we find an Emerald tree boa or an Amazon tree boa or, or a vine snake. And it's like, there's this,
*  it's one of the few animals that you can't really catch a bird and show it to people. You're going
*  to scare the bird. It's feathers are going to come out. You might give it a heart attack.
*  Snakes, you can lift up a snake. You know, if there's a snake in the room right now, I could
*  lift it up and say, look, this is how you hold it. And we can interact calmly with this thing and
*  then put it back on its branch and then it'll go. And I've seen what that does to people. I've seen
*  how the wonder in their eyes. And so to me, snakes have always been this incredible link
*  to teach people about wildlife, about nature, because they have naturally a lot of fear towards
*  this creature and to realize that the fear is not justified, is not grounded or is not as deeply
*  grounded in reality. Of course, there's always New Yorker snakes, right? There's always going to be
*  an asshole snake here and there. Coming for me, man.
*  Well, okay. So back to the anaconda. How do you catch an anaconda? Like what, how do you handle,
*  because it's such a 25 foot or even 12 foot giant snakes. How do you deal with this creature? How
*  do you interact with it? We had to learn how to do that because one of the first ones we caught
*  that I would say maybe like a 16 footer, which is no joke of a snake, you know, girth of a basketball,
*  let's say. You know, we're on the canoe and this is the early days. Like, you know, now we're
*  at a whole different level, but this is back when we were barefoot and shirtless and
*  just guys in the Amazon. And JJ is like, you know, I just listened to him. He'd be like,
*  get off the boat. You come from the top. We're going to come from the bottom. So, okay.
*  I just did as I was told. I came in, the snake is all curled up, dead asleep. She's got some
*  butterflies on her eyes trying to get salt and stuff. And all of a sudden I see the tongue,
*  I'm like, she's awake. And I'm like, guys, guys, guys. And they're paying attention to not crashing
*  the boat to getting over there. And we're all trying to run. Snake starts going into the water.
*  So I run ahead, grab this snake, get her by the head. So you got her by the head. You think, okay,
*  she can't get me. I got her right behind the head. And it's about this thick, the neck.
*  What's that feel like, Cy to interrupt, like grabbing this thing with this giant head.
*  It's exciting. It's amazing. It's scary. How hard is it to hold?
*  It's not that hard to hold. The scary part is the moment of it's like, if you ever done like a cliff
*  dive or something, it's that moment where you go, do it, do it, the time, like do it. And if your
*  body's going, do not do that. And then you're like, I gotta do it. And you do it. Because you can't
*  just gently like flirt with it. You have to grab it. And it's like, it's like crossing the street
*  when there's a bus coming. It's like, if you hesitate, it's more dangerous. So like you just,
*  you go for it. And I got her and I was like, I got her. And then a coil goes over my wrists.
*  And all of a sudden my wrists slapped together and you feel this squeeze that can crush the bones
*  out of an animal bigger than me. And the next coil comes very quickly over my neck. And now I'm on
*  my knees with my arms tied. If I wanted to let go of the snake, I couldn't. And my shoulders are
*  coming together and my collarbone is about to break. And I tried to yell for JJ and all that
*  came out was there was nothing. And so that's what they do to their prey. So I attacked as far
*  as the snake knows, I attacked. She doesn't know that I just want to measure her. You started
*  as the big spoon, but then the snake became the big spoon. The snake very much became the big spoon.
*  And I would say I was 15 seconds away from having my entire rib cage collapsed. And then JJ showed
*  up and grabbed the tail and just started unwrapping this thing. And then we got, but now we have a
*  system. Now we know like, you know, I'm always, I've done, I've gotten more head catches than
*  anybody. So I'm usually point guy and you get, you're the, you're the, the first, the, the point guy.
*  I'm the point guy. The, the, the, the taking the big risky. Yes. First step. Yes. Although it could
*  be argued that there's a similarly large risk for the tail guy because the anaconda's defense is to
*  take a giant projectile shit. And so the person that gets the tail is going to smell like anaconda
*  for like at least a week. Yes. It's the least pleasant. You're taking the most dangerous one
*  there. They have the least pleasant job. This is fascinating. But what's really fascinating though
*  is that because they're the apex predator, they're, they're eating the fish, they're eating the birds,
*  they're eating everything. And everything in this riparian ecosystem is absorbing the mercury that's
*  coming off the gold mining in the region. And so anacondas can be indicative for us of how is
*  mercury moving through this ecosystem. And this is a region where we've lost hundreds of thousands
*  of acres to artisanal gold mining, where they use mercury to bind the gold. They cut the forest,
*  burn the forest, and then they run water through the sand and the sand particles have bits of gold
*  in it, not chunks, but just little almost microscopic flecks of gold. And then they use
*  the mercury to bind that. And then they burn off the mercury and that vapor goes up into the clouds,
*  just like everything else. It's all connected down there and then rains down into the rivers.
*  And so the people in the region are having birth defects from the amount of mercury
*  that's in the water. And so we were starting at one point when we were doing most of our
*  anaconda research, we were learning things like these animals actually aren't just ambush predators,
*  which is what most of the literature would tell you is that anacondas are ambush predators. No,
*  they actually go hunting. They'll go find clay licks and salt deposits and they'll wait there.
*  They'll actually pursue animals. And we were trying to take tissue samples to find out if
*  anacondas could be used to study how mercury is moving through the ecosystem. And so that was
*  really, it became, can we use these animals not only as ambassadors for wildlife because everybody
*  wants to see the anacondas, but also what can we learn from studying this very, very little
*  understood apex predator? And one of the things you can learn is how mercury moves through the
*  ecosystem, which can damage the ecosystem in all kinds of different ways.
*  Yeah, it's brutal, man. The gold mining that's happening down there is, it's funny because we've
*  been hearing a lot recently about the cobalt mines in Africa. And it's like where we are in the Amazon,
*  we were down there with ABC News, I want to say like a year and a half ago with my friend,
*  Matt Gutman, who's the chief correspondent for ABC. And he wanted to see the Amazon fires. He
*  wanted to see some wildlife. He wanted to see the areas that we're protecting. And then he goes,
*  I want to see the gold mining areas. And I'd never gotten in so deep, but we met these Russian,
*  you can't go to the Peruvian, they will kill you. Like our lawyer's father was assassinated for
*  standing up to the gold miners. There was two Russian guys though, who had a legal mining
*  concession somehow way out past the machine gun guarded limit of the Pompas, which is where they
*  do all this gold mining. And we got in there and took footage of the desert that is forming
*  in what used to be the headwaters of the Amazon rainforest. And it's like, there is a massive
*  global scale ecological crime happening down there that you can see from space, from this
*  unregulated gold mining and the cops can't go there because they will be murdered. It's completely
*  lawless. What's the machine gun limit exactly? It's the border of this area that they call
*  the Pompas, which is where the rainforest has been cut and completely destroyed. And it looks
*  like Mars, it's just sand. And inside of this area are gold miners. And we tried to get in there to
*  film years ago and there's just a lot of guys with machine guns who don't let that happen.
*  And what the Russian guys have access to? The Russian guys had access somehow. They'd come
*  down with a bit of money and they had a new system. Yeah. And actually what was interesting is while
*  I was in there, they're very friendly and really, really two friendly gold miners.
*  One of them while I was there, he kind of tapped me on the shoulder. He was like,
*  look at those guys. He was like, those guys over there? He goes, I just heard them say your name.
*  And he goes, that's not a good thing. He goes, they know exactly who you are.
*  He goes, I wouldn't keep posting to Instagram about gold mining in the Amazon. And I was like,
*  thanks for the warning. And then in June, somebody pulled up beside me on a motorcycle and I got a
*  more stern warning. But they pay attention to the flow of information because they don't want the
*  world to find out. Oh, the last thing they want is to be shut down. But the gold miners are notorious
*  for just whacking people and throwing them in a pile of gold mining leftovers. It's really like
*  the Peruvian government has to get the military to go after them. The work we've done with gold
*  miners, converting them into conservationists has all been like, I mean, I've seen the Peruvian
*  Navy come down and literally blow up gold mining barges. And it's a war. It's a war being fought
*  in the Amazon. So it's possible to convert them into conservationists? What's that process like?
*  You say that in jest. No, I say that in absolute sincerity. We went up river,
*  up the Malinowski River several years ago, and I think it was 2018. And everyone was like,
*  you are going to die. You will be shot and killed. And the reason we were able to do it with relative
*  safety was that the gold miner that we were going with was the brother-in-law of one of my closest
*  friends down there, our expedition chef and one of the directors of Jungle Keepers. And they said,
*  look, you can go, just keep a low profile. And so I went up with a photographer and we spent a week
*  there and dead animals everywhere, deforestation everywhere. I mean, the things that we saw were
*  so horrible. And we're living with these gold miners that are, they're getting their gold,
*  they're burning off the mercury. I watched a guy smoking a cigarette, burning the mercury off of
*  his gold with the vapor going straight into his face with his child right there. I mean, unbelievable
*  negligence of just sanity. And then towards the end of the week, the Peruvian Navy comes down the
*  river and everyone starts scrambling. And I was like, I'm just going to sit here with my hands up
*  and they didn't even stop. They found the gold mining barge. They have a floating thing in the
*  river that just plumbs the bottom of the river, just sucks all the sediment up. And they stopped
*  and they strapped a bunch of explosives to this motor and good Lord, the sound of this explosion.
*  And there was just hot metal raining down all over the place. And then they just went, a bunch
*  of guys in fatigues and they just kind of like looked at us like, peace. And I sat there with
*  this gold miner and I went, now what? And he went, well, now I gotta go get a new motor. And I went,
*  why don't you just do something else? And he goes, what else is there? And I went, look what we do.
*  And I sat there with my phone and I was like, see this, these are pretty tourists and we feed them
*  food and we show them tarantulas and macaws and things. And he looked at this and he went, wow.
*  He goes, that looks like so much fun. And I went, it is so much fun. And so we show people,
*  we bring students to the jungle. He goes, so you're saying if I build you a lodge,
*  you'll bring people? I said, yeah. And I came back a year later and he sat there with a chainsaw,
*  a hand saw and some nails and he cut down like 17 palm trees and he built an ecotourism lodge.
*  So you gave them another channel of survival, of making money.
*  And that's what we've been doing through Jungle Keepers for loggers and for all kinds of extractors
*  is just saying, look, what do you make? You make $15 a day destroying the ancient trees of the jungle.
*  What if we paid you $35 a day to have a uniform and a job and health insurance and security and
*  you just protect it and use all of the jungle knowledge you've gained as a logger to protect
*  this place. Who are the loggers trying to destroy the Amazon? Can you say a little bit more about it?
*  Is that as a threat to the Amazon rainforest? A lot of them are really close friends of mine.
*  They're people that need to make a living and they're jungle people who, you know,
*  the rainforest is a very challenging, especially the Amazon is a very challenging environment.
*  So you have these people who they have a chainsaw, they have a job opportunity,
*  they go out and they cut the trees. And a lot of these guys grew up fishing,
*  they grew up in the jungle, they know how to do it. And so for them, it's a way to like,
*  they also love it. So this is the thing, these are outdoorsmen, these are guys that love the jungle.
*  And so they, you know, in the nineties, we had the mahogany boom where they went out after the
*  mahogany and you can almost can't find a mahogany tree in the jungle anymore. And if you want to
*  talk about like carbon sequestration in the rainforest, the ancient hardwoods hold like 60%
*  of the carbon of the whole rainforest. They have an outsized disproportionate mass from
*  the ancient density of the wood. And so these loggers go out and they cut the wood that's most
*  valuable and then they bring it back to town and they sell it. And then people like us buy it and
*  put it on our kitchen floors. And, you know, and so the thing is, is I, you know, when I got to the
*  Amazon, it was, you know, loggers are the bad guys. And if you talk to, you know, a lot of like the
*  PhDs that I worked with down there were, you know, always very at odds with the miners, at odds with
*  the loggers. And then I'd be with JJ and JJ would sit down and he'd be like, Hey, let's pour a drink.
*  Oh, they have Masato. Let's all sit down. And like, we'd all be chilling and throwing them back
*  with a bunch of loggers. And then the opportunity through not vilifying these people came to be
*  like, Oh, these are, these guys are great. You know? And then of course out in the wild,
*  every now and then something will happen. You'll see somebody's boat flipped over and you go help
*  them out. And then that creates a certain type of kinship. So they're ultimately people who love
*  the same thing you love. Often, yeah. Even if they don't love it, they're people that
*  aren't necessarily looking to destroy it. I've met loggers who have looked at,
*  at trees they're about to cut and gone, ah, this is a shame. Started up, you know, they're just
*  like, this is where the paycheck comes from. Let's come back briefly to Anacondas.
*  Can you tell me this whole situation with discoveries eaten alive? There's some drama
*  and controversy around that. Can you explain that whole saga with discovery with,
*  um, with your whole effort, maybe outside of even the drama, the, the initial thing,
*  which I now feel you're sufficiently insane to actually do a being eaten by anaconda. Is
*  that actually possible to survive something like that? I mean, if it, the Anaconda swallows you
*  while you're wearing the suit that they made, maybe, but that was in hindsight with it. That
*  was the result of, look, I go to the jungle and you start seeing these beautiful places,
*  these incredible species. You start developing a relationship with these animals and then you
*  watch it get destroyed. Every year we watch it burn every year, places that are, are crucial to
*  my soul. I have seen leveled and turned to ash. And at some point we started going,
*  someone has to do something about this. And you look to your right and you look to your left and
*  there is no one because it's the middle of the Amazon and the rainforests have been being
*  destroyed since the seventies. It's a cliche. And so we started trying to do something about it. And
*  so I started putting a little bit more emphasis on publicity, a little bit more emphasis on getting
*  the message out there. And so I started trying to see how, what was going to work. You start firing
*  shots in the dark and seeing, and JJ is going, you have to help us do something. And I'm going,
*  okay. And so from 18 years old now, now I'm 23 years old and all of a sudden this place isn't
*  foreign to me anymore. It's home. And so- You're trying to think of all the different ways you can
*  bring attention to this place that you care about this being destroyed.
*  Yeah. You're standing next to a boulder of progress, of destruction, and it's about to roll
*  onto the forest and just destroy it and snuff out all that life. And no one's there to do anything
*  about it. And so you go, is there any way that I could put myself in front of this boulder
*  and hold it back? And you're talking about the global economic reality. It's just such a massive,
*  it's systemic. So what's the most dramatic possible thing I could do?
*  Exactly. So when you find yourself flown to LA as a 23 year old dude, and you're sitting there with
*  some guy who's like spinning a pen and got his feet up on the desk and going, what can you show
*  us down there? And you go, I could show you the biggest anacondas in the world. And we could talk
*  about mercury and bioaccumulation and we could show people how these animals are misunderstood.
*  And we go on a big expedition and we could be the coolest show ever. And he goes, yeah,
*  not good enough. And so that cycled through a bunch of times. And then someone at some point,
*  in one of those meetings said, what if we show people that anacondas really can eat humans?
*  And I went, how is that a good show? You want me to feed someone to an anaconda? And I kind of joked,
*  I said, the only way that's feasible is if you make a suit with a breathing apparatus and let
*  the snake eat you and then come back out safely and make sure you don't hurt the snake. And they
*  were like, kid, you're on. And I was like, oh shit.
*  So I should mention as a small tangent, I think I mentioned to you offline due to travel troubles
*  where I traveled to the totally wrong part of the United States on my way to Boston.
*  And on my way to Boston, I did a conversation with Mr. Beast, Jimmy, and I've gotten a chance
*  to hang out with him for the day. And one of the things we did is have a lengthy brainstorm
*  session with his team or I was observing it. But it was interesting because he's probably way better
*  at that conversation that you had with the guy in LA than the guy in LA, obviously, because he's
*  made, he's revolutionizing entertainment and he's also doing philanthropy, which he's trying to
*  figure out how to help the world with that kind of stuff. So I would love to actually,
*  I'll send him a message to see what his thoughts, just brainstorm. He's so strong at this.
*  Literally take the situation you're facing. Here's the place that I really care about is being
*  burned down. It's being destroyed. What's the sexy video?
*  Yeah. Well, how do you get people to watch something that's, you know, we all change a
*  channel when they show us the kids in Africa with the swollen stomachs. Nobody wants to see it. And
*  it's like with the rainforest, like we know, we know, we know. And I'm going,
*  I could give data all day long. I could show photos of burning forest. And so I was looking
*  for what would do it. And so the eating alive thing without spending too much time on a massive
*  misstep was I agreed to do it. They paid me at the time more money than I had made before,
*  which I very much needed because nobody pays you to be a conservationist. So I was a very poor
*  23 year old that was like, yes, I would love that please. And I thought, you know what,
*  this is the start of a TV career. We got shafted so bad. I mean, they used,
*  somehow they changed our voices. They changed the things we said. They changed the message of the
*  film. There was one point where we had caught a 19 foot snake and I was holding her head. And I
*  said, this is such a beautiful animal, the queen of the Amazon. This is such a great moment for me.
*  I kissed her on the head. I said, she's made so many babies. Look at the scars. I was talking
*  about just the poetry of this incredible dragon. And then the producer goes, yeah, yeah, yeah,
*  that's great. Listen, if that was to bite you, what would happen? And I was like, oh, well,
*  if it bit you, you'd bleed out because it would lacerate down to the, that's what they put in the
*  film. And so they didn't show me the film until the night before I went on Matt Lauer's show.
*  And I said, I am not endorsing this film. And they had called it expedition on the call sheet.
*  They'd called it expedition EA expedition Amazon. All of a sudden they changed it to eaten alive.
*  And I went, wait, guys, wait, wait, wait. I said, you're going to make people think that it actually
*  happened, not that we're attempting it. And they, and I said, I'm not. And then they called me and
*  they said, you better, you're going on live TV tomorrow. They said, you let us know what level
*  of control we need to show for you. Right. It was very threatening phone call. And so I had to go
*  out and smile for the cameras and endorse something that was a train wreck. And the scientific
*  community was like, you're an idiot. We don't want to ever see you again. I lost a lot of
*  opportunities. PETA came, which, you know, PETA, whatever, but PETA came out. People were like,
*  you, you, you were trying to hurt a snake, which I would never do. And then the American public was
*  like, you know, you said you were going to get eaten by a snake and you didn't. And so everyone
*  was pissed. I basically had to exile myself to India for like six months and just, I mean,
*  I had death threats coming through all my messages. People were furious with me.
*  What gave you strength to that? How difficult was that psychologically? Just everything you care
*  about being completely kind of flipped upside down. I've spent so much time on the ground with
*  the local people learning from the wildlife. It's such a devout and important thing to me.
*  And it got turned into a sideshow. It got turned into a joke. And then not just a joke,
*  it got turned into that I'm somehow bad to animals. You know, I'm, I'm irresponsible
*  scientifically. Jimmy Kimmel told me to have sex with a hippo as my next stunt. Like it was like,
*  it got really ugly and it misfired so bad. And when you hear these like motivational speakers
*  talk about, you know, you just got to keep trying and sometimes you're going to fail hard. It was
*  like that one. I got hit in the head with a baseball bat. That one wasn't tough.
*  And at the time I was like, I'm fine. And I was like, I'm going to go away for a while,
*  you know? And I learned a lot though. Like at this point, I'm still glad I did it because man,
*  did I learn a lot about what a room full of people that you don't know who could look you
*  in the eye and shake your hand and say, trust us. Ooh boy. Do you have on a human level of resentment
*  towards discovery, towards the people involved, be able to forgive them?
*  I don't care. It literally, that's what they do. You know, they literally put out a documentary
*  saying that mermaids were real. You know, it's my-
*  Wait a minute, wait a minute. They're not? Listen. I said that I'm not even touching that one.
*  It is true. It is true.
*  The document, there is a-
*  There is a documentary where they duped a bunch of scientists who are like oceanographers and they
*  showed them ancient footage of mariners saying that seals were mermaids. Who cares? I was young,
*  I got brought to Hollywood and I got spit out the other side and that's on me. That's not their
*  fault. There's that parable about the frog who gives the scorpion a ride across the water.
*  And then at the end he says, I'll give you a ride, just don't sting me. And they get to the other
*  side and the scorpion stings him and the frog goes, why did you do that? And the scorpion goes,
*  I'm a scorpion. It's not their fault.
*  That's my nature. But now that you've become much more well-known and much more successful,
*  what you do, you have a platform. Can you return to those people and use the machine to get more
*  and more attention? Is that something you work on or do you prefer to work completely outside?
*  I think that most of the success that we've had now in protecting the rainforest
*  and the levels that we've reached are so far. I think back to those barefoot days of catching
*  snakes with JJ in the boat and now the massive ecological reserve we have and the team of rangers
*  and the converted loggers and all of that is because of the ability to communicate and to
*  show people. But that's all been through social media. And so I'm open to the fact, if somebody
*  came and gave a sort of like Bordenian pass where they said, look, you can be yourself, you can
*  swear, you can fart, you can smoke, you can do whatever you want to do. Go out there and show us
*  the real thing. I would love to. But now I know how those contracts need to be. I need to have
*  right to refusal and they can't change them. And so I'd almost rather just do it like the way I
*  think like Mr. Beast does stuff where it's like you get a crew of guys and some seed money and go
*  film the episodes and put it out. A committee never helped real art be better. It has to come
*  from the source of inspiration. So I think you get JJ and a crew of people or the guys in Africa
*  that I'm working with right now doing elephant conservation and like, but you got to show real.
*  I mean, look, that's why Joe Rogan is important right now. That's why you're important right now
*  is because it's not being filtered through this ridiculous system of polishing it and dumbing it
*  down. Yeah, that's why Joe has been an inspiration. You don't need a crew of a bunch of people. You
*  don't need a crew period. All you need is one or two other people and that's it. And in my case,
*  you don't need anybody. I've been doing this by requirement. I just need to be by myself.
*  There's a few other folks now that are helpful to editing and so on, but it's just, they make life
*  more awesome as opposed to a boss that's a creative director. Somebody told me actually,
*  I was visiting LA. I think it was in LA that they were saying that now for all intimate scenes in
*  Hollywood movies, there's an intimacy director. So when there's two people having sex, there's a
*  third person that ensures that on film, so it's not real, but there's still intimacy. There's a
*  third person that ensures that like everyone is comfortable and the actors say that this like
*  always ruins the chemistry of the scene. And so it's a very Hollywood thing. I understand
*  there's creepy people and so on. Yeah, I understand. Thanks, Harvey Weinstein.
*  It's usually, I think, comes from the director pushing things too hard. If you just leave it to
*  the actors, they know their boundaries. They can control their own boundaries. So the intimacy
*  director is more for like the director pushing things. You know, there's Warner Herzog. I
*  understand the logic. Let's make sure that we don't have anything happen here that shouldn't be
*  happening. I get it, but yeah. But no, I think that authenticity is the greatest currency.
*  And I think that in order for me to tell the stories that I can tell, like what changed the
*  game for me was, I want to tell you this story. Sure. So in 2019, the Amazon fire started popping
*  off and we had just gone to film like a month earlier, we'd filmed like a small documentary
*  and they'd been following me as if I was on a solo, which we did the best we could. I lived on
*  my own. But as we were driving, we passed a spot where the flames were 70 feet tall. The forest was
*  being destroyed. And I went out there with my phone, which overheated in like two minutes and
*  said, you can't use it. But for a second I was out there in the flames, picking up animals and
*  throwing them off to try and just get them cooled off. I was trying to get snakes out of there.
*  Everything was the birds are flying and I lost it. I was red-eyed. I was crying and I was going,
*  this is happening every day. I was screaming. And it's the first time
*  that I'd done that because I've seen the burning so many times and I just lost it that day. And I
*  don't know what made me pull out my phone because usually in those intense moments, I say, forget
*  the documentation. This is real life. We got stuff to do and I'm doing, I'm not documenting.
*  And then a month later I'm home and I'm in New York and all of a sudden I see these articles,
*  the Amazon's burning worse this year than it was last year and blah, blah, blah. And I was like,
*  and I threw it up on Instagram like eight o'clock at night.
*  And I'd never cursed on Instagram. I don't know why. I just never did. And my phone was on 100%
*  and I put it on top of the refrigerator and I went to bed. I woke up in the morning and my phone was
*  on the floor on 2% and it was ringing off the hook and it was like the news. And they're like,
*  are you the guy that posted that viral video about the Amazon? And I was like, what?
*  And that was the start. That's where it broke. And that's where we went from barefoot in the Amazon
*  to all of a sudden, I was a talking head for three weeks and going around on all these news
*  stations and all of a sudden I was like the spokesperson for the Amazon and JJ's calling
*  me and he was like, go, go, go, go, go, like get us, get us that support. And it was just,
*  so communicating with people and bringing them into that reality and whether it's,
*  rhino poaching and elephant poaching or the Amazon being destroyed, it's like to me,
*  it's like being able to take people into that is something that I would love to do.
*  RG Yeah. And you do it directly with authenticity on your Instagram. People should definitely
*  follow your Instagram. I think Rogan follows your Instagram too.
*  JJ Well, the end of that story actually kind of involves him because yeah, because I went to all
*  these news outlets and I was living in green rooms and traveling around and I was all strung out and
*  I hadn't seen anybody I actually know in a few weeks, which was starting to get to me.
*  And I finally got home and I went to like a family party and everyone's like, dude, you've been,
*  it's been crazy. And I was like, yup. And then I left and my cousin Michael calls me and he's
*  screaming and I'm going, what, what, what, what, what? And he goes, Joe Rogan just shared it. Joe
*  Rogan, you shared it. And everyone was losing their shit. And it was so amazing. And it was like,
*  that's when it really took off. And what happened as a result of all of this
*  is that a Canadian entrepreneur who started Lightspeed reached out and several months later,
*  after COVID, after that boom, you know, I'd been in the game for maybe 13 years or something.
*  Had no money, no savings, no job, no nothing. And after that great publicity thing,
*  nothing happened. The waves came and everything got real exciting. Everybody reached out and they
*  said, we care so much. Nothing happened though. You know, we can run into battle, but if we don't
*  have our arrows in the quiver, what can we do? And I actually, I made a phone call to my friend,
*  Mohsen right at the start of COVID and I was going through a divorce and I was broke. And I said,
*  I'm going to get a job. I said, I give up. So this is stupid. I said, the ecotourism business
*  is done. Jungle Keepers has dried up. We're done. And then this guy, Dax De Silva called me on the
*  phone and said, listen, I'm in. What do we got to do? And so if the analogy was me and JJ and a few
*  other people trying to hold this boulder back from just destroying the rainforest, all of a sudden,
*  Dax comes in like a Titan and just puts his arm out and just goes, I'm going to help. And he gave
*  us the funding to start actually developing a ranger program, to start actually bringing loggers,
*  to be protectors of the forest, to be supporting smaller conservation things. And now we're
*  protecting 50,000 acres of rainforest. We're protecting entire streams and ecosystems that
*  I love. And we're soon going to double that. And it's like this whole thing. So yeah, the
*  communication of these things is crucial. And I actually think it's incredible that
*  social media has played such a big role in it. Well, I mean, just because I know Joe well and
*  I love him so much, I definitely think you should do his podcast, but also just be friends with him.
*  I think you guys, he's one, not to meme, but he's one with nature and not much more with the,
*  I'm one, while I do appreciate and love nature, I also love
*  technology and robots and so on. So in that meme type of way, we're very different.
*  Well, either way, at some point, make sure you tell the guy thank you because it definitely
*  really helped push us over that limit where if enough people see it, you get someone like Dax
*  who says, I can help and I have the resources to help. And that changed our whole lives.
*  Everything back to the jungle. You had a bunch of interactions with Jaguars. How are you still
*  alive? Like what? Man, dude, Jags, Jags aren't the Jags. I'll tell you this. Jags are not the
*  danger. The falling trees are the danger. I'll tell you some elephant stories and then you'll,
*  then you'll wonder why I'm still alive. But Jags, I've, I've one, you know, so JJ started and
*  Santiago, his dad started challenging me to do solos, go out alone into the wild style.
*  You know, I'd have a hammock, a headlamp, three days worth of food, some fish hooks, a machete.
*  That's it. And so like one of the stories that, that happened early on was I was out there and
*  it was raining and I was lost. And this is how we test your jungle knowledge. Can you survive out
*  there? Do you know how to find food? Have you listened to the things that we taught you?
*  And there was one night that I was in a hammock and a Jaguar came up and I was asleep when it
*  happened and she came up right next to my head and she was, and I could hear her smelling me.
*  And then my first instinct was to, to, to turn on my headlamp and just the sound of my arm
*  moving against the, the, the material. And she just, like, she just right here, I could feel her
*  breath. And I just laid there in the dark. And that's one of those moments where you go,
*  you really learn a lot about yourself because I wasn't scared. I felt like I understood the
*  intentions of the cat. If she was hunting, I'd already be dead. She was curious and I was lost
*  and I didn't know if I was ever going to get out of that jungle. But what she did was
*  energize me because it was an experience like the giant Anaconda, where I said, this is so wild.
*  That it's, that it's so almost cinematically outside the realm of what I thought my life
*  could be like, that it made me like, wait, because the previous day I was lost, tired, confused,
*  kind of devastated tail between my legs. After that, I was like, man, you've been waiting for
*  this your whole life. Go get it. And I like woke up and I was like, I am going to navigate, even
*  though I've been in this swamp for three days, I'm going to find my way out of this swamp. And like,
*  she just like breathed fire into me where it was like, it was like, if that's possible,
*  if I could be six inches away from a Jaguars face, then I got, I got that energy from her.
*  So that you're able to start to really hear and feel the jungle around you. Yeah. That was a,
*  that was a sign. Do you know what you're doing? It really felt like a sign. I really did. How
*  do you survive in a solo, solo hike through the jungle? What, what, what are the different
*  components with the different dangers? He says you had a hammock, you had some food.
*  What kind of food, by the way, are we talking about? Nuts, stuff that won't go bad. Cause you
*  can't, so you can't really start a fire in the Amazon. Like I'm a good fire. I mean, I camp all
*  over the place. I'm a wilderness guide. Starting a fire in the Amazon is futile. In fact, a lot of
*  survival manuals will tell you don't do it. Cause if you're really lost, it'll break your spirit.
*  You're not going to be able to do it. That's dark. Yeah. They're like, don't even try it.
*  But you can still get like hypothermia from if you get wet and you lay out in the jungle, you
*  could, you know, you could still exposure can still get you. So you want fire. I even in the
*  beginning, I used to bring like ramen noodles, which is, which is the nutritionally is irrelevant.
*  And so I started bringing like nuts and then supplementing that with fish, which forced me
*  to become a very good fisherman. And now of course, JJ knows that he can like, they can cut certain
*  routes and they bash it up and they put it in the stream and the fish just float to the top and they
*  take with it. So like, he's got like, he's got all the cheat codes. Whereas like I'm sitting there
*  with a hook and then he's like, he'll go now find bait. And I go bait in the most competitive
*  ecosystem on earth. Good luck finding a worm. You can't do it. What does JJ do? He takes the
*  machete, looks at his foot, cuts a slug of callus off of his heel. Cause he's got this thick rhino
*  skin. Puts that on the hook, catches a six inch fish, chops it in half, puts it on a bigger hook.
*  And in 15 minutes, he's got a four foot giant catfish that could feed a family of 16.
*  And he's happy. I'm sitting there and I'm like, I'm going to try and like stick a beetle on a,
*  on a fishing hook and like, you know, do you have just a line and a hook or is there a rod to just
*  a line and a hook. And then you, you, you just chop a, you just chop a rod and tie it to the,
*  you know, you just chop a little sapling. So are you still able to start a fire or no?
*  I like for the food that I bring to not be fire dependent. Sure. And so if I have some nuts,
*  I can, I can shove in a few enough calories to get me through the night or like, and leave a
*  fishing line out and there'll be something there in the morning. But yes, I can start a fire,
*  but a lot of times what I'll do is I'll bring a flask and not with like alcohol, but with diesel.
*  And so you have a tuna can and you put the diesel and this is what the local guys do.
*  Everything I do, you know, I'm sure there's going to be someone listening to this and they're like,
*  how could you do that? And it's like, this is what we do down there. Sorry. It's a, it's a tuna can.
*  You pour a little bit of diesel in it. It burns slow. You light it and you put your sticks,
*  you make your pyramid over that and eventually that will burn through the moisture. And finally,
*  you'll get a very reluctant little fire enough to burn, you know, to make yourself like a cup of tea
*  or to pour that into the noodles, something, something, or you just eat a fish raw.
*  How important is it to stay dry? Is it basically impossible? It's impossible to stay dry. You're
*  wet all the time. You're wet all the time. What does that mean? That means infections are more
*  efficient. Yeah. So yeah, I don't know if you saw the picture in my book where I have the
*  yellow spots. Yeah. So yeah, there's a picture with your like entire face consumed with yellow
*  spots is basically, I guess that's MRSA. Yep. Oh boy. Yeah. So how did that happen? What,
*  what was the infection like? And yeah. And how crazy are you for letting that infection
*  stay in you for a prolonged period of time without treating it? Or you had no choice.
*  No, I did have a choice. I was 19 years old and I was taking care of a giant anteater
*  that was orphaned and this is like my dream animal. Yeah. And she was mine and my job was to teach
*  her the jungle. And so when I started like noticing that I had an infection and that I was, I had,
*  I think I had dengue at the time too, I went back to town, probably picked up MRSA in the hospital
*  where I got tested, came back into the jungle and then got progressively sicker and sicker.
*  Weaker and weaker as I was two weeks, three weeks in the jungle. And then it got to the point where
*  my vision went black and white and I passed out one day and, and I don't know why, but at the time
*  I had shaved that day. And when I woke up the next morning, I couldn't open my eyes because the,
*  the pus had come out of my eyes and out of my, the pores in my face, all those little micro cuts and
*  the pillow was stuck to my face. And I was stuck up river with no help at 19 years old. And also
*  when you, when you see that picture, you can imagine that I assumed that my life was over
*  because I didn't know what it was. And I also didn't assume that, or at the very least,
*  I figured I'd be disfigured the rest of my life. I didn't think there was any getting better from
*  that. And so I remember sitting by the side of the river praying that a boat would come by,
*  but it was the rainy season and there aren't going to be any boats because the river is psychotic.
*  And so it was a long time before I got back to town and I didn't want to leave the anteater,
*  but it became like, I was like, I realized I was dying. And then I finally got a boat
*  with some loggers, a death boat just loaded with these guys were, had, had gone into the jungle
*  and shot everything they could and taken all the babies and they were going to go sell them. And
*  so it was like baby monkeys and toucans and birds and cages and pieces of crocodiles and anaconda
*  skins and jaguar skins rolled up. And it was just like, I was just laying there with all these dead
*  animals in the boat with all the flies on my face and got back to the hotel, called my mother,
*  said, please book me a flight out like today, like today. And then I sat on the plane and
*  somebody, somebody sat next to me on the plane and I had a hood on and I do, I do remember that in
*  my, in the haze at this point, I was having trouble staying conscious, but I do remember that she like
*  looked over, like trying to see what was sitting next to her and then she got up and never came
*  back. And when I got to, to, to immigration in New York, you know, the cop, what he like takes my
*  passport and he goes, yeah. He goes, so what are you doing in Peru? He's looking down and he goes,
*  yeah. And he like holds up the passport, looks at the passport, looks at my face and goes,
*  Oh buddy. And I said, no, that's what he, I was like, I'm trying to get home to go to the hospital.
*  He goes, he stamps it. He goes, go, go, go, go. God bless. God bless. He's like, oh shit.
*  And then they put me in the room in the hospital with like the hazmat suits and they didn't know
*  what it was. And I spent like five days on IV antibiotics with like four different things
*  running through my veins. And the doctors were like, don't let it go that close. They're like,
*  you went real close on that one. Yeah. That's what that picture, I mean, people should check out the
*  book just to see the picture because I imagine you just laying there, unable to see, have a fever
*  probably. So you're like half hallucinating and there's no, there's no boat. There's no,
*  no way out. There's no help coming. Plus there's this creature who you've become a parent of.
*  Yeah. That you love. Yeah. Boy, that's a dark place to be as a 19 year old. I mean,
*  most people have never, will never be in a place like that. Like where did you find strength
*  in that, in those, in that place? I don't know. I just remember writing like a goodbye letter
*  to my parents because I said, if I die out here, it was really dark. Like it was, it was,
*  it was terrifying. It really felt like it was the end. And I was writing, you know, if you find me
*  out here, I'm sorry. And all that, all that type of stuff. And it was, you know, I don't know about
*  strength. There was no strength. It was just like move forward. And at some point it was like,
*  if you'll take me down river, take me down river, you know, and you just got lucky with the loggers
*  with the death boat that they found you. Well, how did the infection start by the way? I don't know.
*  I really don't know. I mean, we always have some sort of little shit, but the thing is now JJ taught
*  me that there's like three different trees that can cure infections. I didn't know this at the
*  time. I didn't know the cheat codes. Now there's, there's, if you have a small infection, you can
*  use Sangre de Drago and it'll, it'll cure it right away. Like, let's say you have a botfly and it
*  gets a little pussy. There's a fly living in your skin. You put that on there. Not only will it kill
*  the fly, but it'll heal the infection. Now, if you have a worse infection, you can go to OJ,
*  which is ficus insipida and you can use that and that will completely heal. That will murder.
*  It's like crocodile blood. It will murder infections. So like, forget Neosporin. That's
*  a joke. These are heavy chemical compounds running through these trees and they know all about them.
*  And so whatever it is. So now at this point, that's no longer an issue. Like, because we know how to
*  handle it, which is at that time, if JJ had been there, I would have been fine. Well,
*  learned the hard way. So these are open wounds and then there's creatures that start living in them
*  basically. What is it? Well, that's separate. That's botflies. Yeah. There's, there's a,
*  there's a creature that unfortunately, very, very, very unfortunately, um,
*  likes to make its home inside the flesh of mammals. Yeah. And so the flies attach their eggs to
*  mosquitoes. The mosquitoes go and seek out warm blooded animals, the eggs, microscopic eggs fall
*  into your skin and then begin to grow. And sooner or later you feel a twitch and it's a worm living
*  inside of you. That's like vertical down in you and it's, it's eating you. And at first it's not
*  a problem, but when they get to about as thick as that pen, it starts to hurt because you got a hole
*  in you and they have a little breathing tube that comes up and they breathe and they go back in and
*  then they eat and they come back up to breathe and you have a, you have a friend living in you.
*  Yeah. Um, and it's had one of those. I've had lots of those. It's tough to take them out. They have
*  hooks. How do you, do you have to love the junk? So how do you take it out?
*  A hundred percent. Uh, you gotta, you gotta put an irritant. So like a lot of times what we'll do
*  down there is some, someone will take a massive drag of a cigarette and then they'll spit the,
*  they'll, they'll power like exhale and get some of the, some of the tar, which also shows you how
*  much tar you get out of a cigarette. And then with a knife and you put that right over the hole
*  and then you slap some Vaseline or something on top of that so they can't breathe.
*  And eventually over the course of a few hours, they'll come up enough looking for air and then
*  you got to grab them with a tweezer and try not to rip them. Cause then you're going to get an
*  infection and you got to squeeze from the, but it's a whole ceremony. When people have botflies,
*  we're all like, Oh, it's botfly time. Let's go. And then like JJ will squeeze. He's got like pliers
*  for thumbs. He can like take a piece of your neck and you think he's going to break your skin.
*  He'll just squeeze until this thing comes out. And you don't want to,
*  you don't want to, there's an open wound right there. And yeah, you don't want to bathe for a day
*  or two after until that closes. Cause otherwise you're going to have like water sloshing around
*  in like a little pocket of yours. This is kind of gross. And that water might have other organisms
*  that water in your skin tends to, yeah. I mean, the jungle water is clean. We drink it. Like I
*  drink the water fresh out of the stream. Oh, that's interesting. Well, it's just a
*  giant filtration system, all those roots, the whole jungle is constantly purifying everything.
*  People might be thinking about that with the jungle. There's insects probably all over you all the time.
*  It's not as bad as you think. Like I've been to, to, to Finland, Lapland in the summer and the
*  mosquitoes are horrendous, like devastating the Amazon in our area. If you're sitting in a hammock,
*  reading a book out, you know, our research stations don't have walls or anything.
*  You're good for about one, one mosquito every half hour, which really is not a lot. I mean,
*  it's worse in New Jersey. Like it's really not that bad. Tell me a little more about the little
*  baby anteater, Lulu, Lulu, they, they you've, who you've rescued and had to sadly leave behind.
*  Yeah. I just was always fascinated with giant anteaters or this, you know, German shepherd sized
*  thing with Wolverine claws and these giant Popeye forearms and they, they excavate
*  ant and termite mounds and they have this long tongue and their babies right on their back for
*  the first six months of their lives. And so they actually have this incredibly intimate relationship
*  with their young. And it just so happens that this animal that I was wildly fascinated with,
*  there was an orphan on the river and JJ was like, you love these things. And I was like,
*  yeah. And so he went and he was like, Hey, my friend, you should, he got, he got me the baby.
*  And we were like, we're going to rewild her. And so I spent like weeks and weeks and weeks, just like
*  with this thing on my back, crawling through the jungle, teaching her to find ants,
*  giving her milk, falling asleep with her on my chest. And their tongue is like 11 inches long
*  at that age. And so she, when she wanted me to wake up, she'd fired up my nose and would come out
*  my mouth and she, and then if I tried to get her off me quick, she'd stick the claws in and you
*  know, I'm all my clothes. I have like, I have old like, you know, now they're like, you know,
*  like museum pieces with rips in them from, from Lulu's claws. Just able to also communicate emotion
*  and feeling and all that. She needed it. She needed it. So if this animal didn't have the physical
*  touch, if we didn't, if I didn't hold her all day long, she'd throw tantrums, she'd go shred
*  something, she'd go pull down the curtain, she'd go ruin the woods. She'd start literally having
*  a traumatic response to not having intimacy, which was shocking. Because again, on the scale
*  of a cockroach to an elephant, you go, I didn't know that giant anteaters had such intense emotions.
*  But she did. And we, we, you know, and also taking care of her forced me to,
*  to explore the jungle from the perspective of an animal. So I got to like be an animal.
*  And so there's only a few times in your life, in my life where I've gotten to do that,
*  you know, one was with her, another time was living with a herd of elephants where I had to
*  walk with them through the forest and like, see how they interacted completely natural.
*  And it's, it's, it's different. It's very different. And you realize like,
*  just like a person's public persona when they're out on the street in Manhattan,
*  is going to be very different than when you're on the couch with them on a Tuesday night.
*  And, and, and with wild animals, it's very much like that. You know, like if we see,
*  you see a bobcat on a trail and it's going to look at you and glare at you and then go off
*  and it's like, yeah, but what's it like when it's in the den and it's playing with its cubs?
*  Yeah. So that when it's looking at you, that's like the Instagram posts it's making.
*  The actual, yeah. So you've, besides Amazon, you spend a lot of time in India. Can you tell
*  me what you learned hanging out with a herd of elephants? What should, what do people
*  not understand about elephants? That's, that's beautiful to you. That's interesting to you.
*  First of all, I think that elephants should have government representation as like a subset of
*  society. Like actually they, they have intelligence. They are so intelligent. And, and when you look
*  at an elephant, so there's this question that keeps coming up of, you know, are we,
*  are we smart enough to know how smart animals are? Can we, can we, can we interpret the
*  intelligence that we're seeing? And I've, I've, I've, I lived with a semi wild herd of elephants
*  in India for a while. And some of the things that I saw, like changed how I view reality,
*  to be honest with you, because, you know, you watch a matriarch of an elephant herd walk up
*  to someone that none of us knew was pregnant and her trunk goes to her stomach. And then she calls
*  all the other ones over and they're interested in this little human that they know that there's
*  something in there and they're, and they're all conversing about it. And you go, Whoa,
*  or that every morning we'd wake up and the elephants didn't want the stream water. They
*  didn't want the lake water. They want puddles. They wanted the water from our well. We had like a
*  stone well, you know, like a traditional, and every morning it's like run out of bed because
*  all the elephants were going to come and they were going to rip the bucket off and destroy
*  everything, but they wanted that nice, cold, clean water. And so it was like caring for elephants
*  that were wild. There were sometimes getting shot at by farmers because if they went to try
*  and rob some bananas. So these are sort of like delinquent elephants that were half wild in the
*  forest department was thinking about, you know, getting rid of them, which whatever that meant.
*  And, uh, I made really good friends with this one elephant and his name was Dharma.
*  And, uh, Dharma had the, had the, this stuff doesn't, this is, it's hard to write the book
*  I'm writing right now because none of it sounds real. He grew up around people because he was a
*  tusk-less male. So he couldn't hang out with the females because he was a grown up male.
*  And he couldn't hang out with the males, the bulls, because he couldn't defend himself when
*  they rough housed and everything. So Dharma would be like wandering around the forest,
*  not knowing who to hang out with. And so like there was one night there was a tiger calling
*  and we just heard, you could hear it echoing over the hills. And what does Dharma do? 2 AM,
*  we hear Dharma show up and he's same thing. He starts throwing a tantrum. He starts pulling
*  shit over. He says, takes a chair, throws it. We had bananas in the truck. Dharma walks up to the
*  truck. It's like a Jeep. He walks up to the Jeep, smells it. He looks at me and he's like,
*  are you going to get out of bed? I'm like, no, I'm not going to get out of bed. I was like,
*  Dharma, you're a grown ass elephant. The tiger does this thing again. And he's like,
*  I need bananas to feel better. Pushes the truck up on two, two wheels. Looks at me.
*  Is this how you want it to be? So I'm up, I'm up and I go and I'm like, please, please,
*  please, Dharma, I'm rubbing his face. And he's like, he puts it down. He's like, all right,
*  well then then hit me. I didn't do it. So he lifts it up again. And so in the end,
*  there was no way for me to outsmart the elephant. He wins. There's nothing I could do. And so a lot
*  of my job was taking him out into the forest and spending a little bit of time with him. I have
*  this beautiful, one time I set up the tripod and I went and I was just journaling and he would come
*  and he would just like play with my hair. And he'd be like, Hey, what's up? And he just, he wanted
*  someone to interact with on an emotional level. And when you think about elephants in terms of
*  the fact that people go, oh, they use medication to induce labor. It's like, yeah, that's not that
*  surprising. They hold the bones of the dead. It's like, yeah, they have the best smell of pretty
*  much any animal. That's also not surprising. They probably know exactly who that was, that bone,
*  but they can navigate to water holes and communicate in ways that we cannot really figure
*  out. And so when you hear about people measuring elephant intelligence, you'll hear about scientists
*  being like, Oh, well, we gave it a, you know, a bucket with a hole in it. And then it had like a
*  key and there was a rope. And you're like, bro, this is all human stuff. Can you go walking with
*  them for three weeks in the wild and watch how they deal with the problems that they encounter
*  in the forest? And so elephants have become, especially recently with the work that's been
*  going on, that I've been doing in Africa with vet paw. I've just become so fascinated with elephants
*  and, you know, elephants, the elephant, the African elephant population right now is down
*  at 2% of what it was a few hundred years ago. We're really, we're really putting them on the
*  brink of, you know, there's, there's some elephants that are being born tuskless because we've
*  poaching has taken down the great tuskers to the point where now it's, it's actually beneficial
*  for some elephants and not have tusks because they won't have humans, but that's, that's like
*  we've created deformed elephants. And so like now I'm gotten very concerned with issues of elephants
*  and tusks are fundamental to the interaction between elephants. Absolutely. I mean, with males
*  compete with each other, but also elephants use their tusks, you know, like they'll, they'll break
*  a branch and they'll be like, this is a good branch. I'm going to eat the hell out of this.
*  And they'll like, hang it on their tusk and they'll like grab a bunch of other stuff. They'll
*  like hold it. You know, ripping a tree up out of the ground. I just watched it two weeks ago.
*  I was watching an elephant. He got down on his knees and stuck his tusk into the ground and like
*  leveraged up. He like Archimedes to this root out of the ground and then was like,
*  that's a sweet root. And then when he left, I went and I tasted the root and it was like
*  sweet ginger. And I was like, I have no idea what this is, but he knew it was good.
*  Do they use tusks for sexual selection, like to impress the ladies or no?
*  It's certainly involved in how, who, who has mating rights. Oh, who wins in the competition.
*  I mean, if you've got the big tusks and there are elephants out there, like the mammoth, big tuskers
*  that have tusks down to the ground, like huge. And when you see them, it's like seeing something
*  unique on earth, unique in history. Cause we're at a point where we might lose those. There are
*  only a few of them left. And then they're so prized by hunters. Yeah. It's interesting. Cause I,
*  I forget what the actual conclusion on that is. Cause there's some studies of the use of the value
*  of beauty in evolution, like birds and peacocks and so on that there's no actual value to it,
*  but it plays a role in, in sexual selection, meaning value. Like it's much easier to understand
*  competition. Like a tusk helps you defeat the competitor, but I bet you there's a component
*  to the tusk where the ladies go, God damn, that's a nice, like there's a visual, beautiful component.
*  Maybe not. I don't know. But what if, what if beauty though, as we're defining it though is,
*  is symmetry and the, the absence of yellow spots on your face and, and healthy looking hair. And
*  so like, I think to us, beauty is sexually appealing traits that look good to mate with.
*  So that, that 19 year old with Marissa, everybody in the world was swipe left on that. Yeah.
*  At least sexually desirable object in the universe. Okay. What you mean speaking of elephant
*  intelligence and something I think and work quite a bit on as with artificial intelligence
*  is what the philosophical question that comes up is what is intelligence? What is intelligent?
*  Um, humans, homo sapiens are often thought to be highly intelligent. That's the reason they stand
*  out. Uh, in your understanding of different species, like the elephant, what stands out to
*  about humans or are they just another animal with different kinds of intelligence?
*  Yeah. Well, we're certainly unique because we have altered the entire planet.
*  Yeah. You know, the term, the Anthropocene, I mean, it's like we've literally created a
*  geological layer of us, whereas other animals don't. And going back to elephants, it's like,
*  they also engineer their environment. If you're in a forest, like if you drop me in a forest
*  on earth, I could tell you in two seconds if there's elephants there because this
*  twisted branches and excavated earth and they, they're constantly gardening. Um,
*  but I mean, look, look at us. I mean, there's, we're, we're clearly unique in nature,
*  which, which makes me not understand the, the, the anti-human sentiment that, that so much of
*  environmentalism has about like, you know, like we're, we're bad, we're damned, we ruin everything.
*  And it's like, I've seen the worst. I've seen the burning Amazon and I'm still like,
*  I love being able to share ideas with you and travel to places and FaceTime my family when
*  I'm not around them. And it's like, I, I celebrate a lot of what makes us human.
*  And I, I, it's almost like reality is this crazy video game. And it's like, if we could just figure
*  out the right keys, we can pretty much do anything we can think of. And it's like,
*  I mean, poetry art, I mean, you know, I'm, I'm the biggest animal lover in the world, but we are,
*  we are, we are different. We really are. Yeah. The ability to puzzle, solve, create tools.
*  I think it's the coolest invention humans have come up with is a fire with the most impactful.
*  I feel like fire is fire. I feel like fire is kind of a gimme. I feel like the,
*  they didn't really invent it. They, they probably like the wheel flying. I mean, flying. I mean,
*  think if you could go back in time to someone that never flew, you know, a Sultan, an Egyptian king,
*  George Washington, you know, and be like, you can fly. I mean, this is just, just on my way here.
*  And I fly way too much, but I was looking out the window at the clouds and going, this is
*  unbelievably spectacular. It's just stunning. You know, as a kid, you, you look at a cloudy day
*  and you go, this is the world is like this today. And then you get in a plane and you fly above the
*  clouds and it's sunny up there and you go, Oh, it just, it changes your perspective. It's like when
*  people go to the moon and they come back and they tell you the pale blue dot, you know, just,
*  I say, I say flying, I think the ability to fly. I mean, the fact that I could,
*  I could get on a plane and be in India and, you know, 20, 22 hours is shocking.
*  In terms of its usefulness, I would argue that's not in the top five, but in terms of its ability
*  to inspire, there's somebody I forgot who told me this idea that there's something about the
*  atmosphere, earth's atmosphere that allows you to look up and see the stars. Like if we didn't have
*  that human civilization would not have happened. Meaning like being able to look up and see
*  something out there would fill our, like something that allows you to look up versus just look down
*  to like first looking at your local environment, be able to like wander and see, holy shit,
*  there's a big world out there. And I don't know anything. If you're able to look up and see that
*  that kind of humility combined with the ability to dream about exploring, maybe it just inspires
*  the exploration. It's kind of an interesting thought given how inspiring, for example, the
*  the extra upgraded super cool version of flying, which is flying to other planets. I mean,
*  there's going to be, hopefully it's possible this century, a child born, no, not this century,
*  maybe this century, a child born on another planet that looks up and looks back at earth
*  and has to be educated by his, her parents that like, there's another place.
*  There's another place where life is way easier. Oh God, it's so easy. There's water everywhere.
*  Exactly. People complain about earth, man, earth is really, really, really good.
*  It's really, really good here. Water everywhere.
*  I wouldn't even leave it given like right now, like if somebody said like, oh, you could like,
*  you could go to the moon. I'd be like, no, I'm good. If I died in space, I'd be so pissed.
*  I love it here. Yeah, but you're still, there's a longing to explore for you.
*  There's a longing to explore, but I really think I'm such a, like my longing to explore is like
*  river streams, oceans, jungles. Like to me, yeah, I would, I would watch the hell out of the,
*  the live stream of, of, of Elon touching down on Mars. Like I'd be like, this is incredible.
*  It's an amazing that I get to be around to see this. I'm staying where I'll be right here.
*  Yeah. But it's good that the human spirit pushes us to know what's possible. And it does that for
*  you. What, um, just a out there questions that what's, what's the most dangerous animal
*  in the Amazon would you say? Mammal, let's go at mammal.
*  Oh, dangerous mammal.
*  Like dangerous in terms of you walking around doing the solo hike.
*  I'm going to disappoint everybody with this, but it's, it's, it's humans. It's nothing. There's no,
*  if I'm out in the Amazon, there's nothing that's going to attack me. You know, and in, in India,
*  you might have, you might have an old leopard or a tiger that's missing a tooth that decides
*  your prey, or you might have an angry elephant that's in must that just decides to, just decides
*  to flatten you in the Amazon. You're not, there's real Jaguars won't even let you see them. Yeah.
*  And there's really nothing else. One of my friends, a brilliant scientist friend of mine,
*  Pat got attacked by a rabid ocelot once, but that's like a diesel house cat, just having a fit. You
*  know, it's wasn't the worst thing in the world. Just the assholes kingdom. Okay. What, in terms
*  of humans, you said that the tribes, some of them uncontacted can be exceptionally dangerous. What's
*  your experience with them? What should people learn? Cause it's such a fascinating part
*  of life here on earth that there's tribes that don't have much or any contact with the quote
*  unquote civilized world. I, most of the people that I meet don't actually really understand how,
*  how isolated these people are or how weird it is that we're sitting here and that we have iPhones
*  and airplanes and all this stuff. And these people are living naked in the forest at this moment.
*  And so the, the, the thing though, you know, I also was recently, somebody, somebody said,
*  there's like paleolithic tribes and it's like, no, no, no, just by default, they're modern
*  tribes living now. They just happen to be living out in the jungle. And there's a huge debate about,
*  you know, do we try and contact them and bring them in? And there's two camps of people on this,
*  who they said that it was, it was, it was the trauma of the rubber boom that sent them out
*  that far into the forest and made them terrified of the outside world. And so that's also what made
*  them so hyper violent. I mean, they're, they're, I, there's one of the guys we work with on our
*  team, Victor was, and I think it was 2004, he's coming down river and he had a load of mahogany
*  wood and he's piloting this boat and he sent two people, husband and wife ahead to go start
*  cooking breakfast on the beach so they could put the little kitchenette thing down and pick,
*  put the propane. He sent them ahead as the, he's going nice and slow with the barge coming down
*  the river. They go ahead, reach the beach, they get out, he starts cutting some cane to start
*  making a fire. Tribe comes out, no warning. They just start screaming. They start shooting arrows.
*  The man instantly gets an arrow through the leg and it pins his legs so he can't run. He tells his
*  wife, go save yourself. And she does. She jumps in the water. There's arrows falling around her too.
*  And as she's floating down the river, she looks back and the last thing she sees is these guys
*  getting to her husband and beginning to rip him apart. As Victor comes down the river,
*  this is a guy we work with every day, he comes down the river and sees his friend disemboweled,
*  opened up, dissected. His parts are all over the beach. The beach is red. And they only found out
*  what happened because they found her later on holding onto a stick in the river. And they're
*  like, what happened? And she was like, they just attacked. They don't want people on their land.
*  On the sort of the underground WhatsApp chain of the Amazon, a few in August, like this was not
*  internationally known, some loggers went up and tried to steal a few trees from where the tribes
*  were. And then everybody sent the pictures of what the loggers looked like after a few days
*  because the tribes porcupine them with arrows. They were laying there on the ground with just
*  arrows sticking out of their bodies. And then eventually the authorities came out and looked
*  at you. There was just these white bodies. I'll show you the pictures later. There's just these
*  white puffy bodies with like the skulls sticking out. And it was like, you don't mess with these
*  tribes. I wonder what's the mythology around that they construct around who these outsiders are?
*  Are they gods? Are they demons? Are they humans? Who are they? Who are we to them?
*  Well, you got to go back to the rubber boom. The rubber barons went down there and at the start of
*  the industrial revolution, the only way to get rubber was to mine it from the trees that are out
*  in the forest. And so the only way to do that, because you can't make a rubber plantation in
*  the jungle. When it's in plantation form, when it's a monoculture, it gets this leaf blight and it
*  all dies. Henry Ford tried it, it didn't work. And so what they did was they sent these people
*  down who just whipped, burned, enslaved, raped, and pillaged the people. It's one of the worst
*  periods in human suffering that I've ever read about. One missionary said they were
*  killing the locals the way you or I would kill a mosquito. They just went nuts. And so they sent
*  them out and they would come back with rubber and this would go to fuel the industrial revolution
*  for hoses and gaskets and tires and all this stuff that suddenly we needed. And it was during that
*  time that these gangs of foreigners would go into the jungle to enslave the natives,
*  that these uncontacted tribes went back into the jungle and said, not us.
*  And they have six foot bows and seven foot arrows with bamboo tips. They make the bamboo tips
*  into razor blades. And so when those things fly, actually one of my rangers, one of the
*  jungle keepers team was present when the tribes had come out onto the river and he tried to help
*  them because they're nomadic and they live out there. And so there's an element of brother,
*  they're trying to be like, you don't need to be like this. We're friendly. So they sent a canoe
*  across the river with bananas. And so he's up to his waist in the river and the tribes are right
*  across the river and they shot. And he sees the arrow coming right at his head. And as he moved
*  to the side, it hit him at the temple and sliced him back towards the ear, opening him to the skull.
*  He's fine. But let me tell you something, when he goes and gets a crew cut, it's the most badass
*  the scar you've ever seen, man. And so he always keeps it real short on that side. But
*  even if you try to help them, they're not necessarily friendly.
*  That's a tough lesson.
*  Yeah.
*  I suppose they have a point.
*  They have a point and protecting them is a default of, now that we're protecting all
*  this ecosystems and all these other indigenous communities, it's like we all sort of live with
*  this knowledge that they're the hermanos, the brothers are out there and that's the way they
*  want to keep it. And so we just have to be respectful of like, you don't camp on certain
*  beaches at certain times of the year because we know that they might be there. You really have to
*  be careful about that.
*  Have you yourself interacted with any?
*  My interaction with them came on a solo where I pushed it a little bit too far.
*  And I was planning to do a three week, this was like the big one. And I got dropped off by poachers
*  up a river and I went past the point where they were like names. I said, what tributary are we on?
*  And they were like, tributary. And I was like, okay. And I said, leave me here. And I remember
*  the guy being like, are you committing suicide? And he didn't understand that. I was like, no,
*  I have a backpack and I have like food and like, I'm going to like take videos and I have a tripod.
*  And I was like, we're cool here. And they looked at me like they were like, goodbye.
*  And I was like, all right. And I went up this river. And again, like you just, you learn these
*  things. Like, you know, it was only when I'd been alone for a week that you realize you're,
*  I guess that's saying they're like, oh, you're, you're born alone and you die alone. It's like,
*  no, you're not. You're born into a room full of people. Usually at the very least, your mother's
*  there for everybody. And, and so you've been around people, probably if you're a normal person,
*  every single day of your life, you've seen dozens, if not hundreds of people.
*  And all of a sudden you realize what a social creature we are. Because on day six, it gets
*  weird. For me, it got weird. I know there's people that can do it longer. So what does that mean?
*  Like longing for contact, like are you lonely? Longing for contact, the distortion of reality in
*  the sense that like, you know, you wake up and there's no one there and you start to,
*  you know, you're going up a river. So I would keep, I kept looking back down river and
*  almost thinking of my life as something, it was almost like I had already died and I had gone to
*  somewhere else. And I was looking back on that life as like something that I had experienced.
*  And then there, there came this panic of what if it's gone or like, what if world war three broke
*  out? And I just don't know about it. My family in New York is vaporized and something just,
*  you just, you're, you're, you're,
*  so actually your ability to comprehend and interpret reality kind of requires other people.
*  It's not just that you're lonely. You need that contact to actually just perceive the world,
*  make sense of it, all of that. So you start basically hallucinating.
*  I, I started feeling very uncomfortable. Um, it doesn't help also that like Santiago told me
*  these stories where he's like, if you hear cappuccinos sounding, not quite monkeys, if you
*  hear cappuccino monkeys sounding, not quite like cappuccinos, he goes, it's the tribe and they're
*  coming to get you. And then, um, the guy who was shot Ignacio, they showed me videos where we saw
*  them on the beach and they're communicating in monkey calls. They're using it as code so that
*  we don't understand them, even though we don't speak their language, but they're, they're using
*  animal calls. And so every night you go to sleep and then you go, did that tinamou sound off?
*  You're like, shit, you know, and it's really hard to fall asleep. And then like one night I messed
*  up and I left a fish. I like cleaned this fish. I ate like this huge fish. I just ate it to my
*  face. You're putting out like marathon levels of energy every day. Like, you know, Goggins would
*  love solos. He'd be like, this is awesome. Yeah. You eat the fish raw. Uh, this one,
*  I actually cooked it, but you know, the skeleton was laying there right, right outside my tent.
*  Stupid. And then the middle of the night I wake up and I just could tell there was something there,
*  you know? And then like, you almost don't want to look. It's like when you're a kid at the
*  basement door and you're like, is there a ghost? I like unzipped the tent and I like open it up
*  and there's like 27 black caiman outside of my tent all looking at me like this. And like some
*  of their heads are this big and they're like, there's fish there. Can we have it? And I'm like,
*  holy shit. And like, you know, I was like, do I, I kind of like had to like scooch the tent back and
*  like move back and let them have their fish. And there was a host of crocodiles outside of my tent.
*  Um, but no, so then there was, wait, how many like 27, maybe there's a lot, big ones, small ones,
*  medium sized one, every type. They were all there and their eyes glow in the night. You know,
*  you shine a light at animals and they have a tapetum lucidum. And so their, their eye shine
*  comes back at you. If you shine a headlamp at a, at a jaguar or a frog or almost every animal has
*  a tapetum. So these are croc. There's a whole lot of them. Yeah. I thought, can we go back to the
*  part of the conversation where you said the jungle is not dangerous. The humans are the most
*  dangerous. Did they eat me? No. Why didn't they eat you? They wanted the fish. Is there some way
*  of you interacting with them that shows that you're not a source of harm? I don't believe so. I'm
*  sure there's someone out there that thinks they can talk to crocs, but because there's a, there's
*  a story of you grabbing a croc by the tail. What did you learn from that? Learn to not always listen
*  to JJ. So JJ was testing you to, uh, to see how stupid it was. How do you hold the
*  crocodile? Exactly. You have to get them by the head, like an anaconda like this. And so,
*  so you're one of the world experts at grabbing creatures by the head. I wouldn't say world
*  expert, but I've done a lot of it. Um, I also have, you see the head, there's like kind of a ball
*  there. That's where a crocodile tooth went in that side and like came out that side of my,
*  that was a really good chomp. And the watch I was wearing at the time saved me cause that like that.
*  Um, real fast, just chomp, just whack. Like somebody took a sledgehammer, you put your hand
*  on the table and I just went, bah, really hurt. Um, shouldn't have been doing that.
*  How did that come up? Cause I caught a croc that was too big. So usually when we catch little
*  caiman in the streams and we measure them to monitor the populations, um, you get it by the
*  neck. And then I tuck the tail under my arm and I hold it and you're talking about a little,
*  you know, four foot croc, nothing. And I, I, this one, I dove into a, into a swamp and I caught
*  like a six foot spectacle caiman and her head is big and I had her by the neck and I realized I
*  couldn't get her tail under my arm because her tail was all the way back there and she started
*  thrashing and it was like probably croc number 375 that I'd caught. And I just got a little
*  cocky and I said, ah, she's, you know, I just, I just like grabbed her by a leg. I was like,
*  I got this and she just came back and tagged me and I went, okay, gonna go back to being safe.
*  Just to linger on it, what, um, is it one of the, one of the bigger predators in the Amazon?
*  What, and it's, is it going to, uh, are they going extinct black caimans?
*  Black caiman were, I believe they were critically endangered for a while because for a while the
*  fashion industry loved their skin. It's soft and it's black. Um, they're bouncing back a little
*  bit now, you know, like most animals, if you leave them alone, they'll be fine. I mean, crocs have
*  been through, you know, how many millions and millions of years on earth before us. I mean,
*  that's even the joke with, with the joke, but that's the grim reality of tiger conservation.
*  It's there was a hundred thousand tigers in 1900. Now there's 4,000 tigers left on earth.
*  It's not rocket science. All you have to do is not bulldoze their forest and allow there to be some
*  deer and tigers will be fine. That's it. It's so simple. And that's like sometimes where I feel
*  like I have the dumbest job in the world. I'm like, guys, please stop killing the things that
*  keep us alive. The Amazon regulates our global climate, produces medicine is home to indigenous
*  people. It's beautiful. Rainforests only cover 3% of the planet's landmass. Like it's not that much
*  to ask. If you leave their home untouched, they'll figure out how to have sex and multiply,
*  except for pandas, apparently. Cause pandas you have to convince. Yeah. Humpbacks, humpbacks,
*  they went down to, they went from 130,000 down to I think about 8,000 at whaling times. And then
*  when we banned whaling since that time, where I think we're back up to over a hundred thousand
*  humpback whales, they've bounced back. It's a success story. We're not going to lose them.
*  Okay. So you're in a, on a solo with a crocs looking at you. See, this is why you're good
*  at this. You know, I would have lost. We would have been, we were tangent forever with the fish.
*  That was your mistake. That was my mistake. I don't understand why you're still alive. I mean,
*  it's really inspiring. When you come, we're going to, I'm going to show you.
*  You told me you're coming or you're 100% coming. Yeah. But you know,
*  if there's any place, I mean, um, sort of a grim joke, but if there's any way to die,
*  that's a good one. If I'm being honest, it's a cool one. It's a pretty cool one.
*  It'll become part of the party. Yeah. I mean, there's, it's, I'm not even like joking. There's,
*  there's a oneness to the whole thing. All the stories, just reading your work, looking at your
*  work. I, it seems like you're part of this machine that is nature. There's this, this incredible
*  machine. Like we all die and we're all part of this big thing that humans do have the capability
*  to also construct narratives and stories and myths and tell them to each other and share them
*  with each other and have more sophisticated ways. Therefore to communicate love to each other,
*  but animals do as well. They communicate love, maybe more simply, maybe more honestly.
*  Anyway, so you, you were the Crocs and the fish.
*  Yeah. So I messed up. I left the fish out, Croc straight up outside my tent,
*  but in the end it was fine. I, I, I backed off. They had their way with the fish and then they all
*  started biting each other. It was fun to watch. Is that a general, sorry to interrupt. Is that a
*  general rule you want to not leave? Yeah. Just like if you're camping in the Northeast, you don't
*  leave, like you do a bear bag or a bear canister. You don't, you don't want to invite the wild
*  animals. I really did mess up. I kind of was just like, you know, whatever. I do this every
*  now and then I get a little too cavalier. And the, the ocean has almost, almost taken me down for
*  that a few times. But yeah, so the Crocs and then you keep going for a few days. And my plan was to
*  get to a point where I reached the end of the tributary. And this had a very,
*  you know, again, for me, this is like a pilgrimage. This is like, this is like me going into the heart
*  of the, the very center and soul and essence of everything that I am fascinated with, like as
*  close to God as you can get, because you're leaving every type of security, every human
*  relationship, you're also pushing all your chips in. And so it's, it's,
*  you know, the, every step I took further up river, it got weirder and weirder and more intense.
*  And every day and every moment it changed. And I would, I brought pictures at the time, there's no
*  way to keep a phone charged. I didn't have like a power bank or anything. You know, I brought
*  pictures from home. I brought a, I brought a national geographic magazine, something just to,
*  there came a day right when I was getting to the end, like to the point where the river was so
*  shallow that it was just a trickle. And I was walking on the rocks and the Andes mountains were
*  in front of me and I was like reaching the place and the music was swelling. And then
*  all of a sudden I saw smoke around the next bend. And I, I, like my self, I was like,
*  I knew what I was going to see because I knew that it was impossible for loggers to be out there.
*  There's no motor that could take you. The boat would have run aground miles ago. And so I went,
*  and this is the other, this is the other idiot thing. It's like, just turn around.
*  Yeah. Just do it. I'm that kid though. When you see like a wet paint sign, like I walk by and I
*  touch the wall. Yeah. And I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  touch the wall. And so I, I, I went around the bend
*  and, and I see, I see a few naked people on the beach and they see me and we're like a good
*  distance apart. It's there on the other side of the river, but you know, arrow in hand, bow in hand,
*  the intention of pose, they're looking at me, they're clearly conversing.
*  And that moment lasted for a long moment where I said, this is the part of the story where they
*  are going to rip me apart, dissect me to see what I eat. I mean, every other story in the region
*  that we've heard, that's the ending of it. If you're alone with these people, it's not going to go
*  well. And I have nothing to defend myself with. And I just, I turned and I ran for like three
*  hours and I got in the river and I swam for a while and all my food got wet. I mean, everything,
*  I just, you know, all this just ran for dear life and my, my get out plan, the thing after I crossed
*  the mountains and came down into the next tributary was I had a pack raft and so tiny little
*  inflatable raft good enough to handle rapids. And I inflated the pack raft. Once the, once the river
*  was like six inches deep, I inflated the pack raft and I went and I went for the rest of the
*  for the rest of that day into the night. I went into the point that my headlamp died and I was
*  just floating, floating in a raft down the Amazon and hitting into things. And I was like,
*  I'm going to, I'm going to pop this raft. So I got out of the raft, set up my tent and I was like,
*  I need some sleep. I was freaking out. I hadn't had food and now, you know, hours and hours and
*  hours. As soon as I fell asleep, my asshole brain comes up with the dream of that. I hear voices,
*  they're right outside the tent. I just, you know, sleeping was worse than being awake.
*  So I woke up, got back in the tent and then at one point it was really cool. Cause one of those,
*  one of the same black came in that had come for the fish as I'm going down river, he came right
*  up next to me and the two of us were going and he was just like motoring down river, this giant,
*  like 16 foot crocodile. He just like came up to me and like looked at me as I was going. And it
*  was funny cause I wasn't scared of him. I was scared of them. And yeah, it took me like a week
*  to get back to town. And again, the things you learn in these moments, the, you know,
*  the appreciation for your parents, the, what a hug feels like, you know, when you are faced with
*  pretty much certainty that you're not going to get those things again,
*  whether it's from MRSA or uncontacted tribes or, you know, I find that it brings you this new
*  joy for life where you just being that close to death. Yeah. You go, you go, my God, this is all
*  a miracle. It's sad because they're human just like you actually, how different are they?
*  Like if you were forced to interact for a week together where they can't, they're not allowed
*  to kill you. Like not allowed to kill me. What would they, are they, how fundamentally different
*  are they? Do you think? I don't think that different. I think they're like any other
*  Amazonian natives. They're tall. They seem to have tall genetics. And there's places, you know,
*  again, there's, there's what is known and then there's what we know down there. Like there's,
*  there's one community where I don't know whether it was like a bad rainstorm or something, but some
*  kid from the uncontacted tribes did end up in a village. And so he learned Spanish or he learned
*  whatever dialect they speak in that village. And so he's told us a little bit about what life was
*  like with them, but like, they're just people. They're just people. They have their own culture.
*  They know about medicines that we don't know about. They definitely have hunting practices
*  that, that we don't understand. They can hit a spider monkey out of 160 foot tree with a bamboo
*  arrow. We can't do that. I mean, they are incredible hunters and also like living naked in the jungle
*  with the bot flies and the mosquitoes. I don't know how they do it. Like sometimes at night. And
*  again, we don't have night vision, whereas almost every other animal does. And sometimes we'll be
*  sitting, you know, on our, you know, at the research station at night and we'll be just drinking and
*  like looking out and at the, you know, we'll do, we'll scare each other. We'll go, you know,
*  you realize if they were out there right now, they could be looking at us. And it's like,
*  the truth is, is that when it's dark out there, they can't see, it's not easy to start a fire
*  with matches and a lighter and gasoline. They do it with friction. They have some,
*  some beads on survival that we could really learn from. Not to mention that then you have people
*  that believe that they are actually the guardians of the extinct giant ground sloth. And what they're
*  doing is, you know, living out there because they're protecting a secret population of
*  previously extinct megafauna, but there's all kinds of, I mean, this, it's like you,
*  you go into the crypto world so quick. I've heard so many people be like,
*  but then again, you have to be humble at how little we know about,
*  about that world, about the world of life. Like you said, there's so much of life in the Amazon
*  that we don't, uh, creatures with no names, tons of them. We could go out on a night walk right now
*  and I could show you something that, you know, you, I've done it. You, you, you, you pick up a bug and
*  you go, that doesn't look right. That's not right. He's got three heads. Yeah. You know,
*  and then you send it to, to the, the, the greatest expert on that genus of insects and,
*  and they go, look, I got no idea. And you're talking to a world expert and it's like,
*  that's it. And then 50% of the life is up in the canopy. And so like we started climbing the trees,
*  like rock climbing, like what Alex Honnold does, like, well, like I'll climb up 50 feet and then
*  I'll put a safety, like I'm basically trad climbing and then I'll climb up another 50 feet
*  and I'll have JJ belaying me from below. And then he'll be like, Ooh, look, a snake. I'm like, JJ,
*  pay attention. Like you get up there and the, the branches are as thick as this table. So you can
*  like walk around freely. It's like total like avatar when they're in the floating islands,
*  like you can, you can go run around if that's what you want to do. Bromeliads, orchids,
*  cactuses, because up there it's against the sun. So it's a different environment.
*  Yeah. Interesting. And then you start seeing lizards and snakes and birds and things that
*  aren't down on the ground. And so how many scientists have actually gotten to really spend
*  time up there and really inventory the life. And that's why when you hear about you like it,
*  it's like a taxonomical discussion of how many species there are on earth. They're like between,
*  you know, 10 and 30 million. And it's like, well, that's a big, it's a big swing.
*  What about stuff on the ground? So you mentioned some insects. What about bullet ants?
*  So it's supposed to be the most painful bite in the world. You've been bitten by one
*  seven or eight times. Yeah. What does it feel like? Okay. So the first time that we ever did bullet
*  ants, um, JJ said, you know, okay, this is what we're going to do. He goes, you know, it's bullet
*  ant roulette. We're going to get a bullet ant and you get like chopsticks. You like pick up this
*  bullet ant and a big, they're big and they're tough. Like he, he goes, we're going to put our
*  forearms together and we're going to drop the bullet ant and clamp our forearms together and
*  just rub and whoever, whoever it takes, it takes. Yeah. Of course, JJ did not get stung and I did.
*  And it hurts every bit as much as they say it hurts. It really let me have it. And then,
*  and then I was like hitting my arm against the table to try and like kill it or get it off,
*  but it was holding on and just like really injecting the venom and, uh, yeah, really letting
*  you have it. And then it, it travels up and it goes into your like lymph nodes and into your here
*  and you get a headache. And, and I think the, the, the brilliant thing about the, the, the venom of
*  a bullet ant is that it makes you feel like, like this, this feeling of alarm. It makes you feel like
*  something's wrong. You don't just go out. This hurts. Like it's like a bee sting or you go,
*  this really hurts on my hand. It's like, no, no, no, no. Your whole nervous system
*  is freaking out and you start sweating and then you get cold and then you're tired.
*  Then you get a little blurry vision and it's like, and that's actually that bad. I mean,
*  now after six or seven, I get bitten and I'm like, kind of okay. So it's a full body,
*  full mind experience. It's a full body, full mind experience. But then there's
*  places in the Amazon where they stick their hand in a glove with like 70 of them. Right.
*  And I think Steve-O did that, which I would, I just don't understand how you could do that
*  without going into complete anaphylactic shock and dying. Cause one really sucks.
*  Well, just like, just like we said with animals and with humans, there's different kinds.
*  Definitely a special, unique, the first of his species.
*  On the point of on contact to tribes,
*  it's interesting to think about what kind of civilizations have there been?
*  This is something that you've talked about a little bit. Graham Hancock has written about
*  ancient civilizations, has sort of challenging the conventionals, the mainstream thinking about
*  the civilizations that have been there in the Amazon. Can you steel man and criticize
*  the idea? So the pro and the con of the idea that there have been ancient, advanced ancient
*  civilizations in the Amazon. Like how much do we know? What are all the possibilities
*  of what's in the Amazon in this past? So like when Oriana went down the Amazon,
*  the reports were that there was great civilizations in the Amazon. And then,
*  you know, a few hundred years later, when people got to actually check up on this stuff,
*  it was all gone. And so was that because of this, this whole thing that we're talking about?
*  And so was that because of disease that we wiped out all these civilizations
*  and these communities of people potentially, probably, was he just wrong? Probably not.
*  This is a guy that navigated by the stars back to Spain after building his own boat.
*  Or did he, you know, or was he trying to just, I don't know, I don't know, but
*  there clearly is a long history of complex civilizations in the Amazon. 100%. There's no
*  one that can deny that. The thing that I reacted to was that I've heard videos, I've seen moments
*  in podcasts where the narrative becomes not, there's more ancient civilization information
*  in the Amazon than we previously thought. True statement. We're discovering with LIDAR,
*  and this is what Graham Hancock is talking about, that we're discovering constantly that there's,
*  there was more civilizations than we thought in various places. The place where I take
*  offense is where they start to say that the Amazon, there's actually articles that are titled this,
*  that the Amazon is a manmade garden, which is not true.
*  So the actual, which I think is a really different idea, that the entire ecosystem and everything
*  we've been talking about, all the species, all the forestry and the different, just life, life,
*  one of the most diverse ecosystems on earth is initially created by humans. It's ridiculous.
*  Well, it's not, first of all, it's unlikely, but it's not ridiculous. So we can't, well,
*  there's no ridiculous in science, but the complexity of life is very difficult to engineer,
*  as you, the more you study about biological systems and so on, it's very difficult to
*  create the kind of things that nature is able to do. That said, I don't know if you've heard,
*  but the entire earth, the world has gone through a pandemic recently, and everybody said, of course,
*  it's natural origins, viruses mutate all the time. And nevertheless, it seems more and more likely
*  that in this particular case, it was an artificial origin leaked from a lab. So humans are able to
*  create stuff, at least modern technological genetic engineering. Made golden retrievers.
*  Come on. You can't be that nice and that good looking. Used to be a wolf. Yeah. But so that
*  bothers you because it, it allows you to think that we don't need to preserve the Amazon. We
*  can always engineer it. Yeah, exactly. Then just this is just to me, that's a slippery slope. Like
*  I totally, it's just, it's so quick from, I'm a fan of expeditions to find ecological ruins and
*  to learn more about the ancient civilizations to, which I don't think is what he's putting out is
*  that then sort of like news articles, which I think they're trying to bait you where they're going,
*  was the Amazon manmade? And it's like, yeah, you know, because then you get, you're going to get a
*  Brazilian president that goes, see, see what they said? It's manmade. So we might as well continue
*  to engineer it and manage it. And it's like, there's such complex systems and interactions
*  and such a, such a giant web of life there that at least in my opinion is clearly one of the most
*  authentically natural things. And again, are there things that we've engineered to the
*  uncontacted tribes? Sometimes they have banana plants that they've stolen and we could see it
*  from the air that they've, they have banana plants. We made banana plants that's engineered by us.
*  We know for a fact. So agricultural engineering, agricultural engineering and stuff like that,
*  but suggesting that the Amazon basin, you know, it's just, it's just a weird way to think about
*  it. I've just heard people dismiss the conserved, the protection of the Amazon based on the fact
*  that like, oh, well if people made it and it's such a giant leap from, from, from the, from zero to
*  a hundred, you know, is there slash and burn that the ancient civilizations did? Of course. Are there
*  areas that were affected by people? Of course. I just get worried when we start talking about
*  it was a manmade thing. Yeah. Hear you loud and clear on that. And I personally think that's
*  completely separate from wondering about what the ancient civilization have been able to accomplish.
*  Oh, sure. It's almost really sad because if all the humans on earth die now,
*  how long does it take before all signs of humans ever existing disappear?
*  For the most part.
*  From an alien perspective. How, what timeline are we talking about? I mean, like, I mean, there's,
*  there's a hundred thousand years, like it could be less, it could be less. It could be like a few
*  thousand because a hundred thousand is complete destruction. A hundred thousand is like nothing.
*  But, but then it could be in, in just a few hundred years, it starts becoming, you know,
*  the government of the alien civilization is going to have to pay quite a bit of money to do the
*  research because they're going to find other life first. They're going to find the dolphins and the
*  fish and so on. They're going to find the trees. Maybe the trees are the interesting thing. Sure.
*  The buildings are not that interesting. The crumbles. But there must be examples of cities
*  that have been left on unattended for a few decades and like how quickly the,
*  the plants push up through the street and everything starts to get broken down.
*  If you really look, you'll be like, oh, there's some interesting geometry here for the buildings
*  and so on. But most, most of the computer stuff, all the stuff of the past hundred years,
*  the airplanes, all that, all the technologies, all the paperwork that all the hard drives,
*  they store all the information. I want to, I want to actually know how long it takes like a 747 to
*  biodegrade. Like how, like if you just leave it there, sitting on the runway, society stops.
*  How long does it take for that thing to disappear? Like that's a weird-
*  Completely versus to a point where it's undemagnifiable might be different, but-
*  Sure.
*  I mean, the point I'm trying to say here is as you've brilliantly put the Amazon churns.
*  Yeah. Oh yeah.
*  And the fact that I wonder throughout its history, what are the peaks of the awesomeness?
*  Well, how many banana, how many agricultural, Einstein's of bananas were there? The creating
*  different kinds of ideas, different kinds of geometry, different kinds of tools.
*  Well, yeah, look what the Incas did. I mean, the Incas, you know, Machu Picchu, I mean,
*  when they found, when Hiram Bigam found Machu Picchu, it was covered in jungle. You could hardly see
*  it. And I mean, the stonework they did, much like what the Egyptians did with the pyramids,
*  a lot of it, we don't really understand how they did it. If you come to the jungle,
*  you got to go to Machu Picchu because it's not far from there. And I usually like, I'm the person,
*  like I won't, I don't usually go see like the, you know, like I've never been to see the Taj Mahal
*  after living in India for five years. Like I'm just not, but when you look up and you see Machu
*  Picchu, you go either they were communicating with the gods there or these people were so smart
*  that they knew that anybody they brought, they were going to impress. They've built something
*  there that when you look up at that mountain, you go, whoa, with those giant stones, the beauty of
*  it, you know, it's just, it's just stunning to imagine that there was this culture of people
*  that could achieve this. And so through the Amazon, I mean, that's sort of up in the Andes, but
*  there's all kinds of stuff in the Amazon. There are places where they say there's
*  pyramids beneath the canopy that we just don't know about. I mean, there's, it's endless.
*  RG If you had billions of dollars, trillions of dollars, what would be the efforts in the Amazon
*  for both conservation and for exploration?
*  AC Alright, well first thing is-
*  RG Which are tied together, I'd probably-
*  AC Yeah, exactly. First, arrest the deforestation so we don't have an ecological crisis on our hands.
*  We don't want to keep losing species, losing indigenous cultures, losing the climate stabilizing
*  services that the Amazon provides as a whole. Stop that. That's my first mission. Next, then we can
*  play. And then it's like, let's go find, I mean, I've flown over the Amazon in a Cessna and it's
*  like, you see things where you go, we have to go see what that is, you know, weird lakes or shapes
*  in the jungle that don't make sense, that are, that are, that are strange. And like-
*  RG So even at that level, you can see weirdness. You can see different, like signs of possible
*  awesomeness. AC Oh, the jungle is so weird. And here's the other thing is that most,
*  so like the region I've been working in, you see where the researchers go. There's certain
*  biological stations, there's certain places where like, oh, like this university has a relationship
*  with this, this university is this. So everybody goes to the same few study sites and then they
*  walk on the same trails and they have the same guides. When you fly in a Cessna and you fly
*  a few hours away from all that and you see a tiny little tributary and then you fly for 40 minutes
*  over unbroken green, just wild before you reach another tributary. Even if somebody could survive
*  going up that tributary, had the expeditionary expertise and the ability to survive getting
*  shot at by arrows, if they could get up that tributary. Now go cut perpendicular into the
*  jungle, which I don't do on the solos. You can't, you can never, don't ever leave the river.
*  But you're telling me that in that span of 70 miles between tiny tributaries at the edge of
*  the world, no one's been there. None of us have been there. Maybe somebody 10,000 years ago was
*  there, but we don't know what populations of things are there. We don't know what ruins are there.
*  And so there's so much undiscovered stuff in the Amazon that is just waiting, just waiting.
*  What is the process of exploring that? So how does money get converted towards exploration?
*  Is there safe ways of doing that?
*  There's places where we found out about things that have to be explored, but where you come up
*  with, well, how do we do this without getting shot? And not only without getting shot, but also
*  without endangering them too. Because how stupid are we if we go in there to people that are living
*  in the jungle, not bothering us, and we go insert ourselves into there because we're curious about
*  some rocks. That doesn't seem fair for the loss of life. And so like, yeah, that's something that
*  we're working on. And like one thing of course is like LIDAR and stuff, but eventually, eventually
*  at the end of everything, it comes down to boots on the ground.
*  As somebody who has to ask that very question about how to deal with uncontacted tribes,
*  they're going to kill you. But you also don't want to disturb their environment.
*  If you were an intelligent alien civilization, oh boy, and you came about Earth,
*  how would you interact with it? Can you put yourself in the mind of an alien civilization?
*  Because there seems to be some parallels here.
*  It is actually, right. It's like a microcosm of-
*  We're very aggressive. Human civilization is very aggressive. So if we were easily,
*  we get threatened easily. Yeah.
*  For stupid reasons, because we start like American military probably thinks it's like the Chinese or
*  the Russians. If we see any kind of flying objects, it gets very on edge. I don't know. I mean,
*  because you know, part of it is like, you just want to ask like, that's the thing. I just want
*  to ask questions. Yeah. But you know, but you don't know the same language. Yeah, you're going to get
*  first of all, you send a boat of bananas. You send a boat of bananas, you get shot.
*  I mean, picture if aliens landed in New York, how long would it take for one of them to get shot?
*  It'd be minutes. It'd be a matter of minutes. Yeah. That's because it's New York. Everywhere else.
*  Look where we are right now. That's true. It'd be even worse here. Yeah. It makes me really,
*  makes me wonder what is the right way to interact with intelligent life that's not like our own.
*  I hope I dream of in our lifetime, we would interact with possibly life on Mars or on one
*  of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn. And like, how do you interact with that thing? Well,
*  there's very technical, biological, chemical processes, but also if there's any kind of
*  intelligence, how do you try to communicate with that intelligence? Yes. So we're not talking about
*  like a cockroach or something like something that's clearly like doing things, making things.
*  Or cockroach possibly. How do you know the difference between a cockroach? Like how do
*  you know? We were just talking about developments. We don't know. We don't know. We have-
*  Just like a race of like philosopher cockroaches just chilling on the rocks.
*  Well, here on earth, we kind of, there seems to be a strong correlation between size and intelligence.
*  Like, it seems like the bigger things have bigger nervous systems and brains. And so they're usually
*  smarter, but that doesn't- I think it's brain. It's the ratio brain to body. Sure. Because you
*  have like crows that are up among the most intelligent and it's like the size of the brain
*  to the size of the body. But there also could be kinds of intelligence where we're completely-
*  That we have no idea. We're not appreciating. Maybe cockroaches. It's the right, the longest.
*  They're talking shit about us right now. It's dumb humans. They're like, dude,
*  they got- These rocks are so great.
*  Couple of hundred years. Exactly. Did you ever hear that Kurt Vonnegut where the two space
*  travelers get lost? This really impacted me as a kid because my dad was an English teacher. So
*  he's always quoting Dostoyevsky and Kurt Vonnegut. And there's this two space travelers get like
*  crash landed in a cave. And on the walls of the cave are the harmoniums. And these kite shaped
*  animals and they feed off the vibrations of the cave. And that's all they do. They don't hurt each
*  other. They just do that. And so for like two years, these travelers are stuck and they're
*  trying to fix their ship. And one of them starts playing music for the harmoniums. And the harmoniums
*  love him for the music and they all come around him and he plays this music for him. And finally,
*  they fixed the ship. And the one guy is like, all right, let's get out of here.
*  And the other guy's like, you know what? I'm staying. He goes, I found a place where I can
*  do good. I'm not hurting anybody and they love me. I'm staying right here.
*  RG Yeah, this whole ambition thing we've got going on, always trying to build a bigger boat,
*  bigger thing. That might not be the ultimate conclusion of a happy existence as a civilization.
*  That's one of the possibilities why we haven't met the aliens yet at scale. It's because once
*  you get good enough at technology, you realize that happiness lies in a peaceful coexistence.
*  It's possible.
*  AC So where do you stand on like aliens now? Like there's a lot coming out about the pilots and the
*  things people have been seeing. And again, like I kind of come in and out of this stuff, like I'll
*  be in the jungle for three months. I miss a lot. So like update me. Like, or are we being contacted
*  right now? RG Of course, nobody knows, but I tend to believe my intuition says there's aliens
*  everywhere. Even our galaxy. That's a bigger leap, but I believe our galaxy has probably billions,
*  hundreds of millions of planets with life on it, like bacteria type of life. And I believe there is,
*  I don't know, thousands of intelligent alien civilizations that exist or have existed.
*  The problem is there's a lot of time and it's very difficult to contact each other.
*  So to achieve a kind of civilization that's able to actually send out enough signal or
*  radiate enough energy where we would notice, I think that's really tough.
*  That said, statistically speaking, it seems like that should have been possible inside our galaxy
*  or maybe nearby. And so I suspect that once an alien civilization is just many orders of magnitude
*  smarter than us humans, the way it would contact us is going to be very difficult for us humans to
*  understand. We're very egocentric. We want the message to be sent as like in English versus
*  I think consciousness itself, emotion, thoughts could be like fingertips, could be words in the
*  story that the aliens are telling us or things that are just like a low dimensional projection
*  of a much higher dimensional message that's being sent by aliens. And it may be our striving to
*  create technology is to create the kind of sensor that's actually able to hear some of the message.
*  Maybe that's what AI is trying to do. So I think that bridging that barrier of communication
*  between us and cockroaches, I think that's the biggest challenge.
*  Interesting.
*  Like the messages are all around us. They're here. I suspect the alien messages are here.
*  The aliens are here. We're just too dumb to see it.
*  So first of all, the imagining planets where there are, just picturing like not a silent planet,
*  but just like a planet of alternate life forms. Maybe it's not something that we can communicate
*  and have a conversation with, but just like a planet of like butterflies and centipedes and weird.
*  Unfortunately, bacteria for billions of years, it was bacteria as single cell,
*  prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but they're boring.
*  Animals of some sort in an environment of some sort. Imagine that would just be such an interesting,
*  beautiful, amazing thing. And I'm sure they're out.
*  The kind of viruses they got going on.
*  But they could also not be biologically based. There could be different chemistries.
*  You have to be humble to that too.
*  But then, you know, it depends on the day. I think you caught me on that day today,
*  an optimistic one. Sometimes I think we're all, this is all there is because you start,
*  you ask that question, the Fermi paradox, like why aren't they here?
*  You can't imagine an advanced alien civilization that would not be explorers because we're explorers.
*  We're explorers.
*  Why is that depressing to you that the idea that, let's just say you found out right now that
*  there isn't anything else. Let's just say that for example sake, that the earth is the earth
*  and the universe is the universe and it's sort of like the backdrop of a video game.
*  And it's just what's out there. Would that be tremendously depressing to you?
*  I think it's exciting for an engineer. It's probably exciting for an explorer,
*  but I would equate that to your going out hiking for three days with one match.
*  It kind of terrifies me that we only got one match.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. All you got is one match. This, no, no, no, hold on a second. Hold on a second.
*  Wait.
*  Paul, wait, wait a minute. You're going out. There's no more matches.
*  This is the only match you got.
*  No one's going to extinguish the planet. Like there's not, as far as we know, there's no
*  meteor coming. I'm saying like, do you live in a, so I'm saying is that, is your worry then that
*  we need to have a backup plan? Really? So like what if we do mess it up so bad that we can't
*  live here anymore?
*  Well, there's different ways to mess it up. There's ways to mess it up to make life really
*  difficult. Mad Max type of thing.
*  But there's nuclear war with further and further advancement of technology that can
*  destroy all of earth. It just feels like that's going to be exponentially growing.
*  Yes. It's going to get worse.
*  Listen, I'm very optimistic, but it's a heck of a Russian roulette we're playing.
*  Okay. So I'm still curious about your intention though, or like where your passion for this comes
*  from. Are you, is your, or maybe it's both, but is it the need to have a backup plan
*  for humans, which is admirable for your intense love of humanity and our consciousness and love
*  and art and everything, or is it also just that the raw fascination of imagining what's out there?
*  Because I just, the way you said that about like, oh, you caught me on a positive day where I think
*  it's, there was something in there that made me think that you need there to be.
*  Yeah. Yeah. There's,
*  I think I'm the kind of person that sees beauty and everything, but to me, a universe full of
*  diverse life is more beautiful than one where it's just humans. It's just the earth life.
*  Interesting. There's more beauty. I mean, I'm not egotistical about the awesomeness of humans. I
*  like if humans are not the smartest in our galaxy, or not even close to being the smartest.
*  And that to me is, I don't know that that to me is exciting about the possibility of what
*  the universe can create. Yes. I'm with you on that. That it's wildly exciting to, like if we found,
*  even if it was just a distant inkling that we found out that there is a planet that has
*  life, there's no, there's no communication coming from it, but we know for a fact that there's stuff
*  going on there. It would just change how we think about our entire reality. We know now.
*  And it could be, to me, I guess the little inkling of a thing that is depressing, if all there is is
*  earth and humans destroy it, then we're the coolest thing that the universe has ever created.
*  And it's over. I'm interested to have this conversation. I'm really, I'm saying like,
*  I would be interested to bring you to the jungle. Yeah. And this, like now I'm also wondering,
*  I'm wondering like what your wilderness experience is. Cause I feel like for me,
*  I'm so earth centric to the point where I'm like, we differ in that for me, this is like,
*  it's a curiosity. I feel wonder and I feel it's fun to talk about like what's at the edge of space.
*  Like, you know, there's the conundrums of space time. And, but I'm so, to me, I'm like,
*  what if the aliens are watching us or what if the aliens aren't watching us, but what if the
*  challenge here is we've been put on earth as the most intellectually complex of these creatures
*  and we're being observed to see how we manage it. And it's like, we haven't made a good job
*  of managing each other before Oriana went down the, the Amazon. I mean, they showed up and just
*  sacked the Incas. I mean, we, our history, I mean, I don't have to tell you, you just got back, but
*  it's, I just, sometimes I wonder, you know, what, what the, is, is there a grand narrative with,
*  with what we're doing to wildlife? Cause it's like, we have all these other species and we're,
*  we're struggling even here in this conversation to sort of quantify, like,
*  you know, I think that most people don't think outside of the human framework.
*  You know what I mean? Like just driving around for me, living outside of the jungle,
*  even just for a few weeks, I get, you don't, you don't, you don't even think about the fact
*  that there's other species around us. We really don't day to day. You look at TV and you look at,
*  really listen to the radio and it doesn't, it's not very consequential to the average person living
*  in a city that there are these, you know, islands covered in walruses and that there's rainforests
*  filled with birds and frogs and all these things happening and that, you know, the salmon are
*  contributing to our fresh water and, and that, that life is literally given to us and made possible
*  by these ecological systems. To me, that's where like the whole, you know, essence of my existence
*  comes from. And so like. Yeah. Thank you for that reminder, because you're basically saying like,
*  the alien civilizations you dream about are here on earth. Those, those, those worlds are here.
*  For me. Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree with you. I think I, I agree with you. And I think that's actually the
*  way I, uh, think most of the time, the, you know, I, I think I'm on mushrooms all the time,
*  genetically somehow, because when I go out in nature is just the beauty, even of nothing,
*  you talk about the Amazon, man, just basics of nature. Yeah. Fill you fill me with awe.
*  The other thing that fills me with awe is our own mind, like the, the biology of these things
*  firing basically not our own mind, but biology of any living organisms. Cause it's like an ecosystem.
*  They've came, these cells came together, they somehow function. They'll, they delegate,
*  they mostly operate in a local way, but they, uh, first of all, it's just like you said with the
*  Anacondas, you start out as a tiny snake and you become giant when you're a tiny snake,
*  you're, you're prey for everything. When you're a giant snake, you're a predator or
*  you're prey to no one. And like just that whole process, same starting with a single embryo,
*  single cells, human and through the embryogenic process constructing this giant human that's able
*  to have limbs move about the world, think about things, write books and so on. Just that that is
*  incredibly beautiful. And all of that is here on earth. Yes. Um, and so actually I was being sort
*  of poetic about aliens and so on. I think I can spend 99.99% in terms of filling my mind with awe
*  and beauty, just looking down here on earth for sure. I agree with you.
*  Yeah. And I'm, and they shouldn't cancel out. Like I think it's beautiful that there's,
*  that there's people that are fascinated and obsessed with looking out into space
*  and that will travel there. Um, I mean, just to me, the idea of, I mean, I have a little piece
*  of meteorite at home that I hold and it does amazing things to my mind because I'm like,
*  everything I've ever touched is from this earth and I'm holding this thing. That's been places
*  that we can't even think about. And it blows my mind and I love it. But, but when it comes to like
*  intelligence, I think it's like, I'm so concerned with the fact that we're at this moment in history
*  and it's interesting to me that, you know, we had the internet and now that with the emergence of AI
*  and more and more, I feel like we are starting to resemble like an ant colony where there's more
*  and more connection and there's more and more interaction globally between everybody. In the
*  next 10 years, we're going to have to decide, are we going to let our ocean ecosystems just collapse?
*  Are we going to just take that 3% of rainforest and just let them log the shit out of it until
*  it's gone? And it's like, we're going to be in a very different reality then, then it's going to be
*  very dystopian future. Or can we keep the good things about earth, transcend that, realize that
*  we have these incredible alien species around us that are animals that we grew up with, that we
*  wouldn't be here without, that we owe something to. And I feel like at that stage, then the, the,
*  the outward look becomes something else. It's almost like we've, we've proven that if aliens
*  came up to us, that's when I'd feel good. Aliens would come up to us and they said, you know,
*  Louis has the thing where he goes, God comes back and he goes, what did you do? He goes,
*  the polar bears are brown. He's like, I left food for you. It's like, if the aliens came and were
*  like, you know, and they interviewed the elephants and they said, how are you feeling? And the
*  elephants would be like, listen, fuck these little primates. You know what they've done to us? And
*  it's like, I mean, you know, I've seen people break an elephant. I've seen, I've seen, I've seen it
*  all with that stuff. And it's like, if, if, if anybody was to ask them, they'd be screaming.
*  And, and so like, to me, it's just, you know, I have trouble, trouble looking out into space.
*  I have trouble looking out into normal life as a human because I'm so concerned with trying to
*  make sure that they're okay, because not enough people are doing that. Oh, the interesting thing
*  about all the development with AI and just that we're living more and more of our life online,
*  I think we're actually learning what's missing when it's online. Like, I think people realize that
*  online interaction is shallow, but we're just learning that, that that's a reality,
*  that we need that human connection. And I think there's going to be the swing back to like, sadly
*  AI systems of the future might be able to live fulfilling lives online, but us humans have,
*  have to have a deep connection with earth and like with each other, physical connection. I think
*  there's going to be a phase somewhere in the century where we go back to deep physical connection
*  and there'll be a digital world that we visit, that it would be separate. And that's the, you have
*  discussion with that with Twitter, with Instagram, with all these social networks
*  that they don't, they seem to be dividing us. They seem to not be bringing happiness and you
*  have to try to figure out like, okay, so how do we use them in a way that does connect us, does
*  educate us, grow our knowledge base, but also keeps us keeps our lives fulfilling in a deep human way
*  that we're for good and for bad genetically designed. We can't overcome, but we can't escape
*  these meat vehicles. Yeah, but that's to me, that's so reassuring. Yeah. It's like when you
*  would like, I have, you know, we all have those friends that are like, you know, we gotta live
*  forever. And it's like, I don't know, man, do you? Yeah. I don't know. Is it that bad that this is
*  how it works? Like that we don't understand it. Um, yeah, the, that's, it's often from the tech
*  sector that you have discussions about immortality and so on. I think that's somehow trying to escape
*  the, the beauty of this earth for sure. That, that there's something to look at,
*  yeah. And I, I, I, perhaps like you, I'm worried about the, uh, unintended negative consequences
*  of trying to escape the way things are on this earth, because this is an incredible mechanism.
*  How many times in the past has new technology come out that people have hailed as, you know,
*  blasphemy or it's not going to work or it's, it goes against nature and, and now, well,
*  heart transplants are pretty cool. Yeah. You know, and, and you could say what you want about like
*  television and like, oh, it's, you know, it rots your brain. It's like, yeah, but also how many
*  times have you sat in a room full of people being entertained and all laughing and interacting and
*  eating popcorn because of the televisions there? It's not, it's not one or the other. And so I feel
*  like with AI we'll, we'll, we'll learn, we'll learn our way through it. You know, there's a,
*  like with the, with the legged robots, especially and humanoid also, so anything on legs, four legs
*  or two legs. I remember like the first time I interact, interacted with a legged robot,
*  I saw a magic there, like
*  that this too can have consciousness. This too can have this lifelike quality
*  that a human being loves about other human beings, about other living creatures. Now,
*  while I'm still, I grew up in a place with no internet in a time with no internet.
*  So I still like biological dogs better. I noticed the magic in robotic dogs.
*  And it makes me wonder the way, same way we're just talking about aliens looking up. It makes
*  you wonder about other alien civilizations. Now the deep love is for dogs, for other humans,
*  but there's still this wonder. I struggle with that. Like you said, the, the, whatever's going
*  on in here, the idea, and there's so much talk about the fact, like at what point does
*  an artificially intelligent robot become something that has, and it's like, I get,
*  I get very uncomfortable with that. It makes me, I don't know how to, how to handle the things.
*  Cause I don't know enough about it probably, but it's like, I don't know how to handle like,
*  I don't know how to handle it either. Nobody knows anything about it because the, it's really,
*  everything is terrifying here. Cause it could be as simple as consciousness is easy to fake.
*  So what if you live in a, in a world 10 to 20 years from now where
*  your toaster, there's a bunch of robots in your room that are faking consciousness,
*  and then you fall in love with them and you have a deep connection with them. And then you actually
*  have a deeper connection with your toaster than you do with any romantic human partner you've
*  ever had. And you start to, I was, I was upset about the dogs. It's like, at least the robot
*  doesn't take a shit on the floor. I was like, you just, you just took it way worse. Yeah. Yeah. And
*  then, you know, and then they, they start to, I don't know if you've seen AI porn, but it gets
*  pretty intense. Like fully AI porn. Like they're, they're fake people.
*  Fake people that can, uh, things I've missed in the jungle.
*  Boy, do I have a lot to show you or not, not show you, not show you. Let me ask you about a touchy
*  topic. Uh-oh. Climate change. Oh boy. What's the effect of climate change on the, uh, on the Amazon?
*  Maybe species diversity. What, what, what is something that people should, should think about?
*  Because there's different views on, um, I think most people believe that climate change is human
*  caused and that it's happening, but there is different perspectives on the degree of damage
*  that it's going to do over the next several decades and what our response should be as a
*  society. And so it would be amazing to hear your perspective on it in, in, in small slices of your
*  experience or in large. To me, there's no denying the fact that we are experiencing changes. I think
*  anybody that, that doesn't agree with that hasn't been outside in the last 20 years or has an
*  interviewed old farmers who will tell you that it changed or, you know, it's that I think a lot of
*  us can agree with that. Where I deviate is that I am not a climate scientist. I am, I am not qualified.
*  And so I just like everybody else I'm listening. And what happens to me is I see that the,
*  someone like Santiago Duran, JJ's father will, will tell me it's totally different than it was
*  when I was a kid. The seasons have changed and moved and like in New York, when I was a kid,
*  like we used to get like white Christmas, like we used to get snow. We don't, I was in shorts,
*  like I came off the plane right before coming here and I was in like shorts for a second. Like I was
*  like, this is a different reality, but my ability could my, or my, my interpretation of climate
*  change, you know, I feel like it's just as dumb as those people that go like, you know,
*  it's really cold. I thought they said it was getting warmer. It's like, it's,
*  it's a very rudimentary thing. And so as a, as a, someone that's fighting for the preservation
*  of biodiversity, I, I, I don't feel like I'm any more qualified than the average person to,
*  I can only provide anecdotal anecdotal evidence of the stuff I've seen. What I, what I do do though,
*  and I always, I always make a strong delineation here is that I can speak to the fact that I've
*  been places where the ocean fisheries have been depleted and the local fishermen can tell you,
*  and the scientists can tell you there's no more fish here. I've been to the places where the
*  rainforest line is being pushed back in Borneo and it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller.
*  And I've been in the Amazon and I've walked through the killing fields and through the fires and I've
*  burnt my lungs on it. And, and I'm a big believer personally, and instead of trying to take on all
*  of it, I've tried very hard in my life to pick one thing. And to me, that one thing is protecting
*  as many wild heartbeats as I can because they're under constant fire. And so climate change, you
*  know, there's so much arguing over it. And like you said, the degree to which we, we affect it and,
*  and, and how do you, you know what I mean? Like I like to have provable data points. Like,
*  you know, I can show you tropical deforestation. I can show you the decline in tigers over the
*  last hundred years. I can't prove, you know what I mean? Like I can't answer that question. I don't
*  think probably you can better than I can. No, I think one of the criticism I'd love to get
*  your opinion on is one of the criticisms that somebody like Jordan Peterson provides is that
*  the climate is such a complex system. There's so many variables that making conclusive statements
*  about what's going to happen with the quote unquote climate in the next 10, 20, 50 years is
*  nearly impossible task. Therefore, as he would say, as people like Bjorn Lombard would say,
*  the kind of fear mongering that is done saying we should spend humongous amounts of money to
*  change the trajectory of everything we're doing in terms of energy, in terms of infrastructure
*  and so on, in terms of how we allocate money is not justified because predicting is very difficult.
*  And instead it's better exactly what you're saying, which is focusing on local problems,
*  local saying we need to protect the Amazon. What are the things attacking the Amazon this year
*  in the next five years? How can we stop the deforestation? How can we stop different things?
*  And humans are exceptionally good at coming up with solutions for that, especially when you
*  put money behind it, you put attention to it, and that's the way we solve all the different
*  problems that are projected for the climate change in its worst case scenarios to be realized on this
*  earth. So that's kind of the case he would make. And I should also mention that one of the reasons
*  I was fortunate enough to discover your work is first a friend mentioned that I should definitely
*  talk to you, and then I Googled you and I saw that somebody recommended that Jordan Peterson
*  absolutely must talk to you on his podcast. I think it was like a Reddit post.
*  Thank you Reddit poster. That's great.
*  I was like, oh, interesting. And then I looked and Jordan hasn't yet. I thought my goal is for you to
*  talk to Rogan and to Jordan Peterson for different reasons, but for the same reason, they get
*  connected to a human being that deeply cares about this earth. And I think that's probably
*  the right lens through which to look at the effects of climate change in terms of focusing
*  on the different things that are threatening the diversity of species in this most magical place
*  on earth, which is the Amazon, but also as you talk about with elephants and tigers in India
*  and focusing on how to solve those problems. I don't know if there's any comment you want to
*  make on folks like Jordan Peterson who are sort of raising questions about how much do we really
*  understand about the climate? First of all, I'm such a Jordan Peterson fan, and I think the guy
*  is heroic for a number of reasons. And I find his use of language and his use of theology and the
*  message that he puts out wonderful. I cringe a little bit when he says, I feel like, and I might
*  not even be accurate on this, but I cringe a little bit when I feel like he dismisses that there
*  is an ecological emergency happening right now. Now, I'm not talking about climate change
*  specifically, but I've heard him say, environmentalists upset me. And he goes, well,
*  what do you mean by the environment? Everything. And it sort of seems to outrage him. And I kind
*  of agree with him there because, so are you telling me that we need to halt our global process and
*  and progress and economies and everything? I don't know. I don't know. And so, to me,
*  that doesn't bother me because he's exploring what the hell are these people talking about.
*  When you say, I personally have friends and students and people filling my inboxes. I have
*  young kids telling me that they've become vegan and they ride a bicycle. And sometimes they don't
*  watch TV because it uses electricity. And they're just becoming so terrified that they're
*  killing the earth. And so, it's this doomsday anti-human sentimentist thing that we're evil.
*  It's almost like a new religion about your evil. And so, to me, it almost makes me in a totally
*  different camp where climate change and the right left politics, and I considered a family,
*  I considered Thanksgiving dinner and listened to the climate thing go back and forth.
*  And I'm like, I'm not even here. And that might actually annoy some people
*  in the environmental field that might feel betrayed by me saying that, but I don't care.
*  My job, and it's not just the Amazon. And that's one note I wanted to make is that
*  my career has taken place largely in the Amazon and also in India and now a lot in Africa.
*  But it's not even just these exotic places either. It's people realizing that the salmon runs
*  in Canada and the butterfly gardens in our backyards, that there's biodiversity everywhere.
*  And I strongly feel like the idea of jungle keepers, the idea of stewards of nature. And so,
*  for me, my job, my one thing, and I try to tell this to these kids that message me and that my
*  my inboxes are full of this where they go, the climate is burning and elephants are in decline
*  and tigers and this and that. Guys, look, first of all, calm down. First of all, go outside,
*  go get laid, do something, have fun. Next, pick something that you can affect. And it doesn't
*  have to be with the environment. Do something good on earth. Go help somebody that needs food.
*  Go help your elderly neighbor, whatever it is. Practice with being effective at one thing,
*  at a time. And so, for me, like I said, from those early days of sitting there with JJ on the side
*  of a river and going, someone has to protect this. My concern is that we've lost 70% of the
*  wildlife on this planet in the last 50 years. That's a huge problem. Wildlife maintain the
*  ecosystems. And so, I have a very clear cut, very definable, very measurable, improvable thing that
*  I'm fighting against. And to me, it's a very small ask. Don't cut down the 3% of the world that has
*  50% of the biodiversity in it. Maybe let's keep some wild tigers for future generations. And
*  because tigers have their own inherent right to exist here. That's my thing. In terms of when we
*  get to, I get attacked for, you should be a vegan. Okay. You have me roll into a village in the
*  Amazon when they offer me Spider Monkey and you tell me that I should be a vegan. You see how much
*  they respect you and you tell them that you're a vegan. But no, so for someone like Peterson,
*  I think it's actually good that he's, first of all, telling everyone to make their damn beds
*  and exploring it through a different lens. He's coming at it from a totally different
*  thing and saying, are we just being alarmists here? Are we, I mean, again, imagine if, imagine
*  if there isn't a problem and they're making one out of it and all the implications that that could
*  have for progress. So I think what he's doing is perfectly reasonable. There is a podcast though
*  where he's, it was a great one though, where he's discussing animal intelligence. And I could really
*  see that the human psyche and theology and religion is so much his world that really the idea of
*  animals being intelligent was novel and it was fascinating. Yeah, that's why I would love for
*  the two of you to talk. Just, I don't know, and hopefully I'm not on a line here, but he is so
*  focused on the human mind that I think he forgets that there's other life out there. There's this
*  whole machine of intelligence, of a kind of intelligence out there,
*  this entire trillions of species, tiny and big, just, just moving everywhere. And we're actually
*  part of it. So like to look at it, at human psychology is distinct from that, is missing
*  at least some of the picture. Some of the picture. I do believe though, I would agree with him on that
*  humans are unique. Human psychology is unique. We just are. But I also, he's in such an interesting
*  place because usually you have environmentalists who are like nature, nature, nature, and then
*  it's very anti-human. And then you have the other side and it's like he's on this path where he's
*  starting to explore what those diverse intelligences mean. And that to me is really amazing because I
*  love hearing what he'll do with that. And I think also on top of that, I think if you're aware of
*  nature, deeply aware of nature, it gives you another perspective on the evolutionary history
*  of humans. It's one thing to be an evolutionary biologist and kind of study it from a like
*  philosophical perspective and it's the other to really, I think, experience it and deeply know it
*  to see, I don't know, to the fact that we came from fish and really be cognizant of that. That's
*  something else. That's like, I don't know, to realize that we're part of a computing machine
*  that created intelligence. We're part of the thing that started bacteria and is now
*  creating AI and I don't know, Dunkin' Donuts. I don't know what else is impressive.
*  The other great human achievement.
*  The other great human. I was thinking, well, what's interesting about Boston?
*  But I feel like we keep scratching up against this thing in this conversation that
*  it's so easy. I think something like 50 or more percent of the humans on this planet live in cities
*  and I think it's so easy for people to forget that we share this planet with so many other
*  things. And I think that that sort of, that we're in a way, we're almost like ecological
*  orphans and that we've left the things that actually make us feel at home. And that's a bit
*  of a stretch because I don't know if everybody feels that way. But for me, professionally as an
*  expedition guide, when I take people into nature, I see what happens to them and they leave going,
*  I mean, it doesn't have to be the Amazon. It could be upstate New York, but it's like,
*  if you do it the right way, if you remove the fear of breaking an ankle, seeing a snake,
*  being bitten by a mosquito, all that stuff, if you can get people to a peaceful moment
*  and you're fly fishing, a lot of times they'll take that moment and they'll talk about it the
*  rest of their life. If they don't live in that, then there's those of us who spend our lives
*  doing that, but for a reason, because it's the only place we feel sane.
*  And you were kind enough to suggest that we might travel together for a time at some point.
*  If we do that, if we journey together, where would you recommend we should go?
*  So, what I would want to show you is sort of, I'd want to take you to church. I'd want to take you
*  to see the giant trees, take you to meet the old gods, really. There's places when you walk in
*  off the river that are so deep in the forest, and again, now we do this, we have the boats,
*  we have the rangers, we protect this ecological corridor now. And so, it would be taking you to
*  meet some of those loggers that we converted. It'd be taking you, we'd have to go to the
*  floating forest, meet some of the trees that I love the most, go piranha fishing and really just
*  spend, my ideal trip for you would be to spend five days of airplane mode phone,
*  completely living out, comfortable. I'm not saying I don't want to torture you, I'm saying
*  go and live comfortably on an expedition in the Amazon. And that means a few days at this
*  research station, maybe go up river three days and camp up here just on the edge of where the
*  uncontacted are, and then come back and then see the jungle keeper station. But along the way,
*  seeing all the special sacred places, it would be almost like saying, let's go see
*  all the treasures of Italy. It's like, this is one of the most beautiful things on earth,
*  and I've had the incredible, almost unbelievable fortune to be responsible for protecting it.
*  I think it's a privilege to be able to share that with people.
*  RG To be able to witness what this earth has created. It's been just a gift just even to
*  follow your Instagram. The window you create on this part of the world
*  is just really beautiful. I do want to ask on that,
*  maybe it's like behind the scenes a little bit, but how do you keep the equipment dry?
*  How hard is bringing equipment to the cameras? You're an incredible filmmaker and photographer,
*  so how do you make it work? I don't know. It's not that hard.
*  It's not that bad. It is wet. The new iPhones are waterproof.
*  I'm telling you, dude, it's been such a weapon. It's been awesome.
*  If you drop it in the river, my one thing is you got to have a tether because I drop it all the
*  time. I'll be hanging off a boat, I'll be trying to take a video and I'll be like, here we are in
*  the Amazon. You can see the line. That's the biggest thing. We shoot on cannons.
*  I don't know. It's worked out. It's not that bad. Really? You can keep the equipment dry.
*  I keep the equipment dry and I actually don't. A lot of people put their shit in silica at night
*  and keep it dry and then they take it out. I find that when you do that, the temperature change
*  creates moisture inside the camera. What I do is I never do that. I just keep my cameras in my
*  backpack with a zipper so they're more or less exposed to the elements. It always has a little
*  bit of equilibrium and that's it. I shoot on some pretty fancy equipment sometimes and it's great.
*  But the awesome thing though now is that with a cell phone, I put my phone down on the ground a
*  few weeks ago and let this rhino walk up to it and stuff. You can get video footage that you can
*  literally put on Netflix. It's getting really exciting and that's where I deviate from the
*  nature people. They're like, we need to go back and live in cabins. I'm like, dude, this is awesome
*  and I love taking slo-mos. No way. It makes you reappreciate, but just by yourself,
*  just reappreciate over and over and over and then you can also share it with the world.
*  That's the thing is sharing it with people. There's nothing better than teaching a kid to
*  catch a fish. In a way, Instagram has allowed us to do that where it's like, I can have this crazy-ass
*  moment that is so unique and then put it up for people to see. I remember one of the most recent
*  things that got people, you never know what's going to get people excited. I literally just like,
*  there was like 3000 butterflies on the beach and they were like black, red and blue. Beautiful
*  butterflies and I just panned the phone across it and then jumped in the river and swam away
*  and threw that up on Instagram and people went berserk. They're like, this is the most amazing
*  thing. Four different accounts reached out to try and share it and I was like, butterflies.
*  They're everywhere. There's 4000 species of butterfly in the Amazon, but sharing that with
*  people is beautiful. How do you find the thing to shoot? How do you come up with the butterflies?
*  How do you notice the thing that's beautiful and say, I'm going to, wait a minute, pause. This is
*  beautiful. Let me take a picture of this because sometimes you might get used to the beauty, right?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Or sometimes simple, crazy things like leaf cutter ants. They're just walking by.
*  It becomes pedestrian. It's like, well, I mean, just like when you're living at the elephant camp
*  and it's like the elephant comes out and he starts like trashing the water bucket. We're all like,
*  we just stop. We're trying to watch Peaky Blinders here. Just leave us alone. It becomes normal after
*  a while. But no, in the jungle, that's never a struggle for me because as a photographer,
*  whenever my eye hits on something, I've never seen that many of those butterflies, all the same
*  species together. I'm trying to get this one thing that the butterflies do is in the dry season,
*  the salt deposits, you'll get like three or four, maybe 5000 butterflies all coming onto this one
*  area of sand because there'll be like some leaching. There'll be some salt deposit there
*  or something. And they'll all be wings flat against the ground with their perboscis on the sand.
*  And if you go walk near them, they will vortex up and you have a rainbow vortex of butterflies
*  and you can like go run through that. And it's surreal. And I want to, what I want to do is get
*  the shot where I, I guess leave the phone recording in slow-mo facing up and leave it there for an hour.
*  Let the butterflies come in and settle and then disturb them. So I get the bottom of the vortex of
*  the bug. I'm like, these are the ways I think where I'm like, how can I show people the absolute
*  mind blowing, you know, with an eye perfection? I mean, that's what I have, you know, I'm sure
*  that somebody else could do it with, you know, a red and, and, and nail it, but it's like, that's
*  what I have in the jungle because I have to travel light. And I, you know, yeah, I think that, that,
*  that really, that works. I have the same thing when I was traveling in Ukraine. The, the equipment
*  was just the suit is that suitcase over there with the foam and you just shove it full of equipment
*  and do the best you can. You can go to war zone. It doesn't matter. It doesn't like, uh, I, it has
*  to do with the, you were talking about like with the, like protecting your camera or not. It feels
*  like the more you protect stuff, the more it's going to get damaged. Yeah. Like, so like, see,
*  like my cameras, they're all missing. This is like, this is amazing to me. So all my cameras are
*  missing the, they all, how you can see the metal through the paint. So all this, and so like,
*  they're all because I'm constantly like, I'll like slide in and like take a picture and like
*  they're banged up, but these, they're good. They're good machines. I think they get tough
*  over time. If you put them through, it's like the immune system, it's like muscles. It's like
*  David Goggins cameras. If you got it, you got to make them suffer every day.
*  Yeah. What's your view on hunting? Um, so you really hate poachers. I really hate poachers.
*  How do they operate? Who are they? What are they up to? What do they do?
*  Poachers to me are the people that are going in and annihilating wildlife for profit without any,
*  you know, the people that are going in and, and, and machine gunning an elephant to take its tusks.
*  The people that are sneaking into protected areas in Africa and shooting rhinos so that they can
*  cut off their horns before the animal's even dead while its baby is beside it. So, and, and, and
*  there's a difference between a poacher and a hunter. I'm a hunter. JJ is a hunter. I work with an
*  organization called vet paw in Africa and they use United States veterans who have come back,
*  post 9 11 veterans who have come back from the war and have these skills. And they've been using
*  these guys to protect the last black rhinos, white rhinos, elephants. And so we've, I've gotten to
*  see this play out on a private reserve in Africa where these incredible people have decided to
*  protect zebras, wildebeests, all types of Impala, giraffes, several herds of elephants, white rhinos,
*  black rhinos, all of this stuff is protected. And what's interesting is it's a hunting preserve.
*  And so it's been very interesting and challenging sharing my work there with the public because
*  for instance, I went to a very high profile photographer recently and I said, you have to
*  get over here and see this. It's, it's amazing what these people have done. It's this, this reserve
*  called Buffalo Clouffe and they've, you know, this, this rescued families of elephants and they have,
*  you can see a black rhino every day if you want to. This is, this is all, they're critically
*  endangered. And it's because of the work that vet pod does protecting these animals from poachers.
*  But what people don't understand is that hunting happens all the time on the reserve,
*  not for the elephants and the rhinos. Those are, those are special and they will never be hunted
*  there. But things like an Impala, things like an Inala, a wildebeest, a zebra, there aren't as many
*  predators as there used to be. So if you leave those animals unhunted, you know, without the wolf
*  to chase the herd, to thin off the ones that are old and dying or sick, well, then you just have
*  animals that are old and dying and sick walking around suffering. And so on reserves like this,
*  they hunt and they take the old ones and they use the funding from hunting. No one's going to pay
*  you $30,000 to take a picture of a buffalo, but they'll pay you $30,000 to hunt a buffalo.
*  And so these reserves responsibly and ethically on foot can go hunting and manage. And again,
*  if they were hunting rhinos or if they're hunting elephants, I'd be out in a second.
*  They're hunting non endangered species.
*  They're hunting non endangered species, they're hunting game species. And the difference is that
*  a poacher is going to, those are responsible hunters that are ecologists and conservationists.
*  Whereas a poacher is someone that will come in and kill recklessly
*  and murder an animal for no reason for a part to sell.
*  I would love to travel together actually. So let's, we'll talk offline. I would love to make that
*  happen if you allow me. I'm 100% serious, man. I have tremendous respect for your work and I've
*  been watching you since the beginning. I would love to do that together.
*  I've been, I've talked to Joe quite a bit about it. I really
*  love the idea of eating the meat that I've hunted. It's mostly what I eat is meat,
*  not for dietary. I don't have any weird constraints on my diet and so on. I just really enjoy eating
*  meat. And there is a part of me that's bothered by factory farming. Yes, sure. That
*  it's very easily accessible meat, but there's something deeply wrong with it.
*  Part of the reason I love fishing and eating the fish that I catch, it just seems to be
*  more ethical, but also a more intimate, deep connection, honest connection with nature.
*  You get to see the killing of the food that you're consuming versus removing that from the picture,
*  not even thinking about it, not thinking about that this came from the meat. I love the idea
*  that I kill one animal and I eat that animal basically for the whole year.
*  Yeah, an ethically slaughtered animal, whether it's a fish or a deer or whatever else.
*  To me, that's, oh God, I'm going to use the wrong religious term here, but there's a, I feel like I
*  want to use the word sacrament, but it's like there's a deeply profound ritual. And honestly,
*  if you teach a kid to grow a vegetable, you show a kid how to grow a carrot and the miracle of,
*  wait, I put a, this thing just grew in there, it just appeared because there was sunlight.
*  And it's like, yeah. To me, yes, when you feel that fish tug on the line, to me, it does something
*  that awakens a deep primal something, this satisfaction. And then when you eat that,
*  you feel good. And so I think the other thing, functionally speaking is that aside from the
*  fact that I think it's one of the original, we were so disconnected, we should be hunting,
*  we should be gathering, walking more. I mean, look at what we discussed now. People are like,
*  oh, you got to get your steps in for the day. And it's like, that never used to be a problem.
*  People are like, well, should we be eating animals? And it's like, what do you think
*  we do here on earth? I'm not sure how you got so confused, but Walmart did it to you. I don't know.
*  Living where I've lived, from 18 to 35, I feel like I've grown up, I've lived more outside than
*  I have inside. And it's just to me, showing people these things, I can see this miraculous
*  wonder in their eyes when they realize that they can reach out into the world and interact with
*  something. And so when I hear these frantic people talking about whether or not it's right,
*  it's like, no, of course it is. Then again, factory farming is awful, but I try to stay,
*  I try and walk the line. I'm worried about wild animals. I'm worried about wild ecosystems.
*  The other thing that's sort of important about hunting is that if people's livelihoods depend
*  on salmon and elk and ocean fisheries, well, then they'll fight to protect it naturally,
*  because it's part of their life. And if everybody's going to Burger King and everybody's getting
*  chicken wrapped in plastic, they forget that the fish are there because they're too busy watching
*  sitcoms. And so then when the conglomerate comes in and builds a dam, nobody really cares. And then
*  you just end up with a few hippies and signs standing next to the river and it becomes silly.
*  We forget the meaning. You mentioned that
*  ayahuasca reveals the darkness that's there in the jungle. There's beauty, but there's darkness.
*  So what is it that ayahuasca reveals? What is the heart of darkness?
*  Fuck it opens the heart of darkness right up. I'm going to show you a picture of our shaman,
*  and then I'm going to ask if you want to do ayahuasca here, not here in that sense. It can
*  only be done in the jungle. Anybody that tells you, I've heard people be like, oh, I did ayahuasca
*  in Brooklyn last week. And I'm like, no, you didn't. I actually told that to my native friends. I went,
*  hey, guess what? I said, a bunch of gringos keep thinking they're doing ayahuasca in Brooklyn. And
*  they were like howling laughing. They're like, you can't do it outside the jungle. And I was like,
*  exactly. I've never done ayahuasca. I've done or eaten whatever mushrooms. It's a wonderful
*  experience. I think it's wonderful. But ayahuasca, oh man. Yeah. See, I had done mushrooms. I thought
*  I was like, okay. Yeah. I was like, I got this. I had my notebook. I was like, I'm going to journal
*  a little bit. But I quickly, quickly realized how out of my depth I was and how unprepared I was
*  for what was happening. Because you sit in a circle with these native guys and there's one,
*  he's got the feathers and he's old and he's got a face like the map of the world. And he's
*  smoking this fat old tobacco thing. And he calls you forward and you kneel before him and you're
*  going, is it too late to back up? And everyone's, you know, there's one candle and he blows smoke
*  over the cup and he hands it to you. And you're like, again, it's these things that you can't
*  argue with. It's these facts. So you're like, as soon as this goes down, I'm gone. I know it. And
*  this is a moment in my life that I have to either embarrass myself in front of everybody or I'm
*  going forward with this and then I went and sat and you're sitting in the dark and it's again,
*  so we're on a platform with a palm thatched roof and the jungle is all around you. So all those
*  tens of millions of frogs and insects are, and I'm like, all right, cool. And I remember I like,
*  you know, like I tried to like light a cigarette or something and I went,
*  oh, that's not going to happen. You know, and then I, and I, I put my hands on the floor and like,
*  my experience, I mean, like we've done mushrooms, you know, it's like, it's, it's interesting. It's
*  introspective. No, this, this was like somebody unzipped the universe. I, I, you know, I spent a
*  lot of without boring people with it. I spent a lot of time in, in, in like unconstructed dream
*  space, like floating between nebulas. Like there was a long period where there was no physical
*  shape where I lived without a name. And like, so it's like, it's like, you get brought so deep down,
*  so elementally lost in the universe where like, I truly felt like I was experiencing moving through
*  places like, like that, like that, like that asteroid that I have, like it's, it's like a
*  piece of your piece of something detached from the earth. And so I got back from it and
*  had a, had an interesting new appreciation for life. I strongly suggest that people just do
*  mushrooms like a normal person, unless you're, unless you're ready. It was really intense.
*  It was really intense, but to be fair, the shaman who did it was like the old school guy.
*  Yeah. And he was, he was getting up there in years and he had forgotten and overboiled the brew.
*  And so we came back and I was like four in the morning and I had, you know, all this crazy
*  shit. I'd been on journeys and years down there. And so when I came back and I had like hands,
*  I started crying. I started absolutely weeping. Gratitude or what? Gratitude that I was alive. I
*  was going to get to see my people again. I was like, I'm going to have to see my parents again.
*  I'm going to get to talk to humans. So you kind of thought you might've be gone.
*  I was gone. I was gone. I was, I was, I was a dimly conscious something floating in dark space and
*  spent what felt like years down there. And so when I, I really did feel like being reborn,
*  which I was like cheap trick, like, yeah. But no, the, the, the, the way it moves you through
*  the jungle, the way the jungle moves through your skin, there are moments of absolute majesty and
*  incredible discovery that happened along the way. And on the way up, the jungle brings you up and
*  the shaman brings you up and you get to move through the forest in a way that
*  it's almost like you're inhabiting the consciousness of animals. Very, very, very like,
*  I didn't think that hallucinogenics could do this to a brain. You know, mushrooms, you're like, oh,
*  I can, I feel like I can feel music. Like, cool. You know, you guys want to watch March of the
*  Penguins. This is transformative. Like what? Yeah. Did that, did that change you? I don't know. I
*  think it definitely, it definitely, I almost feel like it showed me the thing that I was scared the
*  most of. And it's that, that it was like, that it's all just cold, dark, nothing. It like brought me
*  to like the basement of the universe. And I felt like the point of that was to, to come back to
*  this place where there's all this life and light and love and, and all this amazing stuff that we
*  experience on a day-to-day basis and don't take for granted. And so just like almost dying,
*  this was like fully dying. Like they're, you know, but the great part is, is that usually it's not
*  that intense. This guy had overboiled the brew. He'd also, I saw the vine afterwards. Most ayahuasca
*  vines are like as thick as your arm. This one was like as thick as a garbage can. It was like the
*  oldest ayahuasca vine you can imagine. And at like four in the morning, I like crawled over to my
*  friend, Chris, who's a tough New York city firefighter. And we were like holding each other,
*  just like weeping, just like, thank God we're back. And then we had to go looking for the shaman.
*  Where the hell is this guy? He's gone. We found him in the morning and he was laying in the stream
*  naked, like ET at the end, you know, at the end when he's like laying like in the, yeah, he, he
*  kicked his own ass with that brew and he retired after that. So we really got like, we, somebody
*  turned the dial all the way up on us. And so we got, we got blasted. So it's not supposed to be
*  that bad. But I think you're somebody who's fearless in sort of diving into those kinds of
*  places. I think I also retire from ayahuasca. I could be fearless with other things, but
*  I think I'm good. It sounds kind of, to me personally, kind of exciting.
*  Why I think, I think that you have a severely fearless aspect to you. I mean, you're,
*  when you come up with something that intrigues you, like if somebody told you right now that
*  you could go physically into deep space, I feel like you would do it. Yeah. Yeah. If, if go to
*  Mars. Yeah. Right. And some of it is, I don't even know if you have that. Some of that is more
*  Goggins like, I want to see where my mind breaks by pushing it to tough places. There's a curiosity
*  of exploring the mind, the limits of the mind. I feel like you're- It's not a cold plunge. That's
*  like, you're not coming back. Right. Right. And that's, that's okay.
*  No, I have, I do. I have, I'm with you on that. I love seeing my limits. I absolutely love seeing
*  my limits. I love getting my ass kicked. I love being shown how insignificant I am. But when it
*  comes to something like that, where you got to push your chips in, it's got to be something for
*  me. It's got to be a hill that I believe in before I die on it. And it's like,
*  like to me, the promise of exploring space isn't enough, but like even just the way,
*  I mean, you said, you're like, I'm going to Ukraine. Here I go. You know, there there's a certain
*  dedication to, to curiosity at any expense. And I think that that is something that maybe we share
*  in different directions. Something tells me with those, with those, with those crocodiles outside,
*  I would have gotten eaten. Something tells me there's some, something trying to preserve you
*  in this world. I'm not sure exactly what that is. Somehow you keep surviving. What do you think is
*  the meaning of this whole thing? Why are we here? Like, do you ever ask yourself that question?
*  I feel like that's every day. I feel like I'm someone that lives with that a lot.
*  And I think that, I think that it actually takes me away from the human world a little bit. I feel
*  like I've always been a little bit apart because I think that other people do, you know, mushrooms
*  and they go, wow, it really made me think about how amazing it is here. And I feel like on a daily
*  basis, I find myself where I'm like, I can't believe that any of this is possible. You know,
*  and that goes, that goes from how delicious something tastes to being able to talk to
*  to someone in your family or, or have a phone. There's times where I'm in the Amazon and I,
*  I miss home and I even just FaceTiming with someone. I go, this is possible.
*  Like people were rubbing sticks together trying to survive saber tooth tigers, not that long ago.
*  And I'm over there like, yo, mom, look at this. It's wild. Like I'm in a constant state of all.
*  And so, I actually hope that this is, that this is a testing ground. And whether it's aliens or
*  God or whatever it is, that this is all, that this is, that this is, that this is something
*  crucially important. That would be nice because it feels like it is.
*  Yeah. I hope that too, that the universe almost created us to see
*  what's possible and that I'd like to believe that beauty and good is possible.
*  And those are the things that make me say that it's not,
*  it's impossible for it to just mean nothing. And I'm very, and just like you said, there could be
*  life forms that we can't even understand. I'm very open to the idea that there's meanings that
*  we have no idea about. The few things I know are the things that I love and some of the things that
*  I love are being pushed to extinction. So I try to protect them, but that's my mission. But I'm
*  saying like, in terms of what are we doing here, I'm just always amazed at the simplest things.
*  That we can sit here doing this exchanging. Yeah. Using our imagination to fill in the gaps,
*  exchanging feelings, experiences, images. Yeah. It fills you with awe. And every once in a while,
*  you get a little glimpse of something like a deeper meaning that might be there. You don't,
*  you don't really know what it is, but you get a glimpse every now and then you keep searching.
*  And then it's over before you know it, Paul. Hopefully for you, you got many more years.
*  It was dark, man. You're an important, important and a beautiful man.
*  Paul, thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for being who you are for everything you're
*  doing. I hope to see you again soon, many times and maybe one day soon in the jungle.
*  I hope that happens. Thank you, Lex. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Paul Rosalie.
*  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Jane Goodall.
*  If we kill off the wild, then we're killing off a part of our souls.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
