# Sean Carroll: General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Black Holes & Aliens | Lex Fridman Podcast #428
**Lex Fridman:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdv7r2JSokI)
*  The whole point of relativity is to say there's no such thing as right now when you're far away.
*  And that is doubly true for what's inside a black hole. And you might think, well, the galaxy is
*  very big. It's really not. It's some tens of thousands of light years across and billions
*  of years old. So you don't need to move at a high fraction of the speed of light to fill the galaxy.
*  The number of worlds is very, very, very, very big. Where do those worlds fit?
*  Where do they go? The short answer is the worlds don't exist in space.
*  Space exists separately in each world.
*  The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll, his third time on this podcast. He is a theoretical
*  physicist at John Hopkins, host of the Mindscape podcast that I personally love and highly
*  recommend, and author of many books, including the most recent book series called The Biggest
*  Ideas in the Universe. The first book of which is titled Space, Time, and Motion, and it's on the
*  topic of general relativity. And the second coming out on May 14th, so you should definitely
*  pre-order it, is titled Quantas and Fields, and that one is on the topic of quantum mechanics.
*  Sean is a legit active theoretical physicist and at the same time is one of the greatest
*  communicators of physics ever. I highly encourage you to listen to his podcast, read his books,
*  and pre-order the new book to support his work. This was, as always, a big honor and a pleasure
*  for me. This is Alex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Sean Carroll. In book one of the series, The Biggest Ideas
*  in the Universe, called Space, Time, Motion, you take on classical mechanics, general relativity,
*  by taking on the main equation of general relativity and making it
*  accessible, easy to understand. So maybe at the high level, what is general relativity?
*  What's a good way to start to try to explain it? Probably the best way to start to try to explain
*  it is special relativity, which came first, 1905. It was the culmination, right, of many decades of
*  people putting things together, but it was Einstein in 1905. In fact, it wasn't even Einstein. I'm
*  sure you have more credit to Minkowski in 1907. So Einstein in 1905 figured out that you could get
*  rid of the ether, the idea of a rest frame for the universe, and all the equations of physics would
*  make sense, with the speed of light being a maximum. But then it was Minkowski, who used to be
*  Einstein's professor in 1907, who realized the most elegant way of thinking about this idea of
*  Einstein's was to blend space and time together into space-time, to really imagine that there is
*  no hard and fast division of the four-dimensional world in which we live into space and time
*  separately. Einstein was at first dismissive of this. He thought it was just like, oh, the mathematicians
*  are over-formalizing again. But then he later realized that if space-time is a thing, it can
*  have properties, and in particular, it can have a geometry. It can be curved from place to place.
*  And that was what let him solve the problem of gravity. He had previously been trying to fit in
*  what we knew about gravity from Newtonian mechanics, the inverse square law of gravity,
*  to his new relativistic theory. It didn't work. So the final leap was to say gravity is the curvature
*  of space-time. And that statement is basically general relativity.
*  And the tension with Minkowski was he was a mathematician.
*  Yes.
*  So it's the tension between physics and mathematics. In fact, in your lecture about this equation,
*  one of them, you say that Einstein is a better physicist than he gets credit for.
*  I know that's hard. That's a little bit of a joke there, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Because we all give Einstein a lot of credit. But then we also,
*  partly based on fact, but partly to make ourselves feel better, tell ourselves a story about how
*  later in life Einstein couldn't keep up. There were younger people doing quantum mechanics and
*  quantum field theory and particle physics, and he was just sort of unable to really philosophically
*  get over his objections to that. And I think that that story about the latter part is completely
*  wrong, almost 180 degrees wrong. I think that Einstein understood quantum mechanics as well
*  as anyone, at least up through the 1930s. I think that his philosophical objections to it
*  are correct. So he should actually have been taken much more seriously about that.
*  And what he did, what he achieved in trying to think these problems through is to really
*  basically understand the idea of quantum entanglement, which is kind of important
*  these days when it comes to understanding quantum mechanics. Now, it's true that in the 40s and 50s,
*  he placed his efforts in hopes for unifying electricity and magnetism with gravity that
*  didn't really work out very well. All of us try things that don't work out. I don't hold
*  that against him. But in terms of IQ points, in terms of trying to be a clear thinking physicist,
*  he was really, really great. What does greatness look like for a physicist? So
*  how difficult is it to take the leap from special relativity to general relativity?
*  How difficult is it to imagine that, to consider space-time together and to imagine that
*  there's a curvature to this whole thing? Yeah, that's a great question. I think that if you
*  want to make the case for Einstein's greatness, which is not hard to do, there's two things you
*  point at. One is in 1905, his famous miracle year, he writes three different papers on three
*  wildly different subjects, all of which would make you famous just for writing that one paper.
*  Special relativity is one of them. Brownian motion is another one, which is just the little
*  vibrations of tiny little dust specks in the air. But who cares about that? What matters is
*  it proves the existence of atoms. He explains Brownian motion by imagining their molecules
*  in the air and deriving their properties. Brilliant. And then he basically starts the world
*  on the road to quantum mechanics with his paper on, which again is given a boring label of the
*  photoelectric effect. What it really was is he invented photons. He showed that light should
*  be thought of as particles as well as waves. And he did all three of those very different things
*  in one year. Okay. But the other thing that gets him genius status is like you say,
*  general relativity. So this takes 10 years from 1905 to 1915. He wasn't only doing general
*  relativity. He was working on other things. He wrote, he invented a refrigerator. He did various
*  interesting things. And he wasn't even the only one working on the problem. There were other people
*  who suggested relativistic theories of gravity, but he really applied himself to it. And I think
*  as your question suggests, the solution was not a matter of turning a crank. It was something
*  fundamentally creative. In his own telling of the story, his greatest moment, his happiest moment
*  was when he realized that if the way that we would say it in modern terms, if you were in a rocket
*  ship accelerating at one G, at one acceleration due to gravity, if the rocket ship were very quiet,
*  you wouldn't be able to know the difference between being in a rocket ship and being on
*  the surface of the earth. Gravity is sort of not detectable or at least not distinguishable
*  from acceleration. So number one, that's a pretty clever thing to think. But number two,
*  if you or I had had that thought, we would have gone, huh, we're pretty clever. He reasons from
*  there to say, okay, if gravity is not detectable, then it can't be like an ordinary force, right?
*  The electromagnetic force is detectable. We can put charged particles around, positively charged
*  particles and negatively charged particles respond differently to an electric field or to a magnetic
*  field. He realizes that what his thought experiment showed, or at least suggested, is that gravity
*  isn't like that. Everything responds in the same way to gravity. How could that be the case? And
*  then this other leap he makes is, oh, it's because it's the curvature of space-time, right? It's a
*  feature of space-time. It's not a force on top of it. And the feature that it is, is curvature.
*  And then finally, he says, okay, clearly I'm going to need the mathematical tools necessary
*  to describe curvature. I don't know them, so I will learn them. And they didn't have MOOCs or AI
*  helpers back in those days. He had to sit down and read the math papers and he taught himself
*  differential geometry and invented general relativity. What about the step of including
*  time as just another dimension? So combining space and time, is that a simple mathematical
*  leap as Minkowski suggested? It's certainly not simple, actually. It's a profound insight.
*  That's why I said I think we should give Minkowski more credit than we do. He's the one who really
*  put the finishing touches on special relativity. Again, many people had talked about how things
*  change when you move close to the speed of light, what Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism
*  predict and so forth, what their symmetries are. So people like Lorentz and Fitzgerald and
*  Poincare, there's a story that goes there. And in the usual telling, Einstein sort of puts the
*  capstone on it. He's the one who says all of this makes much more sense if there just is no ether.
*  It is undetectable. We don't know how fast. Everything is relative, thus the name relativity.
*  But he didn't take the actual final step, which was to realize that the underlying structure that
*  he had invented is best thought of as unifying space and time together. I honestly don't know
*  what was going through Minkowski's mind when he thought that. I'm not sure if he was so
*  mathematically adept that it was just clear to him, or he was really struggling it and he did
*  trial and error for a while. I'm not sure. Do you, for him or for Einstein, visualize the
*  four-dimensional space, try to play with the idea of time as just another dimension?
*  Oh yeah, all the time. I mean, we of course make our lives easy by ignoring two of the dimensions
*  of space. So instead of four-dimensional space-time, we just draw pictures of one dimension of space,
*  one dimension of time, the so-called space-time diagram. But maybe this is lurking underneath
*  your question, but even the best physicists will draw a vertical axis and a horizontal axis,
*  and they'll go space, time. But deep down, that's wrong because you're sort of preferring
*  one direction of space and one direction of time, and it's really the whole two-dimensional thing
*  that is space-time. The more legitimate thing to draw on that picture are rays of light,
*  are light cones. From every point, there is a fixed direction at which the speed of light would
*  represent, and that is actually inherent in the structure. The division into space and time
*  is something that's easy for us human beings. What is the difference between space and time
*  from the perspective of general relativity? It's the difference between x and y when you draw
*  axes on a piece of paper. So there's really no difference? There's almost no difference. There's
*  one difference that is kind of important, which is the following. If you have a curve in space,
*  I'm going to draw it horizontally because that's usually what we do in space-time diagrams.
*  If you have a curve in space, you've heard the motto before that the shortest distance between
*  two points is a straight line. If you have a curve in time, which is by the way literally
*  all of our lives, we all evolve in time, so you can start with one event in space-time and
*  another event in space-time, what Minkowski points out is that the time you measure along
*  your trajectory in the universe is precisely analogous to the distance you travel on a curve
*  through space. And by precisely, I mean it is also true that the actual distance you travel through
*  depends on your path, right? You can go a straight line, shortest distance, and a curvy line would be
*  longer. The time you measure in space-time, the literal time it takes off on your clock,
*  also depends on your path, but it depends on it the other way, so that the longest time
*  between two points is a straight line. And if you zig back and forth in space-time,
*  you take less and less time to go from point A to point B.
*  How do we make sense of that? The difference between the observed reality and the
*  objective reality underneath it, or is objective reality a silly notion given general relativity?
*  I'm a huge believer in objective reality. I think that objective reality, objective reality is real.
*  Yeah. But I do think that people are a little overly casual about the relationship between
*  what we observe and objective reality in the following sense. Of course, in order to explain
*  the world, our starting point and our ending point is our observations, our experimental input,
*  the phenomena we experience and see around us in the world. But in between, there's a theory,
*  there's a mathematical formalization of our ideas about what is going on. And if a theory fits the
*  data and is very simple and makes sense in its own terms, then we say that the theory is right.
*  And that means that we should attribute some reality to the entities that play an important
*  role in that theory, at least provisionally until we come up with a better theory down the road.
*  I think a nice way to test the difference between objective reality and the observed reality
*  is what happens at the edge of the horizon of a black hole. So technically,
*  as you get closer to that horizon, time stands still.
*  Yes and no. It depends on exactly how careful we're being. So here's a bunch of things I think are
*  correct. If you imagine there is a black hole space-time, so like the whole solution Einstein's
*  equation, and you treat you and me as what we call test particles. So we don't have any
*  gravitational fields ourselves. We just move around in the gravitational field. That's obviously an
*  approximation, but let's imagine that. And you stand outside the black hole and I fall in.
*  And as I'm falling in, I'm waving to you because I'm going into the black hole, you will see me
*  move more and more slowly. And also the light from me is red shifted. So I kind of look embarrassed
*  because I'm falling into a black hole. And there is a limit. There's a last moment that light will
*  be emitted from me from your perspective forever. Okay. Now you don't literally see it because
*  I'm emitting photons more and more slowly, right? Because from your point of view. So it's not like
*  I'm equally bright. I basically fade from view in that picture. Okay. So that's one approximation.
*  The other approximation is I do have a gravitational field of my own. And therefore,
*  as I approach the black hole, the black hole doesn't just sit there and let me pass through.
*  It kind of moves out to eat me up because its net energy mass is going to be mine plus its.
*  But roughly speaking, yes, I think so. I don't like to go to the dramatic extremes because that's
*  where the approximations break down. But if you see something falling into a black hole,
*  you see its clock ticking more and more slowly. How do we know it fell in? We don't. I mean,
*  how would we? Because it's always possible that right at the last minute, it had a change of heart
*  and starts accelerating away, right? If you don't see it pass in, you don't know. And let's point
*  out that as smart as Einstein was, he never figured out black holes and he could have.
*  It's kind of embarrassing. It took decades for people thinking about general relativity
*  to understand that there are such things as black holes because basically,
*  Einstein comes up with general relativity in 1915. Two years later, Schwarzschild,
*  Carl Schwarzschild derives the solution to Einstein's equation that represents a black
*  hole, the Schwarzschild solution. No one recognized it for what it was until the 50s,
*  David Winklestein and other people. And that's just one of these examples of physicists not
*  being as clever as they should have been. Well, that's the singularity. That's the edge
*  of the theory, the limit. So it's understandable that it's difficult to imagine the limit of things.
*  It is absolutely hard to imagine and a black hole is very different in many ways from what we're
*  used to. On the other hand, the real reason, of course, is that between 1915 and 1955,
*  there's a bunch of other things that are really interesting going on in physics,
*  all particle physics and quantum field theory. So many of the greatest minds were focused on that.
*  But still, if the universe hands you a solution to general relativity in terms of curved space
*  time and its kind of mysterious, certain features of it, I would put some effort in trying to figure
*  it out. So how does a black hole work? Put yourself in the shoes of Einstein and take
*  general relativity to its natural conclusion about these massive things. It's best to think
*  of a black hole as not an object so much as a region of space time. It's a region with the
*  property, at least in classical general relativity, quantum mechanics makes everything harder, but
*  let's imagine we're being classical for the moment. It's a region of space time with the property
*  that if you enter, you can't leave. Literally, the equivalent of escaping a black hole would
*  be moving faster than the speed of light. They're both precisely equally difficult. You would have
*  to move faster than the speed of light to escape from the black hole. So once you're in, that's
*  fine. In principle, you don't even notice when you cross the event horizon, as we call it. The
*  event horizon is that point of no return where once you're inside, you can't leave. But meanwhile,
*  the space time is sort of collapsing around you to ultimately a singularity in your future,
*  which means that the gravitational forces are so strong, they tear your body apart
*  and you will die in a finite amount of time. If the black hole is about the mass of the sun,
*  to go from the event horizon to the singularity takes about one millionth of a second.
*  And what happens to you if you fall into the black hole? If you think of an object as
*  information, that information gets destroyed. Well, you've raised a crucially difficult point.
*  So that's why I keep needing to distinguish between black holes according to Einstein's
*  theory of general relativity, which is book one of space, time and geometry, which is perfectly
*  classical. And then come the 1970s, we start asking about quantum mechanics and what happens
*  in quantum mechanics. According to classical general relativity, the information that makes up you
*  when you fall into the black hole is lost to the outside world. It's there, it's inside the black
*  hole, but we can't get it anymore. In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking comes along and points out that
*  black holes radiate. They give off photons and other particles to the universe around them.
*  And as they radiate, they lose mass and eventually they evaporate, they disappear. So once that
*  happens, I can no longer say the information about you or a book that I threw in the black hole or
*  whatever is still there, is hidden behind the black hole because the black hole has gone away.
*  Right. So either that information is destroyed, like you said, or it is somehow transferred to
*  the radiation that is coming out, to the Hawking radiation. The large majority of people who think
*  about this believe that the information is somehow transferred to the radiation and information is
*  conserved. That is a feature both of general relativity by itself and of quantum mechanics
*  by itself. So when you put them together, that should still be a feature. We don't know that for
*  sure. There are people who have doubted it, including Stephen Hawking for a long time,
*  but that's what most people think. And so what we're trying to do now in a topic which has
*  generated many, many hundreds of papers called the black hole information loss puzzle is figure out
*  how to get the information from you or the book into the radiation that is escaping the black hole.
*  Is there any way to observe Hawking radiation to a degree where you can start getting insight,
*  or is this all just in the space of theory right now? Right now, we are nowhere close
*  to observing Hawking radiation. Here's the sad fact. The larger the black hole is, the lower
*  its temperature is. So a small black hole, like a microscopically small black hole might be very
*  visible. It's given off light, but something like the black hole in the center of our galaxy,
*  three million times the mass of the sun or something like that, Sagittarius A star,
*  that is so cold and low temperature that its radiation will never be observable.
*  Black holes are hard to make. We don't have any nearby. The ones we have out there in the
*  universe are very, very faint. So there's no immediate hope for detecting Hawking radiation.
*  Allegedly, we don't have any nearby. As far as we know, we don't have any nearby.
*  Could tiny ones be hard to detect? Somewhere at the edges of the solar system, maybe?
*  So you don't want them to be too tiny or they're exploding, right? They're very bright,
*  and then they will be visible. But there's an absolute regime where black holes are large
*  enough not to be visible because the larger ones are fainter, right? Not giving off radiation,
*  but small enough to not be detected through their gravitational effect.
*  Yeah.
*  Psychologically, just emotionally, how do you feel about black holes? They scare you?
*  I love them. I love black holes. But the universe, weirdly, makes it hard to make a black hole,
*  because you really need to squeeze an enormous amount of matter energy into a very, very small
*  region of space. So we know how to make stellar black holes. A supermassive star can collapse
*  to make a black hole. We know we also have these supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies.
*  We're a little unclear where they came from. I mean, maybe stellar black holes that got together
*  and combined, but that's one of the exciting things about new data from the James Webb
*  Space Telescope is that quite large black holes seem to exist relatively early in the history of
*  the universe. So it was already difficult to figure out where they came from. Now it's an even tougher
*  puzzle. So these supermassive black holes are formed somewhere early on in the universe.
*  I mean, that's a feature, not a bug, right? That we don't have too many of them. Otherwise,
*  we wouldn't have the time or the space to form the little pockets of complexity that we'll call
*  humans. I think that's fair. Yeah. It's always interesting when something is difficult, but
*  happens anyway, right? I mean, the probability of making a black hole could have been zero.
*  It could have been one, but it's this interesting number in between, which is kind of fun.
*  Are there more intelligent alien civilization than there are supermassive black holes?
*  Yeah, I have no idea, but I think your intuition is right that it would have been easy for there
*  to be lots of civilizations, and then we would have noticed them already, and we haven't. So
*  absolutely the simplest explanation for why we haven't is that they're not there.
*  Yeah. I just think it's so easy to make them though. So I understand that's the simplest
*  explanation, but also- How easy is it to make life or eukaryotic life or multicellular life?
*  It seems like life finds a way. Intelligent alien civilizations, sure. Maybe there is somewhere along
*  that chain a really, really hard leap, but once you start life, once you get the origin of life,
*  it seems like life just finds a way everywhere, in every condition. It just figures it out.
*  I mean, I get exactly what you're thinking. I think it's a perfectly reasonable
*  attitude to have before you confront the data. I would not have expected Earth to be special in
*  any way. I would have expected there to be plenty of very noticeable extraterrestrial civilizations
*  out there. But even if life finds a way, even if we buy everything you say, how long does it take
*  for life to find a way? What if it typically takes a hundred billion years? Then we'd be alone.
*  So it's a time thing. So to you, really, there's most likely there's no alien civilizations out
*  there. I just, I can't see it. I believe there's a ton of them and there's another explanation
*  why we can't see them. I don't believe that very strongly. Look, I'm not going to
*  place a lot of bets here. I'm both pretty up in the air about whether or not life itself is
*  all over the place. It's possible when we visit other worlds, other solar systems, there's
*  very tiny microscopic life ubiquitous, but none of it has reached some complex form.
*  It's also possible there isn't any. It's also possible that there are intelligent civilizations
*  that have better things to do than knock on our doors. So I think we should be very humble about
*  these things we know so little about. And it's also possible there's a great filter where
*  there's something fundamental about once a civilization develops complex enough technology,
*  that technology is more statistically likely to destroy everybody versus to continue being
*  creative. That is absolutely possible. I'm actually putting less credence on that one just because
*  you need to happen every single time. If even one, I mean, this goes back to von Neumann,
*  John von Neumann pointed out that you don't need to send the aliens around the galaxy. You can build
*  self-reproducing probes and send them around the galaxy. And you might think, well, the galaxy is
*  very big. It's really not. It's some tens of thousands of light years across and billions
*  of years old. So you don't need to move at a high fraction of the speed of light to fill the galaxy.
*  So if you were an intelligent alien civilization, the dictator of one,
*  you would just send out a lot of probes, self-reproducing probes.
*  A hundred percent.
*  And-
*  Just spread out.
*  Yes. And what you should do, this is, so if you want the optimistic spin, here's the optimistic spin.
*  People looking for intelligent life elsewhere often tune in with their radio telescopes, right?
*  At least we did before Arecibo was decommissioned. That's not a very promising way to find
*  intelligent life elsewhere because why in the world would a super intelligent alien civilization
*  waste all of its energy by beaming it in random directions into the sky?
*  For one thing, it just passes you by, right? So if we're here on earth, we've only been listening
*  to radio waves for a couple hundred years, okay? So if an intelligent alien civilization exists for
*  a billion years, they have to pinpoint exactly the right time to send us this signal. It is
*  much, much more efficient to send probes and to park, to go to the other solar systems,
*  just sit there and wait for an intelligent civilization to arise in that solar system.
*  This is kind of the 2001 monolith hypothesis, right? I would be less surprised to find
*  a sort of quiescent alien artifact in our solar system than I would to catch a radio signal from
*  an intelligent civilization. So you're a sucker for in-person conversations versus remote.
*  I just want to integrate over time. A probe can just sit there and wait, whereas a radio wave
*  goes right by you. How hard is it for an alien civilization, again, you're the dictator of one,
*  to figure out a probe that is most likely to find a common language with whatever it finds?
*  Couldn't that be like the elected leader of the alien civilization?
*  Elected leader, democratic leader, elected leader of a democratic alien civilization, yes.
*  I think we would figure out that language thing pretty quickly. I mean, maybe not
*  as quickly as we do when different human tribes find each other because obviously there's a lot
*  of commonalities in humanity, but there is logic in math and there is the physical world. You can
*  point to a rock and go, rock, right? I don't think it would take that long. I know that Arrival,
*  the movie based on a Ted Chiang story, suggested that the way that aliens communicate is going to
*  be fundamentally different, but also they had recognition and other things I don't believe in.
*  I think that if we actually find aliens, that will not be our long-term problem.
*  One of the places you're affiliated with is Santa Fe, and they approach the question of complexity
*  in many different ways and ask the question in many different ways of what is life, thinking
*  broadly. Do you be able to find it? You'll think you show up, a probe shows up to a planet,
*  we'll see a thing and be like, yeah, that's a living thing.
*  Again, if it's intelligent and technologically advanced, the more short-term question of if we
*  get some spectroscopic data from an exoplanet, so we know a little bit about what is in its atmosphere,
*  how can we judge whether or not that atmosphere is giving us a signature of life existing?
*  That's a very hard question that people are debating about. One very simple-minded,
*  but perhaps interesting approach is to say small molecules don't tell you anything,
*  because even if life could make them, something else could also make them.
*  But long molecules, that's the kind of thing that life would produce.
*  Signs of complexity. I don't know. I just have this nervous feeling that we won't be able to
*  detect. We'll show up to a planet, there'll be a bunch of liquid on it. We take a swim in the
*  liquid and we won't be able to see the intelligence in it, whether that intelligence looks like
*  something like ants or we'll see movement, perhaps strange movement, but we won't be able to
*  see the intelligence in it or communicate with it. I guess if we have nearly infinite amount of time
*  to play with different ideas, we might be able to.
*  I'm in favor of this kind of humility, this intellectual humility that we won't know,
*  because we should be prepared for surprises. But I do always keep coming back to the idea that
*  we all live in the same physical universe. Let's put it this way. The development of our intelligence
*  has certainly been connected to our ability to manipulate the physical world around us.
*  I would guess without 100% credence by any means, but my guess would be that any advanced kind of
*  life would also have that capability. Both dolphins and octopuses are potential counter examples to
*  that. But I think in the details, there would be enough similarities that we would recognize it.
*  I don't know how we got on this topic, but I think it was from Supermassive Black Holes.
*  So if we return to Black Holes and talk about the holographic principle more broadly,
*  you have a recent paper on the topic. You've been thinking about the topic in terms of
*  rigorous research perspective and just as a popular book writer. So what is the holographic
*  principle? Well, it goes back to this question that we were talking about with the information
*  and how it gets out. In quantum mechanics, certainly, arguably even before quantum mechanics
*  comes along in classical statistical mechanics, there's a relationship between information
*  and entropy. Entropy is my favorite thing to talk about that I've written books about and
*  will continue to write books about. So Hawking tells us that black holes have entropy.
*  It's a finite amount of entropy. It's not an infinite amount. But the belief is, and now we're
*  already getting quite speculative, the belief is that the entropy of a black hole is the largest
*  amount of entropy that you can have in a region of space time. It's sort of the most densely packed
*  that entropy can be. And what that means is there's sort of a maximum amount of information
*  that you can fit into that region of space and you call it a black hole.
*  And interestingly, you might expect if I have a box and I'm going to put information in it,
*  and I don't tell you how I'm going to put the information in, but I ask how does the information
*  I can put in scale with the size of the box? You might think, well, it goes as the volume of the
*  box because the information takes up some volume and I can only fit in a certain amount. And that
*  is what you might guess for the black hole, but it's not what the answer is. The answer is that
*  the maximum information as reflected in the black hole entropy scales as the area of the black holes
*  event horizon, not the volume inside. So people thought about that in both deep and superficial
*  ways for a long time. And they proposed what we now call the holographic principle, that the way
*  that space time and quantum gravity convey information or hold information is not different
*  bits or qubits for quantum information at every point in space time. It is something holographic,
*  which means it's sort of embedded in or located in or can be thought of as pertaining to
*  one dimension less of the three dimensions of space that we live in. So in the case of the
*  black hole, the event horizon is two dimensional embedded in a three dimensional universe. And the
*  holographic principle would say all of the information contained in the black hole can
*  be thought of as living on the event horizon rather than in the interior of the black hole.
*  I need to say one more thing about that, which is that this was an idea that I did just told you
*  was the original holographic principle put forward by people like Gerard de Tuft and
*  Leonard Susskind, super famous physicist. Leonard Susskind was on my podcast and gave a great talk.
*  He's very, very good at explaining these things. Mindscape podcast. That's right. Yes. And you
*  don't just have physicists on. I don't. I love Mindscape. Oh, thank you very much.
*  Curiosity driven. Yeah. Ideas. Exploration of ideas. Smart people. Yeah. But anyway,
*  what I was trying to get at was Susskind and also at Tuft were a little vague. They were a little
*  hand wavy about holography and what it meant. Where holography, the idea that information is
*  sort of encoded on a boundary really came into its own was with Juan Maldacena in the 1990s
*  and the ADS CFD correspondence, which we don't have to get into that into any detail, but it's
*  a whole full blown theory of it's two different theories. One theory in N dimensions of space time
*  without gravity and another theory in N plus one dimensions of space time with gravity.
*  And the idea is that this N dimensional theory is casting a hologram into the N plus one dimensional
*  universe to make it look like it has gravity. And that's holography with a vengeance. And that's
*  an enormous source of interest for theoretical physicists these days.
*  How should we picture what impact that has? The fact that you can store all the information
*  you could think of as all the information that goes into a black hole can be stored at the event
*  horizon. Yeah. I mean, it's a good question. One of the things that quantum field theory
*  indirectly suggests is that there's not that much information in you and me compared to the
*  volume of space time we take up. As far as quantum field theory is concerned, you and I are mostly
*  empty space. And so we are not information dense, right? The density of information in us or in a
*  book or a CD or whatever computer RAM is indeed encoded by volume. Like there's different bits
*  located at different points in space, but that density of information is super duper low.
*  So we're just like the speed of light or just like the big bang for the information in a black hole.
*  We are far away in our everyday experience from the regime where these questions become relevant.
*  So it's very far away from our intuition. We don't really know how to think about these things. We
*  can do the math, but we don't feel it in our bones. So you can just write off that weird stuff happens
*  in a black hole. Well, we like to do better, but we're trying. I mean, that's why we have
*  an information loss puzzle because we haven't completely solved it. So here's just one thing
*  to keep in mind. Once space time becomes flexible, which it does according to general relativity,
*  and you have quantum mechanics, which has fluctuations and virtual particles and things
*  like that, the very idea of a location in space time becomes a little bit fuzzy,
*  right? Because it's flexible and quantum mechanics says you can't even pin it down.
*  So information can propagate in ways that you might not have expected. And that's easy to say,
*  and it's true, but we haven't yet come up with the right way to talk about it that is perfectly
*  rigorous. It's crazy how dense with information a black hole is. And then plus like quantum mechanics
*  starts to come into play. So, you know, you almost want to romanticize the kind of interesting
*  computation type things that are going on inside the black hole. You do, you do, but I will,
*  I'll point out one other thing. It's information dense, but it's also very, very high entropy.
*  So a black hole is kind of like a very, very, very specific random number, right? It takes a
*  lot of digits to specify it, but the digits don't tell you anything. They don't give you anything
*  useful to work on. So it takes a lot of information, but it's not of a form that we can
*  learn a lot from. But hypothetically, I guess, as you mentioned, the information might be preserved,
*  the information that goes into a black hole, it doesn't get destroyed. So what does that mean
*  when the entropy is really high? Well, the black hole, I said that the black hole is the highest
*  density of information, but it's not the highest amount of information because the black hole can
*  evaporate. And when it evaporates, and people have done the equations for this, when it evaporates,
*  the entropy that it turns into is actually higher than the entropy of the black hole was,
*  which is good because entropy is supposed to go up, but it's much more dilute, right? It's spread
*  across a huge volume of space time. So in principle, all that you made the black hole out of the
*  information that it took is still there, we think, in that information, but it's scattered to the
*  four winds. We just talked about the event horizon of a black hole. What's on the inside?
*  What's at the center of it? No one's been there. So came back to tell. This is a theoretical
*  prediction, but I'll say one super crucial feature of the black holes that we know and love,
*  the kind that Schwarzschild first invented. There's a singularity, but it's not at the middle
*  of the black hole. Remember, space and time are parts of two different,
*  two parts of one unified space time. The location of the singularity in the black hole is not the
*  middle of space, but our future. It is a moment of time. It is like a big crunch. The big bang was
*  an expansion from a singularity in the past. Big crunch probably doesn't exist, but if it did,
*  it would be a collapse to a singularity in the future. That's what the interiors of black holes
*  are like. You can be fine in the interior, but things are becoming more and more crowded.
*  Space time is becoming more and more warped and eventually you hit a limit and that's the
*  singularity in your future. I wonder what time is like on the inside of a black hole.
*  Time always takes by one second per second. That's all it can ever do. Time can take by
*  differently for different people. And so you have things like the twin paradox,
*  where two people initially are the same age. One goes off and at the speed of light and comes back.
*  Now they're not. You can even work out that the one who goes out and comes back will be younger
*  because they did not take the shortest distance path. But locally, as far as you and your wrist
*  watch are concerned, time is not funny. Your neurological signals in your brain and your
*  heartbeat and your wrist watch, whatever's happening to them, is happening to all of them
*  at the same time. So time always seems to be ticking along at the same rate.
*  If you fall into a black hole and then I'm an observer just watching it and then you come out
*  once it evaporates a million years later, I guess you'd be exactly the same age. Have you aged at
*  all? You would be converted into photons. You would not be you anymore. Right. So it's not at all
*  possible that information is preserved exactly as it went in. It depends on what you mean by
*  preserved. It's there in the microscopic configuration of the universe. It's exactly
*  as if I took a regular book, made a paper and I burned it. The laws of physics say that all the
*  information in the book is still there in the heat and light and ashes. You're never going to get it
*  as a matter of practice, but in principle it's still there. But what about the age of things
*  from the observer perspective, from outside the black hole? From outside the black hole,
*  doesn't matter because they're inside the black hole. No, so but is there, okay, there's no way
*  to escape the black hole except to let it evaporate. To let it evaporate. But also,
*  by the way, just in relativity, special relativity, forget about general relativity,
*  it's enormously tempting to say, okay, here's what's happening to me right now. I want to know what's
*  happening far away right now. The whole point of relativity is to say there's no such thing as right
*  now when you're far away. And that is doubly true for what's inside a black hole. So you're tempted
*  to say, well, how fast is their clock ticking? Or how old are they now? Not allowed to say that
*  according to relativity. Because space and time are treated the same and so it doesn't even make
*  sense. What happens to time in the holographic principle? As far as we know, nothing dramatic
*  happens. We're not anywhere close to being confident that we know what's going on here yet.
*  There are good unanswered questions about whether time is fundamental, whether time is emergent,
*  whether it has something to do with quantum entanglement, whether time really exists at all,
*  different theories, different proponents of different things. But there's nothing
*  specifically about holography that would make us change our opinions about time,
*  whatever they happen to be. But holography is fundamentally about, it's a question of space?
*  It really is, yeah. Time just goes along for the ride, as far as we know.
*  Yeah. So all the questions about time is just almost like separate questions,
*  whether it's emergent and all that. Yeah. I mean, that might be a reflection of our ignorance right
*  now, but yes. If we figure out a lot, millions of years from now about black holes, how surprised
*  would you be if they traveled back in time and told you everything you want to know about black
*  holes? How much do you think there is still to know and how mind blowing would it be?
*  It does depend on what they would say. I think that there are colleagues of mine who think that
*  we're pretty close to figuring out how information gets out of black holes, how to quantize gravity,
*  things like that. I'm more skeptical that we are pretty close. I think that there's room for
*  a bunch of surprises to come. So in that sense, I suspect I would be surprised.
*  The biggest and most interesting surprise to me would be if quantum mechanics itself
*  were somehow superseded by something better. As far as I know, there's no empirical evidence-based
*  reason to think that quantum mechanics is not 100% correct, but it might not be. That's always
*  possible. There are, again, respectable friends of mine who speculate about it.
*  That's something I would, that's the first thing I'd want to know.
*  The black hole would be the most clear illustration.
*  Yeah, that's where it would show up.
*  If there's something you wish it would show up there.
*  I mean, maybe. The point is that black holes are mysterious for various reasons.
*  Yeah, if our best theory of the universe is wrong, that might help explain why.
*  Do you think it's possible we'll find something interesting like black holes sometimes create new
*  universes or black holes are a kind of portal through space-time to another place or something
*  like this? Then our whole conception of what is the fabric of space-time changes completely
*  because black holes is like Swiss cheese type of situation.
*  That would be less surprising to me because I've already written papers about that.
*  We don't have, again, strong reason to think that the interior of black hole leads to another
*  universe, but it is possible and it's also very possible that that's true for some black holes
*  and not others. This is stuff we don't know. It's easy to ask questions we don't know the
*  answer to. The problem is the questions that are easy to ask that we don't know the answer to are
*  super hard to answer. Because these objects are very difficult to test and to explore.
*  The regimes are just very far away. So either literally far away in space,
*  but also in energy or mass or time or whatever. You've published a paper on the holographic
*  principle or that involves the holographic principle. Can you explain the details of that?
*  I'm always interested in, since my first published paper, taking these wild speculative ideas and
*  trying to test them against data. The problem is when you're dealing with wild speculative ideas,
*  they're usually not well defined enough to make a prediction. I know it's going to happen in some
*  cases. I don't know what's going to happen in other cases. So we did the following thing.
*  As I've already mentioned, the holographic principle, which is meant to reflect the
*  information contained in black holes, seems to be telling us that there's less information,
*  less stuff that can go on than you might naively expect. So let's upgrade naively expect to
*  predict using quantum field theory. Quantum field theory is our best theory of fundamental
*  physics right now. Unlike this holographic black hole stuff, quantum field theory is entirely
*  local. In every point of space, something can go on and then you add up all the different points
*  in space. Okay. Not holographic at all. So there's a mismatch between the expectation for what is
*  happening even in empty space in quantum field theory versus what the holographic principle would
*  predict. How do you reconcile these two things? So there's one way of doing it that had been
*  suggested previously, which is to say that in the quantum field theory way of talking,
*  it implies there's a whole bunch more states, a whole bunch more ways the system could be
*  than there really are. I'll do a little bit of math just because there might be some people
*  in the audience who like the math. If I draw two axes on a two-dimensional geometry, like the
*  surface of the table, right? You know that the whole point of it being two-dimensional is I can
*  draw two vectors that are perpendicular to each other. I can't draw three vectors that are all
*  perpendicular to each other, right? They need to overlap a little bit. That's true for any numbers
*  of dimensions, but I can ask, okay, how much do they have to overlap? If I try to put more vectors
*  into a vector space than the dimensionality of the vector space, can I make them almost
*  perpendicular to each other? The mathematical answer is as the number of dimensions gets very,
*  very large, you can fit a huge extra number of vectors in that are almost perpendicular to
*  each other. In this case, what we're suggesting is the number of things that can happen
*  in a region of space is correctly described by holography. It is somewhat over counted
*  by quantum field theory, but that's because the quantum field theory states are not exactly
*  perpendicular to each other. I should have mentioned that in quantum mechanics, states are
*  given by vectors in some huge dimensional vector space, very, very, very, very large dimensional
*  vector space. So maybe the quantum field theory states are not quite perpendicular to each other.
*  If that is true, that's a speculation already, but if that's true, how would you know? What is the
*  experimental deviation? It would have been completely respectable if we had gone through
*  and made some guesses and found that there is no noticeable experimental difference because,
*  again, these things are in regimes very, very far away. We stuck our necks out. We made some very,
*  very specific guesses as to how this weird overlap of states would show up in the equations of motion
*  for particles like neutrinos. Then we made predictions on how the neutrinos would behave
*  on the basis of those wild guesses. Then we compared them with data. What we found is,
*  we're pretty close, but haven't yet reached the detectability of the effect that we are
*  predicting. In other words, well, basically one way of saying what we predict is if a neutrino,
*  and there's reasons why it's neutrinos, we can go into if you want, but it's not that interesting.
*  The neutrino comes to us from across the universe, from some galaxy very, very far away.
*  There is a probability as it's traveling that it will dissolve into other neutrinos
*  because they're not really perpendicular to each other as vectors as they would ordinarily be in
*  quantum field theory. That means that if you look at neutrinos coming from far enough away
*  with high enough energies, they should disappear. If you see a whole bunch of nearby neutrinos,
*  but then further away, you should see fewer. There is an experiment called IceCube,
*  which is this amazing testament to the ingenuity of human beings where they go to Antarctica
*  and they drill holes and they put photo detectors on a string a mile deep in these holes.
*  They basically use all of the ice in a cube. I don't know whether it's a mile or not,
*  but it's like a kilometer or something like that, some big region. That much ice is their detector.
*  They're looking for flashes when a cosmic ray or neutrino or whatever hits ice molecule,
*  water molecule in the ice. Flashes in the ice.
*  Yes. They're looking for flashes. Isn't that so crazy? What does the detector of that look like?
*  It's a bunch of strings, many, many, many strings with 360-degree photo detectors.
*  Yeah. That's really cool.
*  It's extremely cool. They've done amazing work and they find neutrinos.
*  So they're looking for neutrinos.
*  Yes. The whole point is most cosmic rays are protons. Why? Because protons exist
*  and they're massive enough that you can accelerate them to very high energies.
*  High energy cosmic rays tend to be protons. They also tend to hit the Earth's atmosphere
*  and decay into other particles. Neutrinos, on the other hand, punch right through,
*  at least usually, to a great extent. Not just Antarctica, but the whole Earth. Occasionally,
*  a neutrino will interact with a particle here on Earth. A neutrino is going through your body all
*  the time from the sun, from the universe, et cetera. If you're patient enough and you have a big enough
*  part of the Antarctic ice sheet to look at, the nice thing about ice is it's transparent.
*  You've built yourself, nature has built you a neutrino detector.
*  Why ice? Is it just because of the low noise and you get to watch this thing and it's...
*  It's much more dense than air, but it's transparent.
*  So yeah, much more dense, so high probability, and then it's transparency,
*  and then it's also in the middle of nowhere.
*  So you can... Humans are great.
*  That's all you need. There's not that much ice, right?
*  Humans are the best.
*  There's more ice in Antarctica than anywhere else. Right. Anyway, you can go and you can get a plot
*  from the Ice Cube experiment, how many neutrinos there are that they've detected with very high
*  energies. We predict in our weird little holographic guessing game that there should be a cutoff. You
*  should see neutrinos as you get to higher and higher energies and then they should disappear.
*  If you look at the data, their data gives out exactly where our cutoff is. That doesn't mean
*  that our cutoff is right. It means they lose the ability to do the experiment exactly where we
*  predict the cutoff should be. Oh boy. Okay. But why is there a limit?
*  Oh, just because there are fewer, fewer high energy neutrinos. So there's a spectrum and it
*  goes down. What we're plotting here is number of neutrinos versus energy. It's fading away
*  and they just get very, very few. And you need the high energy neutrinos for your prediction.
*  Our effect is a little bit bigger for higher energies. Yeah. And that effect has to do with
*  this almost perpendicular thing. And let me just mention the name of Oliver Friedrich, who was a
*  postdoc who led this. He deserves the credit for doing this. I was a co-author and a collaborator.
*  I did some work, but he really gets the lines here. Thank you, Oliver. Thank you for pushing
*  this wild science forward. Just to speak to that, the meta process of it, how do you approach
*  asking these big questions and trying to formulate as a paper, as an experiment that could make a
*  prediction, all that kind of stuff? What's your process? There's a very interesting things that
*  happens once you're a theoretical physicist. Once you become trained, you're a graduate student,
*  you've written some papers and whatever. Suddenly you are the world's expert in a really infinitesimally
*  tiny area of knowledge. And you know not that much about other areas. There's an overwhelming
*  temptation to just drill deep. Just keep doing basically the thing that you started doing.
*  But maybe that thing you started doing is not the most interesting thing to the world or to you or
*  whatever. So you need to separately develop the capability of stepping back and going, okay,
*  now that I can write papers in that area, now that I'm sort of trained enough in the general procedure,
*  what is the best match between my interests, my abilities, and what is actually interesting?
*  And honestly, I've not been very good at that over my career. My process traditionally was I
*  was working in this general area of particle physics, field theory, general relativity, cosmology,
*  and I would sort of try to take things other people were talking about and ask myself whether
*  or not it really fit together. I guess I have three papers that I've ever written
*  that have done super well in terms of getting cited and things like that.
*  One was my first ever paper that I get very little credit for. That was my advisor and his
*  collaborator set that up. The other two were basically my idea. One was right after we
*  discovered that the universe was accelerating. So in 1998, observations showed that not only
*  is the universe expanding, but it's expanding faster and faster. So that's attributed to either
*  Einstein's cosmological constant or some more complicated form of dark energy, some mysterious
*  thing that fills the universe. And people were throwing around ideas about this dark energy
*  stuff. What could it be? And so forth. Most of the people throwing around these ideas were
*  cosmologists. They work on cosmology. They think about the universe all at once.
*  Since I like to talk to people in different areas, I was sort of more familiar than average
*  with what a respectable working particle physicist would think about these things.
*  And what I immediately thought was, you guys are throwing around these theories. These theories
*  are wildly unnatural. They're super finely tuned. Any particle physicist would just be embarrassed
*  to be talking about this. But rather than just scoffing at them, I sat down and asked myself,
*  okay, is there a respectable version? Is there a way to keep the particle physicist happy,
*  but also make the universe accelerate? And I realized that there is some very specific
*  set of models that is relatively natural. And guess what? You can make a new experimental prediction
*  on the basis of those. And so I did that. People were very happy about that.
*  What was the thing that would make physicists happy that would make sense of this fragile
*  thing that people call dark energy? So the fact that dark energy pervades the whole universe
*  and is slowly changing, that should immediately set off alarm bells because particle physics
*  is a story of length scales and time scales that are generally, guess what? Small, right?
*  Particles are small. They vibrate quickly. And you're telling me now, I have a new field and its
*  typical rate of change is once every billion years, right? That's just not natural. And indeed,
*  you can formalize that and say, look, even if you wrote down a particle that evolved slowly over
*  billions of years, if you let it interact with other particles at all, that would make it move
*  faster. Its dynamics would be faster, its mass would be higher, et cetera, et cetera. So there's
*  a whole story. Things need to be robust and they all talk to each other in quantum field theory.
*  So how do you stop that from happening? And the answer is symmetry. You can impose a symmetry
*  that protects your new field from talking to any other fields. Okay. And this is good for two
*  reasons. Number one, it can keep the dynamics slow. So if you just, you can't tell me why it's slow,
*  you just made that up, but at least it can protect it from speeding up because it's not talking to
*  any other particles. And the other is it makes it harder to detect. Naively, experiments looking
*  for fifth forces or time changes of fundamental constants of nature, like the charge of the
*  electron, these experiments should have been able to detect these dark energy fields. And I was able
*  to propose a way to stop that from happening. The detection. The detection. Yeah. Because a symmetry
*  could stop it from interacting with all these other fields and therefore makes it harder to detect.
*  And just by luck, I realized, because it was actually based on my first ever paper,
*  there's one loophole. If you impose these symmetries, so you protect the dark energy
*  field from interacting with any other fields, there's one interaction that is still allowed,
*  that you can't rule out. And it is a very specific interaction between your dark energy field and
*  photons, which are very common. And it has the following effect as a photon travels through the
*  dark energy. The photon has a polarization up, down, left, right, whatever it happens to be.
*  And as it travels through the dark energy, that photon will rotate its polarization. This is called
*  birefringence. And you can run the numbers and say, you can't make a very precise prediction,
*  because we're just making up this model. But if you want to roughly fit the data,
*  you can predict how much polarization rotation there should be. A couple of degrees. Okay. Not
*  that much. So that's very hard to detect. People have been trying to do it. Right now, literally,
*  we're on the edge of either being able to detect it or rule it out using the cosmic microwave
*  background. And there is just truth in advertising. There is a claim on the market
*  that it's been detected, that it's there. It's not very statistically significant. If I were
*  to bet, I think it would probably go away. It's a very hard thing to observe.
*  But maybe as you get better and better data, cleaner and cleaner analysis, it will persist,
*  and we will have directly detected the dark energy. So if we just take this tangent of dark energy,
*  people will sometimes bring up dark energy and dark matter as an example of why physicists
*  have lost it, lost their mind. We're just going to say that there is this field that permeates
*  everything is unlike any other field and it's invisible. And it helps us work out some of the
*  math. How do you respond to that? Well, two ways. One way is,
*  those people would have had to say the same thing when we discovered the planet Neptune.
*  Because it's exactly analogous. Where we have a very good theory, in that case, Newtonian gravity
*  in the solar system. We made predictions. The predictions were slightly off for the motion of
*  the outer planets. You found that you could explain that motion by positing something very
*  simple. One more planet in a very, very particular place. And you went and looked for it and there it
*  was. That was the first successful example of finding dark matter in the universe.
*  It's a matter that we can't see.
*  Neptune was dark. There's a difference between dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter, as far as we
*  are hypothesizing it, is a particle of some sort. It's just a particle that interacts with us very
*  weakly. So we know how much of it there is. We know more or less where it is. We know some of
*  its properties. We don't know specifically what it is. But it's not anything fundamentally
*  mysterious. It's a particle. Dark energy is a different story. So dark energy is, indeed,
*  uniformly spread throughout space and has this very weird property that it doesn't seem to evolve,
*  as far as we can tell. It's the same amount of energy in every cubic centimeter of space,
*  from moment to moment in time. That's why, far and away, the leading candidate for dark energy
*  is Einstein's Cosmological Constant. The Cosmological Constant is strictly constant,
*  100% constant. The data say it had better be 98% constant or better. So 100% constant works,
*  right? And it's also very robust. It's just there. It's not doing anything. It doesn't
*  interact with any other particles. It makes perfect sense. Probably the dark energy is the
*  Cosmological Constant. The dark matter, super important to emphasize here, you know, it was
*  hypothesized at first in the 70s and 80s, mostly to explain the rotation of galaxies.
*  Today, the evidence for dark matter is both much better than it was in the 1980s and from different
*  sources. It is mostly from observations of the cosmic background radiation or of large-scale
*  structure. So we have multiple independent lines of evidence, also gravitational lensing and things
*  like that, many, many pieces of evidence that say that dark matter is there. And also that say that
*  the effects of dark matter are different than if we modify gravity. So that was my first answer
*  to your question is, dark matter, we have a lot of evidence for. But the other one is,
*  of course, we would love it if it weren't dark matter. Our vested interest is 100% aligned
*  with it being something more cool and interesting than dark matter because
*  dark matter is just a particle. That's the most boring thing in the world.
*  And it's non-uniformly distributed through space, dark matter.
*  Absolutely. Yeah. So this-
*  You can even see maps of it that we've constructed from gravitational lensing.
*  So verifiable sort of clumps of dark matter in the galaxy that explains stuff.
*  Bigger than the galaxy, sadly. We think that in the galaxy, dark matter is lumpy, but it's just
*  weaker. Its effects are weaker. But of the scale of large-scale structure and clusters of galaxies
*  and things like that, yes, we can show you where the dark matter is.
*  Could there be a super cool explanation for dark matter that would be interesting as opposed to
*  just another particle that sits there in clumps? The super cool explanation would be modifying
*  gravity rather than inventing a new particle. Sadly, that doesn't really work. We've tried.
*  I've tried. That's my third paper that was very successful. I tried to unify dark matter and dark
*  energy together. That was my idea. That was my aspiration, not even idea. I tried to do it.
*  It failed even before we wrote the paper. I realized that my idea did not help. It could
*  possibly explain away the dark energy, but it would not explain away the dark matter.
*  I thought it was not that interesting, actually. Then two different collaborators of mine said,
*  has anyone thought of this idea? They thought of exactly the same idea completely independently of
*  me. I said, well, if three different people found the same idea, maybe it is interesting.
*  So we wrote the paper. Yeah, it was very interesting. People are very interested.
*  Can you describe this paper a little bit? It's fascinating how much of a thing there is,
*  dark energy and dark matter, and we don't quite understand it. What was your dive into exploring
*  how to unify the two? Here is what we know about dark matter and dark energy. They become
*  important in regimes where gravity is very, very, very weak. That's kind of the opposite
*  from what you would expect if you actually were modifying gravity. There's a rule of thumb in
*  quantum field theory, et cetera, that new effects show up when the effects are strong. We understand
*  weak fields. We don't understand strong fields. But okay, maybe this is different. What do I mean
*  by when gravity is weak? The dark energy shows up late in the history of the universe. Early in the
*  history of the universe, the dark energy is irrelevant. But remember, the density of dark
*  energy stays constant. The density of matter and radiation go down. At early times, the dark energy
*  was completely irrelevant compared to matter and radiation. At late times, it becomes important.
*  That's also when the universes dilute and gravity is relatively weak. Now, think about galaxies.
*  A galaxy is more dense in the middle, less dense on the outside. There is a phenomenological fact
*  about galaxies that in the interior of galaxies, you don't need dark matter. That's not so surprising
*  because the density of stars and gas is very high there and the dark matter is just subdominant.
*  But then there's generally a radius inside of which you don't need dark matter to fit the data,
*  outside of which you do need dark matter to fit the data. So that's again, when gravity is weak.
*  So I asked myself, of course we know in field theory, new effects should show up when fields
*  are strong, not weak. But let's throw that out of the window. Can I write down a theory
*  where gravity alters when it is weak? And we've already said what gravity is. What is gravity?
*  It's the curvature of space-time. So there are mathematical quantities that measure the curvature
*  of space-time. And generally, you would say like I have an understanding Einstein's equation,
*  which I explained to the readers in the book, relates the curvature of space-time to matter
*  and energy. The more matter and energy, the more curvature. So I'm saying what if you add a new
*  term in there that says the less matter and energy, the more curvature. No reason to do that,
*  except to fit the data. So I tried to unify the need for dark matter and the need for dark energy.
*  That would be really cool if that was the case.
*  Super cool, right? It'd be the best. It'd be great.
*  It'd be really interesting if gravity did something funky when there's not much of it.
*  Almost like at the edges of it, it gets noisy.
*  That was exactly the hope. But the great thing about physics is there are equations.
*  You can come up with the words and you can wave your hands, but then you got to write down the
*  equations, and I did. And I figured out that it could help with the dark energy,
*  the acceleration of the universe. It doesn't help with dark matter at all.
*  Yeah. It just sucks that the scale of galaxies and scale of solar systems,
*  the physics is kind of boring.
*  Yeah, it does. I agree. Again, that's why it is a little bit, I tear my hair out when people who
*  are not physicists think, accuse physicists, like you say, of sort of losing the plot because they
*  need dark matter and dark energy. I don't want dark matter and dark energy. I want something much
*  cooler than that. I've tried, but you got to listen to the equations and to the data.
*  You mentioned three papers, your first ever, your first awesome paper ever,
*  and your second awesome paper ever. Of course, you wrote many papers, so you're being very harsh on
*  the others.
*  Well, by the way, this is not awesomeness. This is impact.
*  There's no correlation between awesomeness and impact. Some of my best papers fell without a
*  stone. Yeah. The first paper was called Limits on a Lorentz and Parity Violating Modification of
*  Electromagnetism or Electrodynamics. We figured out how to violate Lorentz invariance, which is
*  the symmetry underlying relativity. The important thing is we figured out a way to do it that didn't
*  violate anything else and was experimentally testable. People love that. The second paper
*  was called Quintessence and the Rest of the World. Quintessence is this dynamical dark energy field.
*  The rest of the world is because I was talking about how the quintessence field would interact
*  with other particles and fields and how to avoid the interactions you don't want.
*  The third paper was called, is Cosmic Speed Up Due to Gravitational Physics, something like that.
*  You see the common theme. I'm taking what we know, the Standard Model of Particle Physics,
*  General Relativity, tweaking them in some way and then trying to fit the data.
*  And trying to make it so it's experimentally validated.
*  Ideally, yes. That's right. That's the goal.
*  You wrote the book, Something Deeply Hidden on the Mysteries of Quantum Mechanics,
*  and a new book coming out soon, part of that Biggest Ideas in the Universe series we mentioned,
*  called Quanta and Fields. That's focusing on quantum mechanics.
*  Big question first. Biggest ideas in the universe. What to you is most beautiful
*  or perhaps most mysterious about quantum mechanics?
*  Quantum mechanics is a harder one. I wrote a textbook on general relativity and I started it
*  by saying, general relativity is the most beautiful physical theory ever invented. I will stand by
*  that. It is less fundamental than quantum mechanics, but quantum mechanics is a little
*  more mysterious. It's a little bit kludgy right now. If you think about how we teach
*  quantum mechanics to our students, the Copenhagen interpretation, it's a god-awful mess. No one's
*  going to accuse that of being very beautiful. I'm a fan of the many worlds interpretation
*  of quantum mechanics, and that is very beautiful in the sense that fewer ingredients, just one
*  equation, and it could cover everything in the world. It's a little bit more complicated.
*  It depends what you mean by beauty, but I think that the answer to your question is
*  quantum mechanics can start with extraordinarily austere, tiny ingredients, and in principle
*  lead to the world. That boggles my mind. It's much more comprehensive. General relativity is about
*  gravity, and that's great. Quantum mechanics is about everything and seems to be up to the task.
*  Is that beauty or not? It's certainly impressive. Both for the theory, the predictive power of the
*  theory, and the fact that the theory describes tiny things creating everything we see around us.
*  It's a monist theory in classical mechanics. I have a particle here, a particle there.
*  I describe them separately. I can tell you what this particle is doing, what that particle is
*  doing. In quantum mechanics, we have entanglement, as Einstein pointed out to us in 1935. What that
*  means is there is a single state for these two particles. There's not one state for this
*  particle, one state for the other particle. Indeed, there's a single state for the whole
*  universe called the wave function of the universe, if you want to call it that. It obeys one equation
*  and is our job then to chop it up, to carve it up, to figure out how to get tables and chairs and
*  things like that out of it. You mentioned the many worlds interpretation, and it is in fact
*  beautiful. It's one of your more controversial things, you stand behind.
*  You've probably gotten a bunch of flak for it. I'm a big boy. I can take it.
*  Well, can you first explain it and then maybe speak to the flak you may have got?
*  The classic experiment to explain quantum mechanics to people is called the Stern-Gerlach
*  experiment. You're measuring the spin of a particle. In quantum mechanics, the spin is
*  just a spin. It's the rate at which something is rotating around in a very down-to-earth sense,
*  the difference being is that it's quantized. For something like a single electron or a single
*  neutron, it's either spinning clockwise or counterclockwise. Let's put it this way. Those
*  are the only two measurement outcomes you will ever get. There's no it's spinning faster or slower.
*  It's either spinning one direction or the other. That's it. Two choices. According to the rules of
*  quantum mechanics, I can set up an electron, let's say, in a state where it is neither
*  purely clockwise or counterclockwise, but a superposition of both. That's not just because
*  we don't know the answer. It's because it truly is both until we measure it. Then when we measure
*  it, we see one or the other. This is the fundamental mystery of quantum mechanics is that how we
*  describe the system when we're not looking at it is different from what we see when we look at it.
*  We teach our students in the Copenhagen way of thinking is that the act of measuring
*  the spin of the electron causes a radical change in the physical state. It spontaneously collapses
*  from being a superposition of clockwise and counterclockwise to being one or the other.
*  You can tell me the probability that that happens, but that's all you can tell me.
*  I can't be very specific about when it happens, what caused it to happen, why it's happening,
*  none of that. That's all called the measurement problem of quantum mechanics.
*  Many worlds just say, look, I just told you a minute ago that there's only one wave
*  function for the whole universe. That means that you can't take too seriously just describing the
*  electron. You have to include everything else in the universe. In particular, you clearly have to
*  interact with the electron in order to measure it. Whatever is interacting with the electron
*  should be included in the wave function that you're describing. Look, maybe it's just you.
*  Maybe your eyeballs are able to perceive it, but okay, I'm going to include you in the wave function.
*  If you do that, since you have a very sophisticated listenership, I'll be a
*  little bit more careful than average. What does it mean to measure the spin of the electron?
*  We don't need to go into details, but we want the following thing to be true.
*  If the electron were in a state that was 100% spinning clockwise, then we want the measurement
*  to tell us it was spinning clockwise. We want your brain to go, yes, the electron was spinning
*  clockwise, right? Likewise, if it was 100% counterclockwise, we want to see that, to measure
*  that. The rules of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation of quantum mechanics is 100% clear.
*  That if you want to measure it clockwise when it's clockwise and measure it counterclockwise
*  when it's counterclockwise, then when it starts out in a superposition, what will happen is that
*  you and the electron will entangle with each other. By that, I mean that the state of the universe
*  evolves into part saying the electron was spinning clockwise and I saw it clockwise.
*  Part of the state is it's in a superposition with the part that says the electron was spinning
*  counterclockwise and I saw it counterclockwise. Everyone agrees with this. Entirely uncontroversial,
*  straightforward consequence of the Schrödinger equation. Then Niels Bohr would say, and then part
*  of that wave function disappears, and we're in the other part. You can't predict which part it will
*  be, only the probability. Hugh Everett, who was a graduate student in the 1950s, was thinking about
*  this, says, I have a better idea. Part of the wave function does not magically disappear. It stays
*  there. The reason why that idea, Everett's idea that the whole wave function always sticks around
*  and just obeys the Schrödinger equation was not thought of years before is because naively, you
*  look at it and you go, okay, this is predicting that I will be in a superposition. That I will be
*  in a superposition of having seen the electron be clockwise and having seen it be counterclockwise.
*  No experimenter has ever felt like they were in a superposition. You always see an outcome.
*  Everett's move, which was kind of genius, was to say the problem is not the Schrödinger equation.
*  The problem is you have misidentified yourself in the Schrödinger equation. You have said, oh,
*  look, there's a person who saw counterclockwise. There's a person who saw clockwise. I should be
*  that superposition of both. Everett says, no, no, no, you're not. Because the part of the wave function
*  in which the spin was clockwise, once that exists, it is completely unaffected by the part of the
*  wave function that says the spin was counterclockwise. They are apart from each other. They are
*  un-interacting. They have no influence. What happens in one part has no influence in the
*  other part. Everett says the simple resolution is to identify yourself as either the one who saw
*  spin clockwise or the one who saw spin counterclockwise. There are now two people
*  once you've done that experiment. The Schrödinger equation doesn't have to be messed with. All you
*  have to do is locate yourself correctly in the wave function. That's many worlds.
*  The number of worlds is very, very, very, very big. Where do those worlds fit? Where do they go?
*  So the short answer is the worlds don't exist in space. Space exists separately in each world.
*  There's a technical answer to your question, which is Hilbert space, the space of all possible
*  quantum mechanical states. But physically, we want to put these worlds somewhere. That's just a wrong
*  intuition that we have. There is no such thing as the physical spatial location of the worlds,
*  because space is inside the worlds. One of the properties of this interpretation is that you
*  can't travel from one world to the other. That's right. Which kind of makes you feel
*  that they're existing separately? They are existing separately and simultaneously.
*  And simultaneously. Without locations in space.
*  Without locations in space. How is it possible to visualize them existing without a location in space?
*  The real answer to that, the honest answer is the equations predicted.
*  If you can't visualize it, so much worse for you. The equations are crystal clear about
*  what they're predicting. Is there a way to get to the closer to understanding and visualizing
*  the weirdness of the implications of this? I don't think it's that hard for me. I don't mind
*  the idea that when I make a quantum mechanical measurement, there is, later on in the universe,
*  multiple descendants of my present self who got different answers for that measurement.
*  I can't interact with them. Hilbert space, the space ball quantum wave functions was always big
*  enough to include all of them. I'm going to worry about the parts of the universe I can observe.
*  So let's put it this way. Many worlds comes about by taking the Schrodinger equation seriously.
*  The Schrodinger equation was invented to fit the data, to fit the spectrum of different atoms and
*  different emission and absorption experiments. It's perfectly legitimate to say, well, okay,
*  you're taking the Schrodinger equation, you're extrapolating it, you're trusting it, believing
*  it beyond what we can observe. I don't want to do that. That's perfectly legit, except,
*  okay, then what do you believe? Come up with a better theory. You're saying you don't believe
*  the Schrodinger equation. Tell me the equation that you believe in. And people have done that.
*  It turns out it's super hard to do that in a legitimate way that fits the data.
*  And many worlds is a really clean. Absolutely. The most austere, clean,
*  no extra baggage theory of quantum mechanics. So if it in fact is correct, isn't this the
*  weird, the weirdest thing of anything we know? Yes. In fact, let me put it this way.
*  The single best reason in my mind to be skeptical about many worlds is not because
*  it doesn't make sense or it doesn't fit the data or I don't know where the worlds are going or
*  whatever. It's because to make that extrapolation, to take seriously the equation that we know is
*  correct in other regimes requires new philosophy, requires a new way of thinking about identity,
*  about probability, about prediction, a whole bunch of things. And it's worked to do that philosophy
*  and I've been doing it and others have done it and I think it's very, very doable, but it's not
*  straightforward. It's not a simple extrapolation from what we already know. It's a grand
*  extrapolation very far away. And if you just wanted to be sort of methodologically conservative
*  and say, that's a step too far. I don't want to buy it. I'm sympathetic to that. I think that
*  you're just wimping out. I think that you should have more courage, but I get the impulse.
*  And there is under many worlds an era of time where if you rewind it back,
*  there's going to be one initial state. That's right. All of quantum mechanics,
*  all different versions require a kind of arrow of time. It might be different in every kind, but
*  the quantum measurement process is irreversible. You can measure something, it collapses,
*  you can't go backwards. If someone tells you the outcome, if I say I've measured an electron,
*  it's spin is clockwise. And they say, what was it before I measured it? You know there was some part
*  of it that was clockwise, but you don't know how much. And many worlds is no different. But the
*  nice thing is that the kind of arrow of time you need in many worlds is exactly the kind of arrow
*  of time you need anyway for entropy and thermodynamics and so forth. You need a simple,
*  low entropy initial state. That's what you need in both cases.
*  So if you actually look at under many worlds into the entire history of the universe,
*  to the entire history of the universe, correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks
*  very deterministic. Yes. In each moment, does the moment contain the memory of the entire history
*  of the universe? To you, does the moment contain the memory of everything that preceded it?
*  As far as we know, so according to many worlds, the wave function of the universe,
*  all the branches of the universe at once, all the worlds, does contain all the information.
*  Calling it a memory is a little bit dangerous because it's not the same kind of memory that
*  you and I have in our brains because our memories rely on the arrow of time. And the whole point
*  of the Schrodinger equation or Newton's laws is they don't have an arrow of time built in.
*  They're reversible. The state of the universe not only remembers where it came from, but also
*  determines where it's going to go in a way that our memories don't do that.
*  But our memories, we can do a replay. Can you do this?
*  We can, but the act of forming a memory increases the entropy of the universe.
*  It is an irreversible process also, right? You can walk on a beach and leave your footprints
*  there. That's a record of your passing. It will eventually be erased by the ever increasing
*  entropy of the universe. But you can imperfectly replay it.
*  Can we return travel back in time imperfectly?
*  Oh, it depends on the level of precision you're trying to ask that question. The universe
*  contains the information about where the universe was, but you and I don't. We're nowhere close.
*  What computationally very costly to try to consult the universe?
*  Well, it depends on, again, exactly what you're asking. There are some simple questions.
*  What was the temperature of the universe 30 seconds after the Big Bang? We can answer that.
*  That's amazing that we can answer that to pretty high precision. But if you want to know where
*  every atom was, then no. What to you is the Big Bang? Why did it happen?
*  We have no idea. I think that's a super important question that I can imagine making progress on.
*  But right now, I'm more or less maximally uncertain about what the answer is.
*  Do you think black holes will help potentially?
*  No, not that much. Quantum gravity will help, and maybe black holes will help us figure out
*  quantum gravity so indirectly, yes. But we have the situation where general relativity,
*  Einstein's theory, unambiguously predicts there was a singularity in the past. There was a moment
*  of time when the universe had infinite curvature, infinite energy, infinite expansion rate,
*  the whole bit. That's just a fancy way of saying the theory has broken down,
*  and classical general relativity is not up to the task of saying what really happened at that moment.
*  It is completely possible there was, in some sense, a moment of time before which there were no other
*  moments. That would be the Big Bang. Even if it's not a classical general relativity kind of thing,
*  even if quantum mechanics is involved, maybe that's what happened. It's also completely
*  possible there was time before that, space and time, and they evolved into our hot Big Bang by
*  some procedure that we don't really understand. And if time and space are emergent, then the
*  before even starts getting real weird. Well, I think that if there is a first moment of time,
*  that would be very good evidence, or that would fit hand in glove with the idea that time is
*  emergent. If time is fundamental, then it tends to go forever because it's fundamental.
*  Well, yeah, I mean, the general formulation of this question is what's outside of it?
*  What's outside of our universe? So in time and in space, I know it's a pothead question, Sean.
*  I understand. I apologize. That's my life. My life is asking pothead questions. Some of them,
*  the answer is that's not the right way to think about it. Okay. But is it possible to think at
*  all about what's outside our universe? It's absolutely legit to ask questions,
*  but you have to be comfortable with the possibility that the answer is there's no such thing as outside
*  our universe. That's absolutely on the table. In fact, that is the simplest, most likely to
*  be correct answer that we know of. But it's the only thing in the universe that wouldn't have an
*  outside. Yeah, if the universe is the totality of everything, it would not have an outside.
*  That's so weird to think that there's not an outside. We want there to be, we want there to
*  be sort of a creator, a creative force that led to this. And outside, like this is our town,
*  and then there's a bigger world and there's always a bigger world.
*  Because that is our experience. That's the world we grew up in, right? The universe
*  doesn't need to obey those rules. Such a weird thing. When I was a kid, that used to keep me
*  up at night. Like what if the universe had not existed? Right. And it feels like a lot of pressure
*  that this is the if this is the only universe and we're here, one of the few intelligent
*  civilizations, maybe the only one. It's the old theories that we're the center of everything.
*  It just feels suspicious. That's why many worlds is kind of exciting to me because it like
*  is it's humbling in all the right kinds of ways. It feels like infinity is the way this whole thing
*  runs. There's one pitfall I'll just mention because there's a move that is made in these
*  theoretical edges of cosmology that I think is a little bit mistaken, which is to say,
*  I'm going to think about the universe on the basis of imagining that I am a typical observer.
*  I, this is called the principle of typicality or the principle of mediocrity or even the
*  Copernican principle. Nothing special about me. I'm just typical in the universe. But then you
*  draw some conclusions from this. And what you end up realizing is you've been hilariously presumptuous
*  because by saying I'm a typical observer in the universe, you're saying typical observers in the
*  universe are like me. And that is completely unjustified by anything. So I'm not telling you
*  what the right way to do it is, but these kinds of questions that are not quite grounded in
*  experimental verification or falsification are ones you have to be very careful about.
*  That to me is one of the most interesting questions. It's in different ways to approach
*  it, but like what's outside of this? How did the big mess start? How do we get something from
*  nothing? That's always the thing you're sneaking up to. When you're citing all of these questions,
*  that's where the black hole and the unifying, getting quantum gravity, all this kind of stuff.
*  You're always sneaking up to that question, where did all this come from?
*  And I think that's probably an answerable question. Right?
*  No. It doesn't have to be. So you think there could be a turtle at the bottom of this
*  that refuses to reveal its identity? Yes. I think that specifically the question,
*  why is there something rather than nothing, does not have the kind of answer that we would
*  ordinarily attribute to why questions. Because the typical why questions are embedded in the
*  universe. And when we answer them, we take advantage of the features of the universe that
*  we know and love. But the universe itself, as far as we know, is not embedded in anything
*  bigger or stronger. And therefore it can just be. Do you think it's possible this whole place is
*  simulated? Sure. It's a really interesting dark, twisted video game that we're all existing in.
*  You know, my own podcast listeners, mindscape listeners tease me because they know from my
*  AMA episodes that if you ever start a question by asking, do you think it's possible that?
*  The answer is going to be yes. That might not be the answer that you care about, but it's possible.
*  Sure. As long as you're not, you know, adding two even numbers together and getting an odd number.
*  When you say it's possible, there's a mathematically yes. And then there's more of like intuitive.
*  Yeah. You want to know whether it's plausible. You want to know is there a reasonable non-zero
*  credence to attach to this. I don't think that there's any
*  philosophical knockout objection to the simulation hypothesis. I also think that there's absolutely
*  no reason to take it seriously. Do you think humans will try to create one? I guess that that's how I
*  always think about it. You know, I see what I've spent quite a bit of time over the past few years
*  and a lot more recently in virtual worlds and just them always captivated by the possibility of creating
*  higher and higher resolution worlds. And as we'll talk a little bit about artificial intelligence,
*  sort of the advancement on the Sora front, you can automatically generate those worlds
*  and the possibility of existing in those automatically generated worlds is pretty exciting.
*  As long as there's a consistent physics, quantum mechanics and general relativity that governs the
*  generation of those worlds. So it just seems like it's a very interesting thing to do.
*  So it just seems like humans will for sure try to create this. Yeah, I think they will create better
*  and better simulations. I think the philosopher David Chalmers has done what I consider to be a
*  good job of arguing that we should treat things that happen in virtual reality and in simulated
*  realities as just as real as the reality that we experience. I also think that as a practical matter,
*  people will realize how much harder it is to simulate a realistic world than we naively believe.
*  So this is not a my lifetime kind of worry. Yeah, the practical matter of going from a sort of a
*  prototype that's impressive to a thing that governs everything. A similar question on this front is in
*  AGI. Yeah, you said that we're very far away from AGI. I want to eliminate the phrase AGI.
*  So basically when you're analyzing large language models and seeing how far they from whatever AGI
*  is, we can talk about different notions of intelligence that we're not as close as kind of
*  some people in public view are talking about. So what's your intuition behind that? My intuition
*  is basically that artificial intelligence is different than human intelligence. And so the
*  mistake that is being made by focusing on AGI among those who do is an artificial agent as we can make
*  them now or in the near future might be way better than human beings at some things, way worse than
*  human beings at other things. And rather than trying to ask how close is it to being a human
*  like intelligent, we should appreciate it for what its capabilities are. And that will both be more
*  accurate and help us put it to work and protect us from the dangers better rather than always
*  anthropomorphizing it. I think the underlying idea there under the definition of AGI is that
*  the capabilities are extremely impressive. That's not a precise statement, but I get that. I completely
*  agree. And then the underlying question where a lot of the debate is, is how impressive is it?
*  What are the limits of large language models? Can they really do things like common sense
*  reasoning? How much do they really understand about the world? Are they just fancy mimicry machines?
*  And where do you fall on that as to the limits of large language models?
*  I don't think that there are many limits in principle. I'm a physicalist about consciousness
*  and awareness and things like that. I see no obstacle to in principle building an artificial
*  machine that is indistinguishable in thought and cognition from a human being. But we're not trying
*  to do that. What a large language model is trying to do is to predict text. That's what it does.
*  And it is leveraging the fact that we human beings for very good evolutionary biology reasons
*  attribute intentionality and intelligence and agency to things that act like human beings.
*  As I was driving here to get to this podcast space, I was using Google Maps. Google Maps was
*  talking to me, but I wanted to stop to get a cup of coffee. So I didn't do what Google Maps told
*  me to do. I went around a block that it didn't like. And so it gets annoyed. It says, no, why
*  are you doing it? It doesn't say exactly in this, but you know what I mean. It's like, no, turn left,
*  turn left, and you turn right. It is impossible as a human being not to feel a little bit sad
*  that Google Maps is getting mad at you. It's not. It's not even trying to. It's not a large language
*  model. It's not as no aspirations to intentionality, but we attribute that all the time. Dan Dennett,
*  the philosopher, wrote a very influential paper on the intentional stance. The fact that it's the
*  most natural thing in the world for we human beings to attribute more intentionality to
*  artificial things than are really there, which is not to say it can't be really there. But if you're
*  trying to be rational and clear thinking about this, the first step is to recognize our huge bias
*  towards attributing things below the surface to systems that are able to, at the surface level,
*  act human. So if that huge bias of intentionality is there in the data, in the human data, in the
*  vast landscape of human data that AI models, large language models, and video models in the future
*  are trained on, don't you think that that intentionality will emerge as fundamental to
*  the behavior of these systems naturally? Well, I don't think it will happen naturally. I think
*  it could happen. Again, I'm not against the principle, but again, the way that large language
*  models came to be and what they're optimized for is wildly different than the way that human beings
*  came to be and what they're optimized for. So I think we're missing a chance to be much more
*  clear headed about what large language models are by judging them against human beings, again,
*  both in positive ways and negative ways. Well, I think to push back on what they're optimized
*  for is different to describe how they're trained versus what they're optimized for.
*  So they're trained in this very trivial way of predicting text tokens. But you can describe
*  what they're optimized for and what the actual task at hand is, is to construct the world model,
*  meaning an understanding of the world. And that's where it starts getting closer to what humans are
*  kind of doing. We're just, in the case of large language models, know how the sausage is made and
*  we don't know how it's made for us humans. But they're not optimized for that. They're optimized
*  to sound human. That's the fine tuning. But the actual training is optimized for understanding,
*  creating a compressed representation of all the stuff that humans have created on the internet.
*  And the hope is that that gives you a deep understanding of the world.
*  Yeah. So that's why I think that there's a set of hugely interesting questions to be asked
*  about the ways in which large language models actually do represent the world. Because what
*  is clear is that they're very good at acting human. The open question in my mind is, is the easiest,
*  most efficient, best way to act human to do the same things that human beings do? Or are there
*  other ways? And I think that's an open question. I just heard a talk by Melanie Mitchell at Santa
*  Fe Institute, an artificial intelligence researcher. And she told two stories about two different
*  papers, one that someone else wrote and one that her group is following up on. And they were
*  modeling Othello. Othello, the game with a little rectangular board, white and black squares.
*  So the experiment was the following. They fed a neural network the moves that were being made
*  in the most symbolic form, like E5. It just means that, okay, you put a token down E5.
*  So it gives a long string. It does this for millions of games, right? Real legitimate games.
*  And then it asks the question, the paper asks the question, okay, you've trained it to
*  tell what would be a legitimate next move from not a legitimate next move.
*  Did it in its brain, in its little large language model brain, I don't even know if it's technically
*  a large language model, but a deep learning network, did it come up with a representation
*  of the Othello board? Well, how do you know? And so they construct a little probe network
*  that they insert and ask it, what is it doing right at this moment, right? And the answer is that
*  the little probe network can ask, would this be legitimate or is this token white or black or
*  whatever? Things that in practice would amount to it's invented the Othello board.
*  And it found that the probe got the right answer, not 100% of the time, but more than by chance,
*  substantially more than by chance. So they said, there's some tentative evidence that
*  this neural network has discovered the Othello board, just out of data, raw data, right? But
*  then Melanie's group asked the question, okay, are you sure that that understanding of the
*  Othello board wasn't built into your probe? And what they found was like at least half of the
*  improvement was built into the probe, not all of it, right? And look, a Othello board is way simpler
*  than the world. So that's why I just think it's an open question. And I think that's the answer.
*  It's an open question whether or not the, I mean, it would be remarkable either way to learn that
*  large language models that are good at doing what we train them to do are good because they've built
*  the same kind of model of the world that we have in our minds, or that they're good despite not
*  having that model. Either one of these is an amazing thing. I just don't think the data are
*  clear on which one is true. I think I have some sort of intellectual humility about the whole
*  thing because I was humbled by several stages in the machine learning development over the past 20
*  years. And I just would never have predicted that LLMs, the way they're trained, on the scale of
*  data they're trained would be as impressive as they are. And there, that's where intellectual
*  humility steps in, where my intuition would say something like with Melanie where you need to be
*  able to have various sort of concrete common sense reasoning, symbolic reasoning type things
*  in a system in order for it to be very intelligent. But here, I'm so impressed by what it's capable
*  to do, train on next token prediction, essentially. My conception of the nature of intelligence is
*  just completely, not completely, but humbled, I should say. Look, and I think that's perfectly
*  fair. I also was, I will say pleasantly, I don't know whether it's pleasantly or unpleasantly,
*  but factually surprised by the recent rate of progress. Clearly some kind of phase transition
*  percolation has happened, right? And the improvement has been remarkable, absolutely amazing.
*  That I have no arguments with. That doesn't yet tell me the mechanism by which that improvement
*  happened. Constructing a model much like a human being would have is clearly one possible
*  mechanism, but part of the intellectual humility is to say maybe there are others.
*  I was chatting with the CEO of Anthropic, Dario Medet, so behind Klon, and that company, but a
*  lot of the AI companies are really focused on expanding the scale of compute. If we assume
*  that AI is not data limited, but is compute limited, you can make the system much more
*  intelligent by using more compute. Let me ask you, almost on the physics level,
*  do you think physics can help expand the scale of compute and maybe the scale of energy required
*  to make that compute happen? Yeah, 100%. I think this is one of the biggest
*  things that physics can help with, and it's an obvious low-hanging fruit situation where
*  the heat generation, the inefficiency, the waste of existing high-level computers is
*  nowhere near the efficiency of our brains. It's hilariously worse. We haven't tried to optimize
*  that hard on that frontier. Your laptop heats up when you're sitting on your lap. It doesn't need
*  to. Your brain doesn't heat up like that. Clearly, there exists in the world of physics the capability
*  of doing these computations with much less waste heat being generated, and I look forward to people
*  doing that. Are you excited for the possibility of a nuclear fusion? I am cautiously optimistic,
*  excited to be too strong. I mean, it'd be great, but if we really tried solar power,
*  it would also be great. I think Elias Tsitskauer said this, that the future of humanity on Earth
*  would be just the entire surface of Earth is covered in solar panels and data centers.
*  Why would you waste the surface of the Earth with solar panels? Put them in space.
*  Sure, you can go in space. Space is bigger than the Earth.
*  Yeah, just solar panels everywhere. Yeah.
*  Like it. We already have fusion. It's called the sun.
*  Yeah, that's true. And there's probably more and more efficient ways of catching that energy.
*  Sending it down is the hard part. Absolutely. But that's an engineering problem. Yeah.
*  So I just wonder where data centers, the compute centers can expand to if that's the future. If
*  AI is as effective as it possibly could be, then the scale of computation will keep increasing.
*  Perhaps it's a race between efficiency and scale. There are constraints, right? There's a certain
*  amount of energy, a certain amount of damage we can do to the environment before it's not worth
*  it anymore. So yeah, I think that's a new question. In fact, it's kind of frustrating because
*  we get better and better at doing things efficiently, but we invent more things we
*  want to do faster than we get good at doing them efficiently. So we're continuing to make
*  things worse in various ways. I mean, that's the dance of humanity. We're constantly creating
*  better and better technologies that are potentially causing a lot more harm.
*  And that includes for weapons, includes AI used as weapons, that includes nuclear weapons, of course,
*  which is surprising to me that we haven't destroyed human civilization yet, given how many nuclear
*  warheads are out there. Look, I'm with you. Between nuclear and bio weapons, it is a little bit
*  surprising that we haven't caused enormous devastation. Of course, we did drop two atomic
*  bombs on Japan, but compared to what could have happened or could happen tomorrow,
*  it could be much worse. Yeah. It does seem like there's an underlying, speaking of quantum fields,
*  there's like a field of goodness within the human heart that like, in some kind of game
*  theoretic way, we create really powerful things that could destroy each other. And there's greed
*  and ego and all this kind of power hungry dictators that are at play here in all the
*  geopolitical landscape. But we somehow always like, don't go too far. Yeah, but that's exactly what
*  you would say right before we went too far. And that's why we don't see aliens.
*  So you're, like I mentioned, associated with Santa Fe Institute. I just would love to take a stroll
*  down the landscape of ideas explored there. So they look at complexity in all kinds of ways.
*  What do you think about the emergence of complexity from simple things interacting simply?
*  I think it's a fascinating topic. I mean, that's why I'm thinking about these things these days,
*  rather than the papers that I was describing to you before. You know, all of those papers I described
*  to you before are guesses. Like what if the laws of physics are different in the following way?
*  And then you can work out the consequences. At some point in my life, I said like, what is the
*  chance I'm going to guess right? You know, Einstein guessed right, Steven Weinberg guessed right, but
*  there's a very small number of times that people guessed right. Whereas with this emergence of
*  complexity from simplicity, I really do think that we haven't understood the basics yet. I think
*  we're still kind of pre-paradigmatic. There've been some spectacular discoveries. People like
*  Jeffrey West at Santa Fe and others have really given us true insights into important systems,
*  but still there's a lot of the basics I think are not understood. And so,
*  searching for the general principles is what I like to do. And I think it's absolutely possible
*  that, I mean, to be a little bit more substantive than that, I think this is kind of a cliche. I
*  think the key is information. And I think that what we see through the history of the universe,
*  as you go from simple to more and more complex, is really subsystems of the universe figuring out
*  how to use information to do whatever, to survive or to thrive or to reproduce. I mean, that's the
*  sort of fuel, the leverage, the resource that we have for a while anyway, until the heat death,
*  but that's where the complexity is really driven by.
*  Yeah, but the mechanism of it, what, I mean, you mentioned Jeffrey West, what are interesting
*  clings of progress in this realm and what are systems that interest you in terms of information?
*  So, I mean, for me, just as a fan of complexity, just even looking at simple cellular automata is
*  always just a fascinating way to illustrate the emergence of complexity.
*  So for those of the listeners who don't know, viewers, cellular automata come from imagining
*  a very simple configuration, for example, a set of ones and zeros along a line. And then you
*  have a rule that says, okay, I'm going to evolve this in time. And generally the simplest ones start
*  with just each block of three ones and zeros have a rule that they will determinously go to either
*  one or a zero. And you can actually classify all the different possibilities, a small number of
*  possible cellular automata of that form. And what was discovered by various people, including
*  Stephen Wolfram, is some of these cellular automata have the feature that you start from almost
*  nothing, like zero, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, and you let it rip and it becomes
*  wildly complex. Okay. So this is very provocative, very interesting. It's also not how physics works
*  at all, because as we said, physics conserves information. You can go forward or backwards.
*  The cellular automata do not. They are not reversible in any sense. You've built in an
*  arrow of time. You have a starting point and then you evolve. So what I'm interested in is seeing how
*  in the real world with the real laws of physics and underlying reversibility, but macroscopic
*  irreversibility from entropy in the arrow of time, et cetera, how does that lead to complexity?
*  I think that that's an answerable question. I don't think that cellular automata are really
*  helping us in that one. So what is in that? What is the landscape of entropy in the universe look
*  like? Well, entropy is hard to localize. It's a property of systems, not of parts of systems.
*  Having said that, we can do approximate answers to the question. The answer is black holes are
*  huge in entropy. Let's put it this way. The whole observable universe that we're in had a certain
*  amount of entropy before stars and planets and black holes started to form. 10 to the 88th,
*  I can even tell you the number. Okay. The single black hole, the center of our galaxy has entropy
*  10 to the 90. Single black holes out of our galaxy has more entropy than the whole universe used to
*  have not too long ago. So most of the entropy in the universe today is in the form of black holes.
*  Okay. That's fascinating. First of all, but second of all, if we take black holes away,
*  what are the different interesting perturbations in entropy across space? What is the,
*  where do we earthlings fit into that? The interesting thing to me is that if you start
*  with a system that is isolated from the rest of the universe and you start it at low entropy,
*  there's almost a theorem that says if you're very, very, very low entropy, then the system looks
*  pretty simple because there's low entropy means there's only a small number of ways that you can
*  rearrange the parts to look like that. So if there's not that many ways, the answer is going to
*  look simple, but it's also almost a theorem that says when you're at maximum entropy, the system is
*  going to look simple because it's all smeared out. If it had like interesting structure,
*  then it would be complicated, right? So entropy in this isolated system only goes up. That's the
*  second law of thermodynamics, but complexity starts low, goes up, and then goes down again.
*  Sometimes people mistakenly think that complexity or life or whatever is fighting against
*  the second law of thermodynamics, fighting against the increase of entropy. That is precisely the
*  wrong way to think about it. We are surfers riding the wave of increasing entropy. We rely
*  on increasing entropy to survive. That is part of what makes us special. This table
*  maintains its stability mechanically, by which I mean there's molecules, there have forces on
*  each other, and it holds up. You and I aren't like that. We maintain our stability dynamically
*  by ingesting food, fuel, right? Food and water and air and so forth, burning it, increasing its
*  entropy. We are non-equilibrium quasi-steady state systems. We are using the fuel the universe gives
*  us in the form of low entropy energy to maintain our stability. I just wonder what that mechanism
*  of surfing looks like. I mean, that's where, first of all, I mean, one question to ask,
*  do you think it's possible to have a kind of science of complexity where you have very precise
*  ways or clearly defined ways of measuring complexity? I think it is and I think we don't.
*  It's possible to have it. I don't think we yet have it because, you know, in part because
*  complexity is not a univalent thing. There's different ideas that go under the rubric of
*  complexity. One version is just a commensurate of complexity, right? If you have a configuration
*  or a string of numbers or whatever, can you compress it so that you have a small program
*  that will output that? That's Komodo Grove complexity. But that's the complexity of a
*  string of numbers, okay? It's not like the complexity of a problem, right? Computational
*  complexity, the traveling salesman problem or factoring large numbers. That's a whole different
*  kind of question that is also about complexity. So we don't have a sort of unified view of it.
*  So you think it's possible to have a complexity of a physical system?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  In the same way we do entropy?
*  Yeah.
*  You think that's a Sean Carroll paper or what?
*  We're working on various things. The glib thing that I'm trying to work on right now with a
*  student is complexogenesis. How does complexity come to be if all the universe is doing is moving
*  from low entropy to high entropy?
*  It's a sexy name.
*  It's a good name. Yeah, I like the name. I just gotta write the paper.
*  Sometimes a name arose by any other name. In which context, the birth of complexity are you
*  most interested in?
*  Well, I think it comes in stages, right? So I think that if you go from the... I'm again,
*  a physicist. So biologists studying evolution will talk about how complexity evolves all the
*  time. The complexity of the genome, the complexity of our physiology, right? But they take for
*  granted that life already existed and entropy is increasing and so forth. I want to go back to the
*  beginning and say the early universe was simple and low entropy. And entropy increases with time
*  and the universe sort of differentiates and becomes more complex. But that statement,
*  which is indisputably true, has different meanings because complexity has different meaning. So sort
*  of the most basic primal version of complexity is what you might think of as configurational
*  complexity. That's what Komolgorov gets at. How much information do you need to specify the
*  configuration of the system? Then there's a whole other step where subsystems of the universe
*  start burning fuel, right? So in many ways, a planet and a star are not that different in
*  configurational complexity. They're both spheres with density high at the middle and getting less
*  as you go out. But there's something fundamentally different because the star only survives as long
*  as it has fuel, right? I mean, then it turns into a brown dwarf or a white dwarf or whatever. But
*  as a star, as a main sequence star, it is an out of equilibrium system, but it's more or less static,
*  right? Like if I spill the coffee mug and it falls in the process of falling, it's out of equilibrium,
*  but it's also changing all the time. A specific kind of system is where it looks sort of
*  macroscopically stationary like a star, but underneath the hood, it's burning fuel to be
*  the band in order to maintain that stability. So as stars form, that's a different kind of
*  complexity that comes to be. Then there's another kind of complexity that comes to be, roughly
*  speaking, at the origin of life, because that's where you have information really being gathered
*  and utilized by subsystems of the universe. And then arguably, there's any number of stages past
*  that. I mean, one of the most obvious ones to me is we talk about simulation theory, but you and I
*  run simulations in our heads. They're just not that good, but we imagine different hypothetical
*  futures, right? Bacteria don't do that. So that's the kind of information processing that is a form
*  of complexity. So I would like to understand all these stages and how they fit together.
*  Yeah, imagination.
*  Yeah, mental time travel.
*  Yeah, the things going on in my head when I'm imagining worlds are super compressed representations
*  of those worlds, but they get to the essence of them. And maybe it's possible with non-human
*  computing type devices to do those kinds of simulations in more and more compressed ways.
*  There's an argument to be made that literally what separates human beings from other species
*  on Earth is our ability to imagine counterfactual hypothetical futures.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's one of the big features. I don't know if it's a-
*  Everyone has their own favorite little feature, but that's why I said there's an argument to be
*  made. I did a podcast episode on it with Adam Bully. It developed slowly. I did different
*  podcasts. Sorry to keep mentioning podcast episodes I did, but Malcolm McIver, who is
*  an engineer at Northwestern, has a theory about one of the major stages in evolution is when fish
*  first climbed on the land. And I mean, of course that is a major stage in evolution, but in
*  particular, there's a cognitive shift because when you're a fish swimming under the water,
*  the attenuation length of light in water is not that long. You can't see kilometers away. You
*  can see meters away and you're moving at meters per second. So all of the evolutionary optimization
*  is make all of your decisions on a time scale of less than a second. When you see something new,
*  you have to make a rapid fire decision what to do about it. As soon as you climb onto land,
*  you can essentially see forever, right? You can see stars in the sky. So now a whole new mode of
*  reasoning opens up where you see something far away and rather than saying look up table,
*  I see this, I react. You can say, okay, I see that thing. What if I did this? What if I did that?
*  What if I did something different? And that's the birth of imagination eventually.
*  You've been critical on panpsychism.
*  Yes, you've noticed that, right?
*  Can you make the case for panpsychism and against it? So panpsychism is the idea that
*  consciousness permeates all matter. Maybe it's the fundamental force or physics of the way,
*  of the fabric of the universe.
*  Panpsychism, thought everywhere, consciousness everywhere, right?
*  To a point of entertainment, the idea of frustrates you, which sort of as a fan is wonderful to watch.
*  You've had great episodes with panpsychists on your podcast where you go at it.
*  I had David Chalmers who is one of the world's great philosophers and he is panpsychism curious.
*  He doesn't commit to anything, but he's certainly willing to entertain it. Philip Goff,
*  who I've had, who is a great guy, but he is devoted to panpsychism. In fact, he is almost
*  single-handedly responsible for the upsurge of interest in panpsychism in the popular imagination.
*  The argument for it is supposed to be that there is something fundamentally uncapturable
*  about conscious awareness by physical behavior of atoms and molecules.
*  So the panpsychist will say, look, you can tell me maybe someday through advances of neuroscience
*  and what have you, exactly what happens in your brain and how that translates into thought and
*  speech and action. What you can't tell me is what it is like to be me. You can't tell me what I am
*  experiencing when I see something that is red or that tastes something that is sweet. You can tell
*  me what neurons fire, but you can't tell me what I'm experiencing. That first-person inner
*  subjective experience is simply not capturable by physics. Therefore, this is an old argument,
*  of course, but then the therefore is supposed to be I need something that is not contained within
*  physics to account for that. I'm just going to call it mind. We don't know what it is yet.
*  We're going to call it mind. It has to be separate from physics. Then there's two ways to go.
*  If you buy that much, you can either say, okay, I'm going to be a dualist.
*  I'm going to believe that there's matter and mind and they are separate from each other
*  and they are interacting somehow. Or that's a little bit complicated and sketchy as far
*  as physics is going to go. So I'm going to believe in mind, but I'm going to put it prior
*  to matter. I'm going to believe that mind comes first and that consciousness is the fundamental
*  aspect of reality and everything else, including matter and physics, comes from it. That would
*  be at least as simple as physics comes first. Now the physicalist such as myself will say,
*  I don't have any problem explaining what it's like to be you or what you experience when you
*  see red. It's a certain way of talking about the atoms and the neurons, et cetera, that make up you.
*  Just like the hardness or the brownness of this table, these are words that we attach
*  to certain underlying configurations of ordinary physical matter. Likewise, sadness and redness
*  or whatever are words that we attach to you to describe what you're doing. And when it comes
*  to consciousness in general, I'm very quick to say I do not claim to have any special insight
*  on how consciousness works other than I see no reason to change the laws of physics to account
*  for it. If you don't have to change the laws of physics, where do you think it emerges from?
*  Is consciousness an illusion? It's almost like a shorthand that we humans use to describe a
*  certain kind of feeling we have when interacting with the world. Or is there some big leap that
*  happens at some stage? I almost never use the word illusion. Illusion means that there's something
*  that you think you're perceiving that is actually not there. Like an oasis in the desert is an
*  illusion. It has no causal efficacy. If you walk up to where the oasis is supposed to be, you'll say
*  you were wrong about it being there. That's different than something being emergent or
*  non-fundamental, but also real. Like this table is real, even though I know it's made of atoms.
*  That doesn't remove the realness from the table. I think the consciousness and free will and things
*  like that are just as real in tables and chairs. Oasis in the desert does have causal efficacy in
*  that you're thirsty. It leads to draw incorrect conclusions about the world.
*  Sure, but imagining a thing can sometimes bring it to reality, as we've seen, and that has a kind of
*  causal efficacy. Sure, but your understanding of the world in a way that gives you power over it
*  and influence over it is decreased rather than increased by believing in that oasis.
*  That is not true about consciousness or this table. You don't think you can
*  increase the chance of a thing existing by imagining it existing?
*  Unless you build it or make it. That's what I mean. Like imagining humans can fly.
*  If you're the right brothers. That's different than imagining that humans are flying.
*  In terms of counterfactuals in the future, absolutely, imagination is crucially important,
*  but that's not an illusion. That's just a imagination.
*  The possibility of the future versus what reality is. The future is a concept.
*  Time is just a concept, so you can play with that. But yes, reality.
*  For example, I love asking this. Donald Hoffman thinks that the entirety of the conversation we've
*  been having about space-time is an illusion. Is it possible for you to steel man the case for that?
*  Can you make the case for and against reality, as I think he writes, that the laws of physics,
*  the laws of physics as we know them with space-time, is a kind of interface to a much
*  deeper thing that we don't at all understand and that we're fooling ourselves by constructing this
*  world? Well, I think there's part of that idea that is perfectly respectable and part of it
*  that is perfectly nonsensical. I'm not even going to try to steel man the nonsensical part.
*  The real part to me is what is called structural realism.
*  So, we don't know what the world is at a deep fundamental level. Let's put ourselves in the
*  minds of people living 200 years ago. They didn't know about quantum mechanics. They didn't know
*  about relativity. That doesn't mean they were wrong about the universe that they understood.
*  They had Newton's laws. They could predict what time the sun was going to rise perfectly well.
*  In the progress of science, the words that would be used to give the most fundamental description
*  of how you were predicting the sun would rise changed because now you have curved space-time
*  and things like that, right? And you didn't have any of those words 200 years ago. But the prediction
*  is the same. Why? Because that prediction, independent of what we thought the fundamental
*  ontology was, the prediction pointed to something true about our understanding of reality. To call
*  it an illusion is just wrong, I think. We might not know what the best, most comprehensive way
*  of stating it is, but it's still true. Is it true in the way, for example, belief in God is true?
*  Because for most of human history, people have believed in a God or multiple Gods.
*  That seemed very true to them as an explanation for the way the world is. Some of the deeper
*  questions about life itself, the human condition, and why certain things happen, that was a good
*  explainer. So to you, that's not an illusion? No, I think that was completely an illusion. I think
*  it was a very, very reasonable illusion to be under. There are illusions. There are
*  substantive claims about the world that go beyond predictions that we can make and verify,
*  which later turn out to be wrong. And the existence of God was one of them.
*  If those people at that time had abandoned their belief in God and replaced it with a
*  mechanistic universe, they would have done just as well at understanding things, right? Again,
*  because there are so many things they didn't understand, it was very reasonable for them to
*  have that belief. It wasn't that they were dummies or anything like that. But that is,
*  as we understand the universe better and better, some things stick with us, some things get replaced.
*  Like you said, you're a believer of the mechanistic universe. You're a naturalist,
*  and as you've described, a poetic naturalist. That's right. What's the word poetic? What is
*  naturalism and what is poetic naturalism? Naturalism is just the idea that all that
*  exists is the natural world. There's no supernatural world. You can have arguments
*  about what that means, but I would claim that the argument should be about what the word
*  supernatural means, not the word natural. The natural world is the world that we learn about
*  by doing science. The poetic part means that you shouldn't be too, I want to say fundamentalist
*  about what the natural world is. As we went from Newtonian space time to Einsteinian space time,
*  something is maintained there. There is a different story that we can tell about the world.
*  That story in the Newtonian regime, if you want to fly a rocket to the moon,
*  you don't use general relativity, you use Newtonian mechanics. That story works perfectly well.
*  The poetic aspect of the story is that there are many ways of talking about the natural world,
*  as long as those ways latch on to something real and causally efficacious about the functioning of
*  the world, then we attribute some reality and truth to them. The poetic really looks at the
*  pothead questions at the edge of science. It's more open to them. It's doing double duty a
*  little bit. That's why it's confusing. The more obvious respectable duty it's doing is that tables
*  are real. Even though you know that it's really a quantum field theory wave function,
*  tables are still real. They're a different way of talking about the underlying deeper reality of it.
*  The other duty it's doing is that we move beyond purely descriptive vocabularies for discussing
*  the universe onto normative and prescriptive and judgmental ways of talking about the universe.
*  This painting is beautiful, that one is ugly. This action is morally right, that one is morally wrong.
*  These are also ways of talking about the universe. They are not fixed by the phenomena. They are not
*  determined by our observations. They cannot be ruled out by a crucial experiment, but they're
*  still valid. They might not be universal. They might be subjective, but they're not arbitrary,
*  and they do have a role in describing how the world works. So you don't think it's possible
*  to construct experiments that explore the realms of morality and even meaning?
*  So those are just subjective?
*  Yeah, they're human. They're personal.
*  But do you think that's just because we don't have a... The tools of science have not expanded
*  enough to incorporate the human experience? No, I don't think that's what it is. I think that
*  what we mean by aesthetics or morality are we're attaching categories, properties,
*  to things that happen in the physical world. And there is always going to be some subjectivity
*  to our attachment and how we do that. And that's okay. And the faster we recognize that and deal
*  with it, the better off we'll be. But if we deeply and fully understand
*  the functioning of the human mind, won't be able to incorporate that?
*  No, that will absolutely be helpful in explaining why certain people have certain moral beliefs.
*  It won't justify those beliefs as right or wrong.
*  Do you think it's possible to have a kind of general relativity, but that includes
*  the observer effect where the human mind is the observer?
*  Sure. So it's sort of like how we morph
*  in the same way gravity morphs space-time, how does the human mind morph reality and have a very
*  thorough theory of how that morphing actually happens?
*  That's a very plot-head question, Lex. But those are the things possible.
*  But the answer is yes. I think that there's no, I think that we're part of the physical world
*  and the natural world. Physicalism would have been just as good a word to use as naturalism,
*  maybe even a more accurate word, but it's a little bit more off-putting. So I do want to
*  snappier, more attractive label than physicalism.
*  Are there limits to science?
*  Sure. We just talked about one, right? Science can tell you right from wrong.
*  Right from wrong. You need science to implement your ideas about right and wrong. If you are
*  functioning on the basis of an incorrect view of how the world works, you might very well think
*  you're doing right, but actually be doing wrong. But all the science in the world won't tell you
*  which action is right and which action is wrong.
*  Dictators and people in power will sometimes use science as an authority to convince you what's
*  right and wrong. Studying Nazi science is fascinating.
*  But there's an instrumentalist view here. You have to first decide what your goals are
*  and then science can help you achieve those goals. If your goals are horrible,
*  science has no problem helping you achieve them. Science is happy to help out.
*  Let me ask you about the method behind the madness on several aspects of your life.
*  So you mentioned that your approach to writing for research and writing popular books,
*  how do you find the time of the day? Like what's the day in the life of Sean?
*  Very unclear how I find the time.
*  So you don't have a thing where in the morning you're like, you try to fight for two hours
*  somewhere. I don't. I'm really terrible at that. My strategy for finding time is just to ignore
*  interruptions in emails, but it's a different time every day. Some days it never happens,
*  some weeks it never happens. You're extremely prolific. So like you're able to have days where
*  you don't write and still write the next day. Oh, wow. That's a rare thing. A lot of prolific
*  writers will carve out two hours because otherwise it just disappears.
*  Right. No, I get that. Yeah, I do. And yeah, it's just like everyone has their foibles or whatever.
*  So I'm not able to do that. Therefore I have to just figure it out on the fly.
*  And what's the actual process look like when you're writing popular stuff? You get behind a
*  computer. Yeah, get behind a computer. And my way of doing it, so my wife, Jennifer, is a science
*  writer, but it's interesting because our techniques are entirely different. She will think about
*  something, but then she will free write. She'll just sit at a computer and write. Like, I think
*  this, I think this, I think that. And then that will be vastly compressed, edited, rewritten or
*  whatever until the final thing happens. I will just like sit there silently thinking for a very
*  long time and then I will write what is almost the final draft. So a lot of it happens. There might
*  be some scribbles for an outline or something like that, but a lot of it is in my brain before
*  it's on the page. So that's the case for the biggest ideas in the universe, the quanta book
*  and the space time motion book. Yeah, quanta and fields, which is actually mostly about quantum
*  field theory and particle physics. That's coming out in May and that is, I'm letting people in on
*  things that no other book lets them in on. So I hope it's worth it. It's a challenge because
*  there's a lot of equations. I mean, you did the same thing with space time motion. You did something
*  quite interesting, which is like you made the equation, the centerpiece of a book.
*  Right. There's a lot of equations. Book two goes further in those directions than book one did.
*  So it's more cool stuff. It's also more mind bending. It's more of a challenge. Book three
*  that I'm writing right now is called Complexity and Emergence. Oh, wow. And that'll be the final
*  part of the trilogy. Oh, that's fascinating. So there's a lot of probably ideas there. I mean,
*  that's a real cutting edge. Well, but you know, I'm not trying to be cutting edge. In other words,
*  I'm not trying to speculate in these books. Obviously, in other books, I've been very free
*  about speculating. But the point of these books is to say things that 500 years from now will still
*  be true. And so there are some things we know about complexity and emergence, and I want to
*  focus on those. And I will mention, I'm happy to say this is something that needs to be speculated
*  about, but I won't pretend to be telling you what one is the right one. You somehow found the balance
*  between the rigor of mathematics and still accessible, which is interesting. I try. I mean,
*  look, these three books, the biggest ideas books are absolutely an experiment. They're going to
*  appeal to a smaller audience than other books will. But that audience should love them. Like
*  my 16 year old self would have been so happy to get these books. I can't tell you. Yeah, in terms
*  of looking back in history, those are books, the trilogy would be truly special in that way. Work
*  for Lord of the Rings. So I figured, why not me? You and Tolkien are just different styles,
*  different topics. Same ultimate reality. Like we mentioned, Mindscape podcast. I love it.
*  You interview a huge variety of experts from all kinds of fields. So just several questions I want
*  to ask you. How do you prepare? Like, how do you prepare to have a good conversation? How do you
*  prepare in a way that satisfies, makes your own curious mind happy? All that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah. No, these are great questions. And I've sort of struggled and changed my
*  techniques over the years. It's over five year old podcast. Might be approaching six years old now.
*  I started out over preparing when I first started. Like I had a journey that I was going to go down.
*  Many of the people I talked to are academics or thinkers who write books. So they have a story
*  to tell. I could just say, okay, give me your lecture and then an hour later, stop. Right?
*  So the mistake is to sort of anticipate what the lecture would be and to ask the leading questions
*  that would pull it out of them. What I do now is much more, here are the points, here are the big
*  questions that I'm interested in. And so I have a much sketchier outline to start and then try to
*  make it more of a real conversation. I'm helped by the fact that it is not my day job. So I
*  strictly limit myself to one day of my life per podcast episode on average. Some days take more.
*  And that includes not just doing the research, but inviting the guests, recording it, editing it,
*  publishing it. So I need to be very, very efficient at that. Yeah.
*  You enforce constraints for yourself in which creativity can emerge.
*  That's right. That's right. And you know, look, sometimes if I'm interviewing a theoretical
*  physicist, I can just go in and we're interviewing an economist or historian. I have to do a lot of
*  work. Do you ever find yourself getting lost in rabbit holes that serve no purpose except
*  satisfying your own curiosity and then potentially expanding
*  the range of things you know that can help your actual work and research and writing?
*  Yes, on both counts. You know, I do. Some people have so many things to talk about that
*  you don't know where to start or finish, right? Others have a message. And one thing I discovered
*  over the course of these years is the correlation with age. Like there are brilliant people and I
*  try very hard on the podcast to sort of get all sorts of people, right? Different ages and things
*  like that. And bless their hearts, the most brilliant young people are not as practiced
*  at wandering past their literal research, right? They have less mastery over the field as a whole,
*  much less how to talk about it. Whereas certain older people just like have their pat answers
*  and that's kind of boring, right? So you want somewhere in between, you know, the ideal person
*  who has a broad enough scope that they can wander outside their specific papers they've written,
*  but they're not overly practiced. So they're just giving you their canned answers.
*  I feel like there's like a connection to the metaphor of entropy and complexity,
*  as you said there. Edge of chaos.
*  You also do incredible AMAs and people should sign up to your Patreon and because you can get
*  to ask questions, Sean Carroll. Well, for several hours you just answer in fascinating ways some
*  really interesting questions. Is there something you could say about the process of finding the
*  answers to those? That's a great one. Again, it's evolved over time. Yeah, so the Ask Me Anything
*  episodes were first, when I started doing them, they were only for Patreon subscribers to both
*  listen to and to ask the questions. But then I actually asked my Patreon subscribers, would you
*  like me to release them publicly and they overwhelmingly voted yes. So I do that. So the
*  Patreon supporters ask the questions, everyone can listen. And also at some point, I really used to
*  try to answer every question, but now there's just too many. So I have to pick and that's fraught
*  with peril. And my personal standard for picking questions to answer is what are the ones I think
*  I have interesting answers to give for, right? So that both means if it's kind of the same old
*  question about special relativity that I've gotten a hundred times before, I'm not going to answer
*  it because you can just Google that, it's easier. There are some very clear attempts to ask an
*  interesting question that honestly just I don't have an answer to. I read this science fiction
*  novel, what do you think about it? I'm like, well, I haven't read it, so I can't help you there.
*  What's your favorite color? I could tell you what it is, but it's not that interesting.
*  And so I try to make it a mix. It's not all physics questions, not all philosophy questions.
*  I will talk about food or movies or politics or religion if that's what people want to. I keep
*  suggesting that people ask me for relationship advice, but they never do.
*  Yeah, I don't think I've heard one.
*  I'm willing to do it, but I'm a little reluctant because I don't actually like giving advice,
*  but I'm happy to talk about those topics. I want to give several hours of talking and I
*  want to try to say things that I haven't said before and keep it interesting, keep it rolling.
*  If you don't like this question, wait for the next one.
*  What are some of the harder questions you've gotten that you remember? What kinds of questions
*  are difficult for you? Rarely, but occasionally people will ask me a super insightful philosophy
*  question. I hadn't thought of it things in exactly that way. I try to recognize that.
*  A lot of times it's the opposite where it's like, okay, you're clearly confused and I'm going to try
*  to explain the question you should have asked. I love those. Yeah, why that's the wrong question
*  or that kind of stuff. That's great. But the hard questions, I don't know. I don't actually
*  answer personal questions very much. The most personal I will get are questions like,
*  what do you think of Baltimore? That much I can talk about. Or how are your cats doing? Happy to
*  talk about the cats in infinite detail, but very personal questions I don't get into.
*  But you even touch politics and stuff like this.
*  Yeah, no, very happy to talk about politics. I try to be clear on what is professional expertise,
*  what is just me babbling, what is my level of credence in different things, where you're
*  allowed to disagree, whether if you disagree you're just wrong. People can disagree with that
*  also. I do think, and I'm happy to go out on a limb a little bit. I'm happy to say, look, I don't
*  know, but here's my guess. I just did a whole solo podcast, which was exactly that. It's
*  interesting. Some people are like, oh, this was great. And there's a whole bunch of people like,
*  why are you talking about this thing that you are not the world's expert in?
*  Well, I love the actual dance between humility and having a strong opinion on stuff, which is
*  a fascinating dance to pull off. And I guess the way to do that is to just expand into all kinds
*  of topics and play with ideas and then change your mind and all that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah, it's interesting because when people react against you by saying,
*  you are being arrogant about this, 99.999% of the time, all they mean is I disagree.
*  That's all they really mean, right? At a very basic level, people will accuse atheists of being
*  arrogant. And I'm like, you think God exists and loves you, and you're telling me that I'm arrogant.
*  I think that all of this is to say, just advice. When you disagree with somebody,
*  try to specify the substantive disagreement. Try not to psychologize them, right? Try to say,
*  oh, you're saying this because of this. Maybe it's true. Maybe you're right. But if you had
*  an actual response to what they were saying, that would be much more interesting.
*  I wonder why it's difficult for people to say or to imply, I respect you. I like you.
*  But I disagree on this. And here's why I disagree. I wonder why they go to this place of like,
*  well, you're an idiot or you're egotistical or you're confused or you're naive or you're
*  all the kinds of words. As opposed to like, I respect you as a fellow human being exploring
*  the world of mysteries all around us. And I disagree. I will complicate the question
*  even more because there's some people I don't respect or like. And I once wrote a blog post,
*  I think it was called the grid of disputation. And I had a two by two grid and it's, are you
*  someone I agree with or disagree with? Are you someone who I respect or don't? Right?
*  And all four quadrants are very populated. And what that means is there are people who I like
*  and I disagree with. And there are people who agree with me and I have no respect for at all,
*  the embarrassing allies quadrant. That was everyone's favorite. So, and I just think,
*  being honest, right? Like trying to be honest about where people are. But if you actually want
*  to move a conversation forward, forget about whether you like or don't like somebody,
*  explain the disagreement, explain the agreement. But you're absolutely right. I completely agree
*  like as a society, we are not very good at disagreeing. We instantly go to the insult.
*  Yeah. And I mean, even on the deeper level, I think at some deep level, I respect and love
*  the humanity in the other person. Yep. You said that general relativity is the most beautiful
*  theory ever. So far. What do you find beautiful about it? Let's put it this way. When I teach
*  courses, there's no more satisfying subject to teach than general relativity. And the reason
*  why is because it starts from very clear, precisely articulated assumptions. And it goes so far.
*  Right? And when I give my talk, you can find it online. I'm probably not going to give it again.
*  The book, one of the biggest ideas, talk, right? Was building up from, you don't know any math or
*  physics. An hour later, you know, Einstein's equation for general relativity. And the punch
*  line is the equation is much smarter than Albert Einstein, because Albert Einstein did not know
*  about the big bang. He didn't know about gravitational waves. He didn't know about black holes, but his
*  equation did. And that's, I mean, that's a miraculous aspect of science more generally,
*  but general relativity is where it manifests itself in the most absolutely obvious way.
*  A human question. What do you think of the fact that Einstein didn't get the Nobel Prize for
*  general relativity? Tragedy. He should have gotten maybe four Nobel prizes, honestly.
*  That was certainly should have got the photoelectric effect was 100% worth the
*  Nobel Prize because and people don't quite get this. Who cares about the photoelectric effect?
*  That's like this very minor effect. The point is his explanation for the photoelectric effect
*  invented something called the photon. That's worth the Nobel Prize. Max Planck gets credit
*  for this in 1900, explaining black body radiation by saying that when a little electron is jiggling
*  in an object at some temperature, gives off radiation in discrete chunks rather than continuously.
*  He didn't quite say that's because radiation is discrete chunks. It's like having a coffee maker
*  that makes one cup of coffee at a time. It doesn't mean that liquid comes in one cup
*  quanta. It's just that you are dispensing it like that. It was Einstein in 1905 who said light is
*  quanta, and that was a radical thing. So that clearly, that was not a mistake, but also special
*  relativity clearly deserved the Nobel Prize and general relativity clearly deserved the Nobel
*  Prize. Not only were they brilliant, but they were experimentally verified, like everything you want.
*  So separately, you think? Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
*  Oh, humans. Whatever the explanation there. Edwin Hubble never won the Nobel Prize for finding
*  the universe was expanding. Yeah, but even the fact that we give prizes is almost kind of silly,
*  and we limit the number of people that get the prize and all that. I think that Nobel Prize has
*  enormous problems. I think it's probably a net good for the world because it brings attention
*  to good science. I think it's probably a net negative for science because it makes people
*  want to win the Nobel Prize. Yeah, there's a lot of fascinating human stories underneath it all.
*  Science is its own thing, but it's also a collection of humans, and it's a beautiful collection.
*  There's tension, there's competition, there's jealousy, but there's also great collaborations
*  and all that kind of stuff. Daniel Kahneman, who recently passed, is one of the great stories
*  of collaboration in science. So all of it, that's what humans do. And Sean, thank you for being the
*  person that makes us celebrate science and fall in love with all of these beautiful ideas in science
*  for writing amazing books, for being legit and still pushing forward the research science side of
*  it, and for allowing me and these pothead questions, and also for educating everybody
*  through your own podcast. Everybody should stop everything and subscribe and listen to
*  every single episode of Mindscape. So thank you. I've been a huge fan forever. I'm really
*  honored that you would speak with me in the early days when I was still starting this podcast,
*  I mean, in the world. I appreciate it. Thanks very much for having me on now that you're a big deal.
*  Still having me on. Thank you, Sean. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sean Carroll.
*  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave
*  you with some words from Richard Feynman. Study hard what interests you the most in the most
*  undisciplined, irreverent, and original manner possible. Thank you for listening and hope to
*  see you next time.
