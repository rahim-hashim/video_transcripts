# Balaji Srinivasan: How to Fix Government, Twitter, Science, and the FDA | Lex Fridman Podcast #331
**Lex Fridman:** [October 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeH7qKZr0WI)
*  Donald Trump was probably the biggest person ever to be removed from social media.
*  Do you understand why that was done?
*  Can you still man the case for it and against it?
*  Everybody who's watching this around the world basically saw, let's say, US establishment
*  or Democrat aligned folks just decapitate the head of state digitally, right?
*  Just boom, gone.
*  Okay.
*  And they're like, well, if they can do that in public to the US president who's ostensibly
*  the most powerful man in the world, what does the Mexican president stand against that?
*  Nothing.
*  Regardless of whether it was justified on this guy, that means they will do it to anybody.
*  Now the seal is broken.
*  Just like the bailouts, as exceptional as they were in the first year, everybody was
*  shocked by them.
*  Then they became a policy instrument.
*  And now there's bailouts happening.
*  Every single bill is printing another whatever billion dollars or something like that.
*  The following is a conversation with biology, sir, and a vasan and angel investor, tech
*  founder, philosopher, and author of the network state, how to start a new country.
*  He was formerly the CTO of Coinbase and general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.
*  This conversation is over seven hours for some folks.
*  That's too long for some too short for some just right.
*  There are chapter timestamps, there are clips, so you can jump around or like I prefer to
*  do with podcasts and audiobooks I enjoy.
*  You can sit down, relax with a loved human, animal or consumable substance or all three,
*  if you like, and enjoy the ride from start to finish.
*  Biology is a fascinating mind who thinks deeply about this world and how we might be able
*  it in order to maximize the possibility that humanity flourishes on this fun little planet
*  of ours.
*  Also, you may notice that in this conversation, my eye is red.
*  That's from Jiu Jitsu.
*  And also, if I may say so from a life well lived.
*  This is a Lex Friedman podcast to support it.
*  Please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's biology, sir, and a vasan.
*  At the core of your belief system is something you call the prime number maze.
*  I'm curious.
*  I'm curious.
*  We got it.
*  We got to start there.
*  Sure.
*  If we can start anywhere, it's with mathematics.
*  Let's go.
*  All right, great.
*  A rat can be trained to turn at every even number or every third number in a maze to
*  get some cheese.
*  But evidently, it can't be trained to turn at prime numbers.
*  Two, three, five, seven, and then 11 and so on and so forth.
*  That's just too abstract.
*  Frankly, if most humans were dropped into a prime number maze, they probably wouldn't
*  be able to figure it out either.
*  They'd have to start counting and so on.
*  Actually, it'd be pretty difficult to figure out what the turning rule was.
*  Yet, the rule is actually very simple.
*  And so the thing I think about a lot is just how many patterns in life are we just like
*  these rats and we're trapped in a prime number maze.
*  And if we had just a little bit more cogitation, if we had a little bit more cognitive ability,
*  a little bit more, whether it's brain machine interface or just better physics, we could
*  just figure out the next step in that prime number maze.
*  We could just see it.
*  We could just see the grid.
*  And that's what I think about.
*  That's a big thing that drives me, is figuring out how we can actually conceive, understand
*  that prime number maze that we're living in.
*  So understand which patterns are just complex enough that they are beyond the limit of human
*  cognition.
*  Yes.
*  And what do you make of that?
*  Are the limits of human cognition a feature or a bug?
*  I think mostly a bug.
*  I admire Ramanujan.
*  I admire Feynman.
*  I admire these great mathematicians and physicists who were just able to see things that others
*  couldn't.
*  And just by writing it down, that's a leap forward.
*  People talk about it's not the idea of its execution, but that's for trivial ideas, for
*  great ideas for Maxwell's equations or Noon's laws or quantum electrodynamics or some of
*  Ramanujan's identities.
*  That really does bring us forward, especially when you can check them and you don't know
*  how they work.
*  Right?
*  You have the phenomenological, but you don't have the theory underneath it.
*  And then that stimulates the advancement of theory to figure out why is this thing actually
*  working.
*  That's actually, stat mech arose in part from the phenomenological studies that were basically
*  being done where people are just getting steam engines and so on to work.
*  And then they abstracted out thermodynamics and so on from that.
*  So the practice led the theory rather than vice versa, to some extent that's happening
*  in neural networks now, as you're aware.
*  And I think that's, so just something that's true and that works, even if we don't know
*  yet, that's amazing and it pulls us forward.
*  So I do think that the limits are more of a bug than a feature.
*  Is there something that humans will never be able to figure out about our universe,
*  about the theory, about the practice of our universe?
*  Yeah.
*  I typically quote Gordel's incompleteness for such a question.
*  And yeah, there are things that are provably unknowable or provably unprovable.
*  But I think you can often get an approximate solution.
*  The Hillebert, you know, Hillebert's problems like we will know, we must know.
*  At least we should know that we can't know.
*  Push to get at least an approximate solution.
*  Push to know that we can't know.
*  At least we push back that darkness enough so that we have lit up that corner of the
*  intellectual universe.
*  OK, let's actually take a bit of a tangent and explore a bit in a way that I did not
*  expect we would.
*  But let's talk about the nature of reality briefly.
*  I don't know if you're familiar with the work of Don Hoffman.
*  No, I don't.
*  I know Roger Penrose has like his Road to Reality series for like basic physics going
*  up to everything we know.
*  But go ahead.
*  It's even wilder.
*  Yeah.
*  In modern physics, we start the question of what is fundamental and what is emergent in
*  this beautiful universe of ours.
*  There's a bunch of folks who think that space time, as we know it, the four dimensional
*  space is emergent.
*  It's not fundamental to the physics of the universe.
*  And the same may argue, I think Sean Carroll is one of them, is that time itself, the way
*  we experience it is also emergent.
*  It's not fundamental to the way our universe works.
*  Anyway, those are the technical term, I apologize for swearing.
*  Those are the mind fucks of modern physics.
*  But if we stroll along that road further, we get somebody like Donald Hoffman, who makes
*  the evolutionary case that the reality we perceive with our eyes is not only an abstraction
*  of objective reality, but it's actually completely detached.
*  We're in a video game, essentially that's consistent for all humans.
*  It's not at all connected to physical reality.
*  It's an illusion.
*  It's like a version of the simulation hypothesis?
*  In a very distant way.
*  But the simulation says that there's a sort of computational nature to reality, and then
*  there's a kind of a programmer that creates this reality and so on.
*  He says that we humans have a brain that is able to perceive the environment, and evolution
*  is produced from primitive life to complex life on earth, produce the kind of brain that
*  doesn't at all need to sense the reality directly.
*  This table, according to Donald Hoffman, is not there.
*  Not just as an abstraction, we don't sense the molecules that make up the table, but
*  all of this is fake.
*  Interesting.
*  I tend to be more of a hard science person.
*  Just on that, people talk about qualia.
*  Is your perception of green different from my perception of green?
*  My counter argument on that is, well, we know something about a spectrum of light, and we
*  can build artificial eyes.
*  If we can build artificial eyes, which we can, they're not amazing, but you can do that.
*  You can build artificial ears and so on.
*  We can build recording devices for cameras and things like that.
*  Well, operationally, the whole concept of your perception of green, you see green as
*  purple, I see green as green, or what I call green, doesn't seem to add up because it does
*  seem like we can do engineering around it.
*  The Hoffman thing, I get why people more broadly will talk about a simulation hypothesis because
*  it's like Feynman and many others have talked about how math is surprisingly useful to describe
*  the world.
*  Very simple equations give rise to these complex phenomena.
*  Wolfram is also on this from a different angle with his cellular automata stuff.
*  It's almost suspicious how well it works.
*  Yeah, but on their hand, it's like, yet we're still also in a prime number maze.
*  There's things we just don't understand.
*  Also, within the constraints of the non-prime numbers, we find math to be extremely effective,
*  surprisingly effective.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So maybe the math we have gets us through the equivalent of the even turns and the odd
*  turns, but there's math we don't yet have that is more complex or more complex rules
*  for other parts.
*  Despite all our rage, we're all just rats in a cage.
*  I know that gets very abstract, but there are unsolved problems in physics.
*  Like the condensed matter space, there's a lot of interesting stuff happening.
*  My recollection, I may be out of date on this, things like sonoluminescence, we don't know
*  exactly how they work.
*  And sometimes those things that are at the edges of physics, in the late 1800s, I think
*  it was Rutherford said, basically all physics is being discovered, et cetera.
*  And that was obviously before quantum mechanics.
*  That sort of edge case, people are looking at the bomber and the passion series and seeing
*  this weird thing with the hydrogen spectrum and it was quantized.
*  And that led to the sort of phenomenological set of observations that led to quantum mechanics
*  and everything.
*  And sometimes I think the UAP stuff might be like that.
*  People immediately go to aliens for UAP, like the unidentified aerial phenomena.
*  There's surprising amount of stuff out there on this.
*  The UK has declassified a bunch of material.
*  Harry Reid is the Senator, has talked about this.
*  It's not an obviously political thing, which is good.
*  Is there something happening there?
*  And people had thought for a long time that the UAP thing was American counterpropaganda
*  to cover up their new spy planes that were spying over the Soviet Union to make anybody
*  who talked about them seem crazy and hysterical or whatever.
*  But if the UAP thing is real, it could be atmospheric phenomena like the aurora borealis
*  or the Northern Lights, but some things we don't understand.
*  It could be something like the Bomber and Passion series, which were the observations
*  of emission spectra before quantum mechanics.
*  So that's another option as opposed to doesn't exist or little green men.
*  It could be physics we don't understand yet, that's one possibility.
*  Do you think there's alien civilizations out there?
*  So there's a lot of folks who have kind of written and talked about this.
*  The Drake equation, which is like multiplying all the probabilities together.
*  There's perhaps more sophisticated takes like the Dark Forest, which says that if the
*  universe is like a dark forest, we're the dumb ones that aren't hiding our presence.
*  There's one calculation I saw, and I haven't reproduced it myself, but basically says that
*  the assumption that other civilizations have seen ours is wrong because when you have a
*  spherical radius for the electromagnetic radiation that's leaving our planet, as that sphere
*  gets larger and larger, it gets smaller and smaller amounts of energy.
*  So you get farther out, you're not getting enough photons or what have you to actually
*  detect it.
*  I actually haven't looked into the math behind it, but I remember seeing that argument.
*  So actually it is possible that it's so diffuse when you go past a certain number of light
*  years out that an alien civilization wouldn't be able to detect it.
*  That's another argument.
*  That's more basically about signals from them, from us, to be able to signals colliding enough
*  to find the signal from the noise.
*  Intelligence signal.
*  Yeah.
*  Hanson has an article called Grabby Aliens.
*  Have you seen his thing?
*  Yes.
*  He's been on this podcast.
*  Oh, great.
*  He's brilliant.
*  I like him.
*  He pushes boundaries in interesting ways.
*  In every ways.
*  In all of the ways.
*  In all the ways.
*  That's right.
*  I like him overall.
*  He's an asset to humanity.
*  Yeah, that's possible.
*  One of the things is, so here's for example, a mystery that we haven't yet done, right?
*  We haven't really figured out yet, which is abiogenesis in the lab.
*  We've done lots of things where you can show macromolecules binding to each other.
*  You can show evidence for the so-called RNA world, abiogenesis to go from non-life to
*  life in the lab.
*  You can show microevolution, obviously with bacteria.
*  You can do artificial selection on them.
*  Lots of other aspects of fundamental biochemistry origins of life stuff have been established.
*  There's a lot of plausibility arguments about the primitive environment and nitrogen and
*  carbon snapping together to get the RNA world as the initial hypothesis.
*  To my knowledge at least, we haven't actually seen abiogenesis demonstrated.
*  One argument is you need just this massive world with so many different reps before that
*  actually happens.
*  One possibility is if we could do atomic level simulations of molecules bouncing against
*  each other, it's possible that in some simulation we could find a path, a reproducible path
*  to abiogenesis and then just replicate that in the lab.
*  I don't know, okay?
*  That seems to me to be a mystery that we still don't fully understand, like an example of
*  the prime number maze.
*  One of the most fascinating mysteries.
*  One of the most important.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There may be some biochemist who's like, oh, Balj, you didn't know about XY and C that
*  happened in the abiogenesis field.
*  I freely confess I'm not like, you know, au courant on it.
*  The last thing I remember looking at is-
*  What's au courant mean?
*  Like up to the moment.
*  Oh, nice.
*  That's a nice word.
*  Au courant.
*  I'm probably mispronouncing it.
*  We'll edit it in post to pronounce it correctly with AI.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  We'll copy your voice and it will pronounce it perfectly correctly in post.
*  One thing that I do think was interesting is Craig Venter a while back tried to make
*  a minimum viable cell where he just tried to delete all of the genes that were not considered
*  essential.
*  It's like a new life form.
*  This was like almost 20 years ago and so on.
*  That thing was viable in the lab, right?
*  It's possible that you could reverse engineer.
*  You're coming at the problem from different directions.
*  can do quite a lot.
*  You've got some reasonable assumptions as to how that could come together.
*  You've got sort of stripped down minimum viable life forms and so on.
*  It's not there isn't stuff here.
*  You can see microevolution.
*  You can see at the sequence level.
*  If you do molecular phylogenics, you can actually track back the bases.
*  So it's not like there's no evidence here.
*  There's a lot of tools to work with.
*  But this in my view is a fascinating area and actually also relevant to AI because another
*  form of a biogenesis would be if we are able to give rise to a different branch of life
*  form, the silicon based as opposed to carbon based, you know, to stretch your point.
*  You give rise to something that actually does meet the definition of life for some definition
*  of life.
*  What do you think that definition is for an artificial life form?
*  Because you mentioned consciousness.
*  When will it give us pause that we created something that feels by some definition or
*  by some spiritual, poetic, romantic, philosophical, mathematical definition that is alive and
*  we wouldn't want to kill it?
*  So a couple of remarks on that.
*  One is Francis Crick of Watson and Crick before he died, I think his last paper was published
*  on something called the Klaustrum.
*  OK.
*  And the thing is that, you know, sometimes in biology or in any, you know, domain, people
*  are sort of discouraged from going after the big the big questions, right?
*  But he proposed the Klaustrum is actually the organ that is the seat of consciousness.
*  It's like this sheath that like covers the brain.
*  And for mice, if you and again, I may be recollecting this wrong, so but you can look, but my recollection
*  is in mice, if you disrupt this, the mouse is like very disoriented, right?
*  It's like it's the kind of thing which, you know, Watson and Crick were all about structure
*  implies function, right?
*  They found the structure of DNA, this amazing thing.
*  And they remarked in this very under understated way at the end of the paper that, well, obviously
*  this gives a basis for how the genetic material might be replicated and error corrected because,
*  you know, helix unwinds and you copy paste, right?
*  So he was a big structure function person and that applies not just at the protein level,
*  not just at the level of DNA, but potentially also at the level of organs.
*  Like the Klaustrum is kind of this system integrated level, right?
*  It's like the last layer in the neural network or something, you know?
*  And so that's the kind of thing that I think is worth studying.
*  So consciousness is another kind of big, abiogenesis is a big question, the prime number remains,
*  consciousness is a big question, and you know, then definition of life, right?
*  There's folks, gosh, there's, I think, so this one is something I'd have to Google around,
*  but there's a guy I think at Santa Fe Institute or something who had some definition of life
*  and like some thermodynamic definition.
*  You're right that it's gonna be a multi-feature definition.
*  We might have a Turing test like definition, frankly, which is just if enough humans agree
*  it's alive, it's alive, right?
*  And that might frankly be the operational definition,
*  because, you know, viruses are like this boundary case, you know,
*  are they alive or not?
*  Most people don't think they're alive,
*  but they're kind of, they're more alive than a rock in a sense.
*  Well, I think in a world that we'll talk about today quite a bit,
*  which is the digital world, I think the most fascinating
*  philosophically and technically definition of life is life in the digital world.
*  So chatbots, essentially creatures, whether they're replicas of humans
*  or totally independent creations, perhaps in an automatic way,
*  I think there's going to be chatbots that we would ethically be troubled by
*  if we wanted to kill them.
*  They would have the capacity to suffer.
*  They would be very unhappy with you trying to turn them off.
*  And then there'll be large groups of activists that will protest,
*  and they'll go to the Supreme Court of whatever the Supreme Court looks like
*  in 10, 20, 30, 40 years, and they will demand that these chatbots
*  would have the same rights as us humans.
*  Do you think that's possible?
*  I saw that Google engineer who was basically saying this had already happened,
*  and I was surprised by it because when I looked at the chat logs of it,
*  it didn't seem particularly interesting.
*  On the other hand, I can definitely see, I mean, GPT-3 for people who, you know,
*  haven't paid attention shows that serious step-ups are possible.
*  And obviously, you know, you've talked about AI in your podcast a ton.
*  Is it possible that GPT-9 or something is kind of like that?
*  Or GPT-15? Or GPT-4, maybe?
*  But...
*  You know, for people just listening, there's a deep skepticism in your face.
*  Yeah, you know, the reason being because...
*  You know it's possible, it's possible that you have, like,
*  a partition of society on literally this basis, you know?
*  That's one model where there's some people,
*  just like there's vegetarians and non-vegetarians, right?
*  There may be machines have life and machines are machines, you know?
*  Like, or something like that, right?
*  You know, you could definitely imagine some kind of partition like that in the future
*  where your fundamental political social system, that's a foundational assumption.
*  And, you know, is AI, does it deserve the same rights as, like,
*  human or, for example, a corporation is an intermediate?
*  Do you see that thing which is how human are different corporations?
*  Have you seen that infographic? It's actually funny.
*  So it's like...
*  There's a spectrum.
*  So, for example, Disney is considered about as human as like a dog, but like Exxon...
*  I may be remembering this one, but they had like a level with like human at one end
*  and like rock at the other end.
*  Does it have to do with corporate structure?
*  I think it's about people's empathy for that corporation, their brand identity.
*  But it's interesting to see that, first of all, people sort of do think of corporations
*  as being more like the branding is really what they're responding to.
*  Well, that's what I mean. They're also responding.
*  You know, I have a brand of human that I'm trying to sell,
*  and it seems to be effective for the most part.
*  Sure.
*  Although it has become like a running joke that I might be a robot.
*  Right.
*  Which means the brand is cracking.
*  Could be.
*  It's seeping through.
*  But I mean, in that sense, I just, I think I don't see a reason why chatbots
*  can't manufacture the brand of being human, of being sentient.
*  I mean, that is the Turing test, but it's like the multiplayer Turing test.
*  Now that actually a fair number of chatbots have passed the Turing test,
*  I'd say there's at least two steps up, right?
*  One is a multiplayer Turing test where you have chatbots talking to each other.
*  And then you ask, can you determine the difference between N chatbots talking
*  to each other and clicking buttons and stuff and apps and humans doing that?
*  And I think we're very far off.
*  I shouldn't say very far off.
*  At least, I don't know how far off we are in terms of time,
*  but we're still far off in terms of a group of N chatbots looking like their
*  digital output is like the group of N humans.
*  Like go from the Turing test to the multiplayer Turing test.
*  That's one definition.
*  Another definition is to be able to kind of swap in,
*  and you're not just convincing one human that this is a human for a small session.
*  You're convincing all humans that this is a human for N sessions.
*  Remote work actually makes this possible, right?
*  That's another definition of a multiplayer Turing test where basically
*  you have a chatbot that's fully automated that is earning money for you
*  as an intelligent agent on a computer that's able to go and get remote work jobs and so on.
*  I would consider that next level, right?
*  If you could have something that was like that, that was competent enough to...
*  I mean, because everything on a computer can be automated, right?
*  Literally, you could be totally hands-free just like autonomous driving.
*  You could have autonomous earning.
*  As a challenge problem, if you were Microsoft or Apple and you had legitimate
*  access to the operating system, just like Apple says,
*  can you send me details of this event?
*  A decentralized thing could, in theory, log the actions of 10,000 or 100,000 or a million people.
*  And with cryptocurrency, you can even monitor a wallet that was on that computer,
*  and you could see what long run series of actions were increasing or decreasing this digital balance.
*  You see what I'm saying, right?
*  So you start to get at least conceptually, it'd be invasive and there'd be a privacy issue and so on.
*  Conceptually, you could imagine an agent that could learn what actions humans were doing
*  that resulted in the increase of their local cryptocurrency balance, okay?
*  There may be better ways to formulate it, but that I consider a challenge problem is
*  to go from the Turing test to a genuine intelligent agent that can actually go and make money for you.
*  If you can do that, that's a big deal.
*  People obviously have trading bots and stuff, but that would be the next level.
*  It's typing out emails, it's creating documents, it's actually...
*  So it'll mimic human behavior in its entirety.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And it'll schedule Zooms, it'll send emails.
*  It'll essentially...
*  Because if you think about it, a human is hitting the keys and clicking the mouse,
*  but just like a self-driving car, the wheel rotates by itself, right?
*  Those keys are effectively just...
*  It's like the Automator app in Apple, right?
*  Everything is just moving on the screen.
*  You're seeing it there and it's just an AI.
*  It's kind of hilarious that the I'm not a robot click thing actually works.
*  Because I actually don't know how it works, but I think it has to do
*  with the movement of the mouse, the timing, and they know that it's very difficult
*  currently for a bot to mimic human behavior in the way they would click that little checkbox.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I think it's something...
*  I mean, again, my recollection on that is it's like a pile of highly obfuscated JavaScript
*  with all kinds...
*  It looks like a very simple box, but it's doing a lot of stuff and it's collecting all kinds
*  of instrumentation.
*  And yeah, exactly like a robot is just a little too deterministic, or if it's got noise,
*  it's like Gaussian noise.
*  And the way humans do it is just not something that you'd usually be able to do without collecting
*  thousands and thousands and thousands of human traces doing it.
*  But it is a predator prey on that.
*  Go ahead.
*  Well, and then the computer...
*  Or millions of human traces, I don't know.
*  The computer just sees the JavaScript.
*  It needs to be able to look outside the simulation for the computer.
*  The world is like...
*  The computer doesn't know about the physical world.
*  It has to look outside of its world and introspect back on this simple box, which is kind of...
*  I think that's exactly what mushrooms do, or psychedelics, is you get to go outside
*  and look back in.
*  And that's what a computer needs to do.
*  I do wonder whether they actually give people insight or whether they give people the illusion
*  of insight.
*  Is there a difference?
*  Yeah, because...
*  Well, actual insight is, again, Maxwell's equations.
*  You're able to shift the world with that.
*  There's a lot of practical devices that work.
*  The illusion of insight is, I'm Jesus Christ and nothing happens, right?
*  So, I don't know.
*  I think those are quite different.
*  I don't know.
*  I think you can fake it till you make it on that one, which is...
*  Insight, in some sense, is revealing a truth that was there all along.
*  Yeah.
*  So, I mean, I guess, like I'm talking about technical insight where you have...
*  This is the thing we were talking about actually before the podcast, like technical truths versus
*  political truths, right?
*  Some truths, they're on a spectrum.
*  And there's some truths that are actually entirely political in the sense that if you
*  can change the software in enough people's heads, you change the value of the truth.
*  For example, the location of a border is effectively consensus between large enough groups of people.
*  Who is the CEO?
*  That's consensus among a certain group of people.
*  What is the value of a currency or any stock?
*  That market price is just the psychology of a bunch of people.
*  Literally, if you can change enough people's minds, you can change the value of the border
*  or the position of the hierarchy or the value of the currency.
*  Those are purely political truths.
*  Then all the way on the other end are technical truths that exist independent of whatever any
*  one human or all humans think, like the gravitational constant, right?
*  Or the diameter of a virus.
*  Those exist independent of the human mind.
*  Change enough human minds doesn't matter.
*  Those remain constant.
*  And then you have things that are interestingly in the middle where cryptocurrency has tried
*  to pull more and more things from the domain of political truths into technical truths,
*  where they say, okay, the one social convention we have is that if you hold this private key,
*  you hold this Bitcoin.
*  And then we make that very hard to change because you have to change a lot of technical truths.
*  So you can push things to this interesting intermediate zone.
*  The question is how much of our world can we push into that?
*  And that takes us in a nonlinear, fascinating journey to the question I wanted to ask you in
*  the beginning, which is this political world that you mentioned and the world of political truth.
*  As we know it in the 20th century and the early 21st century,
*  what do you think works well and what is broken about government?
*  The fundamental thing is that we can't easily and peacefully start new opt-in governments.
*  Like startup governments.
*  Yeah. And what do I mean by that is basically you can start a new company,
*  you can start a new community, you can start a new currency even these days.
*  You don't have to beat the former CEO in a duel to start a new company.
*  You don't have to become head of the World Bank to start a new currency.
*  Okay. Because of this, yes, if you want to, you can join, I don't know,
*  Microsoft or name some company that's a GameStop and you can try to reform it, okay?
*  Or you can start your own.
*  And the fact that both options exist mean that you can actually just start from scratch.
*  The same reason we have a clean piece of paper. I mentioned this actually in the Network State
*  book. I'll just quote this bit, but we want to be able to start a new state peacefully for the
*  same reason we want a bare plot of earth, a blank sheet of paper, an empty text buffer,
*  a fresh tarp or a clean slate because we want to build something new without historical constraint.
*  Right? For the same reason you hit plus and do docs.new, you know, like create a new doc.
*  It's for the same reason, right? Because you don't want to backspace, you don't want to have just
*  like 128 bytes of space, 128 kilobytes and just have to backspace the old document before creating
*  the new one. So that's the fundamental thing that's wrong with today's governments.
*  And it's a meta point, right? Because it's not any one specific reform. It's a meta reform of
*  being able to start new countries. Okay. So that's one problem, but you know,
*  you could push back and say that's a feature because, you know, a lot of people argue that
*  tradition is power. Through generation, if you try a thing long enough, which is the way I see
*  marriage, there's value to the struggle and the journey you take through the struggle and you grow
*  and you develop ideas together. You grow until actually philosophically together. And that's
*  the idea of a nations that spans generations that you have a tradition that becomes more,
*  that strives towards the truth and is able to arrive there or no, not arrive, but take steps
*  towards there through the generations. So you may not want to keep starting new governments.
*  You may want to stick to the old one and improve it one step at a time. So just because you're
*  having a fight inside a marriage doesn't mean you should get a divorce and go on Tinder and
*  start dating around. That's the pushback. So it's not obvious that this is a strong feature to have
*  to launch new governments. There's several different kinds of lines of attack or debate
*  or whatever on this. First is, yes, there's obviously value to tradition and people say,
*  this is Lindy and that's Lindy. It's been proven for a long time and so on. But of course,
*  there's a tension between tradition and innovation. Like going to the moon wasn't Lindy,
*  it was awesome. And artificial intelligence is something that's very new. New is good, right?
*  And this is a tension within humanity actually itself because it's way older than all of these
*  nations. I mean, humans are tens of thousands of years old. The answers to humans are millions
*  of years old, right? And you go back far enough and the time that we know today of the sessile
*  farmer and soldier is if you go back far enough, you want to be truly traditional.
*  Well, we're actually sent from hunter-gatherers who are mobile and wandered the world and there
*  weren't borders and so on. They kind of went where they want, right? And people have
*  had done historical reconstructions like skeletons and stuff like that. And
*  many folks report that the transition to agriculture and being sessile resulted in
*  diminution of height. People had like tooth decay and stuff like that. The skeletons,
*  people had traded off upside for stability, right? That's what the state was. That was what these
*  sessile kinds of things were. Now, of course, they had more likelihood of living consistently.
*  You could support larger population sizes, but it had lower quality of life, right?
*  And so the hunter-gatherer, maybe that's actually our collective recollection of a Garden of Eden
*  where people just like a spider kind of knows innately how to build webs or a beaver knows how
*  to build dams. Some people theorize that the entire Garden of Eden is like a sort of built-in
*  neural network recollection of this pre-sessile era where we're able to roam around, just pick
*  off fruits and so on, a little population density. So the point is that I think what we're seeing is
*  a V3. You go from the hunter-gatherer to the farmer and soldier, the sessile nations are here
*  and they've got borders and so on, to kind of the V3, which is the digital nomad, the new hunter-gatherer.
*  We're going back to the future because it's even older than nations is no nations, right?
*  Even more traditional than tradition is being international, right? And so we're actually
*  tapping into that other huge thread in humanity, which is the desire to explore,
*  pioneer, wander, innovate, you know? And I think that's important.
*  To make America great again is to dissolve it completely into oblivion. No, it's a joke.
*  I know it's a joke. Humor, I'm learning this new thing.
*  Yes, the new thing for the road. The chatbot emulation isn't fully working there.
*  Yeah, glitch. That's where in the beta.
*  And let me say one other thing about this, which is, you know, there are, I mean, everybody in the
*  world to, okay, let's say, I don't know what percentage, let's say 99.99% or it's rounds to
*  that number of political discourse in the US focuses on trying to fix the system. If those folks,
*  I mean, 0.01% of the energy is going towards building a new system, that seems like a pretty
*  good portfolio strategy, right? Or 100% are supposed to go and edit this code base from
*  200 something years ago. I mean, the most American thing in the world is going and,
*  you know, leaving your country in search of a better life. America was founded 200 years
*  ago by the founding fathers. It's not just a nation of immigrants, it's a nation of immigrants,
*  right? Immigration, you know, from other countries to the US and actually also immigration within the
*  US. There's this amazing YouTube video called, it's like 50 states, US population, I think 1792
*  says 2050, so they've got a simulation. So you just stop it at 2019 or 2020. But it shows that
*  like Virginia was like number one early on, and then it lost ground in like New York gained.
*  And then like Ohio was a big deal in the early 1800s. And it was like father of presidents in
*  general, these presidents and later Illinois and Indiana. And then California really came up in the
*  20th century, like during the great depression. And now we're entering the modern era where like
*  Florida and Texas have risen and New York and California have dropped. And so interstate
*  competition, it's actually just like inter-currency competition. You've got trading pairs,
*  right? You, you know, sell BTC by ETH, you sell, you know, Solana or Z, you know, sell Monero by Z
*  cash, right? Each of those trading pairs gives you signal for today on this currency is down or up
*  relative to the southern currency. And the same way each of those migration pairs, someone goes
*  from New York to Ohio, Ohio to California, gives you information on the desirability of different
*  states. You can literally form a pair's matrix like this over time, very much like the link
*  matrix that's shaped America in a huge way. And so, you know, you ask, a, if this nation of
*  immigrants that was founded by men younger than us, by the way, the founding fathers were often
*  in their twenties, right? Who, you know, endorsed the concept of proposition nation, who've given
*  rise to a country of founders and, and pioneers who've literally gone to the moon, right?
*  Those folks would think that this is the end of history, that that's it, we're done. Like,
*  we've, we've done everything else. I mean, there's people in technology who believe,
*  and I agree with them, that we can go to Mars, that we might even be able to end death,
*  but we can't innovate on something that was 230 years old, you know?
*  So there is a balance certainly to, to strike. The, the American experiment is fascinating,
*  nevertheless. So one argument you can make is actually that we're in the very early days of
*  this V2. So what you describe as V2, you could make the case that we're not ready for V3,
*  that we're just actually trying to figure out the V2 thing. You're trying to like,
*  skip- When are we ever ready? Now, again, we'll go back to marriage, I think, and having kids kind
*  of thing. I think everyone who has kids is never really ready to be kids. That's the whole point,
*  you dive in. Okay. But the, I mean, you, you mentioned that you can't watch, is there other
*  criticisms of government that you can provide as we know it today before we kind of outline the
*  ideas of, of V3? Let's stick to V2. I'll give a few, right? And so a lot of this stuff will go
*  into the version. So I've got, you know, this book, the network state, which, which covers
*  some of these topics. Does network state have a subtitle? It is the network state, how to start
*  a new country, how to start a new country. And, but I just have it at the networkstate.com. I should
*  say it's an excellent book that you should get. I read it on Kindle, but there's also a website
*  and Balaji said that is constantly working on improving it, changing it. But by the, by the time
*  the whole project is over, it'll be a different book than it was in the beginning. I think so.
*  It's always shedding its old skin. Well, I wanted to get something out there and get feedback and
*  what not. Just like an app, right? You know, you, again, you have these two poles of an app is
*  highly dynamic and you're, you're accustomed to having updates all the time and a book is supposed
*  to be static. And there's a value in something static, something unchanged and so on. But in this
*  case, I'm glad I kind of shipped a version 1.0 and, you know, the, the next version, you know,
*  I'm going to split into like, tentatively motivation theory and practice, like motivation, like,
*  what is the sort of political philosophy and so on that motivates me at least to this,
*  which you can take or leave, right? And then theory as to why network state is now possible.
*  And I can define it in a second. And then the practices, zillions of practical details and
*  everything from Rhodes to diplomatic recognition and so on, funding, founding, all that stuff.
*  A lot of stuff actually I left out of V1 simply because I wanted to kind of get the desirability
*  of it on the table and then talk about the feasibility. I should actually
*  linger on that briefly in terms of things we can revolutionize. Like one of the biggest
*  innovations I think that Tesla does with the way they think about the car, with the deploy the car
*  is not the automation or the electric to me, it's the over the air updates. Be able to send
*  instantaneously updates to the software that completely changes the behavior, the UX,
*  everything about the car. And so I do think it would be interesting because books are a
*  representation of human knowledge, a snapshot of human knowledge. And it would be interesting that
*  we, if we can somehow figure out a system that allows you to do sort of like a GitHub for books,
*  like if I buy a book on Amazon without having to pay again, can I get updates like V1.1,
*  V1.2 and there's like release notes. That would be incredible. It's not enough to do like a second
*  edition or a third edition, but like minor updates that's not just on your website, but actually go
*  into the model that we used to buy books. So I spend my money, maybe I'll do a subscription
*  service for five bucks a month where I get regular updates to the books. And then there's
*  an incentive for authors to actually update their books such that it makes sense for the
*  subscription. And that means your book isn't just a snapshot, but it's a lifelong project.
*  Right.
*  You care enough about the book.
*  So I think there's a lot that can be done there because actually in going through this process,
*  in many ways, the most traditional thing I did was a self-published ebook on Kindle, right? Why?
*  Because basically like, if you actually ink a deal with a book publisher, first they'll give
*  you some advance. I didn't need the advance or anything. But second is all these constraints.
*  Oh, you want to translate into this, or you want to do this other format, or you want to update it,
*  you have to go and now talk to this other party, right? And also the narrowing window of what
*  they'll actually publish, it gets narrower and narrower. You see all these meltdowns over young
*  adult novels and stuff on Twitter, but it's more than that. So actually having an Amazon page,
*  it's just like a marker that a book exists. Okay. And now I've got an entry point where
*  if someone says, okay, I like this tweet, but how do I kind of get the, that might be a concept from
*  like the middle of chapter three, right? How do I get the thing from front to back? I can just point
*  them at thenetworkstate.com. That is import this, right? This one entry point, okay? And you mentioned
*  like subscription and money and so on and so forth. And I think people are paying for content online
*  now with newsletters and so on. But I've chosen to, and it will always have the thing free.
*  And I want it on, or you can get the Kindle version on Amazon simply because you have to
*  kind of set a price for that. But thenetworkstate.com, what I want to do is have that optimized
*  for every Android phone. So people in India or Latin America or Nigeria can just tap and open it.
*  Going to do translations and stuff like that. Greg Fodor of Allspace VR, you know, founder of
*  Allspace VR, he sold that and he coded the website and worked with him on it. And there's
*  another designer who, Elijah, and it was basically just a three person group. And we thought we had
*  something pretty nice. But one thing I was really pleasantly surprised by is how many people got in
*  touch with us afterwards and asked us if we could open source the software to create this website,
*  right? Because it's actually, you can try it on mobile. I think it's actually, in some ways,
*  a better experience than Kindle. And so that was interesting because I do think of the website
*  as like a V1 version of this concept of a book app, right? For example, imagine if you have
*  the Bible and the Ten Commandments aren't just text, but there's like a checklist and there's
*  a gateway to a Christian community there. And the practice is embedded into the thing.
*  Like, do you know brilliant.org? Amazing site. I love this site. Brilliant is basically mobile
*  friendly tutorials. And you can kind of just swipe through, you're in line at Starbucks or
*  getting on a plane or something. You just swipe through and just get really nice micro lessons
*  on things. And it's just interactive enough that your brain is working and you're problem solving.
*  And sometimes you'll need a little pen and paper. But that format of sort of very mobile friendly,
*  just continuous learning, I'd like to do a lot more with that. And so that's kind of where we're
*  going to go with the book app. So the there's a lot of fun stuff about the way you did at least
*  V1 of the book, which is you have like a one sentence summary, one paragraph summary, TLDR,
*  and like one image summary, which is I think honestly, it's not even about a short attention
*  span. It's a really good exercise about summarization, condensation, and like helping
*  you think through what is the key insight. Like we mentioned the prime number maze that reveals
*  something central to the human condition, which is struggling against the limitation of our minds.
*  And in that same way, you summarize the network state in the book. So let's actually jump right
*  there and let me ask you, what is the network state? What is the network state? So I'll give
*  it a sentence and also give it an image, right? So the informal sentence, a network state is a
*  highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that crowd funds territory
*  around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting states. Okay. So
*  just taking those pieces, highly aligned online community that is not Facebook, that is not Twitter.
*  People don't think of themselves as Facebookers or Twitterians, right? That's just a collection
*  of hundreds of millions of people who just fight each other all day, right? It's a fight club.
*  A company is highly aligned where you'll put a task into the company Slack and
*  on the, if you do it in all hands, about a hundred percent of the people in a company Slack will do
*  it. So they're highly aligned in that way, but online communities don't tend to be highly aligned.
*  Online communities tend to be like a Game of Thrones fan club or something like that.
*  Or, you know, a Twitter account, you might get 0.1% of people engaging with something. It's not
*  the a hundred percent. If you combine the degree of alignment of a company with the scale of a
*  community, that's like what a highly aligned, you know, online community is, right? Start to get a
*  thousand or 10,000 people who can collectively do something as simple as just all liking something
*  on Twitter. For example, why would they do that? They're a, they're a guild of electrical engineers.
*  They're a guild of graphic designers and you've got a thousand people in this guild and every day
*  somebody is asking a favor from the guild and the other 999 people are helping them out. For example,
*  I've just launched a new project or I'd like to get a new job. Can somebody help me? And so on.
*  And so you kind of give to get your, you know, you're helping other people in the community and
*  you're kind of building up karma this way. And then sometimes you spend it down like stack
*  overflow has this karma economy. It's not meant to be an internal economy that is like making tons
*  and tons of money off of is sort of to keep score, right? That's a highly aligned online community
*  part. Then capacity for collective action. I just kind of described that, which is at a minimum,
*  you, you don't have a highly aligned online community unless you have a thousand people
*  and you paste in a tweet and a thousand of them are T or, or like it. Okay. If you can't even get
*  that, you don't have something. If you do have that, you have the basis for at least collective
*  digital action on something. Okay. And you can think of this as a group of activists. You can
*  think of it as, for example, let's say I mentioned a guild, but let's say they're a group that wants
*  to raise awareness of the fact that life extension is possible, right? Every day there's a new tweet
*  on, I don't know whether it's a Metformin research or Sinclair's work or David Sinclair, right?
*  Andrew Huberman has good stuff here, you know, or there's a longevity VC. There's a bunch of folks
*  working in this area every day. There's something there. And literally the purpose of this online
*  community is where is the risk of longevity. And of the thousand people, 970 go and like that.
*  That's pretty good, right? That's solid. You've got something there. You've got it. You've got a
*  laser, right? You've got something, which you can focus on something because most of the web to
*  internet is in tropic. You go to hacker news, you go to Reddit, you go to Twitter, and you're
*  immediately struck by the fact that it's like 30 random things. Random. It's just a box of chocolates.
*  It's meant to be, you know, but we're- Some of them look delicious.
*  Some of them look delicious. Novelty, we can overconsume novelty, right? So, you know,
*  what we were talking about earlier, the balance between tradition and innovation, right?
*  Here is a different version of that, which is entropy going in a ton of different directions
*  due to novelty versus like focus, you know? It's like heat versus work, you know? Heat is
*  entropic and work force along a distance. You're going in a direction, right? And so if those 30
*  links on, you know, the next version of hacker news are read or something like so brilliant,
*  it's just, that's leveling you up. The 30 things you click, you've just gained a skill as a function
*  of that, right? So these kinds of online communities, I don't know what they look like.
*  They probably don't look like the current social media. They just like, for example,
*  I know this is a meta analogy, but in the 2000s, people thought Facebook for work would look like
*  Facebook and, you know, David Sachs, you know, found and sold the company Yammer that was partially
*  on the basis. It was fine as a billion dollar company, but Facebook for work was actually
*  Slack, right? It looked different. It was more chat focused. It was less image focused and whatnot.
*  What does the platform for a highly aligned online community look like? I think Discord is
*  the transitional state, but it's not the end state. Discord is sort of chatty. The work isn't
*  done in Discord itself, right? The cryptocurrency for tracking or the crypto karma for sort of
*  tracking people's contributions is not really done in Discord itself. Discord was not built for that.
*  And I don't know what that UX looks like. Maybe it looks like tasks, you know, like maybe it looks
*  something different. Okay. So let me linger on this. So you were actually,
*  uh, there's some people might not be even familiar with Discord or Slack and so on.
*  Even these platforms have like communities associated with them. Meaning the big,
*  like the meta community of people who are aware of the feature set and that you can do a thing,
*  that this is a thing and then you could do a thing with it. Discord, like when I first realized that,
*  I think it was born out of the gaming world is like, holy shit, this is like a thing. There's
*  a lot of people that use this. There's also a culture that's very difficult to escape.
*  That's associated with Discord that spans all the different communities within Discord. Reddit is
*  the same, even though there's different subreddits, there's still, because of the migration phenomenon,
*  maybe there's still a culture to Reddit and so on. So I'd like to sort of try to
*  dig in and understand what's the difference between the online communities that are formed
*  and the platforms on which those communities are formed. Sure. Very important. Yes, it is. It is.
*  So for example, an office, a good design for an office is frequently you have, um, you know,
*  the, uh, the commons, which is like the lunch room or the gathering area. Then everybody else has a
*  cave on the border they can kind of retreat to. Cave in the commons. I love it. By the way,
*  I was laughing internally about the heat versus work. I think that's gonna stick with me. That's
*  such an interesting way to see Twitter. Like, is this heat or is this, is this thread? Like,
*  cause there's a lot of stuff going on. Is it just heat or we're doing some like, is there a directed
*  thing that's going to be productive at the end of the day? I love this. I've never seen, anyway,
*  the cave in the commons is really nice. So that has to do with the layout of an office. That's
*  effective. That's right. And, uh, so you can think of many kinds of social networks, um, as being on
*  the cave and commons continuum. For example, Twitter is just all commons. The caves are just
*  like individual DMS or DM threads or whatever, but it's really basically just one gigantic global
*  public fight club for the most part. Right. Then you have for love club. Well, somewhat love,
*  but mostly fight or actually it's I love aggressively. That's all. Yeah. I mean, the
*  way I think, I mean, Twitter is like a cross between, uh, you know, a, a library and a civil
*  war, you know, it's something where you can learn and, but, but you can also fight if you choose to
*  fight. Right. Um, yeah. Well, I mean, it's, um, uh, because of it's the commons structure of it,
*  it's a mechanism for virality of anything. Yeah. So you just described the kind of things that
*  become viral. Yeah. Meaning no, no offense to librarians. It's like a library and Liberia
*  Liberia was wrecked by civil war for many years. Right. It's a library is one of my favorite sets,
*  uh, for porn. Just kidding jokes. I'm learning as that's probably crossing the line, uh, for the
*  engineers working on this humor module, maybe take that down. Yeah. Um, gosh, uh, we're just talking
*  about, oh yeah. So continue, continue. What are the commons? Yeah. So Twitter's a commons. Then
*  Facebook is like, it's got all these warrens and stuff. Facebook is very difficult to reason about,
*  uh, like privacy on that. And the reason is I think it's easy to understand when something
*  is completely public like Twitter or completely private like signal. And those are the only two
*  modes I think in which one can really operate when something is quasi private, like Facebook,
*  you have to just kind of assume it's public because if, if it's interesting enough,
*  it'll go outside your friend network and it'll get screenshotted or whatever and posted.
*  And so, you know, Facebook is sort of, sort of forced into default public,
*  despite its privacy settings, you know, for anybody who says something interesting,
*  you know, if it's like, uh, you can figure out all their dials and stuff like that,
*  but just hard to understand unless it's totally private or totally public, right? You have to
*  basically treat it if it's totally public, if it's not totally private. Okay. At least under a real
*  name. I'll come back to soon. So you've got Twitter. That's, that's total commons Facebook,
*  which is like a Warren's, you know, it's like, you know, it's like rabbit Warren's or like a
*  ant colony where you don't know where information is traveling. Then you've got Reddit, which has
*  serve your global Reddit and then all the subreddits. That's a different model of cave
*  and commons. I think one of the reasons it works is that you have individual moderators where
*  something is totally off topic and acceptable, uh, totally off topic and unacceptable in this
*  subreddit and totally on topic and acceptable in another. That's like kind of a, you know,
*  precursor of the digital societies. I think that we're going to see that actually are become
*  physical societies, like lots and lots of subreddit like things, you know, become physical
*  societies. Then you start going further into like discord where it's, it's more full feature than,
*  um, you know, as, as you go Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, now you jump into discord and discord is
*  a bunch of individual communities that are connected and you can easily sort of jump between
*  them. Right. And then you have Slack and you know, yes, you can use, um, Slack to go between
*  different company slacks, but Slack historically, at least I'm not sure what their current policy
*  is historically they discourage public slacks. So there it's mostly like you have your main
*  Slack for your company and then you sometimes may jump into like, uh, let's say you've got a design
*  consultant or somebody like that. You'll jump into their Slack, but discord is you've got way
*  more discords usually that you jump into then than slacks. Right. Well, and let me ask you then on
*  that point, because there is a culture, one of the things I discovered on Reddit and discord of
*  anonymity or pseudonyms or usernames that don't represent the actual name on Slack is an example
*  of one. Cause I think I did a, I used to have a Slack for like deep learning course that I was
*  teaching and that was like very large, like 20,000 people, whatever. But so you could grow quite
*  large, but there was a culture of like, I'm going to represent my actual identity, my actual name
*  and then the same stuff in discord. I think I was the only asshole using my actual name on there.
*  It's like everybody was using pseudonyms. So what's, what's the role of that in the online
*  community? Well, so I actually gave a talk on this a few years ago called, uh, the pseudonymous
*  economy. Okay. And, um, it's come about faster than I expected, uh, but I did think it was going to
*  come about fairly fast. And essentially the concept is obviously we've had, so first anonym, pseudonym,
*  real name, right? Anonymous is like 4chan, uh, where there's no tracking of a name. You're,
*  you know, there's zero reputation associated with an identity, right? So anonymous is like much of
*  Reddit where there's a persistent username and it has karma over time, but it's not linked to a,
*  the global identifier that is your state name. All right. So your quote real name, even the term
*  real name, by the way, is a misnomer because it's like your social security name, like social
*  security number. It's your official government name. It's your, it's your state name. It is
*  the tracking device. It's a, it's the air tag that's put on you, right? Why do I say that? Right.
*  Another word for a name is a handle. And so just visualize like a giant file cabinet. There's a
*  handle with Lex Freeman on it that anybody, the billions of people around the world can go up to
*  and they can pull this file on you out. Images of you, things you said, like billions of people can
*  stock billions of other people. Now that's a very new thing. And I actually think this will be
*  a transitional era in like human history. We're actually going to go back into a much more
*  encrypted world. Okay. Let me linger on that because another way to see real names is the
*  label on a thing that can be canceled. Yes, that's right. In fact, there's a book called
*  seeing like a state, which actually talks about the origins of surnames and whatnot. Like if you
*  have a guy who is that guy with brown hair, that's like an analog identifier. It could be
*  10 different people in a village, but if you have a first name, last name, okay, that guy can now be
*  conscripted. You can go down with a list, a list of digital identifiers, pull that guy out, pull him
*  into the military for conscription. Right. So that was like one of the purposes of names was to make
*  masses of humans legible to a state, right? Hence seeing like a state, you can see them now, right?
*  See digital identifiers, one thing that people don't usually think about is
*  pseudonymity is itself a form of decentralization. So, you know, people know Satoshi Nakamoto was
*  pseudonymous. They also knew he was into decentralization. But one way of thinking
*  about it is let's say his real name, okay, or his state name is a node, okay, attached to that is
*  every database, you know, his Gmail, his, you know, Facebook, if he had one, every government record
*  on him, right? All of these databases have that state name as the foreign key, right? And so it
*  can go and look things up in all of those databases, right? And so it's a thing of it as being the center
*  of a giant network of all of these things. When you go and create a pseudonym, you're budding off
*  a totally new node that's far away from all the rest. And now he's choosing to attach Bitcoin talk
*  and Bitcoin.org and the GPT signatures of the code if you choose to do that. All those things,
*  the digital signatures are all attached to this new decentralized name because he's instantiating
*  it, not the government, right? One way of thinking about it is the root administrator of the quote
*  real name system is the state because you cannot simply edit your name there, right? You can't just
*  go, you can't log into USA.gov and backspace your name and change it. Moreover, your birth certificate,
*  all this stuff that's fixed and immutable, right? Whereas you would take for granted that on every
*  site you go to, you can backspace, you can be like, call me Ishmael, you know, walk into a site,
*  use whatever name you want. You just have to use the same name across multiple sites. You can do
*  that. And if not, you don't have to. One thing that we're seeing now actually is at the level of
*  kids, you know, the younger generation, Eric Schmidt several years ago mentioned that, you know,
*  people would like change their names when they became adults so that they could do that. This
*  is kind of already happening. People are using, I've remarked on this many years ago, search
*  resistant identities. Okay. Why? They have their Finsta, which is their quote fake name Instagram
*  and Rinsta, which is their real name Instagram. That's just cool. Okay. And what's interesting is
*  on their Rinsta, they're their fake self because they're in their Sunday best and, you know,
*  smiling. And this is the one that's meant to be search indexed, right? On the Finsta,
*  with their fake name, this is just shared with their closest friends. They're their real self
*  and they're, you know, hanging out at parties or whatever, you know? And so this way they've got
*  something which is the public persona and the private persona, right? The public persona that's
*  search indexed and the private persona that is private for friends, right? And so organically,
*  people are, you know, like Jean Jacobs, she talks about like cities and how, you know, they're
*  organic and what I like, some of the mid 20th century guys, the architecture they had removed
*  shade from, you know, like awnings and stuff like that got removed. So this is like the restoration
*  of like awnings and shade and structure so that you're not always exposed to the all seeing web
*  crawler that I have sore on, which is like Google bot just indexing everything. These are search
*  resistant identities and that like, I just sort of passes over you like, you know, in the Terminator,
*  Terminator I just kind of passes over you, right? So search identity is not pulled up,
*  it's not indexed, right? And now you can be your real self. And so we've had this kind of thing for
*  a while with communication. The new thing is that cryptocurrency has allowed us to do it for
*  transaction, hence the pseudonymous economy, right? And she go from anonymous pseudonymous real name,
*  these each have their different purposes. But the new concept is that pseudonym, you can have
*  multiple of them, by the way, your ENS name, you could have it under your quote real name or
*  state name like Lex Friedman.eth, but you could also be a punk6529.eth, okay? And now you can earn,
*  you can sign documents, you can boot up stuff, you can have a persistent identity here, okay?
*  Which has a level of indirection to your real name. Why is that very helpful? Because now it's harder
*  to both discriminate against you and cancel you. Concerns of various factions are actually
*  obviated or at least partially addressed by going pseudonymous as default, right? It is the opposite
*  of bring your whole self to work. It's bring only your necessary self to work, right? Only show those
*  credentials that you need, right? Now, of course, anybody using cryptocurrency understands Sushin
*  Nakamoto and so on is for this, but actually many progressives are for this as well. Why?
*  You don't ban the boxes. It's like you're not supposed to ask about felony convictions when
*  somebody is being hired because they've served their time, right? Or you're not supposed to ask
*  about immigration status or marital status in an interview. And people have this concept of blind
*  auditions where if a woman is auditioning for a violin seat, they put it behind a curtain so they
*  can't downgrade her for playing, so her performance is judged on merits of its audible quality, not in
*  terms of who this person is. So this way they don't discriminate versus male or female for
*  who's getting a violin position. So you combine those concepts like ban the box,
*  not asking these various questions, blind auditions, and then also the concept of implicit
*  bias. If you believe this research, people are unconsciously biased towards other folks, right?
*  Okay, so you take all that, you take Satoshi and you put it together and you say, okay,
*  let's use pseudonyms. That actually takes unconscious bias even off the table, right?
*  Because now you have genuine global equality of opportunity. Moreover, you have all these people,
*  billions of people around the world that might speak with accents, but they type without them.
*  And now if they're pseudonymous, you aren't discriminating against them, right? Moreover,
*  with AI, very soon, the AI version of Zoom, you'll be able to be whoever you want to be
*  and speak in whatever voice you want to speak in, right? And you'll be, and that'll happen in real
*  time. So, I mean, this is really interesting. For Finsta and Rinsta, there's some sense in which
*  the fake Instagram you're saying is where you could be a real self. Well, my question is under
*  pseudonym or when you're completely anonymous, is there some sense where you're not actually being
*  your real self? That as a social entity, human beings are fundamentally social creatures.
*  And for us to be social creatures, there is some sense in which we have to have a consistent
*  identity that can be canceled, that can be criticized or applauded in society. And that
*  identity persists through time. So is there some sense in which we would not be our full,
*  beautiful human selves unless we have a lifelong, consistent real name attached to us in a digital
*  world? So this is a complicated topic, but let me make a few remarks. First is real names,
*  quote unquote, state names were not built for the internet. They're actually state names, right?
*  It's actually a great way of thinking about it, social security name, right? So your state name,
*  your official name was not built for the internet. Why? They give both too much information and too
*  little. Okay. So too much information because someone with your name can find out all kinds
*  of stuff about you. Like for example, if someone doesn't want to be stalked, right? The real name
*  is out there, the stalker knows it. They can find address information, all this other kind of stuff,
*  right? And with all these hacks that are happening, just every day we see another hack, massive hack,
*  etc. That real name can be indexed into data that was supposed to be private, right? Like for example,
*  the Office of Personnel Management, the government, the US government, many governments actually,
*  are like a combination of the surveillance state and the Keystone cops, right? Why? They slurp up
*  all the information and then they can't secure it. So it leaks out the back door. Okay. They basically
*  have 100 million records of all this very, 300 million records, all this very sense of data.
*  They just get owned, hacked over and over again, right? And so really there should be something
*  which totally inverts the entire concept of KYC and what have you. And of course, comply with the
*  regulations as they are currently written. But also you should argue privacy over KYC, the government
*  should not be able to collect what it can't secure. It's slurping up all this information.
*  It's completely unable to secure it. It's hacked over and over again. China probably has the entire
*  OPM file. And it's not just that. Texas is hacked and some of these hacks are not even detected
*  yet, right? And these are just the ones that have been admitted. And so what happens is
*  criminals can just run this stuff and find, okay, so that guy who's got that net worth online
*  and he merges various databases, they've got a bunch of addresses to go and hit. Okay.
*  So in that sense, real names were not, state names were not built for the internet. They just give
*  up too much information. In our actually existing internet environment, they give up too much
*  information. On the other hand, they also give too little. Why? If instead you give out LexFriedman.Eath,
*  or a similar crypto domain name or Urbit name or something like that. Now that's actually more
*  like a DNS. Okay. First, if you've got a LexFriedman.Eath, what can you do that?
*  Some you can do today, some you'll soon be able to do. You can pay LexFriedman.Eath,
*  you can message LexFriedman.Eath, you can look it up like a social profile, you can send files to it,
*  you can upload and download. Basically, it combines aspects of an email address, a website,
*  a username, et cetera, et cetera. Eventually, I think you'll go from email to phone number to
*  EMS address or something like that as the primary online identifier, because this is actually a
*  programmable name, right? Whereas a state name is not. Think about it, like a state name will have
*  apostrophes perhaps in it, or is that your middle name or this and that. That was a format that was
*  developed for the paper world, right? Whereas the ENS name is developed for the online world. Now,
*  the reason to say ENS or something like it, somebody in a village, their name might be Smith
*  because they were a blacksmith or Potter because they were a Potter, right? And same, I think your
*  surname, right now for many people it's .Eath and that reflects the Ethereum community. Your
*  surname online will carry information about you, like .Sol says something different about you,
*  .BTC says yet something different. I think we're going to have a massive fractionation of this
*  over time. We're still in the very earliest days of our internet civilization, right? 100, 200
*  years from now, those surnames may be as informative as say, Chen or Friedman or Srinivasan in terms of
*  what information they carry. Because the protocol, it's a civilization fundamentally that you're
*  associated with, right? Right. So there's some improvements to the real name that you could do
*  in the digital world, but do you think there's value of having a name that's persist throughout
*  your whole life that is shared between all the different digital and physical communities?
*  I think you should be able to opt into that, right? At which level? In terms of the society
*  that you're joining. Wait a minute. So can I murder a bunch of people in society one and then go to
*  society two and be like, I'm murder free, my name is- No, no. I don't mean it like that. No, no. Yeah.
*  But that's the application I'm interested in. Okay. Well, I'm not interested in the murder application,
*  but I'm just kidding. I would like you to prevent me, a person who's clearly bad for society,
*  from doing that. Sure, sure. Murder is going to be against the rules in almost every society.
*  And I mean, people will argue- Most likely, yeah. Yeah, most likely, right?
*  And except animals. Well, I'm thinking of like the Aztecs or the Mayas or something like that.
*  There's various, you know, the Soviet Union, there's weird edge case, unfortunately.
*  Prom boards. Yeah. There's societies, unfortunately,
*  that have actually, that's why I asterisked it. But let's say murder is something that society one
*  probably has effectively, a social smart contract or a social contract that says that's illegal,
*  therefore you're in jail, therefore you're deprived of the right to exit. But upon entry into that
*  society, in theory, you would have said, okay, I accept this quote, social contract, right?
*  Obviously, if I kill somebody, I can't leave. Okay. So you've accepted upon crossing the border
*  into there, right? Now, as I mentioned, you know, like what is murder? Like people will,
*  I mean, there's an obvious answer, but as I said, there's been human sacrifice in some societies,
*  communism, they kill lots of people, Nazism, they kill lots of people. Unfortunately, there's
*  quite a lot of societies. You know, I wanted to say it's an edge case, but maybe many of the 20th
*  century societies around the world have institutionalized some kind of murder,
*  whether it was the Red Terror, you know, in the Soviet Union, or obviously the Holocaust,
*  or, you know, the Cultural Revolution or year zero and so on and so forth, right? So my point there
*  is that who is committing all those murders? It was the state, it was the organization
*  that one is implicitly trusting them to track you, right? And how did they commit those murders? Well,
*  how did Lenin, you know, you know, the hanging order, you know, I'm talking about the hanging
*  order for the Kulaks? Yes. Okay. The famous hanging order, which actually showed they're
*  actually bloodthirsty. The key thing was he said, here's a list of all the quote, rich men, the
*  Kulaks go and kill them. The real names, the state names were what facilitated the murder.
*  They didn't prevent the murderers there, right? So my point is just in the ethical weighting of it,
*  it's a two-sided thing, right? You're right that the tracking can, you know, prevent disorganized
*  murders, but the tracking facilitates, unfortunately, organized murders. Lists of
*  undesirables were the primary tool of all of these oppressive states in the 20th century.
*  You see my point? I see your point, and it's a very strong point.
*  It's a cynical point, which is that the rule of a centralized state is more negative than positive.
*  I think it is a, it is like, it's like nuclear energy. Okay. It's, it's, it's like fire. It is
*  something which, um, you're going to keep having it reform because there's, there's good reasons
*  where you have centralization, decentralization, re-centralization, but power corrupts, absolute
*  power corrupts, absolutely. And you just have to be very suspicious of this kind of centralized
*  power. The more trust you give it, often the less trusted it deserves. It's like a weird feedback
*  loop, right? The more trust, the more it can do, the more it can do, the more bad things it will do.
*  So, okay. There is a lot of downside to the state being able to track you.
*  And history teaches us lessons, one at a large scale, especially in the 20th century,
*  at the largest of scale, as they can do, commit a large amount of murder and suffering.
*  And by the way, history isn't over. If you think about what the Chinese are building
*  on this, right? That surveillance state, it's not just tracking your name, it's tracking everything
*  on you. You know, like WeChat is essentially like, it, it is all the convenience and none of the
*  freedom. So that's the downside. But don't you, the question is, I think probably fundamentally
*  about the human nature of an individual, of how much murder there would be if we can just
*  disappear every time we murder at the individual level.
*  So the issue is basically like, once one realizes that the moral trade-off has two
*  poles to it. And moreover, that basically centralized organized murder has, I mean,
*  if we add up all the disorganized murder of the 20th century, it's probably significantly
*  less than the organized murder that these states facilitated. And probably by, you know,
*  R.J. Rommel has this thing called Democide. And the thing is, it's so grim, right? Because,
*  you know, it's saying like, one death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic, right?
*  These are just like, just incalculable tragedies that we can't even, you know, understand. But,
*  you know, nevertheless engaging with it, like, you know, I don't know, is the ratio 10x? Is it
*  100x? I wouldn't be surprised if it's 100x. Yeah, but have you seen the viciousness,
*  the negativity, the division within online communities that have anonymity?
*  So that's the thing is basically you, there's also a sila and a syriptus. I'm not, you know,
*  when you see what centralization can do, and you correct in the direction of decentralization,
*  you can over-correct with decentralization and you get anarchy. And this is basically,
*  then you want to re-centralize, right? And this is the, you know, I think it's the romance of
*  the three kingdoms, the empire long, united must divide, the empire long, divided must unite.
*  That's always the way of it, right? So what's going to happen is we will state certain verbal
*  principles, right? And then the question is where in state space you are. Are you too centralized?
*  Well, then, okay, you want to decentralize. And are you too decentralized? Only you want to
*  centralize and maybe track more, right? And people opt into more tracking because they will get
*  something from that tracking, which is a greater deal of societal stability. So it's kind of like
*  saying, are we going north or south? And the answer is like, what's our destination? Where's
*  our current position in the civilizational state space? Well, my main question, I guess, is,
*  does creating a network state escape from some of the flaws of human nature? The reason you got
*  Nazi Germany is a large scale resentment with different explanations for that resentment
*  that ultimately lives in the heart of each individual. They made up the entirety of Nazi
*  Germany and had a charismatic leader that was able to channel that resentment into action,
*  into actual policies, into actual political and military movements. Can't you not have the same
*  kind of thing in digital communities as well? Have you heard the term argumentum ad Hitlerum
*  or like Godwin's law or something like, you know, it's something where if the reference point is
*  Hitler, it's this thing where a lot of things break down. But I do think, I mean, look, is there
*  any, did Bitcoin manage to get where it was without a single shot being fired to my knowledge? Yes,
*  right? Did Google manage to get to where it is without shots being fired? Absolutely. And
*  while a lot of shots were being fired elsewhere in the world. Sure. But who's firing those shots?
*  But that's because Bitcoin and Google are a tiny minority of communities. It's like the icing on
*  the cake of human civilization. Sure. Basically, any technology, I mean, like you can use a hammer
*  to go and hit somebody with it, right? I'm not saying every technology is equally destructive
*  or what have you, but you can conceive of, it's kind of like rule 34, but for technology, right?
*  You can probably figure out- Your ability to reference brilliant things throughout is quite
*  admirable. Yes. But anyway, sorry, rule 34 for technology. Rule 34, but for abusive technology,
*  you can always come up with a black mirror version of something. And in fact, there is this kind of
*  funny tweet, which is like a sci-fi author. My book, Don't Invent the Torment Nexus was meant
*  to be a cautionary tale on what would happen if society invented the torment nexus. And then it's
*  like tech guys, at long last, we have created the torment nexus. And so the thing is that simply
*  describing something, some abuse, unfortunately, after the initial shock wears off,
*  people will unconsciously think of it as sort of an attractor in the space, right? It's like,
*  I'll give you some examples, like Minority Report had the gesture thing, right? And the connect was
*  based on that. So it's a dystopian movie, but had this cool kind of thing and people kind of keyed
*  off it, right? Or people have said that movies like Full Metal Jack, that was meant to be,
*  my understanding is meant to be like an anti-war movie, but lots of soldiers just love it despite
*  the fact that the drill sergeant is actually depicted as a bad guy, right? For the portrayal
*  of that kind of environment, right? So I'm just saying it's like giving the vision of the digital
*  Hitler or whatever is not actually a vision I want to paint. I do think everything is possible.
*  Obviously, ISIS uses the internet, right? Like, is it-
*  Yeah, we're not bringing up Hitler in a shallow argument. We're bringing up Hitler in a long,
*  empathetic, relaxed discussion, which is where Hitler can live in a healthy way. There's deep
*  lessons in Hitler and Nazi Germany as there is with Stalin, yes.
*  So let's talk about it. Okay, so in many ways, and this is a very superficial way of talking
*  about it, but this is, exit is the anti-genocide technology, right? Because exit is the route of
*  the politically powerless. Exit is not, people will always say, oh, exit is for the rich or
*  that's actually not true. Most immigrants equals most immigrants are not rich. They're
*  politically powerless. You can describe exit.
*  What is exit? So there's this book which I reference a lot. I like it called Exit,
*  Voice, and Loyalty by Albert Hirschman, okay? And he essentially says, and I gave this talk
*  in 2013 that goes through this at YC Starb School, but just to describe these,
*  Voices reform, Exit is alternatives. For example, in the context of an open source project, Voices
*  submitting a bug and Exit is forking. In a company, Voices, you're saying, hey, here's a ticket
*  that I'd like to get solved and Exit is taking your business elsewhere, okay? At the level of
*  corporate governance, Voices, board directors vote and Exit is selling your shares, right?
*  In a country, Voices is a vote and Exit is migration, okay? And I do think that the two
*  forces we talk about a lot, democracy and capitalism, are useful forces. But there's
*  a third, which is migration, right? So you can vote with your ballot, you can vote with your
*  wallet, you can vote with your feet. Wallet has some aspects of Exit built into it, but voting
*  with your feet actually has some aspects of Voice built into it because when you leave, it's like an
*  amplifier on your vote. You might say 10 things, but when you actually leave, then people take what
*  you said seriously. You're not just complaining or whatever. You actually left San Francisco
*  because it was so bad on this and this issue and you've actually voted with your feet. It is
*  manifest preference as opposed to state of preference. So Voice versus Exit is this
*  interesting dichotomy. Do you try to reform the system or do you exit it and build a new one or
*  seek an alternative? And then loyalty modulates this, where if you are a patriot as part of the
*  initial part of your conversation, like are you a traitor? You're giving up on our great thing or
*  whatever, right? And people push those buttons to get people to stick. That's like, I shouldn't say
*  the bad version. Let's say a common version. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. But then there's
*  the good version, which is, oh, maybe the price is down right now, but you believe in the cause.
*  So even if they're on paper, you would rationally exit, you believe in this thing and you're going
*  to stick with it. Okay. So loyalty can be again, good and bad, but it kind of modulates a trade
*  off between Voice and Exit. Okay. So given that framework, we can think of a lot of problems in
*  terms of, am I going to use Voice or Exit or some combination of, because they're not mutually
*  exclusive. It's kind of like, you know, left and right, some of these needs both together.
*  I think that one of the biggest things the internet does is it increases microeconomic leverage and
*  therefore increases exit in every respect of life. For example, you know, on every phone,
*  you can pick between Lyft and Uber, right? When you're at the store, you see a price on the shelf
*  and you can comparison shop, right? If it's Tinder, you can swipe, right? If it's Twitter,
*  you can click over to the next account. The back button is exit. The microeconomic leverage,
*  leverage in the sense of alternatives, right? This is like one of the fundamental things that
*  the internet does. It puts this tool on your desktop and now you can go and talk to an
*  illustrator or you can kind of build it yourself, right? By typing in some, you know, characters
*  into Dalit. And that makes the positive forces of capitalism more efficient,
*  increase in microeconomic leverage. And it's individual empowerment, right? And so our sort
*  of industrial age systems were not set up for that level of individual empowerment. Just to give you
*  like one example I think about, we take for granted every single website you go and log into, you can
*  configure your Twitter profile and you can make it dark mode or light mode and your name, all this
*  stuff is editable, right? How do you configure your USA experience? Is there a USA.gov that you edit?
*  Can you even edit your name there? Dark mode for USA. But I mean, just your profile, is there like
*  a national profile? I mean, there's like driver's license. Point is that it's assumed that it's not
*  like individually customizable quite in that way, right? Of course you can move around your house
*  and stuff like that. But it's not like your experience of the US is like configurable,
*  you know? Let me think about that. Let me think about sort of the analogy of it. So the
*  microeconomic leverage, you can switch apps. Can you switch your experience in small ways
*  efficiently multiple times a day in inside the United States? Well, the physical world.
*  I think you do, yeah, under the constraints of the physical world, you do like micro migrations.
*  So this is coming back to the hunter-gatherer, farmer-soldier, digital nomad kind of thing,
*  right? The digital nomad combines aspects of the V1 and the V2 for a V3, right? Because the digital
*  nomad has the mobility and freedom of the hunter-gatherer, but some of the consistency of
*  the civilization of the farmer and soldier, right? But coming back to this, like one other thing
*  about it is in the 1950s, if a guy on assembly line might literally push the same button for 30
*  years, okay? Whereas today you're pushing a different key every second, right? That's like
*  one version of like microeconomic leverage. Another version is, you know, in the 1980s,
*  I mean, they didn't have Google Maps, right? So you couldn't just like discover things off the
*  path. People would just essentially do, you know, home to work and work to home and home to work,
*  and a trip had to be planned, right? They were contained within a region of space, or you do
*  home to school, school to home, home to school. You know, it wasn't like you went and explored
*  the map. Most people didn't, right? They were highly canalized, okay? Meaning, you know, it was
*  just back and forth, back and forth, very routine, just like the push the button, push the button,
*  trapped within this very small piece and also trapped within this large country because it was
*  hard to travel between countries and so on. Again, you know, of course there were vacations,
*  of course there were some degree of news and so on. Your mobility wasn't completely crushed,
*  but it was actually quite low, okay, relatively speaking. Just you were trapped in a way that
*  you weren't even really thinking about it, okay? And now that map has opened up. Now you can see
*  the whole map. You can go all over the place. You know, I don't have the data to show it, but I would
*  be shocked if people, the average person didn't go to more places, wasn't, you know, doing more
*  restaurants and things like that today than they were in the 80s, simply because the map is open,
*  okay? And the map is made more open through the digital world.
*  To the digital world, exactly. So we're reopening the map like the hunter-gatherer,
*  okay? Because you can now think about every site for very low costs that you can visit,
*  right? The digital world, I mean, how many websites have you visited? I don't know,
*  hundreds of thousands probably at this point over your life, right? How many places on the surfaces
*  there's your visit? You're actually unusual. You might be like a world traveler or have you, right?
*  But still, even your physical mobility is less than your digital mobility, right? You can just,
*  essentially, I mean, the entire concept of nations and borders and whatnot didn't exist in the
*  hunter-gatherer era, right? Because you couldn't build permanent fortifications and whatnot.
*  Even nations as we currently think of them with demarcated borders, you needed cartography,
*  you needed maps, right? That stuff didn't exist for a long time. You just had sort of a fuzzy area of
*  we kind of control this territory and these guys are on the other side of the river, okay?
*  I think just the- I don't want to digress too much, but yeah.
*  We're digressing away. I think entirety of life on earth is a kind of a digression,
*  which creates beauty and complexity as part of the digression. I think your vision of the network
*  state is really powerful and beautiful. I just want to linger on this real name issue.
*  Yes, real name. Let me just give you some data.
*  Go ahead. Personal anecdotal
*  experience data. There's a reason I only do this podcast in person. There is something lost in the
*  digital space. Oh, sure.
*  And I find- now, I personally believe to play devil's advocate against the devil's advocate that
*  I'm playing, I personally believe that this is a temporary thing. We will figure out technological
*  solutions to this, but I do find that currently people are much more willing to be on scale,
*  cruel to each other online than they are in person. The only- the way to do that,
*  I just visited Ukraine, went to the front. The way you can have people be cruel to each other in the
*  physical space is through the machinery of propaganda that dehumanizes the other side,
*  all that kind of stuff. That's really like hard work to do. Online, I find just naturally,
*  at the individual scale, people somehow start too easily engage in the drug of mockery,
*  derision, and cruelty when they can hide behind anonymity. I don't know what that says about
*  human nature. I ultimately believe most of us want to be good and have the capacity to do a lot of
*  good, but sometimes it's fun to be shitty, to shit on people, to be cruel. I don't know what that is.
*  It's weird because I think one of my sayings is, just like the internet increases microeconomic
*  leverage, the internet increases variance. For anything that existed before, you have the
*  zero and 100 versions of it. I'll give some examples, then I'll come to this. For example,
*  you go from the 30-minute sitcom to the 30-second clip or the 30-episode Netflix binge. You go from
*  95 to the guy who's 40 years old and has failed to launch, doesn't have a job or anything,
*  and the 20-year-old tech billionaire. You go from all kinds of things that were sort of
*  Gaussian or constrained on one location to extreme outcomes on both sides.
*  Applying that here, you are talking about the bad outcome, which I agree does happen, where the
*  internet in some sense makes people have very low empathy between others, but it also is the
*  other extent where people find their mental soulmates across the world. Someone who's living in
*  Thailand or in Latin America who thinks all the same stuff, just like them. Wow, you never met
*  this person before. You get to know them online, you meet in person. The brains have been
*  communicating for two years, three years, you've been friends, and you see them in person, it's
*  just great. It's not just the total lack of empathy, it is frankly far more empathy than you
*  would be able to build usually with an in-person conversation in the 80s or the 90s with someone
*  on the other side of the world because you might not even be able to get a visa to go to their
*  country or not even know they existed. How would you be able to find each other and so on and so
*  forth? It is kind of both. It is tearing society apart and it's putting it back together, both at
*  the same time. My main concern is this. What I see is that young people are for some reason more
*  willing to engage in the drug of cruelty online under the veil of anonymity. That's what you're
*  seeing publicly, but you're not seeing the private chats. I work for the intelligence agency, so I'm
*  seeing the private chats. I'm collecting all of your data. Yes, but you can intuit stuff,
*  and I don't think I'm being very selective. If you just look at the young folks, I am very concerned
*  about the intellectual, psychological growth of young men and women.
*  I'm not disagreeing with you on this. I am saying, however, there is a positive there that once we
*  see it, we can try to amplify that. Yes, with technology. I'm just saying the very basic
*  technology. I give stuff I code up over the weekend kind of thing. I think if I throw
*  anonymity on top of that, it will lead to many bad outcomes for young people. Anonymity, yes.
*  Pseudonymity, maybe not, because Reddit is actually fairly polite. The entirety of Reddit just chuckled
*  as you said that. Well, within a subreddit, it's actually fairly polite. It depends on which
*  subreddit, of course. There's a consistency. I think the definition of politeness is interesting
*  here because it's polite within the culture of that subreddit. Yes, they abide by, let me put it
*  in a different way, they abide by the social norms of that subreddit. That's the definition of
*  politeness. Yes, or civility is right. There is an interesting difference between pseudonymous
*  and anonymous, you're saying. It's possible that pseudonymity, you can actually avoid some of the
*  negative aspects. Absolutely. We're re-Dunbarizing the world in some ways. With China being the big
*  exception or outlier, the Dunbar number, 150 people, that's roughly the scale of your society.
*  That's the number of people that a human can keep in their brain. Whether apocryphal or not,
*  I think it's probably roughly true. We're re-Dunbarizing the world because,
*  A, we're making small groups much more productive, and B, we're making large groups much more
*  fractious. You have an individual like Notch who can program Minecraft by himself, or Satoshi who
*  could do V1 of Bitcoin by himself, or Instagram, which is just like 10 people, or WhatsApp is like
*  50 people when they sold. On the other hand, you have huge countries of hundreds of millions of
*  people that are just finding that the first and second principle, they're just splitting on
*  principle components. Scott Alexander thinks of them as scissor statements, statements that
*  one group thinks is obviously true, one group thinks is obviously false. You can think of them
*  as political polarization, you think of it in terms of game theory. There's lots of different
*  reasons you can give for why this happens, but those large groups now are getting split.
*  So you have both the unsustainability of these large artificial groups and the productivity of
*  these small organic ones. It's obvious that's the direction of civilizational rebirth. We just need
*  to lean into that. There's so many beautiful, we mentioned chocolates, advertising themselves,
*  your entirety speech is an intellectual box of chocolates. But okay, so I don't think we finished
*  defining the network state. Let's linger on the definition. You gave the one sentence statement,
*  which I think essentially encapsulated the online nature of it. I forget what else.
*  Can we just try to bring more richness to this definition of how you think about the network
*  state? Absolutely. So that informal sentence is a network state is a highly aligned online community
*  with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and
*  eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states. So we talked about was
*  the alignment of online communities and the capacity for collective action.
*  Well, one collective action, it could be a thousand people liking a tweet, right? If you
*  can get a thousand of a thousand people doing it. But a much higher level, much higher bar is a
*  thousand people crowdfunding territory and actually living together. Just like people
*  currently in physical space and not all in one place. That's critical. Just like Bitcoin is a
*  decentralized currency, the network is a recipe for a decentralized state like entity. Okay. Where
*  it starts with, for example, two people just get, they become roommates, they meet in this community,
*  they become roommates. Okay. They get their place together or 10 people get a group house
*  or eventually a hundred people just buy a small apartment building together. And guess what? They
*  start getting equity, not just paying rent. Okay. These are all people who share their values and
*  now they can crowdfund territory together. Now, of course they don't just jump straight from
*  a thousand people liking something to a thousand people are crowdfunding something.
*  What I described in the middle is you do a lot of meetups, you get to know these other people
*  before you decide to live, you know, collectively with them. Once you live with them, you start to
*  get a network effect. For example, if those a hundred people want to learn Spanish or Turkish
*  or Vietnamese, they could all have a building where they're doing Vietnamese immersion. Right.
*  And that's something which they get a benefit from being physically around the other people
*  that the pure digital wouldn't give them to quite the same extent. Right. And so crowdfund territory
*  around the world, crucially, not just one place, they're all connected by the internet, just like
*  Hawaii is 2000 miles away from the continental US, but both sides think of them as American,
*  but the people on Hawaii and people in the continental US. What's the role of having to
*  have territory if most of the exchange, so presumably as technology gets better and better,
*  the communication, the intimacy, the exchange of ideas all happens in a digital world. What's
*  the importance of being able to crowdfund territory? Well, because we're still physical
*  creatures. You can't reproduce yet digitally, right? There's still lots of things. So it's all
*  about sex. Well, that's going to be part of it. You're going to want to reproduce. Are we talking
*  about a cult? It's not a cult. Why can't you just take a train? Why is it not a cult?
*  It's not a cult because a cult is very internally focused and it tries to close its members off
*  from the outside world. This is much more how America itself was populated, where there were
*  lots of towns, like Penn is named after William Penn or the founder of Texas, like Sam Houston,
*  right? Lots of towns like the Oneida commune in Northern New York, they recruited and they became
*  a town and they became actually the Oneida glassware company, kind of makes glassware out of
*  there. All of these communities that were opt-in voluntary communities were not simply like cults
*  that were closed off from the world. They were meant to set an example to the world of what
*  virtuous living looked like and they were trying to recruit from the rest of the world. They were
*  exporting goods to the rest of the world, right? So it is, yes, reproduction, it's marriage and kids
*  and so on, but it's also just hanging out and it is just the physical world is very high bandwidth.
*  There's lots of stuff, it's fun to just go and have a dinner in person just to hang out to build
*  things. Moreover, there's also lots of innovation that can only take place in the physical world.
*  One of my sayings in the book is cloud first, land last, but not land never, okay? In many ways,
*  one of the problems the book solves is Teal's problem of we have innovation in bits, but not
*  in atoms, right? We can build a billion dollar company online, but we need a billion permits to
*  build a shed in San Francisco, right? How do you reconcile that? Well, what is stopping the innovation
*  in atoms? It is a thicket of regulations. What are those regulations? Ultimately, a social
*  construction. If you lean into the whole deconstructionist school of thinking,
*  you can deconstruct and then reconstruct the state itself given sufficient social consensus online,
*  okay? If the population of Nevada had 100% consensus, you could just dissolve every law
*  in Nevada in theory and then build new ones, okay? So the online consensus of getting people
*  to agree on something is upstream of what happens offline. So once you have consensus in bits,
*  the human consensus, also cryptographic consensus, cryptocurrency consensus,
*  then you can reshape the world of atoms. The reason we can't reshape the world of atoms right
*  now is because you don't have that consensus of minds, okay? For example, in SF, anything you do,
*  there's going to be 50% of people who are against you. So that's just a recipe for gridlock. Whereas
*  if you have a bare piece of land that everybody agrees on, you can get 70,000 units get set up
*  in Burning Man in just a few days, okay? That's the power of when you actually have human consensus.
*  And one way I talk about this also in the book a little bit, and this is going to go much more
*  into detail in the V2, I think of this as 100% democracy as opposed to 51% democracy. 51%
*  democracy, which is the current form of government, is 49% dictatorship. Because the entire premise
*  of democracy is about the consent of the governed, right? That's actual legitimating underpinning
*  principle. And in so far as 49% did not consent to the current president or prime minister or whatever,
*  let's say presidential system first past the post, okay? In so far as 49% did not consent,
*  or in a prime minister system, it could be like 60% or more didn't consent to the current leader.
*  Those folks are having something imposed on them that they literally did not vote for.
*  Moreover, campaign promises are non-binding. So whatever they voted for, they can effectively be
*  defrauded. The actual voter fraud is when a politician promises X but does not do it. It's
*  as if you bought a can of orange juice and it actually drinking its milk or it's nothing,
*  right? So all of that is routinized, all of that is accepted. We have this thing which is just
*  the minimum possible amount of democracy of 51%, okay? And what happens is then that 50%
*  tries to ram something down the 49% throat and then the next election is now 51-49 the other way
*  and then they ram it back. And that's how you get the seesaw that is just splitting countries apart,
*  right? The alternative to that is you build a consensus online, you go and get some god-forsaken
*  patch of territory. Actually, the worse the territory, the better. Why? Because it's like
*  Burning Man. Nobody cares, right? The nicer the piece of land, the more the people are going to
*  argue about it. But Starlink has repriced the world. Basically, all kinds of pieces of territory
*  that were previously, you know, they're far away from natural ports, they're far away from natural
*  resources, all kinds of pieces of territory around the world now have satellite internet.
*  And so what you can do is, again, the map has been reopened, right? What we were talking about
*  earlier. The map has been reopened. You can gather your community online. They're now capable of
*  collective action. You can point here. This place has great Starlink coverage. You go there like the
*  Verizon guy, you know, can you hear me now? Good, right? You see that the coverage is good there.
*  You drive out there, you test it out. Maybe you do it with mobile homes first, right? This, by the way,
*  is its own thing. There's Yimby and there's NIMBY and there's YIMBY, but I actually also like Himby.
*  Okay. Do you want that? Did I change the- Let's go with NIMBY, YIMBY, HIMBY. What are those?
*  So NIMBY is not in my backyard, don't build in cities. YIMBY is let's build high density
*  buildings, really tall buildings and so on in cities. There's a third version, which is Himby,
*  my little acquaintance, which is horizontal sprawl is good. Why horizontal sprawl? Because
*  to build a skyscraper, to build a tall building in a city, you have this enormous permitting process,
*  all of this stuff, which has to get done. It's expensive. It's time consuming. The way that
*  cities were built, if you go back to the V1, what does the startup city look like? It looks like
*  something like Burning Man. It looks like the cities of the Wild West. They were not multi-story
*  buildings. They were basically things that were just like one story and someone could have it
*  there in the dust and then you build roads and stuff between them. They can move them around.
*  It was a much more dynamic geography. And so when you have that as a vision of what a startup city
*  looks like, now you've got something. There's a company I find called Kift, which is like Van Life.
*  There's a lot of stuff in construction that makes this feasible. There's so-called man camps
*  for fracking where people can just do like companies like a Greco. They provide power.
*  You can bring water, all this stuff on site. So it's easy to actually snap this stuff to grid,
*  relatively speaking, if you've got horizontal space, you pick this space, you crowd from the
*  territory, now you've got a city. And the last bit is, eventually gains diplomatic recognition
*  from pre-existing states. And this is the part that different people will be with me up to this
*  point and then they'll say, okay, that's the part I disagree with or how are you going to ever do
*  that? They'll say, yeah, you can build an online community. I believe you can get them to do
*  collective action. And of course, people have crowdfunded land and moving together and doing
*  it at a larger scale. All that I believe, how are you possibly ever going to gain diplomatic recognition
*  from pre-existing states? You dumb delusional tech bro. That's a common thing. That's about the tone
*  of it as well. And so first I would say, sovereigns are already out for business. They're inking deals.
*  Okay. Nevada, inked a deal with Tesla to build the Geiger factory. El Salvador has Bitcoin as
*  its national currency. Wyoming has done the Dow law where Ethereum is now recognized, where you
*  can have on-chain incorporations that are recognized by Wyoming law. Virginia and New York
*  negotiate with Amazon for HQ2. Tuvalu signed a deal with GoDaddy for the .tv domain. Columbia
*  signed a deal for the .co domain and on and on and on. Sovereigns are open for business. Sovereigns
*  are doing deals with companies and with currencies. Sovereigns at the level of cities like Miami or
*  New York where the mayors are accepting their salary in Bitcoin. States like Wyoming or Nevada
*  has its new private cities legislation or entire countries like El Salvador. So-
*  When you say sovereigns, by the way, you mean the old school physical nation states, governments?
*  Fiat states.
*  Fiat states. But the Fiat isn't the thing that makes a state. What makes a state is geographical
*  location. It is something where, they're both, right? So basically it's a play on words. So just
*  like Fiat currency is cryptocurrency, we will have Fiat country and crypto country, right? And in fact,
*  you can think of the Fiat and crypto version of almost anything. One thing I'll come to later is
*  a big thing. The big thing I think comes after digital currency is digital passports.
*  Okay. And that's a big part of this whole network thing, which we'll come back to.
*  So that last bit, the reason I just mentioned all those deals between sovereigns, whether at the city,
*  US state, or UN listed country level, okay? And on the other hand, so that's on one side of the
*  market and the other side are the companies and the currencies. Why could we not have online
*  communities, right? Making those deals.
*  So diplomatic recognition, but aren't you still attached to the responsibilities
*  that come from being a member of a sovereign, old school nation state? Can you possibly escape that?
*  So yes, and let me give you a concrete example. Israel. Okay. Why? People talk about, a lot of
*  people are like, oh, he took this from Snow Crash or some sci-fi book they'll reference.
*  Remember, actually, there's many different references to the book. This is not the only
*  reference, but a very important reference that I think is much more important to me than Snow
*  Crash, which is good, a good book, whatever, but it's fictional, is Dierdudensstadt by Theodor
*  Herzl, which translates as the Jewish state. And that led to the foundation of Israel. And that's
*  very real. It's worth reading because it's amazing. Theodor Herzl was like a tech founder, okay?
*  In the book, he was writing about the death of distance in 1897. Why? Because steam ships could
*  take you across countries, okay? And he was just amazingly smart and practical guy,
*  who just handled all these various objections. And he said, look, the Jewish people, our choices are
*  either A, assimilate and give up the culture, or B, some people are thinking communism is a good idea,
*  I disagree with that. We should do C, build our own country, right? And that was considered totally
*  crazy. But what he did was he A, wrote a book, B, started a fund, C, organized a semiannual
*  conference, the World Zionist Congress, and the fund and the Congress are still going today.
*  Crucially, there were a bunch of intermediate stages between the book and the idea and then
*  the actual state of Israel in 1947. For example, the folks who were committed Zionists got together
*  and started crowdfunding territory in what is now Palestine. And in fact, though,
*  Palestine was only one choice. In the book, they also had Argentina as a choice. So this is my
*  concept, cloud first, land last, and the land's a parameter you can choose, right? Other places that
*  were considered at various points like Madagascar, Bir-Bidzin in the former Soviet Union, right? So
*  land was a parameter, Palestine went out because of its historical religious importance. Now,
*  by the way, one thing, I'm sure there's some fraction of viewers will be like, oh my God,
*  all the bad stuff that happened. I'm obviously not denying that there's enormous amounts of
*  controversy and so on that attends Israel. I consider myself generally pro-Israeli. I also
*  consider myself pro-Palestinian. I fund lots of Palestinians and so on and so forth. So I'm leaving
*  that part out, that huge conflict for now, okay? And you might say that's airbrushing it. I don't
*  mean it to do that. I'm saying here is the positive things they did. Can we take the positive and not
*  have the negative? And I'll come back to how we might swap those parts out. But let me just talk
*  about this a little bit more. So one of the things that happened was committed Zionists went and
*  crowdfunded territory in what is now Israel and they knit it together, right? Why? Because when
*  you're physically present on territory, yes, in theory, like the British Empire was in control,
*  they were the sovereign, okay? In practice, who were the boots on the ground, the facts on the
*  ground, right? There was the people who were actually tilling the land and building the
*  buildings and so on and so forth. Like who had the claim there is like the people who are present,
*  okay? Now, this territory, this network of territories eventually became the basis for
*  or part of the basis for what became Israel. Now, I'm fully aware that the exact configuration of
*  what territory belongs to Israel, what territory belongs to Palestinians, this is an enormous topic
*  of dispute, okay? But I just point this out to say the pros of going from book to crowdfunding
*  territory to a sovereign state where people were now citizens of Israel as opposed to the British
*  Empire is not some fictional thing, but did happen and within the lifetimes of some of the older,
*  you know, they're in their 80s now, but in the lifetimes of some older people, okay? So it's
*  not impossible. In fact, it has happened, right? Okay. But for that step, then perhaps hopefully
*  is a better example because in this particular, like you said, land last, if I were to say that
*  if I was an alien and arrived at earth and say choice of land, maybe if you were interested
*  in choosing a land that represents a network state where ideas that unites a people
*  based on ideas, maybe pick a land that doesn't lead to generational conflict and war.
*  Yes. So I'll get to that point.
*  And destruction and suffering and all that.
*  All this stuff. That's right. So now that I've said what are the positive things about Israel,
*  and I think there's a lot to admire in Israel. As I said, I think there's also a lot to admire
*  in the Palestinians and so on. I'm not taking any position on that. There's other inspirations
*  for the network state. The second major inspiration is India, which managed to achieve
*  independence nonviolently, right? That's very important, right? So can you fuse these things,
*  right? A state started with a book that achieved independence nonviolently, okay?
*  That managed to build this polyglot, multicultural democracy, right? That does,
*  India has its flaws, but it does manage to have human rights of lots of people respected and
*  what have you, right? And has managed to, there were times like emergency in the 1970s in
*  Dhiraghandi, declared emergency. There are times when seem touch and go, but overall with fits and
*  starts, this flawed thing has kind of made its way through. And the third inspiration is
*  Singapore with Lee Kuan Yew, who built a city state from nothing. I shouldn't say from nothing.
*  Okay, there was something there, but let's say built one of the richest countries in the world
*  without huge amounts of natural resources in the middle of a zone where there was lots of
*  communist revolution going on. And so he was the CEO founder essentially of this amazing startup
*  country, right? And finally, of course, America, which has too many influences to name things we
*  talked about the nation of immigrants, obviously the constitution and so on. And you think, okay,
*  can we go, you think of these inspirations, what's interesting about these four countries, by the way,
*  Israel, India, Singapore, and the US, they have something in common, you know what that is?
*  They're all forks of the UK code base. We think obviously, you know, the UK was sort of the
*  ancestor of America, but Israel was a former British colony, right? India was a British colony
*  and so was Singapore, right? And for people who don't know what fork and code base means,
*  it's a language from versioning systems, particularly get represented online on a
*  website called GitHub. And a fork means you copy the code and all the changes you make to the code
*  now live in their own little world. So America took the ideas that define the United Kingdom and then
*  forked it by evolving those ideas in a way that didn't affect the original country.
*  That's right. And what's interesting about this is, and of course, I'm saying that in a somewhat
*  playful way, right? But I think it's a useful analogy, interesting analogy, right? So you have
*  the Americans who forked, you know, the UK code base, and then you have, you know, the Indians,
*  Israelis, and the Singaporeans who also made their own modifications. And in some ways,
*  each society has pieces that you can take from them and learn from them and try to combine them,
*  right? So you have a state that is started by a book that nonviolently assembles that crowd funds
*  territory around the world that is led by a CEO founder and that is also governed by something
*  that's like a constitution. But just like you went from, you know, I talk about the V1, V2,
*  and V3 a lot, right? Like V1 is gold and V2 is fiat and V3 is Bitcoin, right? Or V1 is hunter
*  gatherer and V2 is farmer soldier, V3 is digital nomad or sovereign collective, okay? Which is not
*  just an individual but a group. Here, V1 is UK common law. They don't have a constitution. It's
*  just all precedent going for many years, right? V2 is the US constitution and V3 is the smart
*  contract, the social smart contract, which is a, you know, fusion obviously of Rousseau's concept
*  of the social contract and the smart contract. The social smart contract is like written in code,
*  okay? So it's like even more rigorous than the constitution. And in many ways, you can think of
*  going from the United Kingdom of England, Wales, you know, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the United
*  States of America, the network states of the internet, okay? Where you go from the rights
*  of Englishmen with the Magna Carta to Europeans, African Americans, all the immigrants to the,
*  you know, the Americans or the, you know, North America, then you go to all the people of the
*  world. And so you basically are more democratic and you're more capitalist because you're talking
*  about internet capitalism, not just nation state law capitalism. In a sense, it's the V3, right?
*  In other ways, it's the V3. Only about 2% of the world is over 35 native born American,
*  can qualify to be president of the United States. But 100% of the world, you can become the president
*  of a network state. There might be a, you know, Palestinian Washington or a, you know, Brazilian
*  Hamilton, right? And now rather than say, okay, maybe you're, maybe you have a small percentage
*  chance of immigrating to the US and a small percentage chance of your descendant, you know,
*  becoming like, you know, president. Now we can just say, you can start online. And you know what,
*  maybe this person is so exceptional, they have Americans coming to their, you know, network state,
*  right? You don't think that kind of thing is possible with like the rich get richer
*  in a digital space too, the people with more followers have friends that have followers and
*  they like, I don't think it's a rich get richer. I think what happens is, so this is an important
*  concept, it is, it's multi-axis, right? That is to say, for example, just the introduction of the
*  Bitcoin axis, right? And those, because it didn't exist pre 2009, now it exists. Those people who
*  are rich in BTC terms are only partially correlated with those who are rich in USD terms. There's all
*  these folks who essentially- BTC is Bitcoin and USD is US dollar.
*  Yes. So that's a new axis and ETH is yet another axis, right? You-
*  Ethereum, ETH is Ethereum.
*  Right. So you are essentially getting new social systems, which are actually net inequality
*  decreasing because before you only had USD millionaires and now you have a new track
*  and then another track and another track, right? You have different hierarchies, different ladders,
*  right? And so on net, you have more ladders to climb. And so it's not the rich getting richer.
*  In fact, old money in some ways is a last to cryptocurrency. Old money and old states,
*  I think those people who are the most focused on, you might call it reform, I would call it control.
*  Okay. The most focused on control of the old world who have the least incentive to switch.
*  They will, the rich will get poorer because it will be the poor or those who are politically
*  powerless, politically poor, who go and seek out these new states.
*  Yeah. I didn't mean in the actual money, but yes, okay. There's other ladders. I meant in terms of
*  influence, political and social influence in these new network states. You, I think said that
*  basically anybody can become president of a network state. Just like anybody can become CEO
*  of a startup company. Of course, whether people follow you is another matter, but anybody can go
*  and found one. Go ahead. Sorry. Oh, from the perspective that anyone can found one. Anyone
*  could found, I see. We don't think it's implausible that somebody from Brazil or Nigeria, I mean,
*  most quote billionaires in the world are not American. And in fact, actually,
*  here's another important point. It's far easier to become a tech billionaire than become or a
*  billionaire period than become president of the United States. There's less than 50 US presidents
*  ever, all time. Okay. It is a much more realistic ambition to become a billionaire than become
*  president. There's like thousands of billionaires worldwide. In fact, 75% of them are outside of the
*  US and many of those have been, you know, some of them are like energy and oil, which is often
*  based on political connections, but a very large chunk of the rest are tech. Okay. And that's
*  something where you're mining, but you're mining online by hitting keys as opposed to with a
*  pickaxe, you know, and granite. Right. So the point is that we think it's totally understandable
*  today for there to be a, you know, huge founder who comes out of Vietnam or, you know, South America,
*  like that, like you can name founders from all over the world, right? Exceptional people can rise
*  from all over the world to run giant companies. Why can they not rise to run giant new countries?
*  And the answer is we didn't develop the mechanism yet. Right. And just as another example, I talked
*  about this in the book, Vitalik Buterin is far more qualified than Jerome Powell, right, or anybody
*  at the Federal Reserve. He actually built a car and managed a monetary policy and a currency from
*  scratch. Okay. As a 20 something, right. Obviously that's a more accomplished person than somebody
*  who just inherited an economy. This is a- A lot of people can push back at that and say that the
*  people that initially build a thing aren't necessarily the best ones to manage a thing
*  once it scales and actually has impact. Sometimes, sometimes, but Zuck has done a good job of both.
*  I think Vitalik has done a good job of both. Right. But that's not an inherent truth. Well,
*  so actually- If you built the thing, you will be the best person to run it. I will agree with you
*  on that. And actually I talk about this in the book, or I've got an essay on this called founding
*  versus inheriting. Okay. And the premise is actually that the classic example, you know,
*  the saying shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations. It means the guy who starts out poor
*  and builds a fortune, his son maintains it and his dissipate grandson dissipates it. Right.
*  Right. Why is shirt sleeves a symbol of poverty? Back in the past, it was kind of like, you know,
*  you're just working with your- You're not, you're not white collar. You're back to working with your
*  hands. You're just- Oh, so it's a blue collar to blue collar in three generations. Yeah, yeah.
*  We're working class or something like that. Right. So essentially that the grandson squanders it.
*  Right. And, you know, in sense, by the way, just to talk about that for a second, if you have two
*  children and four grandchildren and eight great grandchildren and 16 and so on, and older families,
*  you know, they were much bigger, right? Six, you know, children's not uncommon. Whatever fortune
*  you have is now split six ways and then six ways and six ways again. So with the exception of
*  premature where the oldest son inherits all the way down, the majority of descendants,
*  just a few generations out have probably inherited none of that fortune unless it is compounded to
*  such an extent that it's like up six acts over 20 years. Right. So it's actually hard to maintain
*  a quote ruling class in the sense that this person who's like four generations down has,
*  you know, like one 16th of the DNA, you know, one over two to the fourth, right,
*  of their, their scion who built a fortune. So it's not even like the same, is it the same family
*  even, right? Is the fortune actually in the family? So most people don't think a few generations out.
*  They just kind of think, oh, Marx is right. There's always been a rich and a poor. It's
*  actually much more dynamic than that because you literally like, what is even the family when it's
*  diluted out, you know, one 16th, right? If you're one 16th of Rockefeller, are you a Rockefeller?
*  Really like 15, 16 something else. Would you have the Rockefeller fortune? Probably not. Right. Now,
*  again, premature, where the guy who inherits the name all the way through,
*  that would be one way to pass it down. But even that person doesn't necessarily have the qualities
*  of the guy who, you know, the cultural qualities, other qualities, guy who's like four generations
*  past, they tend to squander it. Right. So this actually brings us to, you know, coming back up
*  to governance, the system, the guys who built the United States, you know, like Washington and
*  Hamilton. These are giants, right? These are founders. And the folks today are like, not the
*  grandson, but like the 40th generation heir of a factory that somebody else built. Like think about
*  a factory and you have, you know, this grandchild or great grandchild that inherits a factory.
*  Most of the time it's just cranking out widgets and the great grandson is cashing checks.
*  They have been selected as the legitimate heir because it's the, you know, the founder passes
*  it down to his son, pass it down to his grandson, to his great grandson. So legitimacy is there.
*  They've got title. They can show, I own this factory. Okay. They can cash the checks. There's
*  professional managers there. Everything seems fine. Until one day that factory has to go from making,
*  you know, widgets to making masks for COVID or something else. It has to change direction. It
*  has to do something it hasn't done before. None of that capability for invention and reinvention is
*  present anymore. These people have inherited something that they could not build from scratch.
*  Because they could not build from scratch, they can't even maintain it. This is an important point.
*  The ability to build from scratch is so important because if some part breaks and you don't know why
*  it was there, can you even maintain it? No, you can't. Okay. Unless all the replacement parts and
*  the know how to fit them together is there, you can't repair this. So in 2009, Mother Jones had a
*  story that said that the US military had forgotten how to make some kinds of nuclear weapons because
*  there was a part where all the guys who knew how to make it had like aged out or left. Okay. And
*  this was some like aerogel or something like that. It was rumored. Okay. The thing is, you're seeing,
*  you know, increasingly, for example, you've got wildfires in California. You've got, you know,
*  water that's not potable in Jackson. You've got power outages in Texas. You're seeing a lot of the
*  infrastructure of the US is just less functional. I think probably part of that is due to civil
*  engineering not being that sexy a field, people aging out and just domain knowledge being lost.
*  And the heirs who win, you know, the role of mayor or whatever of this town don't have the ability to
*  build it from scratch. You're just selected for legitimacy, not competence. Okay. So once you think
*  about this concept of founding versus inheriting, and I've got the whole essay which talks about this,
*  of course, the alternative to somebody who's legitimate, but not competent, what people will
*  say is, oh, we need like, you know, an authoritarian to be in control of everything. And then
*  their hope is that that person is competent, but they don't have legitimacy because if they're just
*  installed as just like a authoritarian ruler, 50% of the population is really mad at them. They don't
*  have title. They just grab the title. You know, maybe they can exert enough force. That's the
*  problem with kind of the authoritarian, you know, dictator takeover, right? So the alternative,
*  the third version is the founder who combines both legitimacy and competence because they start from
*  scratch and they attract people to their vision and they build it from scratch. And so you need
*  is the ability to constantly do refounding rebirths. So if you imagine a world that is primarily
*  network states, can you help me imagine what that looks like? Now there's several ways to imagine
*  things, which is how many of them are there and how often do they, the new ones pop up?
*  There could be thousands given 7 billion people, 8 billion people on earth. Yeah. Yeah. So there's
*  network state in the, like the precise definition I have in the book, which is a diplomatically
*  recognized entity. And there's never seen sort of the loose definition where, you know, one thing
*  that's interesting is this term has become a lowercase term really fast. Okay. Yeah. Like in
*  the sense of Google became lowercase Google for like Googling or like Uber became lowercase Uber.
*  Like if you go to the networkstate.com from such reviews, or you go to search.twitter.com and put
*  in network state, you'll see it's just become like a word or a phrase. Okay. So that means it's sort
*  of whatever I intended to mean, people will use it to mean what they want it to mean. Right. Okay.
*  Internet. It's interesting. Right. You've become a meme. Well, first of all, you're a meme and this
*  book is a meme. Am I a meme? Okay. Maybe I'm a meme, but the book is, I think it's a good meme.
*  That's actually why I wanted to make it free. I wanted people to take it out there, make it
*  their own. And one of the things I say at the beginning, and I'll come back to this thing is
*  it's a toolbox, not a manifesto. Even if you dislike 70% of it, 80% of it, 90% of it,
*  if there's something that's useful to you, you can take that and use it just like a library,
*  a software library. You might just use one function there. Great. I'm glad I've delivered
*  you some value. Right. That's my purpose in this. Right. So you're not Ayn Rand.
*  No, I'm not Ayn Rand. And basically the whole point of this actually is it's polytheistic,
*  polystatistic, polynumeristic is genuinely- Is it polyamorous?
*  It's not polyamorous. Though somebody might-
*  Do you have love advice in the book? I didn't see it. So did you talk about love in-
*  I do not talk about love. I rather-
*  Maybe in V2 you will. Not that I don't believe in love. Love is great.
*  All right. I will accept your offer to write a guest chapter in your V2 book about love.
*  All right. Great.
*  Because there is some aspect that's very interesting. Which parts of human civilization
*  require physical contact, physical- Because it seems like more and more can be done in
*  digital space. Yeah. But as I said-
*  Like work, for example. But you're not going to build a
*  self-driving car city in digital space. You're not going to be able to do-
*  Oh, why do you need cars at all? Well, sure. But let's say you're not going to be able to
*  get to Mars in a purely digital thing. You need to build- You have to have a little rocket launch
*  pad. You're not going to be able to do all the innovative biomedicine, whether it's-
*  All the- Have you seen bioelectricity or there's stuff on regenerative medicine,
*  STEMs, all this stuff? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You just can't do that digitally, right? We're still physical beings. So you need
*  physical space, but how do we get that? This is meant to wend its way through various roadblocks
*  in the so-called- Actually, my term from many years ago, the idea maze, it's meant to wend
*  its way through the idea maze to find how to use bits to re-unlock innovation in atoms.
*  The idea maze within the bigger prime number maze, or go back to visualizing the number of
*  states and how often are they born. Okay. So let me first anchor this because
*  people, just to give some numbers, right? How many UN listed countries are there? Like 196,
*  193, okay? And there's some that are on the border like Taiwan or Israel, right?
*  Israel is a country, but it's not recognized by every country or what have you, right?
*  Is Texas a country? No, but it may eventually become. Right. Okay. So
*  within that list of about 200 countries, okay, I've got a graph in the book that shows that
*  most countries are actually small countries. There's 12 countries that have less than 100,000
*  people by the UN definition of a country. There's another 20 something that have between 100,000 and
*  1 million. There's another 50 or 60 something that have between a million and 10 million.
*  So most countries in the UN are less than 10 million people. There's only 14 countries
*  that are over a hundred million people. Okay. So most countries are small countries is kind of
*  surprising to us because most people live in big countries. Okay. And so now you're like, okay,
*  well, I've built social networks that are bigger than that. You have a following that's bigger
*  than a hundred thousand people. You have a following that's bigger than a small country
*  like Kiribati or what have you, right? And okay. So that first changes feasibility. You think of a
*  country as this huge, huge, huge thing, but it's actually smaller than many countries are smaller
*  than social networks that you've built. Okay. Number one. Number two is the number of UN listed
*  countries, even though it's been flat ish for the last 30 years with like a few things like South
*  Sudan and East Timor that have come online. There's a graph that I posted, which shows that it's
*  increased by about from about 40 or 50 something at the end of World War II when the UN was set up
*  to 197 today. There's been like kind of a steady increase in particular with all the decolonization,
*  all the countries that got their independence first from the British Empire and then from the
*  Soviet Empire, right? That Imperial breakup led to new countries. Okay. And so the question is,
*  is that flat forever? Well, the number of new currencies similarly increased for a while,
*  roughly one per country or thereabouts. And then it was flat for a while. And then suddenly it's
*  gone completely vertical. That's an interesting graph, right? Where it's like linear ish,
*  then it's flat, and then it just goes like this. Now you can define, you can argue where the
*  boundary is for quote a new currency. Okay. But I think Bitcoin certainly counts. I think
*  Ethereum certainly counts in terms of just its scale and adoption worldwide. So at least you have
*  two. If you take the broad church view, you have a thousand or something like that, right? Somewhere
*  in between, you might say how many currencies are above the market cap of an existing previously
*  recognized fiat currency, which got onto the leaderboard, right? There's a website,
*  just like coinmarketcap.com. That's a site for cryptocurrency tracking. It's very popular. Okay.
*  There's a fun site called fiatmarketcap.com, which shows where Bitcoin is relative to the fiat
*  currencies of the world. And it's like, last I checked, like number 27, somewhere in between
*  the Chilean peso and the Turkish lira or something. Okay. And it had previously been close
*  to cracking the top 10. Okay. And I think it will again at some point. So we know that you can have
*  a currency out of nowhere that ranks with the fiat currencies of the world. Could you have a
*  country out of nowhere that ranks with the countries of the world? So this is maybe the
*  fastest way you probably should have said this at the very beginning. If you go to the network state
*  in one image, okay, that kind of summarizes what a network state looks like in a visual, just one
*  single visual. And the visual is of a dashboard. And the dashboard shows something that looks like
*  a social network, except you're visualizing it on the map of the world. And it's got network
*  nodes all over the place. A hundred people here, a thousand people there, they're all connected
*  together. The total population of the people in this social network is about 1 million people.
*  So 1.7 million people in this example. And some of the buildings are, some of the people are just
*  singletons. They're just folks in their apartment who conceptualize themselves as citizens of this
*  network state. And they've got the flag on their wall, right? And the digital passport on their
*  phone, along with the digital currency. Others are groups of hundreds or thousands or even
*  tens of thousands of people that have all taken over a neighborhood, just like Chinatowns exist,
*  right? Just like intentional communities existed. They just basically go in crowdfunding
*  lane together, right? And these are all networked together. Just like the islands of Indonesia are
*  separated by ocean, these are islands of this network state that are separated by intranet.
*  Okay? So they conceptualize themselves as something. And at the very top of the dashboard,
*  there's something very important, which is the population annual income and real estate
*  footprint of this network state. So the population we already discussed, you can build an online
*  social network. We know you can build something which has a population that's bigger than these
*  hundred thousand or million person countries. One of the new things contributions the network state has
*  is say that you can not just exceed in population, you can exceed in real estate footprint.
*  Because one way of thinking about it is, I don't exactly know the numbers on foreign ownership in
*  Estonia, but let's say to first order, the million something Estonians own and could afford Estonia.
*  Okay? A million people could buy a territory that is the size of Estonia, right? That's probably true
*  to first order. There might be some overseas ownership, but it's probably true, okay? You
*  probably find a country for which that's true. What that means is a million people digitally could
*  buy distributed territory that is probably greater than or equal to the size of Estonia,
*  especially if they're buying like desert territory or stuff like that. Which means now you have a
*  digital country that is ranking not just in people, not just in real estate footprint. So it's also in
*  real estate footprint with the countries of the world. So you start ranking and you're bigger
*  than these UN listed countries in your population and your real estate footprint. And then the third
*  is income. Okay? You can prove on chain that you have a income for the digital population that is
*  above a certain amount, right? This is what I call the census of the network state. And it's actually
*  such a crucial component that I have it in the essay, the network state in a thousand words.
*  The post office and census were actually important enough to be written into the US constitution,
*  okay? Partly because it was like for apportionment of representatives, partly because there's a
*  feedback mechanism. And so that census was done every 10 years and it's provided a crucial
*  snapshot of the US for the last several hundred years. Okay? Now here, this census of a digital
*  state could be done every 10 seconds. Okay? Conducting it is actually not the hard part.
*  You know what the hard part is? Proving it. Because how will the world believe that you actually have
*  a hundred thousand people spread across countries? Couldn't they all be bots? Could they be AI's?
*  Proof of human, proof of income, and also proof of real estate start to actually rise dramatically
*  in importance because you're saying we're going to rank this digital state on the leaderboard of the
*  fiat states. Okay? And so that means that people will start to, yeah, first they'll just laugh at
*  it. Once you start claiming you have 10,000 citizens, people are going to start poking
*  and be like, is that real? Prove that it's real. Okay? So I have a whole talk on this, actually,
*  I'm giving at this Chainlink conference, but essentially how do you prove this? Right? The
*  short answer is crypto oracles plus auditing. The somewhat longer answer is you put these assertions
*  on chain, these proof of human, these proof of real estate, et cetera, assertions on chain. Okay?
*  And there's people who are writing to the blockchain and they are digitally signing their
*  assertions. Now, of course, simply just putting something on chain doesn't make it true. It just
*  says you can prove not that the, what is written on chain is true, but that the metadata is true.
*  You can show who wrote it via their digital signature, what they wrote, their hash, and when
*  they wrote their timestamp. So you can establish those things in metadata of who, what, and when
*  was written. Who's the who in that picture? So for example, how do you know it's one human?
*  Great question. So let's say you've bought a bunch of your piece of territory from Blackstone. Okay?
*  As a function of that, Blackstone.eth signs an on-chain receipt that says,
*  this LexReadman.eth bought this piece of property from us and it has, you know, like it's a thousand
*  square meters and this is put on chain. They sign it. Okay? That's their digital receipt. Just like
*  you might get an email receipt when you buy a piece of property or something. Okay? It's just
*  put not online, but on chain and it's signed by Blackstone or whatever real estate vendor you buy
*  it from. It could be a company. It could obviously be an individual. Right? And so you have a bunch
*  of these assertions. Let's say there's 47 different real estate vendors. I know vendors in atypical
*  term there, but just bear with me, right? 47 different real estate sellers that you've bought
*  all of your territory from. Each of them put digital signatures that are asserting that a
*  certain amount of real estate was bought and its square meters, its location or whatever else they
*  want to prove. The sum of all that is now your real estate footprint. Okay? And now the question
*  is, was that real? Well, because they signed what they put on chain, you can do things like you can
*  audit. Let's say Blackstone has signed 500,000 properties and they've sold them and put them
*  on chain. And I'm not talking about 2022 or 2023, but 2030, right? It'll be a few years out, but
*  people are doing this type of stuff. They're putting this stuff on chain. So you get that
*  on-chain receipt. They've got 500,000 of these. What you can do is just sampling. Okay? You pick
*  a subset N of them, let's say 500 properties around the world. You go there, you actually go
*  and independently look at what the square footprint is. And then from that, you can see what was the
*  actual, your measurement versus their reported. And then you can, via Cisco inference, extrapolate
*  that if they were randomly selected to the rest of the properties and get a reliability score for
*  Blackstone's reporting of its real estate square footage. Okay? So that's the auditing step.
*  So the crypto Oracle is the on-chain, what did you say? Assertions? Yeah. Who bought stuff with
*  who? I still have to get to the proof of human, but auditing, there's a bunch of people
*  randomly checking that you're not full of shit. Who is in charge of the auditing though?
*  So it could be a big four, like a PWC and basically the accountants that do corporate
*  balance sheet and cashflow and- Who keeps them in check from corruption. I'm just imagining a
*  world full of network states. Yeah, it's a good question. So at a certain point you get to who
*  watches the watchers, right? Yeah. And, oh, well, the government is meant to keep the accountants
*  accountable. And Arthur Anderson actually did have a whole flame out around the time, the Enron thing.
*  So it is possible that there's corrupt accountants or bad accountants or what have you.
*  The government itself is corrupt in many ways and prints all this money and seizes all these assets
*  and surveils everybody and so on and so forth. So the answer to your question is going to be
*  probably exit in the sense that if those accountants, they are themselves going to
*  digitally sign a report and put it on chain. So they're going to say, we believe that X, Y, and Z's
*  reports are on chain, we're this reliable and here's our study. If they falsify that, well,
*  if somebody finds that eventually, then that person is downweighted. Then you have to go to
*  another accountant, right? Is there ways to mess with this? I mean, I just, let me breathe in and
*  out. As I mentioned, some of the heaviest shit I've ever read. So because I visited Ukraine,
*  I've read Red Famine by Ann Applebaum, Bloodlands. And it's just a lot of coverage of the census.
*  I mean, there's a lot of coverage of a lot of things, but in Ukraine in the 1930s, Stalin
*  messed a lot with the census to hide the fact that sort of a lot of people died from starvation.
*  And did that with the cooperation of Arthur G. Salzberger's New York Times Company,
*  like Walter Durante falsified all those reports. There's several parties involved.
*  Can there be several parties involved in this case that manipulate the truth as it is represented
*  by the crypto oracle and as it is checked by the auditing mechanism? It is possible,
*  but the more parties are involved in falsifying something, the more defections there are. So
*  that's why you basically have another level of auditing is fundamentally the answer, right? And
*  I think what it comes back to is if you're showing your work, this is the difference between
*  crypto economics and fiat economics. The Bitcoin blockchain, anybody can download it and run
*  verification on it. This is different than government inflation stats, which people don't
*  believe because the process is just... It is true that CPI methodology is published and so on,
*  but it is not something which people feel reflects their actual basket of goods.
*  Right? And so the independent verifiability is really the core of what true auditability is.
*  And so then to your question, it's hard for some group to be able to collude because the blockchain
*  is public and everything they've written to it is public. And so if there's an error,
*  it's easier in some ways to tell the truth than to lie because the truth is just naturally
*  consistent across the world, whereas lies can be found out even in a Cisco test. You know,
*  Benford's law? Yes.
*  Right? It's something where the digits in like a real... If you take the last digit,
*  or I think it was the last digit or the first digit. I think it's the first digit, right? So
*  you take the first digit in an actual financial statement, you look at the distribution
*  of like how many ones and how many twos, how many threes, the percentages.
*  It has actually... You'd guess it might be, oh, each one will be equally random. It'd be 10%. It's
*  not like that actually. There's a certain distribution that it has and fake data
*  doesn't look like that, but real data does. That's weird.
*  It's interesting, right? Benford's law, also called the first digit law, states that the
*  leading digits in a collection of data sets are probably going to be small. For example,
*  most numbers in a set, about 30%, will have a leading digit of one.
*  Yeah. So that's a great example of what we were talking about earlier, the observational leading
*  to the theory. Oh, there's a Benfors law of controversy. I'm looking that up.
*  Benfors law of controversy. Benfors law of controversy is an adage from the 1980 novel
*  Timescape stating passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available.
*  The adage was quoted in an international drug policy article and peer reviewed social... Can
*  I just say how much I love Wikipedia? I have the founder of Wikipedia coming on this very podcast
*  soon. I think the world is a better place because Wikipedia exists. One of the things he wanted to
*  come on and talk about is the ways that he believes that Wikipedia is going wrong.
*  So on technical truths, it's great. Remember I think earlier on technical truths versus
*  political truths? On technical truths, it's great. On political truths, it's like a defamation engine.
*  Just as one example, okay, this is something that I was going to write up, but there was a scam called
*  HPZ Token that managed to edit Wikipedia. Nobody detected it. It said that I was the
*  founder of HPZ Token. That you were the founder of HPZ Token.
*  Yeah. I had nothing to do with this. And people were scammed out of it because Google just
*  pushes Wikipedia links to high on Google. And people are like, well, it's in this Wikipedia,
*  therefore it's real. Wikipedia has the bio of living persons thing. They should just allow
*  people to delete their profile because they have zero quality control on it. It's literally
*  facilitating fraud where people will maliciously edit and then do things with them and nobody cares
*  or is looking at it beyond the fraudsters. And this is happening. If that was happening,
*  that was undetected. I wasn't paying attention to this. This was there for weeks or months,
*  totally undetected, that literally facilitated fraud. And fundamentally, the issue is that
*  Wikipedia doesn't have any concept of who's editing or property rights or anything like that.
*  It used to be something in the early 2000s, mid 2000s, people said, oh, it's Wikipedia,
*  how trustworthy can be? Britannica's reviewed. And that's been forgotten. And now it's become
*  over-trusted. Remember the thing like the more trust something gets, the less trustworthy
*  it often becomes. It abuses the power. So what I'm interested in, Google actually had a model a
*  while back called KNOL. KNOL, NOL, was something where when there were different versions of a
*  Wikipedia-style page, you had Google Docs-like permissions on them. For example, you might have
*  10 different versions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And each one had an editor and folks
*  that they could grant edit rights and so on. But this way you would actually be able to see
*  different versions of a page. And they might have different versions of popularity,
*  but this way you wouldn't have edit words, you'd have forks. And they would all coexist. And then
*  people could review them. And now you could see different versions of something versus the thing
*  that just kind of rewards dogged persistence or being an editor or something like that.
*  The other thing is a lot of the folks who have editorial privileges at Wikipedia are there from
*  the early 2000s. And most of India wasn't online then. Most of Africa wasn't online then. So there's
*  this inherited power that exists, which again was fresh and innovative 10 or 20 years ago,
*  but it's now kind of outdated. Yeah, I want to see some data though. I want to see some data because
*  we can always... We often highlight small anecdotal cases. Hold on a second.
*  We often highlight issues in society, in the world, in anything by taking a specific example,
*  taking anecdotal data and saying there's a problem here. I want to know on net how much
*  positive is being added to the world because of it. My experience that I tried to be empathetic
*  and open-minded, my exploration of Wikipedia has been such that it is a breath of fresh air
*  in terms of the breadth and depth of knowledge that is there. Now you can say there's bias built
*  in. There's wars that are incentivized not to produce truth, but to produce a consensus around
*  a particular narrative. But that is how the entirety of human civilization operates. And we
*  have to see where is it better and where is it worse in terms of platforms. I think Wikipedia
*  was an improvement over what came before, but has a lot of flaws. You're right that absolutely
*  sometimes people can over fixate on the anecdotal, but sometimes the anecdotal illustrates a general
*  pattern. For example, one thing that happens frequently on Wikipedia is there are editors
*  who will plant a story and then they will then go and use that story as like a neutral third party
*  to win an edit war. Here's a phenomenon that happens in Wikipedia. You have an editor who
*  has privilege above just random users, who will plant a story and then cite that story as if it
*  was a neutral third party. There's a site called Wikipediaocracy and it discusses the case of
*  a person named Peppermint who had a name that they didn't want included, their so-called
*  dead name on their Wikipedia profile. And there's a Wikipedia editor named Tenebrae who people
*  allege was a Newsday reporter or writer that put a piece into Newsday that dead name Peppermint and
*  then was able to cite it on the Wikipedia article as if it was like a neutral third party when it
*  actually wasn't, when people allege it was the same guy. Now that is not an uncommon thing.
*  That's what I wanted to add on. How many articles... I'm not...
*  Who's auditing Wikipedia?
*  I'm dancing with you, not against you.
*  Sure.
*  Okay. I'm saying how many articles have that kind of war where douchebags are manipulating each other?
*  So that's the question. What's the audit? Has Wikipedia actually been audited? Who are the
*  editors? Who's actually writing this stuff? It is actually something where, again, on technical
*  topics, I think it's pretty good. On non-technical topics, there's something called the Wikipedia
*  reliable sources policy. It's a fascinating page. So it actually takes a lot of the stuff that we
*  have been... The world has been talking about in terms of what's a reliable source of information
*  and so on and so forth. It's called the Wikipedia reliable sources, perennial sources. And if you go
*  to this page, which I'm just going to send to you now, you will literally see every media outlet in
*  the world and they're colored gray, green, yellow, or red. Okay? And so red is untrustworthy,
*  green is trustworthy, yellow is neutral. Okay? Now, this actually makes Wikipedia's epistemology
*  explicit. They are marking a source as trustworthy or untrustworthy. For example, you are not allowed
*  to cite social media on Wikipedia, which is actually an enormous part of what people are posting.
*  You will... Instead, you have to cite a mainstream media outlet that puts the tweets in the mainstream
*  article and only then can it be cited in Wikipedia. By the way, to push back... This is a dance.
*  That those are rules written on a sheet of paper. I have seen Wikipedia in general
*  play in the gray area that these rules create. Oh, well, if you are an editor, then you can get...
*  But you can use the rules and you can... Because there's a lot of contradictions within the rules.
*  You can use them to... In the ways you said, to achieve the ends you want, it really boils down
*  to the incentives, the motivations of the editors. And one of the magical things about Wikipedia,
*  the positive versus the negative, is that it seems like a very small number of people,
*  same with Stack Overflow, can do an incredible amount of good editing and
*  aggregation of good knowledge. Now, as you said, that seems to work much better for technical
*  things over which there's not a significant division. Yeah. So some of that has to do
*  less with the rules and more with the human beings involved.
*  Well, but here's the thing is... So first, let me finish off this point of reliable sources,
*  parental sources. So if you go to this, you'll see that Al Jazeera is marked green, but let's say
*  the Cato Institute is marked yellow. The Nation is marked green.
*  Oh, shit. Oh, snap. Right. Okay, sure. Yes.
*  Right? The Nation is marked green, but National Review is marked yellow.
*  Okay. You could probably go and do... What's good about this is it makes the epistemology explicit.
*  You could actually take this table and you could also look at all the past edit wars and so on
*  over it and take a look at what things are starting to get marked as red or yellow and what things
*  are starting to get marked as green. And I'm pretty sure you're going to find some kind of partisan
*  polarization that comes out of it, right? Number one. Number two is once something gets marked as
*  being yellow or red, then all links and all references to it are pulled out. For example,
*  CoinDesk was marked as being like... Gosh, what was it?
*  Yellow? I think it's marked as red. CoinDesk, which is actually like...
*  I get a lot of useful information from CoinDesk. That's right, but it's marked as red. Why? Because
*  there's some Wikipedia editors who hate cryptocurrency. So cryptocurrency on Wikipedia
*  has been a huge topic where they've just edited out all the positive stuff. And these are senior
*  editors of Wikipedia who can control what sources are considered reliable. So they've now knocked
*  out CoinDesk. They've knocked out social media. They only allow mainstream media coverage and not
*  even all mainstream media, only those they've marked as green. This is the manipulation of...
*  I want to know how many articles are affected by it and on that...
*  Hundreds of thousands. You could just say that randomly.
*  I can, because all the... No, affected. There's different
*  levels of effect in terms of it actually having a significant impact on the quality of the article.
*  Let me give you an example. Let me give you an example, right? The fact that people cannot cite
*  direct quotes on social media, but can only cite the rehash of those quotes in a mainstream media
*  outlet. And not just any mainstream media outlet, but those that are colored green on the Wikipedia
*  reliable perennial sources policy is a structural shift on every single article to make Wikipedia
*  aligned with US mainstream media corporations. Right?
*  I am as often playing devil's advocate to counter a point so that the disagreement reveals
*  some profound wisdom. That's what I'm doing here. But also in that task here, I'm trying to understand
*  exactly how much harm is created by the bias within the team of editors that we're discussing
*  and how much of Wikipedia is technical knowledge. For example,
*  the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Wikipedia article I've seen there,
*  now that changes very aggressively a lot. And I hear from every side on this,
*  but it did not seem biased to me. As compared to mainstream media in the United States.
*  So now I'm going to sound extremely woke. If you go and look at this, Times of India
*  is yellow, but Mother Jones, Jacobin, they are green. So a niche, mostly white, Western,
*  partisan left outlet is more green, but a billion people, like the Times of India is marked yellow.
*  That's a structural bias towards Western media outlets and Western editors when much of the
*  rest of the world hadn't gotten online or what not. I would just love to see in terms of the
*  actual article, what ideas are being censored, altered, shifted. I just think it's an open...
*  So edit logs are there, edit logs are public. It would be fascinating. Is there a way to
*  explore the way that narratives are shifted because of this? Sure. So a very simple one is
*  if you were to pull all the edit logs of Wikipedia, you could see how many times are social media
*  links disallowed. First of all, think about it like this. Just the fact that social media is not
*  allowed to be cited on Wikipedia or inconsistently allowed. You think that's a problem. It's a huge
*  problem. You can't cite, let's say, Jeff Bezos' own tweet. You have to cite some random media
*  Here's the thing. Sorry if I'm interrupting. Hopefully I'm adding to it. I think they're
*  trying to create friction as to the sources used because if you can use social media, then you can
*  use basically bots to create a bunch of sources. And then you can almost automate the editor war.
*  Here's the thing. Wikipedia initially said, oh, we'll only cite mainstream media as a way of
*  boosting its credibility in the early 2000s when its credibility was low. Now it's become
*  merged with the US establishment and it only cites these things. Whose trust? Have you seen
*  the graphs on trust in mainstream media? It's plummeted. It's down to 10% or something like
*  that. So the most trusted sources for Wikipedia are untrusted by the population.
*  That feels like it's a fixable technological problem. I think I'm under informed and my gut
*  says we're both together under informed to do a rigorous three to four hour discussion about
*  Wikipedia. Hold on a second. I think I have a gut sort of developed feeling about which articles
*  not to trust in Wikipedia. I think I need to make that explicit also. I have an understanding that
*  you don't go to Wikipedia for this particular topic. Don't go to Wikipedia for an article on
*  Donald Trump or Joe Biden. If I did, I would go to maybe sections that don't have room for insertion
*  of bias or the section on controversy or accusations of racism or so on or sexual assault. I'll usually
*  not trust Wikipedia on those sections. Like math? That'll be great. Wikipedia is great for that.
*  On many topics that do not have a single consensus truth, it's structurally shifted towards
*  basically white Western liberals, woke whites. Fundamentally, that's the demographic of the
*  Wikipedia. What kind of articles do you think are affected by this? Let's think about-
*  Everything that's not math and technology. I think that's too strong a statement. Like I said,
*  war in Ukraine. I think that's too strong a statement. There's so much
*  effect, I guess I'm saying affected to a large degree. Even major battles in history,
*  Battle of Stalingrad. That's not math. You think all of that is affected to a point
*  where it's not a trusted source? Absolutely. If you look at the edit wars, for example,
*  on Stalin versus Hitler, Hitler's, the tone on Hitler starts out legitimately and justifiably as
*  basically genocidal maniacal dictator. With Stalin, there's a fair number of Stalin apologists
*  that edit out mention of genocide from the first few paragraphs.
*  I am playing devil's advocate in part, but I also am too under informed to do the level of defense
*  I would like to provide for the wisdom that is there, for the knowledge that is there. I don't
*  use the word truth, but for some level of knowledge that is there in Wikipedia, I think I really worry
*  about, I know you don't mean this, but a cynical interpretation of what you're saying, which is
*  don't trust anything written on Wikipedia. I think you're being very consistent and eloquent
*  in the way you're describing the issues in Wikipedia, and I don't have enough
*  actual specific examples to give where there is some still battle for truth that's happening
*  that's outside of the bias of society. I think if we naturally distrust every source of information,
*  there is a general distrust of institutions and a distrust of social knowledge that
*  leads to an apathy and a cynicism about the world in general. If you believe a lot of conspiracy
*  theories, you basically tune out from this collective journey that we're on towards the
*  truth. It's not even just Wikipedia, I just think Wikipedia was at least for time, and maybe I tuned
*  out, maybe because I am too focused on computer science and engineering and mathematics, but to
*  me Wikipedia for a long time was a source of calm escape from the political battles of ideology.
*  As you're quite eloquently describing, it has become part of the battleground of political ideology.
*  I just would love to know where the boundaries of that are.
*  Glenn Greenwald has observed this, lots of other folks. For example, I'm definitely not the only
*  person who's observed that Wikipedia- Let me just state, because I'm sensing this,
*  and because of your eloquence and clear brilliance here, that a lot of people are going to immediately
*  agree with you. This is what I am also troubled by. This is not you, but I often see that people
*  will detect cynicism, especially when it is phrased as eloquence is yours, and will
*  look at a natural dumbass like me and think that Lex is just being naive. Look at him,
*  trust in Wikipedia- Let me argue your side.
*  For the mainstream narrative. Let me argue your side, okay?
*  Can you please do that because you could do that better than me?
*  No, no, no. No, Lex, I enjoy talking to you.
*  I'm doing devil's advocate a little bit because I do really want to be,
*  I am afraid about the forces of basically editors of authority of talking down to people and
*  censoring information.
*  Yeah. Let me first argue your side, and let me say something, okay? Which is,
*  what you are reacting to is, oh, even those things I thought of as constants are becoming
*  variables. Where is the terra firma? If we cannot trust anything, then everybody is just,
*  it is anarchy and it is chaos. There is literally no consensus reality and anybody can say anything
*  and so on and so forth, right? I think that there are two possible deviations from,
*  let us say that the mainstream, obviously people talk about QAnon, for example, as this kind of
*  thing where people just make things up. They just go totally, quote, supply chain independent from
*  mainstream media. And if mainstream media is a distorted gossamer of quasi-truth, these guys go
*  to just total fiction as opposed to like, right? The alternative to QAnon is not BlueAnon mainstream
*  media, but SatoshiAnon, okay? Which is an upward deviation, okay? Not a downward deviation to say
*  there is no such thing as truth, but rather the upward deviation is decentralized cryptographic
*  truth, not centralized corporate or government truth, okay? So how does the decentralization
*  of Wikipedia look like? Great question. It is a concept of ledger of record. First,
*  whether you are Israeli or Palestinian, Japanese or Chinese, Democrat or Republican,
*  those people agree on the state of the Bitcoin blockchain. Hundreds of billions of dollars
*  is managed without weapons, okay, across tribes with wildly varying ideologies, right?
*  And what that means is that is a mechanism for getting literally consensus. It's called consensus,
*  cryptographic consensus, proof of work. And when people can get consensus on this, what they're
*  getting consensus on are basically bytes that determine who holds what Bitcoin. This is exactly
*  the kind of thing people would fight wars over. For hundreds of billions of dollars alone,
*  millions of dollars, people will kill each other over that in the past, right? So for hundreds of
*  billions of dollars, people can get consensus truth on this in this highly adversarial environment,
*  right? So the first generalization of that is it says you can go from bytes that reflect what
*  Bitcoin somebody has to bytes that reflect what stocks, bonds, other kinds of assets people have.
*  That's the entire DeFi, Ethereum, that whole space, okay? Basically the premise is if you
*  go from consensus on one byte by induction, you can go to consensus on n bytes depending on the
*  cost of getting that consensus, right? And almost anything digital can be represented,
*  everything digital can be represented as bytes, right? So now you can get consensus on certain
*  kinds of digital information, Bitcoin, but then also any kind of financial instrument.
*  And then the next generalization is what I call the leisure of record. Many kinds of facts
*  can be put partially or completely on chain. It's not just proof of work and proof of stake.
*  There's things like proof of location, proof of human, proof of this, proof of that. The auditable
*  oracles I talked about extended further. Lots and lots of people are working on this, right? Proof
*  of solvency, seeing that some actor has enough of a bank balance to accommodate what they say
*  they accommodate. You can imagine many kinds of digital assertions can be turned into proof of X
*  and proof of Y. You start putting those on chain, you now have a library of partially or completely
*  provable facts. Okay. This is how you get consensus as opposed to having a
*  white Western Wikipedia editor or mostly white Western US media corporation or the US government
*  simply say what is true in a centralized fashion.
*  So do you think truth is such an easy thing as you get to higher and higher questions of politics?
*  Is the problem that the consensus mechanism is being hacked or is the problem that truth is a
*  difficult thing to figure out? Was the 2020 election rigged or not? Is the earth flat or not?
*  That's a scientific one. That's what it is. My technical versus political truth spectrum. Yeah.
*  But even the earth, well, that one is, yeah, nevermind. That's a bad example because that
*  is very, you can rigorously show that the earth is not flat. But what there's some
*  social phenomena, political phenomena for the soft going that will have a lot of debates,
*  historical stuff about the different forces operating within Nazi Germany and Stalinist
*  Soviet Union. I think there's probably a lot of, yeah, the historians debate about a lot of stuff
*  Blitz, the book that talks about the influence of drugs in the Third Reich.
*  Were they on meth or something?
*  Yeah. There's a lot of debates about how truth, what is the significance of meth on the actual
*  behavior and decisions of Hitler and so on. So there's still a lot of debates. Is it so easy
*  to fix with decentralization, I guess is the question.
*  So I actually have, basically chapter two of the Network State book is on essentially this topic.
*  It's like 70 pages or something like that. So let me try to summarize what I think about on this.
*  The first is that there was an Onion article that came out, I can't find it now anymore, but
*  it was about historians in the year 3000 writing about the late 90s and early 2000s. And they're
*  like, clearly Queen Brittany was a very powerful monarch. We can see how many girls around the
*  world worshiped her like a god. And so it was very funny because it was a plausible distortion
*  of the current society by a human civilization picking through the rubble a thousand years later,
*  having no context on anything. And it's a very thought provoking article because
*  it says, well, to what extent is that us picking over Pompeii or the pyramids or even like the
*  1600s or the 1700s, like a few hundred years ago, we're basically sifting through artifacts.
*  Selma Berger actually has this concept, which is obvious, but it's also useful to have a name for
*  it. I think he calls it like dark history, which is, and again, it might be getting this wrong,
*  but it's like only a small percentage of what the Greeks wrote down has come to us to the present
*  day. So perhaps it's not just the winners who write history, it's like the surviving records.
*  We have this extremely partial fragmentary record of history. And sometimes there's some discovery
*  that rewrites the whole thing. Do you know what like Gobekli Tepe is? Everything I know about that
*  is from Rogan because he's a huge fan of that kind of stuff. Yeah, so that rewrites. And then
*  there's a lot of debates there. There's a lot of debates. Basically, it's like the discovery of
*  this site in Northern Turkey that totally shifts our estimate of when civilization started, maybe
*  pushing it back many thousands of years further in the past. The past, it's like an inverse problem
*  in physics. We're trying to reconstruct this from limited information. It's like extra-acrossocary,
*  it's an inverse problem. It's Plato's cave. We're trying to reconstruct what the world looks like
*  outside from these shadows, these fragments that have been given to us or that we've found.
*  And so in that sense, as you find more information, your estimate of the past changes.
*  Oh, wow, okay, that pushes back civilization farther than we thought. That one discovery
*  just changes it. You want to try to, given all the gaps in the data we have, you want to try to remove
*  bias from the process of trying to fill the gaps. Well, so here's the thing. I think we're very
*  close to the moment of it. And so that's why it'll sound crazy when I say it now. But our
*  descendants, I really do think of what the blockchain is and cryptographically verifiable
*  history as being the next step after written history. It's like on par with that because
*  anybody who has the record, the math is not going to change. Math is constant across human time and
*  space. So the value of pi is constant. That's one of the few constants across all these different
*  human civilizations. So somebody in the future, assuming of course the digital record is actually
*  intact to that point because in theory, digital stuff will persist. In practice, you have
*  lost data and floppy drives and stuff like that. In a sense, in some ways, digital is more persistent,
*  in some ways, physical is more persistent. But assuming we can figure out the archival problem
*  somehow, then this future record, at least it's internally consistent. You can run a bunch of
*  the equivalents of checksums, the Bitcoin verification process, just sum it all up and
*  see that, okay, it's F of G of H of X and boom, that at least is internally consistent. Again,
*  it doesn't say that all the people who reported it, they could have put something on chain that's
*  false, but at least the metadata is likely to be very difficult to falsify. And this is a new tool.
*  It's really a new tool in terms of a robust history that is expensive and technically challenging
*  to edit and alter. And that is the alternative to the Stalin-esque rewriting of history by
*  centralized power. Yeah, I'm going to have to do a lot of actually reading and thinking about...
*  I'm actually, as you're talking, I'm also thinking about the fact that I think 99% of my access to
*  Wikipedia is on technical topics because I basically use it very similarly to Stack Overflow.
*  And even there, it doesn't have unit tests. For example, one thing...
*  That's a good way to put it.
*  Right. So one thing I remember, again, I might be wrong on this, but I recall that the Kelly
*  criterion, it's actually quite a useful thing to know. It's like how to optimally size your bets,
*  and you can have, given your probability that some investment pays off or assumed probability,
*  you can have bets that are too large, bets that are too small. Sometimes the Kelly criterion,
*  it goes negative and actually it says, you should actually take leverage. You're so sure this is a
*  good outcome that you should actually spend more than your current bankroll because you're going
*  to get a good result. So it's a very sophisticated thing. And as I recall, many sites on the internet
*  have the wrong equation. And I believe that was reprinted on Wikipedia. The wrong equation was
*  put on Wikipedia as the Kelly criterion for a while. That's funny.
*  Okay. And so without unit tests... See, math is actually the kind of thing that you could unit
*  test. You could literally have the assert on the right-hand side today, the modern version.
*  We've got Jupiter, we've got Replet, we've got all these things. The modern version of Wikipedia,
*  there's sites like golden.com, for example. There's a bunch of things. I'm funding lots
*  of stuff across the board on this. And I'm not capitalizing these companies or capitalize
*  independently, but I'm trying to see if not just talk about a better version. It's hard to build
*  something better. So actually go and build it. And where you want is assertions that are actually
*  reproduced. You don't just have the equation there. You have it written down in code. You
*  can hit enter, you can download the page, you can rerun it. It's reproducible.
*  The problem with that kind of reproducibility is that it adds friction. It's harder to put together
*  articles that do that kind of stuff, unless you do an incredible job with UX and so on.
*  The thing that I think is interesting about Wikipedia on the technical side is that
*  without the unit tests, without the assertions, it still often does an incredible job. Because
*  the reason it's... The people that write those articles, and I've seen this also in Stack Overflow,
*  are the people that care about this most. And there's a pride to getting it right.
*  Let me agree and disagree with that. Absolutely, there's some good there.
*  Again, do I think Wikipedia is a huge step up from what preceded it in some ways on the technical
*  topics? Yes. However, you talk about the editing environment, like the markup for Wikipedia,
*  it's very mid-2000s. It is not... It's like Craigslist.
*  Yeah, exactly. At a minimum, for example, it's not WYSIWYG. So like Medium or something like that,
*  or Ghost, you can just go in and type, and it looks exactly like it looks on the page. Here,
*  you have to go to a markup language where there can be editor conflicts, and you hit enter,
*  and someone is over in your edit or something like that, and you don't know how it looks on
*  the page, and you might have to do a few previews or what have you. It's number one. So editing
*  you talk about bearish editing, that's the thing. Number two is, given that it might be read a
*  thousand times for every one time it's written, it is important to actually have the mathematical
*  things unit tested, if they can be, given that we've got modern technology. And that's something
*  that's hard to retrofit into this because it's so kind of ossified, right? Right. Yeah, the interface
*  on every side for the editor, even just for the editor to check that... Say the editor wants to
*  get it right, you want to make it really, or not really easy, but easier to check their work.
*  That's right. Like debugging, like a nice idea for the... That's exactly right.
*  For the editing experience. That's right. And the thing about this is,
*  as I said, because the truth is a global constant, but like incorrectness, you know, right? Go ahead.
*  Every happy family... I love to think that truth will have a nice debugger.
*  Well, so here's... Right? So the thing is that what you can do is... Let's say you do have like
*  a unit tested page for everything that's on Wikipedia. First of all, it makes the page more
*  useful because you can download it, you can run it, you can import it, and so on. Second is it
*  leads into one of the things that we can talk about. I've sort of like a roadmap for building
*  alternatives to not just existing companies, but to many existing US institutions, from media
*  and tech companies to courts and government and academia and non-profits. The Wikipedia
*  discussion actually relates to how you improve on academia, right? And so academia right now,
*  one of the big problems, this is kind of related to the, oh boy, okay, the current institutions,
*  we don't have trust in them, is that the answer is the answer to trust no one, right? And I think
*  the alternative is decentralized cryptographic trust or verification. How does that apply to
*  academia? First observation is we are seeing science being abused in the name of quote-unquote
*  science, okay? Capital S science is Maxwell's equations. That's-
*  That's a good one.
*  That's a good one, right? Quote-unquote science is a paper that came out last week.
*  And the key thing is that capital S science, real science, is about independent replication,
*  not prestigious citation. That's the definition. All the journal stuff, the professors, all that
*  stuff is just a superstructure that was set on top to make experiments more reproducible.
*  And that superstructure is now dominating the underlying thing because people are just fixating
*  on the prestige and the citation and not the replication, right? So how does that apply here?
*  Once you start thinking about how many replications does this thing have, Maxwell's
*  equation, I mean, there's trillions of replications. Every time us speaking into this microphone right
*  now, we're testing our theory of the electromagnetic field, right? Or electromagnetic fields.
*  Every single time you pick up a cell phone or use a computer, you're putting our knowledge to the
*  test, right? Whereas some paper that came out last week in Science or Nature may have zero independent
*  replications, yet it is being cited publicly as prestigious scientists from Stanford and Harvard
*  and MIT all came up with X, right? And so the prestige is a substitute for the actual replication.
*  So there's a concept called Goodhart's law, okay? I'm just going to quote it.
*  When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure, okay? So for example,
*  back links on the web were a good signal for Google to use when people didn't know they were
*  being used as a signal. You talked about quantity versus quality and page rank was a pretty good
*  approximation for quality. Yes. It's a fascinating thing, by the way, but yeah.
*  It's a fascinating thing. We can talk about that. But basically, once people know that you're using
*  this as a measure, they will start to game it. And so then you have this cycle where, you know,
*  sometimes you have a fixed point like Satoshi with Proof of Work was miraculously able to come up
*  with a game where the gaming of it was difficult without just buying more compute, right? So it's
*  actually a rare kind of game where knowledge of the game's rules didn't allow people to game the
*  game. Yeah. A brilliant way to put it, yeah. Which is one of the reasons it's brilliant is that
*  you can describe the game and you can't mess with it.
*  Exactly. It's very hard to come up with something that's stable in its way. It's actually
*  on the meta point, gosh, there's a game where the rule of the game is to change the rules.
*  Okay. You mean human civilization or what? Yeah. Gosh, it is called something.
*  NOMIC. Okay. N-O-M-I-C?
*  NOMIC is a game where the rule of the game is to change the rules of the game.
*  At first, that seems insane. Then you realize that's Congress.
*  Yeah. Right? Yeah.
*  Literally, it is so meta because there are laws for elections that elect the editors of those laws
*  who then change the laws that get them elected with gerrymandering and other stuff, right?
*  That's a bad way of thinking that. The other way of thinking about it is this is what every
*  software engineer is doing. You are constantly changing the rules by editing software and pushing
*  code updates and so on, right? So many games devolve into the meta game of who writes the
*  rules of the game, right? Become essentially games of NOMIC. Proof of work is so amazing
*  because it didn't devolve in such a way, right? It became very hard to rewrite the rules once
*  they got set up. Very financially and technically expensive. That's not to say it will always be
*  like that, but it's very hard to change. If we could take a small tangent, we'll
*  return to academia. I'd love to ask you about how to fix the media as well after we fix academia.
*  Yeah. These are all actually related.
*  Related.
*  Yeah. Wikipedia, media, and academia are all related to the question of
*  independent replication versus prestigious citation.
*  Sure. So the problem is authority and prestige as you see it from academia and the media and
*  Wikipedia with the editors, we have to have a mechanism where the data and the reproducibility
*  is what dominates the discourse.
*  That's right. And so one way to think about this is I've said this in, I think I tweeted this
*  earlier, but Western civilization actually has a break classification emergency button.
*  It's called decentralization, right? Martin Luther hit it when the Catholic
*  church was too ossified and centralized, decentralized with the Protestant Reformation.
*  He said at the time people were able to pay for indulgences, like that is to say they could sin.
*  They could say, okay, I sinned five times yesterday. Here's the equivalent of 50 bucks.
*  Okay, I'm done with my sin. I can go and sin some more. They should really buy their way out of sin.
*  People debate as to how frequent those indulgences were, but these are one of the things he invaded
*  against in the 95 theses. So decentralization, boom, break away from this ossified church,
*  start something new, right? And in theory, the quote religious wars of the 1600s that ensued
*  were about things like where the wafer was the body of Christ or what have you. But in part,
*  they were also about power and whether the centralized entity would write all the rules
*  or the decentralized one would. And so what happened was obviously Catholicism still exists,
*  but Protestantism also exists. Okay. And similarly here, you've got this ossified central
*  institution where, you know, forget about, I mean, there's complicated studies that are difficult
*  to summarize, but when you have the science saying masks don't work and then they do,
*  okay, which everybody saw. And this is not like, you know, everybody knew that there was not like
*  some massive study that came out that changed our perspective on mask wearing. It was something
*  that was just insistently asserted as this is what the science says. And then without any acknowledgement,
*  the science said something different, you know, the next day, right? I remember because I was in
*  the middle of this debate. And I think you could justify masks early in the pandemic as a useful
*  precaution. And then later, you know, post vaccination, perhaps not necessary. I think
*  that's like the rational way of thinking about it. But the point was that such levels of uncertainty
*  were not acknowledged. Instead, people, you know, were basically lying in the name of science and
*  public policy was, you know, it wasn't public health, it was political health. Okay. So something
*  like that, you're just spending down all the credibility of an institution for basically
*  nothing. Okay. And so in such a circumstance, what do you do? Break glass, decentralize. What
*  does that look like? Okay. So let me describe what I call crypto science by analogy to, you know,
*  crypto, just like there's fiat science, crypto science, right? Fiat economics. Okay. So in any
*  experiment, any paper when it comes out, right? It's, you can sort of divide it into the analog
*  to digital and the purely digital. Okay. So the analog to digital is you're running some instruments,
*  you're getting some data. Okay. And then once you've got the data, you're generating figures
*  and tables and text and a PDF from that data, right? Leave aside the data collection step for now.
*  I'll come back to that, right? Just the purely digital part. What does the ideal quote academic
*  paper look like in 2022, 2023? First, there's this concept called reproducible research. Okay.
*  Reproducible research is the idea that the PDF should be regenerated from the data
*  and code. Okay. So you should be able to hit enter and regenerate it. Why is this really important
*  as a concept? John Claire Boo and David Donahoe at Stanford 20 years ago pioneered this in stats
*  because the text alone often doesn't describe every parameter that goes into a figure or
*  something, right? You kind of sometimes just need to look at the code and then it's easy.
*  And without that, it's hard. Okay. So reproducible research means you regenerate the PDF from the
*  code and the data you hit enter. Okay. Now one issue is that many papers out there, science,
*  nature, et cetera, are not reproducible research. Moreover, the data isn't even public.
*  Moreover, sometimes the paper isn't even public. The open access movement has been fighting this
*  for the last 20 something years. There's various levels of this like green and gold open access.
*  Okay. So the first step is the code, the data and the PDF go on chain. Step number one. Okay.
*  The second thing is once you've got, so you can, anybody who is, and that could be the Ethereum
*  chain. It could be its own dedicated chain, whatever. Okay. It could be something where
*  there's a, just the URLs are on the Ethereum chain and stored on Filecoin, many different
*  implementations, but let's call that on chain broadly. Okay. Not just online on chain. When
*  it's on chain, it's public and anybody can get it. So that's first. Second is once you've got
*  something where you can regenerate the code or the PDF from the code and the data on chain,
*  guess what? You can have citations between two papers, turn it to import statements.
*  That's cool. Right. So now you're not just getting composable finance like DeFi,
*  where you have like one interest rate calculator calling another. You have composable science.
*  And now you can say this paper on this, especially an ML, right? You'll often cite a previous paper
*  and its benchmark or its method, right? You're going to want to scatter plot sometimes your
*  paper, your algorithm versus theirs on the same dataset. That is facilitated if their entire paper
*  is reproducible research that is generated. You can just literally import that Python and
*  then you can generate your figure off of it, right? Moreover, think about how that aids
*  reproducibility because you don't have to reproduce in the literal sense every single
*  snippet of code that they did. You can literally use their code and import it. Okay. People start
*  compounding on each other. It's better science. Okay. Now I talked about this, but actually
*  there's a few folks who have been actually building this. So there's youscholar.org,
*  which actually has a demo of this, like just a V1 kind of prototype where it shows
*  two stats papers on chain. And one of them is citing the other with an import statement.
*  There's also a thing called, I think, dsci.com, which is trying to do this, right? Decentralized
*  science. So this itself changes how we think about papers. And actually, by the way,
*  the inspiration for PageRank was actually citations. It was like the impact factor out
*  of academia. That's where Larry Page and Sergey Brin got the concept out of, right?
*  So now you've got a web of citations that are import statements on chain. In theory,
*  you could track back a paper all the way back to its antecedents. Okay. So if it's citing
*  something, you can now look it up and look it up and look it up. And a surprising number of
*  papers actually, their antecedents don't terminate or the original source says something different,
*  or it just kind of got garbled like a telephone game. And there's this famous thing on the
*  spinach. It does actually have iron in it or something like that. I forget the details on
*  this story, but it was something where you track back the citations and people are contradicting
*  each other. Okay. But it's just something that just gets copy pasted. And it's a fact. It's
*  not actually a fact because it's not audited properly. This allows you to cheaply audit,
*  in theory, all the way back to Maxwell or Newton or something like that. Okay. Now,
*  what I'm describing is a big problem, but it's a finite problem. It's essentially taking all the
*  important papers and putting them on chain. It's about the scale of, let's say Wikipedia.
*  Okay. So it's like, I don't know, a few hundred thousand, a few million papers. I don't know the
*  exact number, but it'll be out of that level. Okay. So now you've got number one, these things
*  that are on chain. Okay. Number two, you've turned citations into import statements. Number three,
*  anybody can now at a minimum download that code. And while they may not have the instruments,
*  and I'll come back to that point, while they may not have the instruments, they can do internal
*  checks, the Benford's Law stuff we were just talking about. You can internally check the
*  consistency of these tables and graphs, and often you'll find fraud or things that don't add up
*  that way because all the code and the data is there, right? And now you've made it so that
*  anybody in Brazil, in India, in Nigeria, they may not have an academic library access zone,
*  but they can get into this. All right. Now, how do you fund all of this? Well,
*  good thing is crypto actually allows tools for that as well. Andrew Huberman and others have
*  started doing things like with NFTs to fund their lab. I can talk about the funding aspect.
*  There's things like researchhub.com, which are trying to issue tokens for labs, but a lab isn't
*  that expensive to fund. Maybe it's a few hundred thousand, a few million a year, depending on where
*  you are. Crypto does generate money, and so you can probably imagine various tools, whether it's
*  tokens or NFTs or something like that to fund. Finally, what this does is it is not QAnon,
*  right? It is not saying don't trust anybody. Neither is it just trust the centralized academic
*  establishment. Instead of saying trust because you can verify, because we can download things
*  and run them. The crucial thing that I'm assuming here is the billions of supercomputers around the
*  world that we have, all the MacBooks and iPhones that can crank through lots and lots of computation.
*  So everything digital, we can verify it locally, okay? Now, there's one last step, which is I
*  mentioned the instruments, right? Whether it's your sequencing machine or your accelerometer
*  or something like that is generating the data that you are reporting in your paper when you
*  put it on chain, okay? Basically, you think of that as the analog to digital interface.
*  We can cryptify that too. Why? For example, an Illumina sequencing machine has an experiment
*  manifest. There's a website called NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information. You can see
*  the experiment metadata on various sequencing runs. It'll tell you what instrument and what time
*  it was run and who ran it and so on and so forth, okay? What that does is allows you to correct for
*  things like batch effects. Sometimes you will sequence on this day and the next day and maybe
*  the humidity or something like that makes it look like there's a statistically significant difference
*  between your two results, but it was just actually batch effects, okay? What's my point? Point is,
*  if you have a crypto instrument, you can have various hashes and stuff of the data as a chain
*  of custody for the data itself that are streamed and written on chain that the manufacturer can
*  program into this. For anything that's really... And you might say, well, boy, that's overkill,
*  right? I'm saying actually not. You know why? If you're doing a study whose results are going to
*  be used to influence a policy that's going to control the lives of millions of people,
*  every single step has to be totally audible. You need the glass box model. You need to be able to
*  go back to the raw data. You need to be able to interrogate that. And again, anybody who's a good
*  scientist will embrace this, right? Yeah. So first of all, that was a brilliant exposition
*  of a future of science that I would love to see. The pushback I'll provide, which is not really a
*  pushback, is like what you describe is so much better than what we currently have that I think
*  a lot of people would say any of the sub steps you suggest are already going to be a huge
*  improvement. So even just sharing the code or sharing the data, you said like... I think it
*  would surprise people how often... It's hard to get data.
*  The actual data or specifics or a large number of the parameters, not that you'll share like
*  one or two parameters that were involved with running the experiment. You won't mention the
*  machines involved, except maybe at a high level, but the versions and so on, the dates when the
*  experiments were run, you don't mention any of this kind of stuff. So there's several ways to fix
*  this. And one of them, I think, implied in what you're describing is a culture that says it's
*  not okay. Exactly.
*  So first of all, there should be, even if it's not perfectly unchained to where you can automatically
*  import all the way to Newton, just even the act of sharing the code, sharing the data, maybe in a
*  way that's not perfectly integrated into a larger structure is already a very big positive step.
*  Yeah.
*  Saying like, if you don't do this, then this doesn't count. And because in general, I think
*  my worry, as somebody who's a programmer, who's OCD, I love the picture you paint that you can
*  just import everything, automatically checks everything. My problem is that makes incremental
*  science easier and revolutionary science harder. Oh, I actually very much just screwed that.
*  I would love to hear your argument. Let me just kind of elaborate why sometimes you have to think
*  in this gray area of fuzziness when you're thinking on totally novel ideas. And when you
*  have to concretize in data, some of the greatest papers ever written aren't to don't have data.
*  They're in the space of ideas almost. You're kind of sketching stuff and there could be errors, but
*  Einstein himself with the famous five papers, I mean, they're really strong, but they're fuzzy.
*  They're a little bit fuzzy. And so I think even like the GAN paper, you're often thinking of
*  new data sets, new ideas. And I think maybe as a step after the paper is written, you could
*  probably concretize it, integrate it into the rest of science. You shouldn't feel that pressure,
*  I guess, early on. Well, I mean, each of the steps that I'm talking about, there's like
*  data being public and everything. Just having the paper being public, that's like V1, right?
*  Then you have the thing being regenerated from code and data, like the PDF being regenerated
*  from code and data. Then you have the citations as import statements. Then you have the full
*  citation graph as an import statement. So you just follow it all the way back, right? And now
*  that gives you auditability. Then you have the off-chain, the analog digital crypto custody,
*  like where you're hashing things and streaming things. So you have the chain of custody.
*  Each of those is kind of like a level up and adds to complexity, but it also adds to the auditability
*  and the verifiability and the reproducibility. But one thing I'd say, I wanted to respond to
*  that you said was that you think that this would be good for incremental but not innovative. I
*  actually think it's quite the opposite. I think academia is institutional and it's not innovative.
*  For example, NIH has this graph, which is like, I think it's age of recipients of R01 grants.
*  And what it shows is basically it's like a hump that moves over time, roughly
*  plus one year forward for the average age as the year moves on. And I'll see if I can find the GIF.
*  Why is this? Let me see if I can find it actually. Look at this movie just for a second.
*  It's ridiculously powerful movie and it's 30 seconds. I just sent it in WhatsApp.
*  The name of the video is age distribution of NIH principal investigators and medical school faculty.
*  And it starts out on the accesses age with the distribution and percent of PIs. And from 19
*  early 1980s moving one year at a time. And the mean of the distribution is moving slowly,
*  approximately as Balaji said about one year per year per year. And this is 10 years ago,
*  one year in age per year of time. And notice how first of all, the average age is moving way upward
*  before you become an NHPI. Second is it's a court of guys, people who are just awarding grants to
*  each other. That's clearly what's happening. That's the underlying dynamic. They're not
*  awarding grants to folks who are much younger because those folks haven't proven themselves yet.
*  So this is what happens when you get prestigious citation rather than independent replication.
*  The age just keeps creeping up. And this was 10 years ago and it's gotten even worse. It's
*  become even more gerontocratic, even more hidebound. And so the thing is that the
*  structures that Vannevar Bush and others set up, the entire post-war science establishment,
*  one thing I'll often find is people will say, Balaji, the government hath granted us the internet
*  and self-driving cars and space flight and so on. How can you possibly be against the US government?
*  Kneel and repent for its bounty. And really, the reason they don't say it quite in that way,
*  but that's really the underpinning kind of thing because they've replaced GoD with GoV.
*  They really think of the US government as God. The conservative will think of the US government
*  as the all-powerful military abroad and the progressive will think of it as the benign,
*  all-powerful, nurturing parent at home. But in this context, they're like, how come you as some
*  tech bro could possibly think you could ever do basic science without the funding of the US
*  government? Has it not developed all basic science? And the answer to this is actually to say,
*  well, what if we go further back than 1950? Did science happen before 1950? Well, I think it did.
*  Bernoulli and Maxwell and Newton, were they funded by NSF? No, they weren't.
*  Were aviation, railroads, automobiles, gigantic industries that arose and both were stimulated
*  by and stimulated development of pure science? Were they funded by NSF? No, they were not.
*  Right? Therefore, NSF is not a necessary condition for the presence of science. Neither is even the
*  United States. Obviously, a lot of these discoveries, Newton was before, I believe,
*  it was before the American... Let me just find the exact... It's actually less old than people think.
*  Okay. So Newton died 1727. Right? So I knew that it was in the 1700s. So
*  Newton was before the American Revolution. Right? Obviously, that meant huge innovations could
*  happen before the US government, before NIH, before NSF. Right? Which means they are not a
*  necessary condition, number one. That itself is crucial because a lot of people say the government
*  is necessary for basic science. It is not necessary for basic science. It is one possible catalyst.
*  And I would argue that mid-century, it was okay because mid-century was the time when
*  the middle of the centralized century. 1933, 1945, 1969, you have Hoover Dam, you have the
*  Manhattan Project, you have Apollo. That generation was acclimatized to a centralized US government
*  that could accomplish great things, probably because technology favored centralization going
*  into 1950 and then started favoring decentralization going out of it. I've talked about this in the
*  book. Sauron and Doudoul has talked about this, but very roughly, you go up into 1950 and you have
*  mass media and mass production and just centralization of all kinds, giant nation
*  states slugging it out on the world stage. You go out in 1950 and you get cable news and
*  personal computers and the internet and mobile phones and cryptocurrency,
*  and you have the decentralization. And so this entire centralized scientific establishment was
*  set up at the peak of the centralized century. And it might've been the right thing to do at that time,
*  but is now showing its age. And it's no longer actually geared up for what we have. Where are
*  the huge innovations coming out of? Well, Satoshi Nakamoto was not, to our knowledge, a professor.
*  That's this revolutionary thing that came outside of it. Early in the pandemic, there was something
*  called project-evidence.github.io, which accumulated all of the evidence for the
*  coronavirus possibly having been a lab leak when that was a very controversial thing to discuss.
*  Alina Chan, to her credit, Matt Ridley and Alina Chan have written this book on whether
*  the coronavirus was a lab leak or not. I think it's plausible that it was.
*  I can't say I'm 100% sure, but I think it's certainly a hypothesis worthy of discussion,
*  okay? Though, of course, it's got political overtones. Point being that the pseudonymous
*  online publication at project-evidence.github.io happened when it was taboo to do so. So we're
*  back to the age of pseudonymous publication where only the arguments can be argued with.
*  The person can't be attacked, okay? This is actually something that used to happen in the
*  past. There's a famous story where Newton solved a problem. Someone said, I know the lion by his
*  claw or something like that, right? People used to do pseudonymous publication in the past so that
*  they would be judged on part by their scientific ideas and not the person themselves, right?
*  So I do disagree that this is the incremental stuff. This is actually the innovative stuff.
*  The incremental stuff is going to be the institutional gerontocracy that's academia
*  where it's like, do you know who I am? I'm a Harvard professor.
*  Yeah. I think I agree with everything you said, but I'm not going to get stuck on technicalities
*  because I think I was referring to your vision of datasets and importing code.
*  Sure.
*  And so that forces just knowing how code works, it forces a structure and structure usually
*  favors incremental progress. If you fork code, you're not going to, it descentivizes revolution.
*  You want to go from scratch.
*  Okay. So I understand your point there. Okay. And I also agree that some papers like Francis
*  Crick on the Klaustrum or others are theoretical. They're more about where to dig than the data
*  itself and so on and so forth. Right? So I agree with that. Still, I don't, the counterargument is
*  rather than a thousand people reading this paper to try to rebuild the whole thing and do it with
*  errors, when they can just import, they can more easily build upon what others have done.
*  Right? Oh yeah. So the paper should be forkable.
*  Well, yeah. So here's what, you know, like Python has this concept of batteries included for the
*  standard library, right? Because it lets you just import, import, import, and just get to work.
*  Right? That means you can fly. Whereas if you couldn't do all those things and you had to
*  rewrite string handling, you would only be able to do incremental things. Libraries actually allow
*  for greater innovation. That's my counterargument.
*  I think you create, I think that paints a picture. I hope that's a picture that fits with science.
*  It certainly does. It fits with code very well. I just wonder how much of science can be
*  that, which is you import how much of it is possible to do that. Certainly for the things
*  I work on, you can, which is the machine learning world, all the computer science world, but whether
*  you can do that for, all right, you can think biology. It seems to, yes, I think so. Chemistry,
*  I think so. And then you start getting into weird stuff like psychology, which some people don't
*  even think is a science. No, just love for my psychology friends. I think as you get farther
*  and farther away from things that are like hard technical fields, it starts getting tougher and
*  tougher and tougher to have like importable code. Okay. So let me give the strong foreign version,
*  right? So there's a guy who I think is a great machine learning guy, creator of actually Keras,
*  who he disagrees with me on Francois Chalet. Yeah, he's been on this podcast twice.
*  Okay, great. So he disagrees- I disagree with him on a lot of stuff.
*  Yes, me too. I think we have mutual respect, follow each other on Twitter, whatever.
*  Yes, I think he does respect them like you. Here's something which I totally agree with him on,
*  and he actually got like trolled or attacked for this, but I completely agree. Within 10,
*  20 years, nearly every branch of science will be, for all intents and purposes, a branch of
*  computer science, computational physics, computational chemistry, computational biology,
*  computational medicine, even computational archaeology, realistic simulations, big data
*  analysis and ML everywhere. That to me is incredibly obvious. Why? First of all,
*  all we're doing every day is PDFs and data analysis on a computer, right? And so every
*  single one of those areas can be reduced to the analog to digital step, and then it's all digital.
*  Then you're flying, you're in the cloud, right? Did he say how long?
*  10 to 20 years. I think arguably it's already there, right? And here's the thing. You were
*  saying, well, you might drop off when you hit psychology or history. Actually, I think it's
*  the softer sciences that are going to harden up. Why? One of the things I talk about a lot in the
*  book is, for example, with history, the concept of crypto history makes history computable.
*  One way of thinking about it is, remember my Britney Spears example, right? Where Queen Britney,
*  right? Okay. So at first it's kind of a funny thing to say a computer scientist's term for
*  history is the log files until we realized that what would a future historian, how would they
*  write about the history of the 2010s? Well, a huge part of that history occurred on the servers of
*  Twitter and Facebook. So now you go from a log file, which is just the individual record of one
*  server's action to a decade worth of data on literally billions of people, all of their
*  online lives. Arguably, that's why I say that's actually what the written history was
*  of the 2010s was this giant digital history. As you go to the 2020s and the 2030s,
*  more of that is going to move from merely online to on-chain and then cryptographically verifiable.
*  So that soft subject of history becomes something that you can calculate things like Google Trends
*  and ngrams and stuff like that. Yes, beautifully put. Then I would venture to say that Donald
*  Trump was erased from history when he was removed from Twitter and many social platforms
*  and all his tweets were gone. I think it's someone who has an archive of it, but yeah,
*  I understand your point. Yeah. Well, as the flood of data about each individual increases censorship,
*  it becomes much more difficult to actually have an archive of stuff. But yes, for important people
*  like a president in the United States, yes. Let me on that topic ask you about Trump. You were
*  considered for position as FDA commissioner in the Trump administration. And I think one of in
*  terms of the network state, in terms of the digital world, one of the seminal acts in the history of
*  that was the banning of Trump from Twitter. Can you make the case for it and against it?
*  Sure. So first let me talk about the FDA thing. So I was considered for a senior role at FDA,
*  but I do believe that, and this is a whole topic, we can talk about the FDA.
*  I do believe that just as it was easier to create Bitcoin than to form the Fed,
*  reforming the Fed basically still hasn't happened. So just as it was easier to create Bitcoin than
*  to reform the Fed, it will literally be easier to start a new country than to reform the FDA.
*  It may take 10 or 20 years. I mean, think about Bitcoin, it's only about 13 years old, right?
*  It may take 10 or 20 years to start a new network state with a different biomedical policy. But that
*  is how we get out from perhaps the single worst thing in the world, which is harmonization,
*  regulatory harmonization. Can you describe regulatory harmonization?
*  Regulatory harmonization is the mechanism by which US regulators impose their regulations on
*  the entire world. So they basically have a monopoly by US regulators. This is not just the FDA,
*  it is SEC, and FAA, and so on and so forth. And for the same reason that a small
*  company will use Facebook login, they will outsource their login to Facebook,
*  a small country will outsource their regulation to the USA.
*  With all the attendant issues, because I mean, you know the names of some politicians. Can you
*  name a single regulator at the FDA? No, right? Yet they will brag on their website that they
*  regulate, I forget the exact numbers, I think it's like 25 cents out of every dollar, something along
*  those lines. It's like double digits. That's a pretty big deal. And the thing about this is,
*  people will talk about quote, our democracy and so on. But many of the positions in quote,
*  our democracy are actually not subject to democratic accountability. You have tenured
*  professors and you have tax exempt colleges. You have the Salzburgers, the New York Times,
*  who have dual class stock. You have a bunch of positions that are out of the reach of the
*  electorate and that includes regulators who have career tenure after just a few years of not
*  necessarily even continuous service. So they're not accountable to the electorate. They're not
*  named by the press. And they also aren't accountable to the market because you've got
*  essentially uniform global regulations. Now the thing about this is, it's not just a government
*  thing. It's a regulatory capture thing. Big pharma companies like this as well. Why? Because they
*  can just get their approval in the US and then they can export to the rest of the world. Right?
*  I understand where that comes from as a corporate executive. It's such a pain to get access in one
*  place. So there's a team up though between the giant company and the giant government
*  to box out all the small startups and all the small countries and lots of small innovation.
*  Right? There are cracks in this now. Right? The FDA did not acquit itself well during the pandemic.
*  For example, it denied, I mean, there's so many issues, but one of the things that even actually
*  New York Times reported, the reason that people thought there were no COVID cases in the US
*  early in the pandemic was because the FDA was denying people the ability to run COVID tests
*  and the emergency use authorization was, you know, emergency should mean like right now. Right? But
*  it was not, it was just taking forever. And so some labs did civil disobedience and they just
*  disobeyed the FDA and just went and tested academic labs with threat of federal penalties
*  because that's what they are. They're like the police. Okay. And so they were sort of retroactively
*  granted immunity because NYT went and ran a positive story on them. So NYT's authority is
*  usually greater than that of FDA. If they come into a conflict, NYT runs stories, then FDA kind
*  of gets spanked. Right? And it's not, you know, probably neither party would normally think of
*  themselves that way. But if you look at it, when NYT goes and runs stories on a company, it names
*  all the executives and they get all hit. When it runs stories on a regulator, it just treats the
*  regulator usually as if it was just some abstract entity. It's Zuckerberg's Facebook, but you can't
*  name, you know, the people who the career bureaucrats at FDA. Interesting. Right?
*  It's very interesting.
*  It's a very important point. Like that person who's like named and their face is known. Like
*  you just as an example, you know, Zuckerberg's face and name. Most people don't know Arthur G.
*  Salzberger. They couldn't recognize him. Right? That he's a guy who's inherited the New York
*  Times Company from his father's father's father. That is unaccountable power. It's not that they
*  get great coverage, that they get no coverage. You don't even think about them. Right? And so
*  it's invisibility. Right? There's some aspect why Fauci was very interesting.
*  He was a public face.
*  My recent memory, there's not been many faces of scientific policy, of science policy.
*  Yeah.
*  He became the face of that. And, you know, as there's some of his meme, which is, you know,
*  basically saying that he is science or to some people who represent science, but in-
*  Or quote unquote science or whatever. Yeah.
*  The positive aspect of that is that there is accountability when there's a face like that.
*  Right. But you can also see the Fauci example shows you why a lot of these folks do not want
*  to be public because they enter a political, you know, immediate minefield. I'm actually
*  sympathetic to that aspect of it. What I'm not sympathetic to is the concept that in 2022,
*  that the unelected, unfireable, anonymous American regulator should be able to impose
*  regulatory policy for the entire world. We are not the world of 1945. You know? It is not something
*  where these other countries are even consciously consenting to that world. Just as given example,
*  you know, there's a concept called challenge trials. Okay. The Moderna vaccine was available
*  very, very early in the pandemic. You can just synthesize it from the sequence. And challenge
*  trials would have meant that people who are healthy volunteers, okay, they could have been
*  soldiers, for example, of varying ages who are there to take a risk, their lives for their country,
*  potentially. Okay. It could have been just healthy volunteers, not necessarily soldiers, just
*  patriots of whatever kind in any country, not just the US. But those healthy volunteers could
*  have gone. And at the early stages of the pandemic, we didn't know exactly how lethal it was going to
*  be because, you know, Li Wenliang and, you know, 30 year old, 30 somethings in China were dying
*  from this. It seemed like it could be far worse. How lethal the virus would be.
*  Yeah. It may be, by the way, that those who are the most susceptible to the virus died faster
*  earlier. It's as if you can imagine a model where those who were exposed and had the lowest
*  susceptibility also had the highest severity and died in greater numbers early on. If you look at
*  the graph, like deaths from COVID were exponential going into about April 2020 and then leveled off
*  to about 7,500, 10,000 a day and then kind of fell, right? But it could have gone to 75,000 at the
*  beginning. So we didn't know how serious it was. So this would have been a real risk that these
*  people would have been taking, but here's what they would have gotten for that. Basically,
*  in a challenge trial, somebody would have been given the vaccine and then exposed to the virus
*  and then put under observation. And then that would have given you all the data because ultimately
*  the synthesis of the thing, I mean, yes, you do need to scale up synthesis and manufacturing and
*  what have you, but the information of whether it worked or not and was safe and effective and
*  like that could have been gathered expeditiously with volunteers for challenge trials.
*  And you think there'd be a large number of volunteers?
*  Absolutely.
*  What's the concern there? Is there an ethical concern of taking on volunteers?
*  Well, so let me put it like this. Had we done that, we could have had vaccines early enough
*  to save the lives of like a million Americans, especially seniors and so on, okay? Soldiers and
*  more generally first responders and others, I do believe there's folks who would have stepped up
*  to take that risk.
*  The heroes walk among us.
*  Yeah, that's right. Like if military service is something which is a ritualized thing,
*  people are paid for it, but they're not paid that much. They're really paid in honor and in duty
*  and patriotism. That is actually the kind of thing where I do believe some fraction of those folks
*  would have raised their hand for this important task. I don't know how many of them, but I do
*  think that volunteers would have been there. There's probably some empirical test of that,
*  which is there's a challenge trials website. There's a Harvard prof who put out this proposal
*  early in the pandemic and he could tell you how many volunteers he got. But something like that
*  could have just shortened the time from pandemic to functional vaccine, right? To days even,
*  if you'd actually really acted on it. The fact that that didn't happen and that the Chinese
*  solution of lockdown, that actually at the beginning people thought the state could
*  potentially stop the virus, stop people in place. It turned out to be more contagious than that.
*  Basically, no NPI, no non-pharmaceutical intervention really turned out to work that
*  much, right? Actually, at the very beginning of the pandemic, I said something like, look,
*  it's actually February 3rd, about a month before people – I was just watching what was going on
*  in China. I saw that they were doing digital quarantine, using WeChat codes to block people
*  off and so on. I didn't know what was going to happen, but I said, look, if the coronavirus goes
*  pandemic and it seems it may, the extreme edge case becomes the new normal. It's every debate
*  we've had on surveillance, deplatforming and centralization accelerated. Pandemic means
*  emergency powers for the state, even more than terrorism or crime. Sometimes a solution creates
*  the next problem. My rough forecast of the future, the coronavirus results in quarantines,
*  nationalism, centralization. This may actually work to stop the spread, but once under control,
*  states will not see their powers, so we decentralize. I didn't know whether it was
*  going to stop the spread, but I knew that they were going to try to do it, right?
*  And look, it's hard to call every single thing right, and I'm sure someone will find some errors,
*  but in general, I think that was actually pretty good for early February of 2020, right?
*  So, it's my point though. The point is, rather than copying Chinese lockdown, what we should have
*  had were different regimes around the world, to some extent, Sweden defected from this, right?
*  They had no lockdowns or what have you. But really, the axis that people were talking about
*  was lockdown versus no lockdown. The real axis should have been challenge trials versus no
*  challenge trials. We could have had that in days, okay? And those are two examples on both vaccines
*  and testing. There's so many more that I can point to. So, those are kind of decentralized
*  innovations, and that's what FDA should stand for. FDA can stand for it. Or something like FDA,
*  right? Ah, so let's talk about that, right? Something like FDA. So, this is very important.
*  In general, the way I try to think about things is V1, V2, V3, as we've talked about a few times.
*  Right. So, FDA, V.
*  Well, right. So, what was before FDA, right? So, there was both good and bad before FDA,
*  because people don't necessarily have the right model of the past, okay? So, if you ask people
*  what was there before the FDA, they'll say, by the FDA itself, omits the, right? Their pronouns
*  are just FDA, FDA, okay? But basically- Why is that important?
*  It's just something where- Why is that either humorous or interesting to you?
*  They have a sort of in-group lingo where when you are kind of talking about them the way that they
*  talk about themselves, it is something that kind of piques interest. It's kind of like,
*  you know, in LA, people say the 101 or the, you know, right? Whereas in Northern California,
*  they'll say 101. Or people from Nevada will say Nevada, right? It just instantly marks you as
*  insider or outsider, okay? In terms of how the language works, right? And that's- Go ahead.
*  I mean, it just makes me sad, because that lingo is part of the mechanism which creates the silo,
*  the bubble of particular thoughts, and that ultimately deviates from the truth because
*  you're not open to new ideas. I think it's actually like,
*  you know, in Glorious Basterds, there's a scene in the bar. Do you want to talk about it?
*  No, but it's good. You can't- Just to censor you, this is like a Wikipedia podcast,
*  like Wikipedia. You can't cite Quentin Tarantino films. No.
*  Okay, okay, okay. Sorry, take me back there.
*  Basically, English start going like one, two, three, four, five. And I believe it's like
*  the Germans start with the thumb. Something that you never know, right?
*  I may be misremembering there, but I think that's right. Okay. So-
*  FDA's got the lingo. All right.
*  Right. So FDA's got the lingo. So coming back up, basically,
*  just talk about FDA and then come back to your question on the platform.
*  What was V0 FDA? What's V1? What does the future look like?
*  V1 was, quote, patent medicines. Okay, that's what people say. But V1 was also Banting and Best.
*  Okay, Banting and Best, they won the Nobel Prize in the early 1920s. Right? Why? They came up with
*  that year for insulin supplementation to treat diabetes. And they came with a concept. They
*  experimented on dogs. They did self-experimentation. They had healthy volunteers. They
*  experimented with the formulation as well, right? Because just like you'd have a web app and a mobile
*  app, maybe a command line app, you could have a drug that's administered orally or via injection
*  or cream. There's different formulations, right? Dosage, all that stuff they could just iterate on
*  with willing doctor, willing patient. These folks who were affected just sprang out of bed. The
*  insulin supplementation was working for them. And within a couple of years, they had won the
*  Nobel Prize and Eli Lilly had scaled production for the entire North American continent. Okay?
*  So that was a time when pharma moved at the speed of software, when it was willing buyer,
*  willing seller. Okay? Because the past is demonized as something that our glorious regulatory agency
*  is protecting us from. Okay? But there's so many ways in which what it's really protecting you from
*  is being healthy. Okay? As you know, I mean, there's a zillion examples of this. I won't be
*  able to recapitulate all of them just in this podcast, but if you look at a post that I've got,
*  it's called Regulation, Disruption and the Future Technologies of 2013 Coursera PDF. Okay? This
*  lecture, which I'll kind of link it here so you can maybe put in the show notes if you want,
*  this goes through like a dozen different examples of crazy things the FDA did from
*  the kind of stuff that was dramatized in Dallas Byers Club where they were preventing
*  people from getting AIDS drugs to their various attacks on
*  raw milk, where they were basically saying, here's a quote from FDA filing in 2010.
*  There's no generalized right to bodily and physical health. There's no right to consume
*  or feed children any particular food. There's no fundamental right to freedom of contract.
*  They basically feel like they own you. You're not allowed to make your own decisions about
*  your food. There's no generalized right to bodily and physical health. Direct quote from there,
*  like a written kind of thing. Okay? The general frame is usually that FDA says it's protecting
*  you from the big bad company, but really what it's doing is preventing you from opting out.
*  Okay? Now, with that said, and this is where I'm talking about V3, as critical as I am of FDA or
*  the Fed for that matter, I also actually recognize that the Ron Paul type thing of end the Fed
*  is actually not practical. End the Fed will just be laughed at. What Bitcoin did was a much, much,
*  much more difficult task of building something better than the Fed. That's really difficult to
*  do because the Fed and the FDA, they're like the hub of the current system. People rely on them
*  for lots of different things. Okay? You're going to need a better version of them,
*  and how would you actually build something like that? With the Fed and with SEC and the entire
*  banks and whatnot, crypto has a pretty good set of answers for these things. Over time,
*  all the groups that are not the US establishment or the CCP will find more and more to their liking
*  in the crypto economy. That part, I think, is going. Okay? We can talk about that.
*  What does that look like for biomedicine? Well, first, what does exit the FDA look like? Right?
*  There actually are a bunch of exits from the FDA already, which is things like Right to Try laws,
*  CLIA labs and laboratory-developed tests, compounding pharmacies,
*  off-label prescription by doctors, and countries that aren't fully harmonized with FDA. For example,
*  Kobe Bryant, before he passed away, went and did stem cell treatments in Germany. Okay? Stem cells
*  have been pushed out, I think, in part by the Bush administration, but by other things. So,
*  those are different kinds of exits. Right to Try basically means at the state level, you can just
*  try the drug. Okay? CLIA labs and LDTs, that means that's a path where you don't have to go
*  through FDA to get a new device approved. You can just run it in a lab. Okay? Compounding pharmacies,
*  these were under attack. I'm not sure actually where the current statute is on this, but this
*  is that year that a pharmacist has some discretion in how they prepare mixtures of drugs. Off-label
*  prescription by MDs. So, MDs have enough weight in the system that they can kind of push back
*  on FDA. An off-label prescription is the concept that a drug that's approved for purpose A can be
*  prescribed for purpose B or C or D without going through another whole new drug approval process.
*  And then countries that aren't harmonized. Right? So, those are like five different kinds of exits
*  from the FDA on different directions. So, first, those exits exist. So, for those people who are
*  like, oh my God, we're all going to die or he's going to poison us with non-FDA approved things
*  or whatever. Right? Like those exits exist. You've probably actually used tests or treatments from
*  those. You don't even realize that you have. Right? So, it hasn't killed you, number one.
*  Number two is actually testing for safety. There's safety, efficacy, and comparative.
*  Safety is actually relatively easy to test for. There's very few drugs that are like…
*  There's TGN-1412. That's a famous example of something that was actually really dangerous to
*  people with an early test. So, those do exist. Just acknowledge they do exist. But in general,
*  testing for safety is actually not that hard to do. Okay? And if something is safe, then you
*  should be able to try it usually. Okay? Now, what does that decentralized FDA look like? Well,
*  basically, you take individual pieces of it and you can often turn them into
*  vehicles. And this is like 50 different startups. Let me describe some of them. First,
*  have you gotten any drugs or something like that recently? I mean, like prescribed drugs,
*  prescription drugs, and it was like… Well, now that you clarify the answers, no.
*  Yeah. No. Prescribed drugs, no. Okay. So…
*  Not long ago. Antibiotics, a long time ago, maybe. But no.
*  So, you know how you have like a wadded up chemistry textbook, the package insert that
*  goes into the… Yes, yes, yes.
*  Okay. Wadded up chemistry textbook. I love it.
*  That's what it is, right? What a terrible user interface. We don't usually think of it that way.
*  Why is the user interface so terrible? That's a web of regulation that makes it so terrible.
*  And there's actually guys who tried to innovate just on user interface called,
*  Help, I Need Help. That was like the name of the company a while back. And it was trying to
*  explain the stuff in plain language, okay? Just on user interface, you can innovate.
*  And why is that important? Well, there's a company called PillPack, which innovated on,
*  quote, the user interface for drugs by giving people a thing which had like a daily blister pack.
*  So, it's like, here's your prescription and you're supposed to take all these pills on the first
*  and second. And basically, whether you had taken them on a given day was manifest by whether you
*  had opened it for that specific day, okay? This is way better than other kinds of so-called
*  compliance methodologies like there are guys who tried to do like an IoT pill where when you
*  swallow it, it gives you measurements. This was just a simple innovation on user interface
*  that boosted compliance in the sense of compliance with the drug regimen dramatically, right?
*  And I think they got acquired or would have you for a lot of money.
*  And hopefully utilized effectively.
*  Utilized effectively, right?
*  Well, sometimes these companies that do incredible innovation really makes you
*  sad when they get acquired that leads to their death, not their scaling.
*  Sure. I mean, they did a lot of other good things, but this is one thing that they did well,
*  right? So, PillPack just shows what you can get with improving on user interface.
*  Why can't... I mean, we get reviews for everything, right? One thing that, you know,
*  like people have sort of, in my view, somewhat quoted our context are like,
*  oh, biology thinks you should replace the FDA with the ELP for drugs. Actually, there's something
*  called phase four, okay, of the FDA, which is so-called post-market surveillance.
*  Do you know that that's actually something where in theory you can go and fill out a form
*  on the FDA website, which basically says, I've had, you know, a bad experience with a drug.
*  Like VAERS, but for drugs.
*  Yeah. So, it's called MedWatch, right? And so, you can do like voluntary reporting and you can get
*  like a PDF and just like upload it, right? Is this a government? Like, is this .gov?
*  Yeah, it's form 3500B.
*  I love it. It's HTML. It's going to be like from the 90s or it's going to have an interface
*  designed by somebody who's a COBOL slash Fortran programmer.
*  Right. Here we go. So, here we go. So, basically the 3500B...
*  I hope to be proven wrong on that, by the way.
*  So, 3500B, consumer voluntary reporting. When do I use this form? You were hurt or had a bad
*  side effect, use a drug which lets unsafe use, et cetera. The point is FDA already has a terrible
*  Yelp for drugs. It has a terrible version of it. What would the good version look like? The fact
*  that you've never, I mean, the fact you have to fill out a PDF to go and submit a report. How do
*  you submit a report at Yelp or Uber or Airbnb or Amazon? You tap and there's star ratings, right?
*  So, just modernizing FDA 3500B and modernizing phase four, okay, is a huge thing.
*  Can you comment on that? What incentive mechanism forces the modernization of that kind of thing?
*  Here's how it would work. Or one possible.
*  To create an actual Yelp.
*  Yeah. Here's how that would work, right? You go to the pharmacy or wherever and you hold up your
*  phone and you scan the barcode of the drug, okay? What does it usually say? Instantly you see
*  global reports, right? By the way, because your biology, your physiology, that's global, right?
*  Information from Brazil or from Germany or Japan on their physiological reaction to the same drug
*  you're taking is useful to you. It's not like a national boundaries thing. So, the whole nation
*  state model of only collecting information on by other Americans. Really you want a global kind of
*  thing. Just like Amazon book reviews, that's a global thing. Other things are aggregated
*  at the global level, okay? So, what you want is to see every patient report and every doctor
*  around the world on this drug. That might be really important to your rare or semi-rare condition.
*  Just that alone would be a valuable site.
*  Who builds that site? It sounds like something created by capitalism. It sounds like-
*  You could do it by capitalism, yeah.
*  It would have to be a company.
*  Yeah, you can definitely do it. See, these-
*  But we don't have a world where a company is allowed to be in charge of that kind of thing.
*  Well, I don't know about-
*  Health went down. It just seems like a lot of the-
*  So, it depends, right? Basically, this is why you have to pick off individual elements, right?
*  There's essentially a combination of first recognizing that
*  DEFTY is actually bad. You can be able to say that. Let me put it like this. It does a lot of bad
*  things. It is something which you need to be able to criticize. You might be like, well, that's
*  obvious, right? Well, in 2010, for example, there's a book that came out, if anybody wants
*  to understand FDA, it's called Reputation and Power.
*  Yeah. A lot of people don't want to criticize FDA.
*  Yeah, because they will retaliate against your biotech or pharma company.
*  Yeah, and that retaliation can be initiated by a single human being.
*  Absolutely. The best analogy is, you think about the TSA, okay? Have you flown recently?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay. Do you make any jokes about the TSA when you're in the TSA line?
*  Usually, you don't want to, but they're a little more flexible.
*  Okay.
*  Can I tell a story?
*  Sure.
*  Which is similar to this. I was in Vegas at a club. I don't go to clubs.
*  I got kicked out for the first time in my life for making a joke with a bouncer.
*  Because I had a camera with me and you're not allowed to have a camera. I said, okay, cool,
*  I'll take it out. But I made a funny joke that I don't care to retell. But he was just a little
*  offended. He was like, I don't care who you are. I don't care who you're with. He proceeded to list
*  me the famous people he has kicked off. But there is, I mean, all of those... The reason I made the
*  joke is I sensed that there was an entitlement to this particular individual where the authority has
*  gotten to his head.
*  Respect my authority.
*  Yeah. I almost wanted to poke at that. And I think the poking the authority, I quickly learned
*  the lesson. I have now been rewarded with the pride, I feel, for having poked authority. But
*  now I'm kicked out of the club that would have resulted in a fun night with friends and so on.
*  Instead, I'm standing alone crying in Vegas, which is not a unique Vegas experience.
*  Sure.
*  It's actually a fundamental Vegas experience. But that, I'm sure that basic human nature happens
*  in the FDA as well.
*  That's exactly right. So just like with the TSA, just to extend the analogy, when you're in line
*  at the TSA, you don't want to miss your flight. That could cost you hundreds of dollars. And so
*  you comply with absolutely ludicrous regulations like, oh, three ounce bottles. Well, you know what?
*  You can take an unlimited number of three ounce bottles and you can combine them into six ounce
*  bottles with a terrorist technology called mixing. Okay? Advanced, right? And the thing about this is
*  everybody in line, actually some fairly high, let's say, called influence or net worth,
*  whatever people fly, right? Millions and millions and millions of people are subject
*  to these absolute moronic regulations. It's all what I think security theater is Shrier's term.
*  A lot of people know this term. So millions of people are subject to it. It costs untold billions
*  of dollars in terms of delays and what, if you could just walk up to it, right? It irradiates
*  people. And this is another FDA thing, by the way, this is an FDA TSA team up, okay? In 2010,
*  the TSA body scanners, there were concerns expressed, but when it's a government to
*  government thing, see a .com is treated with extreme scrutiny by FDA, but it's another .gov.
*  Well, they're not trying to make a profit. So they kind of just wave them on through. Okay?
*  So these body scanners were basically applied to millions and millions of people and this huge
*  kind of opt-in experiments almost, I think it's quite likely by the way, that if there was even
*  a slightly increased cancer risk, that the net morbidity and mortality from those would have
*  outweighed the deaths from terrorism or whatever that were prevented, right? You can work out the
*  numbers, but you can just get the math under reasonable assumptions. It's probably true.
*  If it had any increased morbidity and mortality. I've not seen the recent things, but I've seen
*  that concern expressed 12 years ago. Point being that despite the cost, despite how many people
*  are exposed to it, despite how obviously patently ludicrous it is, you don't make any trouble,
*  nor do people organize protests or whatever about this because it's something where
*  the security theater of the whole thing is part of it. Oh, well, if we took them away,
*  there'd be more terrorism or something like that. People think, right?
*  But it is fascinating to see that the populace puts up with it because one of my favorite things
*  is to listen to Jordan Peterson, who I think offline, but I think also on the podcast,
*  you know, is somebody who resists authority in every way. And even he
*  goes to TSA with a kind of suppressed, like all the instructions, everything down to whenever you
*  have like the yellow thing for your feet, they force you to adjust it even slightly if you're off.
*  Just even, I mean, it's like, it's a Kafka novel. We're living like TSA, it makes me smile,
*  it brings joy to my heart because I imagine Franz Kafka and I just walking through there because
*  it really is just deeply absurd. But, and then the whole motivation of the mechanism
*  becomes distorted by the individuals involved. The initial one was to reduce the number of
*  terrorist attacks, I suppose. Right. Now it's guns and drugs. Basically,
*  it's like, essentially what they've done is they've repealed the fourth amendment, right?
*  Search and seizure, they can do it without probable cause. Everybody is being searched,
*  everybody's a potential terrorist. So they've got probable cause for everybody in theory.
*  And so what they do, they'll post on their website, the guns and drugs or whatever that they seized
*  in these scanners. Well, of course, if you search everybody, you're going to find some criminals
*  or whatever, but the cost of doing that is dramatic. Moreover, the fact that people have
*  sure been trained to have, you know, compliance, it's like the Soviet Union, right? Where,
*  you know, just grudgingly, all right, go along with this extremely stupid thing. What's my point?
*  The point is this is a really stupid regulation that has existed in plain sight of everybody
*  for 20 years. We're still taking off our shoes. Okay. But there's some shoe bomber, whatever
*  number of years ago. Okay. All of this stuff is there as opposed to, there's a zillion other
*  things you could potentially do, different paradigms for quote airport security, but
*  now apply that to FDA. Just like a lot of what TSA does is security theater, arguably all of it.
*  A lot of what FDA does is safety theater. The difference is there's far fewer people who go
*  through the aperture. They're the biotech and pharma CEOs. Okay. So you don't have an
*  understanding of what it is to deal with them. Number one. Number two is the penalty is not a
*  few hundred dollars of missing your flight. It is a few million dollars or tens or hundreds of
*  millions of dollars for getting your company subject to the equivalent of a retaliatory
*  wait time. Just like that bouncer threw you out, just like the TSA officer, if you make a joke or,
*  you know, they can just sit you down and make you lose your flight, right? So too, can the FDA just
*  silently impede the approval of something and choke you out financially because you don't have
*  enough runway to get funded, right? So impose more wait time. Guess what? We want another six months,
*  you know, data is going to take another six months. Your company doesn't have the time.
*  You die, right? If you live, you have to raise around at some dilutive valuation.
*  And now the price gets jacked up on the other side. That's the one thing that can give by the
*  way in this whole process. When you push out timelines from days to get a vaccine approved
*  with or vaccine evaluated rather via challenge trials to months or years, the cost during that
*  time, when you, it just increases nonlinearly, right? Because you can't iterate on the product.
*  All the normal observations, if it takes you 10 years to launch a product versus 10 days,
*  what's the difference in terms of your speed of variation, your cost, et cetera, right? So this
*  is part of it. It's not the only thing. There's other things. There's AMA and CPT, there's other
*  things, but this is one of the things that jacks up prices in the US medical system. Okay?
*  So now you have something where these CEOs, they're going through this aperture. They are,
*  they can't tell anybody about it because if you read Reputation and Power, okay, I'm going to
*  just quote this because it's an amazing, amazing book, right? It's written by a guy, you know,
*  Daniel Carpenter, a smart guy, but he's an FDA sympathizer. He fundamentally thinks it's like
*  a good thing or what have you. Nevertheless, I respect Carpenter's intellectual honesty because
*  he quotes the CEOs in the book, you know, verbatim and he gives some paragraphs.
*  And essentially from their descriptions, it's like, think about like a Vietnam War thing where
*  you've got a POW and they're like blinking through their eyes, I'm being tortured. Okay?
*  That is the style when you read Carpenter's book, you read the quotes from these CEOs.
*  Let me see if I can find it. Do you recommend the book?
*  It's a good book. Yeah. It's now a little bit outdated, okay? Because it's like, you know,
*  almost 10 years old. Still, as a history of the FDA, it is well worth reading. And by the reason
*  I say it, like the FDA is so insanely important. It's so much more important than many other things
*  that people talk about, but they don't talk about it, right? I just want to read his little
*  blurb for it, right? This is 2010. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is the most powerful
*  regulatory agency in the world. How did the FDA become so influential and how does it wield its
*  extraordinary power? Reputation power traces the history of FDA regulation pharmaceuticals,
*  revealing how the agency's organizational reputation as being the primary source of
*  its power is also one of its ultimate constraints. Carpenter describes how the FDA cultivated
*  a reputation for competence and vigilance throughout the last century and how this
*  organizational image has enabled the agency to regulate while resisting efforts to curb
*  its own authority. First of all, just that description alone, you're like, wait a second,
*  he is describing this as an active player. It's not like a DMV kind of thing, which is passed
*  through. It's talking about cultivating a reputation, its power, resisting efforts to
*  curb its own authority, right? The thing is, now you're kind of through the looking glass,
*  you're like, wait a second, this is kind of language I don't usually hear for regulatory
*  agencies. The thing is, the kind of person who becomes the CEO of a giant company, what do they
*  want to do? They want to expand that company. They want to make more profit. Similarly, the
*  kind of person who comes to run a regulatory agency or one of the subunits, that person
*  wants to expand its ambit. Okay.
*  By the way, is that always obvious and sorry to interrupt, but for the CEO of the company,
*  I know that the philosophical ideal of capitalism is you want to make the thing more profitable, but
*  we're also human beings. Do you think there's some fundamental aspect to which we want to do
*  a lot of good in the world? Sure. But the fiduciary duty will push people to get the ambitious,
*  the profit maximizing expansionist CEO is selected for. Right? Basically, they believe crucially,
*  they're not just, this is important, they're not just, I mean, some of them are grant the thought
*  to make as much money as possible, but they believe in the mission. Okay. They've come to
*  believe in the mission and that is the person who's selected. Chomsky actually had this good thing,
*  which is like, I believe that you believe what you believe, but if you didn't believe what you
*  believe, you wouldn't be sitting here. Right. So they select for the kind of people that are
*  able to make a lot of money. And in that process, those people are able to have constructed narrative
*  that they're doing good, even though what they were selected for is the fact that they can make a lot
*  of money. Yeah. And they may actually be doing good, but the thing is with CEOs, we have a zillion
*  images and television and media movies of the evil corporation and the greedy CEO. We have some
*  concept of what CEO failure modes are like. Okay. Now, when have you ever seen an evil regulator?
*  Have you? Can you name a fictional portrayal of an evil regulator? Can you name an evil CEO?
*  Yeah, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot. But that's so interesting. I'm trying to,
*  I'm searching for a deeper lesson here. You're right. You're right. I mean, there is,
*  there is portrayals, especially in sort of authoritarian regimes or the Soviet Union,
*  where there's bureaucracy, you know, Chernobyl, you can kind of see within that there's a dereg,
*  the story of the regulator, but yeah, it's, it's not as plentiful and it's also doesn't often
*  doesn't have a face to it. It's almost like bureaucracy is this amorphous thing that results
*  in you. One individual, you see, they're just obeying somebody else. There's not a face to it
*  of evil. That's the evil is the entire machine. That's right. That's what I call the school of
*  fish strategy, by the way. It's something where you are an individual and you can be signaled out,
*  but there's more accountability for one person's bad tweets than all the wars in the Middle East,
*  right? Because it's a school of fish. Yeah. Right? So if the establishment is wrong,
*  if the bureaucracy is wrong, they're all wrong at the same time. Who could have known?
*  Whereas if you deviate, then you are a deviation who can be hammered down. Okay. Now the school
*  of fish strategy is unfortunately very successful because, you know, truth is whatever. If you just
*  always ride with the school of fish and turn when they turn and so on, unless there's a bigger
*  school of fish that comes in, you basically can never be proven wrong. Right? And this is actually,
*  you know, of course someone who believes in truth and believes in, you know, innovation and so on,
*  just physiologically can't ride with the school of fish. You just have to say what is true or do
*  what is true. Right? Still you've described correctly, you know, how it's faceless. Right?
*  So I will give two examples of fictional portrayals of evil regulators.
*  One is actually the original Ghostbusters.
*  Okay. Did not exactly that one, but yes.
*  Yeah. So the EPA is actually the villain in that where they flip a switch that lets out all the
*  ghosts in the city. And essentially the guy is coming in with a head of steam as this evil
*  regulator that's just totally arrogant, doesn't actually understand the private sector or the
*  consequences of their actions. And they force the, and crucially they bring a cop with them with a
*  gun. So it shows that a regulator is not simply, you know, some piece of paper, but it is the police.
*  Right? And that cop with the gun forces the Ghostbusters to like release the container
*  and the whole thing spreads. The second example is Dallas Spires Club, which is more recent.
*  And that actually shows the FDA blocking a guy who with a life threatening illness, you know,
*  with AIDS from getting the drugs to tree's condition and from getting it to other people.
*  Right? Those are just two portrayals. But in general, what you find is when you talk about FDA
*  with people, one thing I'll often hear from folks is like, why would they do that? Right? They have
*  no mental model of this. They kind of think of it as why would this thing, which they think of as
*  sort of the DMV, they don't think of the DMV as like this active thing. Okay. Why would the FDA do
*  that? Well, it is because it's filled with some ambitious people that want to keep increasing the
*  power of the agency, just like the CEO wants to increase the profit of the company. Right? I use
*  that word ambit. Right? Why ambit? Because these folks are, we know the term greedy, right? These
*  folks are power hungry. They want to have the maximum scope. And sometimes regulatory agencies
*  collide with each other. Right? Even though FDA is under HHS, sometimes it collides with HHS and
*  they've got regulations that conflict. You know, for example, HHS says everybody's supposed to be
*  able to have access to their own medical record. FDA didn't want people to have access to their
*  own personal genomes. That conflicts. Okay. And both of those are kind of anti-corporate
*  statutes that were put out with HHS's thing being targeted at the hospitals and FDA being
*  targeted at the personal genomic companies. But those conflicted. Right? It's a little bit like
*  CFTC and SEC have a door jam over who will regulate cryptocurrency. Right? Sometimes regulators
*  fight each other, but they fight each other. They fight companies. They are active players.
*  This reputation and power book, the reason I mention it is, I'm going to see if I can
*  find this quote. So let me see if I can find this quote. Reputation and power, organizational image
*  and pharmaceutical regulation at the FDA. So Genentech's executive G. Kirk Robb, right? Rob
*  would describe regulatory approval for his products as a fundamental challenge facing his company.
*  And he would depict the administration a particularly vivid metaphor.
*  I've told the story hundreds of times to help people understand the FDA. When I was in Brazil,
*  I worked on the Amazon river for many months selling teramycin for Pfizer. I hadn't seen my
*  family for eight or nine months. They're flying into Sao Paulo and I was flying down from some
*  little village on the Amazon to Manus and then to Sao Paulo. I was a young guy in his 20s. I
*  couldn't wait to see the kids. One of them was a year old baby. The other was three. I missed my wife.
*  There was a Quonset hut in front of just a little dirt strip with a single engine
*  plane to fly me to Manus. I roll up and there's a Brazilian soldier there.
*  The military revolution happened literally the week before. So this soldier is standing there with
*  his machine gun and he said to me, you can't come in. I speak in pretty good Portuguese by that time.
*  I said, my God, my plane, my family, I got to come in. He said again, you can't come in. I said,
*  I got to come in. And he took his machine gun, took the safety off and pointed at me and said,
*  you can't come in. And I said, oh, now I got it. I can't go in there. And that's the way I always
*  described the FDA. The FDA is standing there with a machine gun against the pharmaceutical industry.
*  So you better be their friend rather than their enemy. They're the boss. If you're a pharmaceutical
*  firm, they own you body and soul. Okay. That's the CEO of a successful company, Genentech. He
*  said he's told the story hundreds of times and regulatory approval is a fundamental challenge
*  facing his company because if you are regulated by FDA, they are your primary customer. If they cut
*  the cord on you, you have no other customers. And in fact, until very recently with the advent
*  of social media, no one would even tell your story. It was assumed that you were some sort of
*  corporate criminal that they were protecting the public from, that you were going to put
*  poison in milk, like the melamine scandal in China. I'm not saying those things don't exist,
*  by the way. They do exist. That's why people are like, they can immediately summon to mind
*  all the examples of corporate criminals. That's why I mentioned those fictional stories,
*  those templates. Even if Star Wars doesn't exist, how many times have you heard a Star
*  Wars metaphor or whatever for something? Breaking Bad. Go ahead.
*  Yeah, but the pharmaceutical companies are stuck between a rock and a hard place because the
*  reputation, if they go to Twitter, they go to social media, they have horrible reputations.
*  So it's like they don't know- Yes. But why is that? Because reputation and power.
*  FDA beat down the reputation of pharma companies, just like EPA helped beat down the reputation of
*  oil companies. And as it says over here, right? In practice, dealing with the fact of FDA power
*  meant a fundamental change in corporate structure and culture. At Abbott and at Genentech, Rob's
*  most central transformation was in creating a culture of acquiescence towards a government
*  agency. As was done at other drug companies in the late 20th century, Rob essentially fired
*  officials at Abbott who were insufficiently compliant with the FDA. What that means is
*  de facto nationalization of the industry via regulation, just to hover on that. That's a
*  really big deal because if their primary customer is this government agency, then it has nationalized
*  it just indirectly, right? This is partially what's just happened with Microsoft, Apple, Google,
*  Amazon, the other MAGA, okay? They have been- That's funny.
*  Well done. Yeah. I didn't even think about that. It's well done.
*  Like I have this tweet, it's like MAGA Republicans and MAGA Democrats, right?
*  Okay. Oh, damn it. So many things you've said today will just get stuck in my head.
*  It changes the way you think. Something about catchy phrasing of ideas makes me even more
*  powerful. So yeah, okay. So that's happening in the tech sector.
*  It's happening in tech. So Facebook is the outlier because Zuck still controls the company.
*  But just like, I mean, why had tech had a good reputation for a while? Because there wasn't a
*  regulatory agency whose justification was regulating these corporate criminals, right? Once that is the
*  case, the regulatory agency basically comes back to Congress each year. If you look at its budget
*  approvals, it's saying, we find this many guys, we found this many violations, right? They have an
*  incentive to exaggerate the threat in the same way that a prosecutor or a policeman has a quota,
*  right? Like these are the police. One way I describe it also is like a step down transformers.
*  You have high voltage electricity that's generated at the power plant and it comes over the wires.
*  And then there's step down transformers that turn it into a lower voltage that you can just deal
*  with out of your appliances, right? Similarly, you have something where the high voltage of like
*  the US military or the police, and that is transmitted down into a little letter that
*  comes in your mailbox saying, pay your $50 parking ticket, where it's a piece of paper. So you don't
*  see the gun attached to it. But if you were to defy that, it's like Grand Theft Auto, where you
*  get one star, two star, three stars, four stars, five stars. And eventually, you know, you have some
*  serious stuff on your hands. Okay. So once you understand that, you know, every law is backed by
*  force, like that Brazilian guy with the machine gun that Rob mentioned, these guys are the regulatory
*  police. Okay. Now, see, for a time, what happened was you had the captured industry because all of
*  the folks who were in pharmaceuticals were, as Carpenter said, a culture of acquiescence
*  towards the FDA. The FDA was their primary customer. So just like in a sense, it's rational.
*  You know, Amazon talks about being customer obsessed, right? What Rob did was rational
*  for that time, right? What G-Corp Rob did was saying, our customer is the FDA. That's our primary
*  customer. Nobody else matters. They are satisfied first. Every single trade-off that has to be made
*  is FDA, right? And, you know, really that's why the two most important departments at many
*  pharmaceutical companies, arguably all, are regulatory affairs and IP, not R&D, right?
*  Because one is artificial scarcity of regulation, which jacks up the price, and the other is
*  artificial scarcity of the patent, which allows people to maintain the high price, right? So this
*  entire thing is just like, you know, college education. These things may at some point have
*  been a good concept, but the price has just risen and risen and risen until it's at the limit price
*  and beyond, okay? So what has changed? What's changed is in the 2010s, the late 2000s and 2010s
*  and so on, with the advent of social media, with the advent of a bunch of millionaires,
*  like who are independent, with the advent of Uber and Airbnb, right? With the advent of
*  cryptocurrency, with the diminution of trust in institutions, it used to be really taboo to even
*  talk about the FDA's potentially bad in like, you know, 2010, 2009, okay? But now people have
*  just seen face plant after face plant by the institutions, and people are much more open to
*  the concept that they may actually not have it all together. And I think it's a, you know, you
*  could probably see some tracking poll or something like that, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's
*  like a 20 or 30 point drop after the CDC failed to control disease and the FDA failed, and the
*  entire biomedical regulatory establishment and scientific establishment was saying masks don't
*  work before they do. This was just a train crash of all the things that you're paying for that you
*  supposedly think are good. As I mentioned, one response is to go QAnon and people say,
*  oh, don't trust anything, but the better response is decentralizing FDA. Okay. So
*  I will say one other thing, which is I mentioned, you know, this concept of improving the form 3500B
*  where you like scan, go ahead. Yeah, right. That just makes me laugh that I could just tell the
*  form sucks by the fact that it has that code name. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Right.
*  UX is broken at every layer. Yeah. So they have a bad yelp for drugs. Could we make a better one?
*  We could make a better one. Just modern UX. The key insight here, by the way, which is a non-obvious
*  point, and I've got a whole talk on this actually, that I should probably release. I actually did
*  like almost eight, nine years ago. It's called regulation is information. Product quality is a
*  digital signal. Okay. What do I mean by that? Basically, when I talk about exit, you know,
*  exit the Fed, that's the crypto economy, right? What does exit the FDA look like? Well, one key
*  insight is that many of the big scale tech companies can be thought of as cloud regulators rather than
*  land regulators. What do I mean by that? Well, first, what is regulation? People do want a
*  regulated marketplace. They want A, quality ratings, like on a one to five star scale,
*  and B, bands of bad actors, like the zero star frauds and scammers and so on. And these are
*  distinct, right? Somebody who's like a low quality but well intentioned person is different than a
*  smart and evil person. Those are two different kinds of failure modes you could have in a
*  marketplace, right? Why is it rational for people to want a regulated marketplace, especially for
*  health? Because they want to pay essentially one entry cost, and then they don't have to evaluate
*  everything separately where they may not have the technical information to do that. Right. You don't
*  want to go to Starbucks and put a dipstick into every coffee to see if it's poisoned or something
*  like that. You sort of want to enter a zone where you know things are basically good, and you pay
*  that one diligence cost on the zone itself, right? Whether it's a digital or physical zone, and then
*  the regulator is taking care of it, and they've baked in the regulatory cost into some subscription
*  fee of some kind, right? So the thing is the model we've talked about is the land regulator of a
*  nation state and a territorially bounded thing, but the cloud regulator, what's a cloud regulator?
*  That is Amazon star ratings, that's Yelp, that is eBay, that is Airbnb, that is Uber and Lyft,
*  and so on and so forth. It's also actually Gmail and Google. Why? Because you're doing spam filtering
*  and you are doing ranking of mails with priority inbox, right? With Google itself, they ban malware
*  links, right? So the bad actors are out and they're ranking them, right? How about Apple,
*  the app store, right? They ban bad actors and they do star ratings. When you start actually applying
*  this lens, PayPal, they've got a reputation there. Every single web service that's at the scale of
*  tens of millions or hundreds of millions of people has had to build a cloud regulator.
*  And the crucial thing is it scales across borders. So you can use the data from Mexico
*  to help somebody in Moldova or vice versa, right? Because it's fundamentally international,
*  right? Those ratings, you have a network effect. And there's another aspect to it, which is these
*  are better regulators than the land regulators. For example, Uber is a better regulator than the
*  taxi medallions. Why? Every ride is GPS tracked. There's ratings on both the driver and the
*  passenger side. Both parties know that payment can be rendered in a standard currency, right?
*  If you have below a certain star rating on either side, you get deplatformed and so on to
*  protect either rider or driver and on and on, right? What does that do? Think about how much
*  better that is than taxi medallions. Rather than a six-month or annual inspection, you have reports
*  from every single rider, okay? Before Uber, it was the taxi drivers and taxi regulators were in a
*  little monopoly locally, okay? Because they were the persistent actors in the ecosystem. Taxi riders
*  had nothing in common, didn't even know each other. In New York, some guy gets in a taxi,
*  another guy, they had no way to communicate with each other. So the persistent actors in the
*  ecosystem were the regulators and the drivers, and they had this cozy kind of thing and medallion
*  prices just kept going up, and this was a sort of collaboration on artificial scarcity. Afterwards,
*  with Uber and Lyft and other entrants, you had something interesting, a different kind of regulator
*  driver fusion. If you assume regulatory capture exists and lean into it,
*  Uber is the new regulator and Uber drivers are the drivers, Lyft is the competing regulator,
*  and Lyft drivers are the new drivers, okay? So you have a regulator driver fusion
*  versus another regulator driver fusion. You no longer have a monopoly. You have multiple parties,
*  okay? You have a competitive market. This is the concept of polycentric law, right? Where you have
*  multiple different legal regimes in the same jurisdiction overlapping that you can choose
*  between with a tap of a button, right? All these concepts from libertarian theory like
*  polycentric law or catalysis, all these things are becoming more possible now that the internet
*  has increased microeconomic leverage because that exit is now possible. Now, you may argue,
*  oh, well, Lyft and Uber, they're not profitable anymore, and there's two different criticisms
*  of them. One is, oh, they're not profitable, or oh, they're charging too much. And I think part of
*  this is because of certain kinds of… The regulatory state has caught up to try to make
*  them uncompetitive. For example, they don't allow people in some states to identify themselves as
*  independent contractors, even if they are part-time, okay? There's various other kinds of rules and
*  regulations. In Austin, for a while, Uber was even banned, what have you, right? Netnet, though,
*  like Uber, Grab, Go-Jek, Lyft, Didi, like ride sharing as a concept is now out there. And
*  whatever the next version is where it's self-driving, while it's like a very hard-fought
*  battle and the regulatory state keeps trying to push things back into the garage, this is a
*  fundamentally better way of just doing regulation of taxis. Similarly, Airbnb for hotels. I mean,
*  I don't even have to have to… It's basically the same thing, okay? And Airbnb could use
*  competition. I think that it would be good to have competition for them, and there are other
*  kinds of sites opening up. But the fundamental concept of the cloud regulator now, let's apply
*  it here. Once you realize regulation is information, the way you'd set up a competitor to FDA or SEC
*  or FAA or something like that is you just do better reviews. You just start with that. That's pure
*  information. You're under free speech. That's still the most defended thing, literally just
*  publishing reviews. And not just reviews by any old person. It turns out that FDA typically will
*  use expert panels, where there's expert panels. It's like professors from Harvard or things like
*  that. So what that is, is this concept of a reputational bridge. What you want to do is you
*  want to have folks who are, let's say, biotech entrepreneurs or they're, you know, profs like
*  Sinclair or what have you. You do want to have the reviews of the crowd, okay? But you also want to
*  have, especially in medicine, you want to have the reviews of experts of some kind. So there's going
*  to be defectors from the current establishment, okay? Just like there are profs who defected from
*  computer science academia to become Larry and Sergey and whatever. They weren't profs,
*  they were grad students, right? In the same way, you'll have defectors who have the credentials
*  from the old world, but can build up the new. Just like there's folks from Wall Street who have come
*  into cryptocurrency and helped legitimate it, right? Just like there's folks who left
*  Salzburger to come to Substack, okay? We have these folks who by defecting, they help,
*  and then they're also supplemented by all this new talent coming in, right? That combination of things
*  is how you build a new system. It's not completely by itself nor is it trying to
*  reform the old, it's some fusion, okay? So in this new system, who do you have? You have
*  like the most entrepreneurial and innovative MDs, you have the most entrepreneurial and innovative
*  professors, and you have the founders of actual new products and stuff. And they are giving
*  open source reviews of these products and they're also building a community that will say, look,
*  we want this new drug or we want this new treatment or we want this new device,
*  and we're willing to crowdfund 10,000 units. So please give us the thing and we'll write a very
*  fair review of it and we'll also all evaluate it as a community and so on. So you turn these people
*  from just passive patients into active participants in their health, that's a community part, and
*  they've got the kind of biomedical technical leadership there. Now, what is the kind of
*  prototype of something like this? Something like VitaDao is very interesting. Things like
*  MoleculeDao are very interesting. It'll start with things like longevity, right? And why is that?
*  Because the entire model of FDA, this 20th century model, is wait for somebody to have a disease and
*  then try to cure them, okay? Versus saying an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, right?
*  Why are we not actually tracking folks and getting a constant dashboard on yourself
*  so you can see whether things are breaking and then you deal with it just like you've got server
*  uptime things? You don't wait necessarily for the site to go down. You start seeing, oh, response
*  rates are spiking. We need to add more servers, right? You have some warning, okay? Even 10 years
*  ago, there's this article called The Measured Man in the Atlantic where this guy, physicist Larry
*  Smarr, okay? What he was doing is he was essentially doing a bunch of measurements on himself,
*  and he was finding that there were predictors of inflammation that were spiking and he went to the
*  doctor, showed the charts, and the doctor was like, I can't do anything with this.
*  Then it turned out to be an early warning of a serious condition and he had to, I think, go for
*  like surgery or something. And he was starting to think, well, look, the way that we're doing
*  medicine right now is it's not quite like pre-germ theory of disease, but it is pre-continuous
*  diagnostics. Okay. Continuous diagnostics, just to talk about this for a second, I mentioned one
*  angle on which you go after FDA, which is like the better phase four, right? I've mentioned the
*  concept of better reviews in general, okay? I mentioned VitaDao, which is like a community
*  that is going after longevity. Let's talk about continuous diagnostics. So basically, we know
*  better what is going on in Bangalore or Budapest in our own body.
*  That's actually kind of insane to think about. This stuff that, you know, it's all the other
*  side of the world, 10,000 miles away, but you know, a few millimeters away, you don't really
*  know what's going on, right? And that's starting to change with all the quantified self-devices,
*  the hundreds of millions of Apple watches and Fitbits and stuff, right? You're also starting
*  to see continuous glucose meters, which are very important. They're starting to give you readouts.
*  People are seeing, wow, this is spiking my insulin, or rather, this is spiking my blood sugar.
*  And it might be something you didn't predict. It varies for different people. For some people,
*  banana isn't a big deal. For others, it's actually quite bad for the blood sugar.
*  What happens when you extend that? Well, about 10 years ago, a guy, Mike Snyder, a professor
*  at Stanford, did something called the Integroam, where he just threw the kitchen sink of all the
*  diagnostics he could at himself over the period of, I think, a few weeks or a few months. I forget
*  the exact duration. He's able to do things where he could see during that period, he like got a
*  cold or something. And he could see in the expression data, the gene expression data,
*  that he was getting sick before he felt sick. He could also see that something about that
*  viral infection made him develop diabetes-like symptoms, if I'm remembering it accurately.
*  So you can see, oh, wait a second, these are things that I can see in my readouts
*  that I would only have the vaguest interpretation of as a human being, right?
*  And moreover, he could take, I don't think he did this, but if you took treatments, if you took
*  drugs, you could actually show what your steady state was, if you tracked over time, show what
*  your disease state or sick state was. And then this drug pushes you back into non-disease state.
*  You can actually get a quantitative readout of what steady state was. And that steady state,
*  that steady state, your expression levels across all these genes, your small molecules,
*  basically everything you can measure, that's going to vary from person to person.
*  What's healthy and natural for you may be a different baseline than for me. For example,
*  people who are, small example, people who are South Asian or have dark skin tend to have vitamin D
*  deficiency. Why? Because we need a lot of sunlight. So often inside you're tapping on your screen.
*  So what do we do? Take actually significant vitamin D infusions. That's a small example
*  of where baselines differ between people. So continuous diagnostics, what could that mean?
*  That could mean things like the continuous glucose meter, it's quantified self, it's like
*  continuous blood testing. So you have a so-called mobile phlebotomist. This is something which,
*  phlebotomist takes blood, mobile phlebotomy would come to your office, come to your remote office.
*  This is a great business for people. I think you can revisit this in 2022. People tried this in the
*  2010s, but I think it's worth revisiting. Mobile phlebotomist comes every week or every month,
*  takes blood, runs every test. Maybe that's a few thousand dollars a year, maybe eventually gets to
*  a few hundred dollars a year. And that's expensive in some ways, but boy, that's better health
*  insurance in other ways. Yeah, I mean, it's amazing. So one, there's a bunch of companies that do this
*  and I actually would love to learn more about them. One of them is a company called InsideTracker,
*  that sponsors this podcast. They do that, but the reason I really appreciate them, they're the
*  first ones that introduced me to like how easy it is, but it's also depressing how little information
*  exactly, as you beautifully put it once again, how little information we have about our own body
*  in a continuous sense. And actually also sadly, even with InsideTracker, as I collect that data,
*  how not integrated that data is with everything else. If I wanted to opt in, I would like,
*  just like riffing off the top of my head, but I would like Google Maps to know what's going on
*  inside my body. Maybe I can't intuit at first why that application is useful, but there could be
*  incredible, like that's where the entrepreneurial spirit builds is like, what can I do with that
*  data? Can I make the trip less stressful for you and adjust the Google Maps thing kind of thing?
*  That's right. So I mean, one of the things about this, by the way, is because there are so many
*  movies made about theranos, that's one of the reasons why people have sort of been scared off
*  from doing diagnostics to some extent. Why? Because VCs are like, oh, is this another theranos?
*  The diligence and everything, everyone's looking at it, oh, blood testing, one drop of blood,
*  how it hurts the recruiting. Essentially, a lot of the media and stuff around that
*  basically has pathologized the thing that we want to have a lot more entrance in.
*  One way of thinking about it is FDA has killed way more people than theranos has.
*  Way more. Just take drug lag alone. Whenever you have a drug that works and reduced morbidity and
*  mortality after it was actually generally available, but was delayed for months or years,
*  the integral under that curve is the excess morbidity and mortality attributable to FDA's
*  drug lag. You could go back and do that study across lots and lots of different drugs,
*  and you'd probably find quite a lot. Alex Tabarrok and others have written on this,
*  Daniel Henninger has written on this. That's just like one example. I mean,
*  I gave the pandemic example, the fact that they held up the EUAs for the tests and didn't do
*  challenge trials. That's like a million American dead that could have been orders of magnitude
*  less if we had gotten the vaccine out to the vulnerable population sooner.
*  You're talking about something that has a total monopoly on global health, and you can't know
*  what it is without that unless you have zones that are FDA free, but that have some form of
*  regulation. As I mentioned, it's a V3. It's not going back to zero regulation everybody made for
*  itself, but it's a more reputable regulator, just like Uber is a better regulator than the
*  tax medallions, right? Yeah. I mean, you're painting such an incredible picture. You're
*  making me wish you were FDA commissioner. There are a bunch of people who tweeted something like
*  that after the pandemic. Whatever. Go ahead. Yeah. Is that possible? If you became FDA
*  commissioner, could you push for those kinds of changes, or is that really something that has to
*  come from the outside? The short answer is no. And the longer answer, meaning-
*  The long, that'd be funny if you're like, the short answer is no, the long answer is yes.
*  Basically, a CEO of a company, while it's very difficult, they can hire and fire,
*  so in theory, they can do surgery on the organism. Steve Jobs took over Apple and was able to hire
*  and fire, raise money, do this, that. He basically had root over Apple, that he was a system
*  administrator. He had full permissions. As FDA commissioner, you do not have full permissions
*  over FDA, let alone the whole structure around it. If you're FDA commissioner, you are not the CEO
*  of the agency. Lots of these folks there have career tenure. They can't be fired. They can't
*  even really be disciplined. There's something called the Douglas Factors. You ever heard the
*  Douglas Factors? It's like the Miranda rights for federal employees. You have the right to man-size
*  it. Basically, if you've heard that federal employees can't be fired, the Douglas Factors
*  are how that's actually operationalized. When you try to fire somebody, it's this whole process
*  where they get to appeal it and so on and so forth. They're sitting in the office while you're
*  trying to fire them, and they're complaining to everybody around them that this guy's trying to
*  fire me. He's such a bad guy, blah, blah. Everybody around, even if they may think that guy is doing
*  a bad job, they're like, wait a second, he's trying to fire you. You might try to fire me too.
*  And so anybody who tries to fire somebody at FDA just gets a face full of lead for their troubles.
*  What they instead will do is sometimes they'll just transfer somebody to the basement or something
*  so they don't have to deal with them if they're truly bad. But the thing about this is there is
*  only one caveat to Douglas Factor number eight, the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon
*  the reputation of the agency. There's that word again, reputation of reputation and power. So the
*  one way you can truly screw up within a regulatory bureaucracy is if you endanger the annual budget
*  renewal. Think of it as this mini Death Star that's coming to dock against the max Death Star for its
*  annual refuel. And it's talking about all the corporate criminals that it's prosecuted,
*  the quotas, the police quotas, the ticketing. If they don't have a crisis, they will invent one.
*  Again, just like TSA, just like other agencies, you're more familiar with it. You can map it
*  back. Look at the guns and drugs we've seized. And so you have an incentive for creating these
*  crises or manufacturing them or exaggerating them. And if you endanger that refueling,
*  that annual budget renewal or what have you, then the whole agency will basically be like,
*  okay, you're bad and you can be disciplined or sometimes with rare except you can be booted.
*  But what that means is that FDA commissioner is actually a white elephant. It's a ceremonial role,
*  really. The term white elephant, it's like basically the Maharaja gives you a white elephant
*  as a gift. Seems great. Next day, it's eaten all of your grass. It's pooped on your lawn.
*  It has just put a foot on your car and smashed it. But you can't give it away. It's a white elephant.
*  The Maharaja gave it to you. That's what being FDA commissioner is. It's the kind of thing where
*  if, and a lot of people are drawn in like moths to the flame for these titles of the establishment,
*  I want to be head of this. I want to be head of that. And really what it is, it's like,
*  I don't know, becoming head of Kazakhstan in the mid 1980s in the Soviet Union, the Kazakhstan SSR,
*  Soviet Socialist Republic, before the thing was going to crumble potentially. In many ways,
*  it's becoming folks who are just totally status obsessed getting these positions.
*  But a lot of the merit, all the folks with merit are kind of leaving the government and going into
*  tech or crypto or what have you. So even if these agencies were hollow before, in some ways,
*  they're becoming hollow-er because they have less talent there. So A, you can't hire and fire very
*  easily. You can hire a little bit. You can't really fire. B, a lot of the talent has left the building
*  but was there. C, we're entering the decentralizing era. And D, like Satoshi. Satoshi founded Bitcoin
*  because he knew you could not reform the Fed. Everybody is trying to go and reform, reform,
*  reform. The reason they're trying to reform is we haven't figured out the mechanism to build
*  something new. And now perhaps we have that. So I've named a few of them. I'll name one more.
*  Related to the difference, fitness is actually the back door to a lot of medicine. Why is that?
*  You go to any conference, it could be neurology, it could be cardiology. You'll find somebody who's
*  giving a talk that says something along the lines of fitness is the ultimate drug. Maybe not today
*  when people are saying, oh, fat phobic or whatever, but not too many years ago, you would see somebody,
*  people saying fitness is the ultimate drug. If we could just prescribe fitness in a pill,
*  that would improve your cardiovascular function, your neurological function, it deals with depression.
*  By the way, in that case, the use of the word drug means medicine.
*  So, yeah, sure, sure, sure.
*  Fitness is the ultimate medicine. Yeah.
*  Yeah, the ultimate medicine, right? So if they could just prescribe the effects of it,
*  it's just like, boom, just massive effect, right? Like you're fit enough, you do resistance training,
*  it helps with, you know, preventive diabetes. Every kind of thing in the world, you see a
*  significant treatment effect. Yet your fitness is your own responsibility. You go to some gym,
*  24 hour fitness, what do they have? They have on the wall exhortations like your body is your
*  responsibility, right? Am I right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And, you know, go ahead. But no, it's just, it's hilarious. Yes, yes, yes.
*  It's funny, but it's true, right? Yeah, it's funny because it's true.
*  And so your fitness, your diet, that's your responsibility. But when you go into a doctor's
*  office, suddenly becomes lie back and think of England. Okay, suddenly you become passive,
*  suddenly, oh, your doctor, your doctor is Dr. Google. Well, your doctor must be a moron. You're
*  going and trying to take care of yourself. You're Googling symptoms. Oh, how stupid you are. I have
*  a medical degree and that doctor, see, the thing is if you come in and you've self-diagnosed or
*  you've done some of your own research, if you're right, they're, and then if they've got an ego
*  about it, they're undermined. And if you're wrong, they're like, you know, haha, you know, arrogant.
*  But either way they have, if they've got this kind of mindset, they have an incentive to resist
*  the patient taking care of themselves. Isn't that the doctor's job, right? And they're kind of taught
*  to behave like this, many of them. So what that means then is that intervention of that 15 or 30
*  minute appointment with the doctor, whatever drug they prescribe better hit you like Thor's hammer
*  to put you back on the straight and narrow because that's only with you for like a few seconds,
*  you know, a few minutes or whatever. The doctor's only with you for a few minutes. The drug is only,
*  you know, some drugs are very powerful, so they actually do work like this. Okay. But
*  your fitness is your own responsibility and that's a continuing forcing function every day.
*  And again, we get back to decentralization, right? The decentralization of responsibility
*  from somebody thinking of themselves merely as a patient to an active participant in their own
*  health, who's doing their own monitoring of their own health, right? And logging all their stuff,
*  who's eating, you know, properly and looking at the effect of their diet on things like their,
*  you know, continuous glucose monitor as a V1, but other things, right? Who is, you know, as fit as
*  they can possibly be. Like these are kind of obvious things, but why is this the back door
*  to medicine? Because since the FDA only regulates those things that are meant to diagnose and treat
*  a disease, all the stuff that is meant to improve an otherwise healthy person is potentially out of
*  their purview. Supplements are one interesting aspect that they were carved out in the mid-90s
*  and that's why the supplement industry is big because FDA doesn't have as tight a reign on that.
*  But all of the Fitbit, CGM, continuous glucose monitor type stuff, you can crank out all kinds
*  of things that help people get fitter that will also actually have just general health value,
*  but you're not quote marketing them to diagnose or treat, you know, a disease. You see what I'm
*  saying? You're marketing them for the purpose of fitness. This is a market. Why? Because
*  psychologically people, they don't like paying to get back to normal, but they will absolutely
*  pay tons of money to get better than normal. They'll pay for fitness, they'll pay for makeup,
*  they'll pay for hair, they'll pay for this and that. So that's actually the back door and you
*  can do tons of things there where obviously being healthier is also protective. You can actually
*  show the studies on this. So this way you build out all the tooling to get healthier and that
*  actually helps on this axis. Fewer things which kind of a US medical system, you got me on this
*  topic. I love this. This is the most eloquent exploration of the US medical system and how
*  to improve it, how to fix it and what the future looks like. I love it.
*  So basically, part of it is decentralizing control back to the individual. Now I've talked
*  about FDA at length, but let me talk about some of the other broken parts of the US system.
*  There's AMA, there's CPT, there's CPOM, there's this, you know, like all these regulations which
*  see normally in capitalism, you have a buyer and a seller, right? Duh. In medicine, you have
*  third-party regulation and fourth-party pricing and fifth-party payment. Okay, so
*  third-party regulation, FDA is regulating it. Fourth-party pricing, it is, you know, the CPT
*  codes, right? Fifth-party payment, it's the insurance companies, right? And just to discuss
*  these bits of the system, first, why are some people against capitalism in medicine? I actually
*  understand why they're against it because they are visualizing themselves on a gurney when
*  they're being wheeled in and now somebody at their moment of vulnerability is charging this insane
*  price for their care and many people in the US have had this horrible experience where they're
*  bankrupted or scared of being bankrupted by medical bills. Therefore, the concept of adding
*  more capitalism to medicine scares them and they think it's horrible and you're some awful, greedy,
*  tech bro kind of thing, right? Let me say I understand that concern and let me, you know,
*  kind of let me tease that apart a little bit, right? Basically, the most capitalistic areas
*  of medicine are the most functional areas of medicine. So that's the places where you can
*  walk in and walk out, okay? Whether that's dentistry, dermatology, plastic surgery,
*  even veterinary medicine, which is not human, okay? Where you can make a conscious decision, say,
*  okay, I want this care or I don't want this. I see a price list. I can pay cash, right? If I don't
*  like it, I go to another dermatologist. There's few dermatological emergencies. That's why
*  dermatologists have a great quality of life, okay? By contrast, when you're being wheeled in on a
*  gurney, you need it right now, okay? And you're unconscious or what have you or you're not in a
*  capacity to deal with it, right? And so these are the two extremes. It's like ambulatory medicine.
*  You can walk around and pick and like ambulance medicine, okay? And what that means is the more
*  ambulatory the medicine, the more legitimate capitalism is in that situation. People are okay
*  with a dermatologist basically turning you down because you don't have enough money and you go
*  to another dermatologist because you can comparison shop there. It's not usually an emergency, right?
*  Whereas if you're coming in with an ambulance, then people don't want to be turned down and
*  I understand why, okay? What this suggests by the way is that you should only have
*  insurance for the edge cases. Insurance should only cover the ambulance, not the ambulatory.
*  And most people are losing money on insurance, right? Because most people are paying more in
*  in premiums than they are getting out. It's just that this huge flight of dollars through the air
*  that no one can make heads or tails out of. Oh, the other aspect that's obviously broken is employer
*  provided health insurance just started after World War II. So auto insurance is in a much
*  more competitive market. You don't whip out your auto insurance card at the gas station to pay for
*  your gas, right? You only whip it out when there's a crash, right? That's what quote health insurance
*  should be. And the Singapore model is actually a pretty good one for this where they have sort of a
*  mandatory HSA. You have to put some money in that and that pays for your healthcare bills,
*  but then it's cash out of that. It's like a separate pocket, sort of four savings to pay for-
*  Health savings accounts.
*  Health savings account, right? The thing about this is once you realize, well, first,
*  ambulatory medicine is capitalistic medicine. Ambulance medicine is socialist medicine, okay?
*  You want to shift people more towards ambulatory. Guess what? That's in their interest as well.
*  Now that brings us back to the monitoring, right? The continuous monitoring,
*  whether eventually it's Mike Snyder's Intergrom, the V1 is the quantified self and the Apple Watch
*  and the continuous glucose meters and the VN is the Mike Snyder Intergrom. There's a site called
*  Q.bio, which is doing this also, right? Eventually this stuff will hopefully just be in a device
*  that just measures tons and tons of variables on you, right? There's ways of measuring some of these
*  metabolites without breaking the skin. You don't have to keep breaking the skin over and over.
*  There's various ways of doing that. So now you've got something where you've got the monitoring,
*  you've got the dashboards, you've got the alerts, and just like this Larry Smarr guy that I mentioned,
*  the measured man, you might be able to shift more and more things to ambulatory.
*  One of the things about this also is the medical system is set up in a bad way where the primary
*  care physician is the one who is not the top of their class, but the guys who are at the bottom
*  of the pinball machine, the surgeons and the radiologist, once your stuff is already broken,
*  they're the ones who are paid the most. So a lot of the skill collects at the post-break stage,
*  where you actually want Doogie Howser MD is at the upstream stage. So you want this amazing,
*  amazing doctor there. How could we get that? I mentioned the app that doesn't exist,
*  which is like a better version of the 3500B. Here's another app that doesn't exist,
*  and this is one that FDA has actively quashed. Why can't you just take an image of a mole or
*  something like that with the incredible cameras we have? A huge amount of medical imaging should
*  be able to be done at home, and it goes to doctors, whether it's in the US or the Philippines or India.
*  Telleradiology exists. Why can you not do that for dermatology, for everything else? You should be
*  able to literally just hold the thing up and with a combination of both AI and MDs, just diagnose.
*  That should exist. The answer is there's a combination of both American doctors and the
*  FDA that team up to prevent this or slow this. One argument is, oh, the AI is not better than a human
*  100% of the time because it's not deployed yet. Therefore, it could make an error. Therefore,
*  it's bad, even if it's better than 99% of doctors, 99% of the time. Another argument is the software
*  has to go through design control. Once you understand how FDA works, imagine the most
*  bureaucratic, frozen process for code deployment at any company ever,
*  and that is the most nimble thing ever relative to FDA's design review.
*  Just to review, A, talked about how FDA was blocking all this stuff. B, talked about why
*  ambulatory medicine is capitalist medicine, ambulance medicine is socialist medicine.
*  C, talked about how with the diagnostic stuff, we can shift it over to ambulatory. D, talked about
*  how there's lots of things where you could have a combination of doctor and AI in an app that you
*  kind of quickly self-diagnose. Some of this is happening now. Some of the telemedicine laws were
*  relaxed during COVID, where now people, a doctor from Wyoming can prescribe for somebody in Minnesota.
*  Some of that stuff was relaxed during COVID. There's other broken things in medical
*  system. I'll just name two more and then kind of move on. I mentioned AMA and CPT.
*  Those are two regulatory bodies? AMA, American Medical Association, CPT,
*  Current Procedural Terminology. Basically, you know Marx's labor theory of value,
*  where people are supposed to be paid on their effort, right? Of course, the issue with this
*  is that you'd be paying a physicist to try to dunk and they'd be trying, but they wouldn't
*  actually probably be able to do it. They'd be trying real hard, whereas you actually want to
*  pay people on the basis of results, right? Cheaply attained results are actually better than expensively
*  attained non-results, perhaps obvious, okay? Nevertheless, the way that the US medical system
*  has payouts, it's based on so-called RVUs, relative value units. This is something where
*  there's a government body that sets these prices and it is in theory only for Medicare,
*  but all the private insurers key off of that. AMA basically publishes a list of these so-called
*  the CPT codes, which is like the coding, the biomedical coding of this
*  and what each medical process is worth and whatnot. I don't remember all the numbers,
*  but it's like a five-digit code and it's like, okay, I got a test for cystic fibrosis or a test
*  for this or a test for that. God help you if your medical billing is erroneous. Why? The insurance
*  company will reject it because it doesn't pay for that. This is this giant process of trying to
*  encode every possible ailment and condition into these CPT codes and that you can literally get
*  degrees in medical billing just for this, okay? This enormous inefficient industry.
*  Literally, medical billing is a whole field, okay?
*  Yeah. What do you want to do when you grow up? I want to work in medical billing.
*  In medical billing, okay? Where everybody's mad at you at all times.
*  Yeah. Part of what happens is when you give a treatment,
*  when a doctor gives a treatment to a patient, they can't repo the treatment, okay? Like a car,
*  you sell a car, you can in theory repo the car. So the patient has a treatment.
*  Now, what happens? Well, the insurance company, that treatment is perhaps provided, look,
*  it's a lab test provided by a company, right? The company bills the patient.
*  The company is supposed to charge a high price. Why? The insurance company wants it to try to
*  collect from the patient. The patient is scared. Oh my God, they see this huge price. They sometimes
*  don't pay. Sometimes the insurance company doesn't pay either. When a company is stiffed
*  by an insurance company, when a diagnostic company is stiffed by an insurance company,
*  it has to jack up the price of everybody else, right? Everything boils down to the fact that
*  you don't have a buyer and a seller. The doctor doesn't know the price of what is being sold.
*  The buyer doesn't know the price of what is being bought at the time it's being bought.
*  Neither party can really even set a free price because there's this RVU system that hovers above.
*  The buyer feels they've already bought it because they bought insurance. The insurance company
*  doesn't want to pay for it. Everybody is trying to push the price onto somebody else and not
*  actually show the sticker price of anything and hide everything and so on and so forth.
*  Oh, their thing about it is obviously lawsuits are over everything. Everybody's
*  mad about everything. It's health. People are dying. Everything is just optimized for optics
*  as opposed to results. Similarly, actually many drugs are optimized for minimizing side effects
*  and optics rather than maximizing effects, which are totally different criteria. You might have,
*  for example, a drug that only cures a thousand people but doesn't have any side effects versus
*  one that cures a million people but that has 10 really serious side effects a year.
*  The second one probably not happen because those side effects would be so big.
*  How do you attack this? I name a few examples, but I actually think the reform is going to come in
*  part from outside the system. In particular, India is coming online. Why is that important?
*  You may have encountered an Indian doctor or two, maybe an Indian programmer, one or two.
*  Mm-hmm. I do think telemedicine could explode,
*  where you could have an Indian doctor in India and there's a US doctor who's like a dispatcher.
*  You see what I'm saying? They've got all these other Indian doctors behind them. They've got a
*  telemedical app and you are now doing something where these relatively inexpensive Indian doctors
*  who are vetted by the American doctor or the doctor in jurisdiction of the license become the
*  back end doctors of the world. To some extent, this is already there with tele-radiology and
*  other kinds of things. Now that you've got literally like a billion Indians who've just come online,
*  you have this huge pool of folks who have a different attitude towards medicine.
*  For example, it's a lot more cash payment over there. For example, India is big on generic drugs.
*  For example, during COVID, it had something called Arogia Sethu, which is a national telemedicine
*  app. The US wasn't able to ship that. In some ways, India's digital infrastructure,
*  again, you'll have to read a post called The Internet Country by tigerfeathers.substack.com
*  and you'll see that actually India's national software infrastructure is surprisingly good.
*  It's not as good as China's in some ways, but it's better than the US's, which is like health.gov
*  and non-existent. It's kind of impressive how good some of India's software is. The fact that it
*  exists is good. You have all these new doctors coming online. India cranks out generics.
*  Telemedicine is now more legal in the US and you have cash payment in India and in a lot of other
*  places. You don't have the whole insurance employer health thing and this market is growing.
*  You could have a sort of parallel market that starts evolving, which is, and people are
*  only doing some medical tourism. I think that's another exit from the FDA. You have a parallel
*  market that starts evolving that just starts from fundamentally different premises. It's just cash,
*  cash for everything. There's downsides with cash for everything. There's a huge upside with cash
*  for everything. Cash for everything means you get customer service from the doctor. It means
*  the prices are actually visible. It ideally pushes you, again, towards more ambulatory medicine
*  rather than ambulance medicine. It is monitoring, constant monitoring with the quantified self and
*  whatnot as opposed to just let your system fail and then wheel you in. There's a reputational bridge
*  because now we've had a couple of generations almost of Indian doctors in the US. People know
*  that there's some very competent Indian doctors. They're a good chunk of AMA and so they can
*  serve lobby for this. You have plenty of Indian engineers. Now, I'm not saying India alone is a
*  panacea, but I do think that this is a large enough parallel market to start doing interesting things.
*  You could see medical tourism, medical migration to where it gives India an opportunity to
*  basically let go of the constraints of the FDA and innovate aggressively. It's such a huge opportunity
*  to define the future of medicine and make a shit ton of money from a market that's desperate for it
*  in the United States because of all the over the regulation. That's right. I think basically
*  it's something where the reason it needs- That would fix the FDA, sorry, to interrupt.
*  Yes. We fix FDA by exiting the FDA. Then the FDA would dry out and then it would hopefully-
*  It might reform. It might dry out. This is why people are, for example, they're traveling
*  across borders to getting orders from Canadian pharmacies. A lot of this type of stuff,
*  we can start to build alternatives. India's generic industry is really important because
*  it just doesn't enforce American IP there. Generic drugs are cheaper and it's quite
*  competent. It's been around for a while. There's enough proof points there where,
*  again, I'm not saying a panacea. It's going to be something which will acquire American and Indian
*  collaboration. I think there's going to be a lot of other countries and so on that are involved.
*  You can start to see another poll getting set up, which is a confident enough civilization
*  that is willing to take another regulatory path and that is in some ways doing better on national
*  software than the US's and it has enough of a bridge to the US that it can be that simulation
*  which you need, which is something that outside poke. I want to talk about India, but let me just
*  wrap up on this big FDA biomedical thing. With the book, The Network State, the purpose of
*  The Network State, I want people to be able to build different kinds of network states. I want
*  people to build the vegan village. I want people to be able to build a, if they want to do the
*  Bendig option like a Christian network state. If people want to do different kinds of things,
*  I'm open to many different things and I will fund lots of different things.
*  For me, the motivation is just like you needed to start a new currency, Bitcoin,
*  it was easier to do that than reform the Fed. I think it's easier to start a new country than
*  reform the FDA and so I want to do it to in particular get to longevity, meaning longevity
*  enhancement. What does that mean? In an interesting way, and this will sound like a trite statement,
*  but I think it's actually a deep statement or let me hopefully try to convince you it is,
*  crypto is to finance what longevity is to the current state of medicine. Why? It inverts
*  certain fundamental assumptions. At first, crypto looks like traditional finance. It's got the
*  charts and the bands and you're buying and selling and so on. What Satoshi did is he took
*  fundamental premises and flipped them. For example, in the traditional macroeconomic worldview,
*  hyperinflation is bad, but deflation is also bad. A little inflation is good.
*  In the traditional macroeconomic worldview, it's good that there are custodians, banks
*  that kind of intermediate the whole system. In the traditional worldview,
*  every transaction needs to be reversible because somebody could make a mistake and so on and so
*  forth. In the traditional worldview, you don't really have root access over your money.
*  Satoshi inverted all of those things. Obviously, the big one is hyperinflation was bad, but he
*  also thought mild inflation was bad and deflation was good. That's just a fundamental shift.
*  He gave you root access over your money. You're now a system administrator of your own money.
*  You can room-RF your entire fortune or send millions with a keystroke. You are now the system
*  administrator of your own money. That alone is why cryptocurrency is important. If you want
*  system administration access at times to computers, you'll want it to currency, to be sovereign.
*  There's other assumptions where the assumption is every transaction is private in the existing
*  system by default or it's visible only to the state, whereas at least the Bitcoin blockchain,
*  everything is public. There are various kinds of things like this where he just inverted
*  fundamental premises. Then the whole crypto system, the crypto economy is in many ways a
*  teasing out of what that means. Just to give you one example, the US dollar, people have seen those
*  graphs where it's inflating and so it loses value over time and you've seen that. Most of the time,
*  it's just denied that it's losing any value. The most highbrow way of defending it is the US dollar
*  trades off temporary short-term price stability for long-term depreciation.
*  Bitcoin makes the opposite trade-off. In theory, at least, long-term appreciation at the expense
*  of short-term price instability. There's the whole plunge protection team and so on. Basically,
*  there's various ways in which price stability is tried to be maintained in the medium term
*  at the expense of long-term depreciation. You need a reserve of assets to keep stabilizing the dollar
*  against various things. What does crypto medicine look like relative to fiat medicine to make the
*  same analogy? The existing medical system, it assumes that a quick death is bad, an early death
*  is bad, but also that living forever is either unrealistic or impossible or undesirable, that you
*  should die with dignity or something like that. A little death is good. That's the existing medical
*  system. Whereas the concept of life extension and David Sinclair and what you call health span
*  rejects that fundamental premise. It says, actually, the way to defeat cancer is to defeat
*  aging. Aging is actually a programmed biomedical, biological process. We have results that are
*  showing stopping or even reversing aging in some ways. Now, just like with the other thing, you say
*  a quick death is bad and so is actually death itself. We actually want significant life
*  extension. This is similar. It's very similar to what the rejection of the fiat system.
*  The fiat system says a little inflation is good. Fiat medicine says a little death is good.
*  Bitcoin says, actually, no inflation, just get more valuable over time.
*  Crypto medicine says, actually, let's extend life. This leads to all kinds of new things where you
*  start actually thinking about, all right, how do I maintain my health with diagnostics? How do I
*  take control of my own health with the decentralization of medicine? All the stuff
*  that I've been describing sort of fits like longevity is traditional medicine as crypto is
*  to traditional currency. If we take those assumptions separately, so we take cryptocurrency aside,
*  is that to you obvious that this letting go of this assumption about death, is that an obvious
*  thing? Is longevity obviously good versus, for example, the devil's advocate to that would be,
*  what we want is to keep death and maximize the quality of life up until the end so that you ride
*  into the sunset healthy. Somebody who was listening to the whole podcast would say,
*  well, Baljeet, just a few hours ago, you were saying this gerontocracy runs the US and they're
*  all old and they don't get it, blah, blah. Now you're talking about making people live forever,
*  so there's never any new blood to wash it out. Ha ha, what a contradiction, right?
*  It's funny that you're so on point across all the topics we covered and the possible criticism.
*  I love it. Well, just trying to anticipate some of it.
*  Yeah, good. Well done. Well done, sir.
*  I think the argument on that is so long as you have a frontier, it is okay for someone to live
*  long, okay, so long as people can exit to a new thing, number one. Number two is in order for us
*  to go and colonize other planets and so on, if you do want to get to Mars, if you want to become
*  Star Trek and what have you, probably going to need to have, just to survive a long flight,
*  so to speak, multiple light year flight, you're going to need to have life extension.
*  So to become a pioneering interstellar kind of thing. I know it's a kind of thing which sounds
*  like, okay, yeah, and when we're on the moon, we're going to need shovels. It sounds like
*  a piling a fantasy on top of a fantasy in that sense, but it's also something where if you're
*  talking about the vector of our civilization, where are we going? Well, I actually do think
*  it's either anarcho-primitivism or optimism slash transhumanism. Either we are shutting down
*  civilization, it's degrowth, it's Unabomber, et cetera, or it's the stars and escaping the
*  prime number means. It's like to me, it's obvious that we're going to, if we're to survive, expand
*  out into space. Yes. And it's obvious that once we do, we'll look back at anyone, which is currently
*  most people that didn't think of this future, didn't anticipate this future, worked towards this
*  future as Luddites, like as people who totally didn't get it. It will become obvious. Right now,
*  it's impossible and then it will become obvious. Yes. It seems like, yes, longevity in some form,
*  I mean, there could be a lot of arguments that the different forms of longevity could take,
*  but in some form, longevity is almost a prerequisite for the expansion out into the
*  cosmos. That's right. Expansion of longevity. There's also a way to bring it back to Earth
*  to an extent, which is how were societies used to be judged? You may remember people used to talk
*  about life expectancy as a big thing, right? Life expectancy is actually a very, very, very good
*  metric. Why? It's a ratio scale variable. There's like four different class of variables
*  statisticians talk about. Ratio scale is like years or meters or kilograms, okay. Then you have
*  interval scale where plus and minus means something, but there's no absolute zero.
*  Then you have ordinal where there's only ranks and plus and minus don't mean anything. And then you
*  have categorical like the Yankees and the Braves are categorical variables. They're just different,
*  but all you have is the comparator operator, whether you have a quality, you don't have a rank.
*  Okay. So ratio scale data is the best because you can compare it across space and time.
*  If you have a skeleton that is like two meters tall, that's from 3000 years ago,
*  you can compare the height of people from many, many years ago, different cultures and times,
*  whereas their currency is much harder to value. That's not like a ratio scale variable. Other
*  things are harder to value across space and time, right? So life expectancy is good because as a
*  ratio scale variable, it was a very clear definition, right? Like when someone born and died,
*  those are actually relatively clear, but most other things aren't like that. That's why murder
*  or death, it can be scored, it's unambiguous, it's done when it's done. Whereas when does somebody
*  get sick? Oh, they were kind of sick, they were sick today, they were sick at this hour,
*  the boundary conditions, many other kinds of things are not like clear cut like that, right?
*  And I should just briefly comment that life expectancy does have this quirk,
*  a dark quirk that when you just crudely look at it, it incorporates child mortality,
*  mortality at age of one or age of five. And maybe it's better and clearer to look at
*  mortality after five or whatever. And those metrics still hold in interesting ways and measure the
*  progress of human civilization in interesting ways. That's right. You actually want longevity
*  biomarkers. A lot of people are working on this. There's a book called The Picture of Dorian Gray,
*  and the concept is sell your soul to ensure the picture rather than he will age and fade.
*  So the concept is that thing on the wall just reflects his age and you can see it.
*  So there's a premise that's embedded in a lot of Western culture that
*  to gain something you must lose. If you're Icarus and you try to fly, then you'll fly too high and
*  it'll melt your wings. But guess what? We fly every day, commercial flight. So the opposite of
*  the Icarus or Picture of Dorian Gray kind of thing is the movie Limitless, which I love because
*  it's so Nietzschean and so unusual relative to the dystopian sci-fi movies where there's a
*  without giving – I mean, the movie is kind of old now, but there's a drug in it that's a
*  neurotropic that boosts your cognitive abilities and it's got side effects. But at the end,
*  he engineers out the side effects. Amazing. Just like, yeah, there are planes that crash and we
*  land, right? Okay. So why did I mention The Picture of Dorian Gray? Well, there's another aspect of it,
*  which is longevity biomarker. The point is to kind of estimate how many years of life you have left
*  by that Q.bio or Integrom. You take all these analyses on somebody, right?
*  One of the best longevity biomarkers could be just your face, right? You image the face and you can
*  sort of tell, oh, somebody looks like they've aged, oh, someone looks younger, et cetera, et cetera.
*  And this is actually data that you've got on millions and millions of people
*  where you could probably start having AI predict, okay, what is somebody's life expectancy
*  given their current face and other kinds of things, right? Because you have their name,
*  they passed away if they've already passed away, right? And you have photos of them through their
*  life, right? So just imaging might give a reasonably good longevity biomarker, but then you can
*  supplement that with a lot of other variables. And now you can start benchmarking every treatment
*  by its change in how much time you have left. If that treatment, that intervention
*  boosts your estimated life expectancy by five years, you can see that in the data.
*  You can get feedback on whether your longevity is being boosted or not, okay? And so what this does
*  is just fundamentally changes the assumptions in the system. Now, with that said, life extension
*  may be the kind of thing, I'm not sure if it'll work for our generation, we may be too late,
*  it may work for the next generation. Wouldn't that make you sad?
*  Well, I've got something. To the last generation.
*  Could be, but I've got something for you, which is, I call it genomic reincarnation. Okay, this one
*  you probably haven't heard before, I've tweeted about it, okay? So-
*  By the way, good time to mention that your Twitter is one of the greatest
*  Twitters of all time, so people should follow you.
*  Well, Lex Friedman has one of the greatest podcasts of all time, you guys should listen
*  to the Lex Friedman podcast, which you may be doing, right?
*  Which you may be doing right now. Yes.
*  Yeah. Well, thank you. So-
*  What was the term again? Sorry, genomic-
*  Sorry, I called it genomic, not resurrection, but genomic reincarnation, okay? So here's the concept.
*  You may be aware that you can synthesize strands of DNA, okay? There's sequencing of DNA,
*  which is reading it, and synthesizing DNA, which is creating strands of DNA.
*  Okay. What's interesting is you can actually also do that at the full chromosome level for
*  bacterial chromosomes. Remember that thing I was saying earlier about the minimum life form
*  that Craig Venter made? So people have synthesized entire bacterial chromosomes, and they work.
*  They can literally essentially print out a living organism, all right?
*  Now, when you go from bacteria to eukaryotes, which are the kingdom of life that we're part of,
*  right? Yeasts are part of this kingdom and so on. It becomes harder because the chromosomes are
*  more complicated. But folks are working on eukaryotic chromosome synthesis. And if you
*  spot me that sci-fi assumption, that eventually we'll be able to take your genome sequence.
*  And just like we can synthesize a bacterial chromosome, we can synthesize not just one
*  eukaryote chromosome, but your entire complement of chromosomes in the lab, right? Because you have
*  23, and 46, whatever you take the pairs. What you can do is potentially print somebody out from disk,
*  reincarnate them. Insofar, if your sequence determines you, and you can argue with this
*  because there's epigenetics and our stuff, okay? But let's just say to first order,
*  your DNA sequence is Lex. You can sequence that, okay? You can do full genome sequencing and log
*  that to a file. Then here's the karma part. Your crypto community, where you've built up enough
*  karma among them, if when you die, your karma balance is high enough, they will spend the money
*  to reincarnate the next Lex, who can then watch everything that happened in your past life,
*  and you can tell them something. Everything I described there, I mean, if you spot me
*  eukaryotic chromosome synthesis, that's the only part that I think will be possible, right?
*  Folks are working on it. I'm sure someone will mess with you.
*  But it's essentially a clone.
*  It's like a clone, right? But it is you in a different time.
*  You're in a different time, but you don't unfortunately have the memories.
*  Well, you could probably watch the digest of your life, and it would be pretty interesting, right?
*  I mean- Yeah, that's actually a process for psychology to study. If you create a blank mind,
*  what would you need to show that mind to align it very well with the experiences,
*  with the fundamental experiences that define the original version, such that the resulting clone
*  would have similar behavior patterns, worldviews, perspectives,
*  feelings, all those kinds of things. Potentially, right?
*  Including, sadly, enough traumas and all that. Or what have you, right? But basically, just like
*  in a very simple version of it, by the time one is age 20 or 30 or something in your 20s,
*  you'll sort of learn your own personal operating system. You'll be like, oh,
*  alcohol really doesn't agree with me or something like that. You just by trial and error,
*  things that are idiosyncratic to your own physiology, you're like, oh,
*  I'm totally wrecked if I get seven hours of sleep versus nine hours or whatever it is, right?
*  People will have different kinds of things like this. That manual can be given to your next self.
*  You can know, don't do this, do this. Don't do this, do this, right? To some extent,
*  personal genomics already gives you some of this where you're like, oh, I'm a caffeine-non,
*  slow metabolizer. Oh, that explains X or Y. Or I have a weird version of alcohol dehydrogenase. Oh,
*  okay, that explains my alcohol tolerance. This is part of the broader category of what I call
*  practical miracles, right? So it's longevity, it's genomic reincarnation, it is restoring sight,
*  and it is curing deafness with the artificial eyes and artificial ears. It is the super solider
*  serum. Did I show you that? So like myostatin, no. I tweeted about this. Basically, X-Men are real.
*  So here is a study from an EGM from several years ago. Okay. What is this? This is like the
*  mid-2000s. This was in 2004, okay? So it's now 17 years later. This is almost certainly a teenager
*  by now. So this kid basically was just totally built. Okay. Extraordinarily muscular.
*  Very muscular at a very young age. Yes. So the child's birth weight was in the 73rd percentile.
*  He appeared extraordinarily muscular, protruding muscles in his thighs, motor and mental development
*  has been normal. Now at four and a half years of age, he continues to have increased muscle bulk
*  and strength. And so essentially, myostatin mutation is associated with gross muscle hypertrophy in a
*  child. So this is like real life X-Men. Okay. And- And there's pictures of animals.
*  Yes. So it's a company called Variant Bio that is looking at people who have exceptional health
*  related traits and is looking for essentially this kind of thing, but maybe more disease or
*  whatever related, right? For example, people who have natural immunity to COVID, understanding how
*  that works, perhaps we can give other people artificial immunity to COVID, right? If you scroll
*  up, you see my kind of tweet, super solider serum is real, where it's like wild type mouse
*  and a myostatin null. And look at the chest on that thing. You see the before and after.
*  Wow. Okay. This is what's possible. You know, this could be us, but you're regulating,
*  you know, right? You're not saying like, this could be us, but you're playing. This could be us,
*  but the FDA regulating, right? All this. Oh yeah. On steroids. But it's not, that's the thing.
*  It's not steroids. Well, that's the thing is people, when people, again, you get back to the
*  Icarus thing, they think, oh, steroids. Well, that's definitely going to give you cancer,
*  screw up your hormones, et cetera, et cetera. And it could, but you know what? Like have we actually
*  put in that much effort into figuring out like the right way of doing testosterone supplementation
*  or the right way of doing this? Obviously we've managed to put a lot of effort into
*  marijuana, increasing the potency of it or what have you. Could we put the effort into
*  these kinds of drugs, right? Or these kinds of compounds? Maybe. I think that would actually be
*  a really good thing. The thing about this is I feel this is just a massively underexplored area
*  rather than people drinking caffeine all the time. That's like a very mild enhancing drug. Okay.
*  Nicotine is also arguably kind of like that. You know, some people have it even without the cigarettes,
*  right? Why can't we research this stuff? One way of thinking about it is, you know, Lancer Armstrong,
*  the cyclist, yes, he violated all the rules. You know, he shouldn't have won the Tour de France
*  or anything like that. But his chemists, and I say this somewhat tongue in cheek, but also,
*  you know, his chemists are candidates for like the Nobel Prize in chemistry
*  because they brought a man back from like testicular cancer to like winning Tour de
*  France's against a bunch of guys who probably, you know, a bunch of them were also juiced or whatever,
*  right? Whatever was done there, take it out of the competition framework. There's a lot of
*  testicular cancer patients or cancer patients period who would want some of that.
*  And we should take that seriously. We should take that pursuit really, really, really seriously.
*  Yes. Except again, just like the Theranos stuff, all this pathologize, oh, it's a Balco scandal. Oh,
*  it says, oh my God, you know, and yes, of course, within the context of that game, they're cheating
*  when the context of life, you want to be cheating death. Right? So it's just a kind of a reframe on
*  what is good, right? And it is just taking away these assumptions that mild inflation is good or
*  mild death is good and going towards transcendence. So that gets me done with the giant FDA,
*  biomedical, et cetera, et cetera. Longevity. Yeah. That's beautifully,
*  beautifully done. You have two questions. One was on Trump and deplatforming and the other was on
*  crypto and the state of crypto and the third is on India. Which one should we do?
*  All right. Since we talked about how to fix government, we talked about how to fix
*  health, medicine, FDA, longevity. Let us briefly talk about how to fix social media.
*  Sure. Since we kind of talked about it from different directions, but it'd be nice to just
*  look at social media. And if we can perhaps first, as an example, maybe it's not a useful example,
*  but to me it was one that kind of shook me a little bit is the removal of Trump and since then
*  other major figures, but Donald Trump was probably the biggest person ever to be removed from social
*  media. Do you understand why that was done? Can you steel man the case for it and against it?
*  And if there's something broken about that, how do we fix it?
*  Steel man the case for is kind of obvious in the sense of you are seeing a would-be dictator
*  who is trying to run a coup against democracy, who has his supporters go and storming the seat
*  of government, who could use his app to whip up his followers across the country to reject
*  the will of the people. And so you're an executive and you'll take actions that,
*  while perhaps controversial, are still within the law and you'll make sure that you do your
*  part to defend democracy by making sure that at least this guy's megaphone is taken away
*  and that his supporters cannot organize more riots. That's basically the case for the
*  deplatforming. Would you agree with that? So it's like really steel manning it.
*  Yes, it's steel manning, so I'm giving the for case. Yeah. Well, I guess I would like to separate
*  the would-be dictator. Oh, I guess if you're storming the Capitol, you are a dictator. I see.
*  So those are two are interlinked. You have to have somehow a personal judgment of the person.
*  Bad enough to be worth this significant step.
*  Yeah. It's not just their actions or words in a particular situation, but broadly.
*  Context of everything that led up to this moment and so on. Right? Yeah. So that's a for case.
*  Right. Now the against case. There's actually several against cases, right? There's obviously
*  the Trump supporters against case. There is the libertarian slash left libertarian against case.
*  And there is the rest of world against case. Okay. There's actually three because it's not
*  just two factions. There's multiple, right? So what is the Trump supporter against case?
*  There's an article called the secret bipartisan campaign that saved the 2020 election, right?
*  Which came out a few weeks after the inauguration like February 4, 2021. And essentially,
*  the Trump supporter would read this as basically saying in the name of defending democracy,
*  they corrupted democracy, whether it was actually vote counts or just changes of all the rules for
*  mail-in ballots and stuff. There were regular meetings between the chamber of commerce and
*  AFL and the unions. In particular, they admit that the BLM riots of the mid 2020s were actually on
*  a string and they could say, stand down, right? So that's actually, that's a quote from this article
*  where it's like, the word went out, stand down, protect the results, announce that it would not
*  be activating the entire national mobilization network today, remains ready to activate if
*  necessary. Pothoser credits the activists for their restraint. So basically the activists
*  re-arranged the protected results protest towards a weekend of celebration. So point being that
*  the fact that the Trump supporter would say the fact that they could tell them to stand down meant
*  that the previous unrest was in part coordinated. And so it'd say, okay, so that makes it illegitimate
*  in a different way, right? Plus, you know, what is one riot on Jan six versus the attacks on the
*  White House and stuff, you know, there's a storming of the White House in mid 2020 and didn't actually
*  storm the White House, but they're setting fires outside and it's quite a lot of stuff, right?
*  So the second against case is the, let's say libertarian slash left libertarian would say,
*  do we really want giant corporations, regardless of what you think about Trump,
*  and you don't have to be a Trump supporter, do you really want giant corporations to be terminating
*  who can say what on the internet? And if they can deplatform a sitting president and the quote,
*  most powerful man in the world, he's not the most powerful man in the world. In fact,
*  the quote people are electing a figurehead and actually it's the heads of network that are more
*  powerful than the heads of state, right? That the fact that the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter and
*  Google and Apple and Amazon all made the decisions at the same time to not just deplatform Trump
*  from Twitter, which literally billions of people around the world saw, but also censor or stop on
*  Facebook and to have Google and Apple pull parlor out of the app store and Amazon shut down the
*  backend, that would be corporate collusion by any other name. It's actually very similar to the so
*  called business plot against FDR. FDR was a complicated figure who can in some ways best be
*  thought of as the least bad communist dictator or socialist dictator of the 20th century. Why?
*  Because he nationalized the economy, repealed the 10th amendment, right? Tried to pack the courts.
*  He sicked the government on all of his enemies from Huey Long to Andrew Mellon. Obviously,
*  he interned the Japanese, which shows that wasn't really totally a good guy, right? We don't usually
*  think about the same guy who did this, did that. Earlier in his life, most people don't know this
*  one, he led a whole Navy thing to entrap gay sailors. And do you know about this one?
*  No.
*  Yeah. Google FDR entrapment of gay sailors. Basically, he got young men to try to find
*  folks within the Navy who were gay and then basically entrap them so that they could be
*  prosecuted and what have you, right? FDR did a lot of stuff, but fundamentally nationalized the
*  economy and set up the alphabet soup is what they called it at the time. And that's like all these
*  agencies or whatever. And in some sense, he's continuous like there'd been a rising trend of
*  centralization. Woodrow Wilson obviously centralized, Lincoln centralized, right?
*  Even actually 1789 was a degree of centralization over the more loose thing that was 1776, 1789.
*  So he's on that trend line, but he was definitely a huge kind of dog leg up.
*  So the thing is that because of all the lawsuits that were flying, many folks like Ami Schlays has
*  written a book, The Forgotten Man, and essentially heard the thesis and thesis of many others at
*  that time, like John T. Flynn, who's this journalist who was pro FDR and then was against, was it FDR
*  made the Great Depression great? Okay. That it wouldn't have been such a bad thing without him
*  mucking up the entire economy and giving it a sickness. It would have recovered quickly
*  without that, right? This is a counterfactual, which people just argue about it really angrily
*  back and forth. And you can't actually run the experiment unless you could fork the economy,
*  right? Just like were the bailouts good or bad? I think they were bad, but how could I prove it?
*  I'd need to actually be able to fork the economy. Crypto actually allows you in theory to do that,
*  like where folks could actually shift balance. This is a whole separate thing where you can
*  actually start to make macroeconomics into more of an experimental science rather than simply
*  arguing from authority. You could argue from experiment. Some of the virtual economy stuff
*  that Edward Castronova has done is relevant to this. We can talk about that. Point is though,
*  with FDR, there's this thing because he had such a war on private industry at that time
*  and justified it with this narrative, quote, bold persistent experimentation. There was something
*  called the quote business plot where all of these captains of industry that he'd been beating up.
*  And again, Teddy Roosevelt had also been doing this with the trust buster. The journos at the
*  time, Ida Tarbell had gone and basically ran all these articles and Rockefeller knocked him down.
*  Woodrow Wilson is going to control. But FDR, the CEOs were thinking, oh, bad, this is so terrible.
*  There's a so-called business plot to try to take over the government and stop FDR from pushing the
*  country in what they thought was a bad direction. Spendley Butler was a general that they recruited
*  to try to help them with this, but he turned on them and he went and broke the whole thing open
*  and were told to Congress and so on. And so this guy's, the whole plot was broken up.
*  Now, one way of thinking about today or the whole aftermath of Jan six is it's a business
*  plot, but in reverse because the generals and the CEOs both were against Trump and actually
*  the business plot happened. And now all the CEOs just, you know, they pulled all the
*  push all the buttons that they needed to. And now the network was prime over the state.
*  Okay. Now, why is that an interesting way of looking at it? Because
*  because one thing I have in the book is you can kind of think of 1950 as like
*  ish as peak centralization. You go forward and backward in time, things decentralized,
*  you know, for example, and you start getting mirror image events that happen with the opposite
*  outcome. For example, 1890, the frontier closes. 1991, the internet frontier opens. Internet
*  becomes open for commerce. Okay. You go backwards in time, you have the Spanish flu, forwards in time,
*  COVID-19, right? Backwards in time, you have the captains of industry, the robber barons,
*  forwards in time, you have the tech billionaires. And there's so many examples of this. Like another
*  one is backwards in time, the New York times is allying with Soviet Russia to choke out Ukraine.
*  Now today they have reinvented themselves as cheerleaders for Ukraine against, you know,
*  nationalist Russia, right? And of course, I think you could absolutely support Ukraine on other
*  measures, but it's pretty hypocritical for the guys who profited from the Hall de Mour, you know,
*  the Oxlesburg family literally profited from, you know, denying the Hall de Mour to now make
*  themselves cheerleaders for Ukraine. It's actually this insane thing, which we can talk about.
*  A tiny tangent on that. You put it brilliantly and a reminder for anyone who listens to me talk about
*  Ukraine, it is possible to have empathy for a nation and not be part of the machine that generates
*  a mainstream narrative. Yes, that's right. Like basically, you know, I was actually one of the
*  first three Estonian residents, okay? And I completely understand why Estonia and the
*  Baltics and all these countries, including Ukraine, that just recently within living memory got their
*  independence from the Soviet empire, would not want to be forcibly reintegrated into a place
*  that they just escaped from, you know? And so that is something which is sort of outside the American
*  left-right, you know, tired kind of thing, where when you understand it from that point of view,
*  right? Then there's like a fourth point of view, which is like India's point of view, or like
*  much of the developing world or what I call, you know, parts of it are, you know, ascending, parts
*  are descending, whatever. But much of the rest of the world outside of that border region says, look,
*  we're sympathetic to the Ukrainians, but we can't allow our people to starve. So we're going to
*  maintain trade. And guess what? Actually, you know, we've got a lot of wars in our neck of the woods
*  and human rights crises that Europe just didn't even care about. So it can't be that Europe's
*  problems are the world's problems, but the world's problems are not Europe's problems, right? So
*  that's like a fourth point of view. And a fifth point of view is China, which is like, guess what?
*  We're going to be the Iran of the Iraq war, you know, where like who won the Iraq war? Iran,
*  arguably, because they extended their influence into Iraq, right? So China's like, guess what?
*  We're going to turn Russia into our gas station and build a pipeline. They're building, there's a
*  power sub-area is like the name of the Eastern Russia pipeline, just like Nord Stream is, you know,
*  Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2. I think they're building a new pipeline, you know, through
*  Mongolia. So Xi Jinping and Putin and the Mongolian head of state, we're all photographed kind of
*  thumbs up in this pipeline. We'll see if it goes through, but it's ironic that, you know, Russia
*  wanted to make Ukraine their, you know, colony, but the outcome of this war may be that Russia
*  becomes China's colony, you know? So that's at least like five different perspectives, right?
*  There's like the US establishment perspective, there's the, you know, Tucker-Maga perspective,
*  there's the Baltics and Ukrainian perspective, there's like the Indian and like poor countries
*  perspective, then there's Chinese perspective, and then of course there's the Russians, right?
*  So just respect to that, by the way, that's another example of history happening in reverse.
*  This is the sign of Soviet partnership, except this time, China is a senior partner and Russia
*  is a junior partner, and this time they're both nationalists rather than communists.
*  And there's so many flips like this, and you know, I'm going to list a few more actually,
*  because there's so, so, so many of them. Do you have an explanation why that happens?
*  Yes. Let me just list a few of them. This is in the, the New York State book,
*  it's in the chapter called Fragmentation Frontier, Fourth Turning Futures Are Past, right?
*  So I give this example of like a fluid unmixing, right? Just watch this for a second, right?
*  This is from Smart Every Day Unmixing Color Machine,
*  Ultra-Laminar Reversible Flow, Smart Every Day 217.
*  And so you can mix something, and then like this thing that you don't think of as reversible,
*  you can unmix it, which is insane, right? That it works. Okay, the physics of that situation,
*  it just works, right? So for people just listening,
*  that there is whatever the mixture this is, this is ultra-laminar reversible flow, so this
*  probably has to do something to do with the material. We're used to mixing not being a
*  reversible process. Exactly.
*  And that's what that shows, and then he then reverses the mixing and is able to do it perfectly.
*  That's right. So that's like the futures are past thesis.
*  It shows that free will is an illusion, just kidding. Okay.
*  Well, basically there's, there's, you know, some environments where, you know,
*  the equations are like time symmetrical, so you can, right? And this is one model, sort of,
*  it's just an interesting visual model for what's happening in the world as we re-decentralize after
*  the centralized century, right? So basically, you know, I mentioned the engineer frontier
*  reopens back then the Western frontier closed. Today we experienced COVID-19. Back then we
*  experienced the Spanish flu, tech billionaires, and we had the cabbage industry, right? Today,
*  founders like Alon and Dorsey are starting to win against establishment journalists. Back then,
*  Ida Tarbell demagogued and defeated Rockefeller. I think net-net founders win this time versus
*  the journos. Back then, the journos won over the founders. Okay. Say we have cryptocurrencies. Back
*  then we had private banking. Today, this is an amazing one. We have a populist movement of digital
*  gold advocates. Back then, because Bitcoin maximalists and so on, where gold has become
*  populist because it's against the printing money and so on and so forth. Back then,
*  we had a populist movement against gold in the form of William Jennings Bryan and the
*  cross of gold speech. Gold was considered a tool of big business. Now, gold is the tool against
*  big business and big government, right? Digital gold, yeah. Digital gold, right.
*  Today, we have the inflation and cultural conflict of Weimar-like America. Back then,
*  we had the inflation and cultural conflict of Weimar Germany. Today, in Weimar America,
*  we have right and left fighting in the streets. Same, unfortunately, in Weimar Germany.
*  Peter Turchin has written about, today we have what Turchin considers antebellum-like polarization,
*  like pre-war polarization. Back then, if you go further back in time, we had what we now know to
*  be antebellum-paralysation, right? Today, we have Airbnb. Back then, we had Flophouses. Today,
*  we have Uber. Back then, we had Gypsy cabs. So today, we see the transition from neutral
*  to yellow journalism. Back then, we saw the transition from yellow to neutral journalism,
*  right? And today, figures like Mike Moritz wrote about China's energetic and America's laconic.
*  But back then, Bertrand Russell actually wrote this whole long book. Actually, the mathematician,
*  Bertrand Russell, right? Wrote this whole long book, which I didn't even realize he wrote about
*  these kind of topics, about the problem of China. And one of his observations was, again,
*  I'm not saying this is, I'm just saying he made this observation. He was saying that America was
*  energetic and China laconic at the time, because everybody was in opium dens and so on and so forth.
*  Okay? More examples, the one I just mentioned, where the Chinese and Russians are again lining
*  up against the West, except this time, the Chinese are the senior partner in the relationship rather
*  than the junior partner. Today, I think, in the second Cold War, there will also be a third world,
*  but this time, I think that third world might come in first, because it's not the non-aligned
*  movement, it's the aligned movement around Web 3 protocols. That's fascinating. Yeah. That's where
*  Indic comes in. By the way, something we haven't mentioned, Africa, that there could be very
*  interesting things in Africa as well. Nigeria is actually, Nigeria has first tech unicorn,
*  and I'm investing there. And I think, it's one of these things where China's risen, India's like
*  about 10 years behind China, but I think this is the Indian decade in many ways. We can come back
*  to that point. But there's absolutely sparks of light in Africa. I mean, it's a huge continent.
*  It feels like the more behind, sorry to interrupt, the more behind you are,
*  the more opportunity you have to leapfrog. Sometimes, that's right. And Pesa is a classic
*  example where they did this in East Africa, but I think there's more possibility there.
*  So what is the fact that there's a kind of symmetry, history? How did that take us from
*  Trump, the different perspective you took, the libertarian perspective of, it doesn't really
*  matter? Yeah, because the libertarian perspective or the left libertarian perspective would say,
*  is it really a good idea to have total corporate power against the quote, elected government,
*  even if you may disagree? Do you want to open the door to total corporate oligarchy?
*  And it's like the opposite. That's why I mentioned it's like the opposite of business plots. And they
*  pulled on that thread. Okay. So the macro explanation that I have for this future is our past thesis.
*  And there's more. It also gives some predictions, right? If you go backwards in time, the US
*  federalizes into many individual states. Like before the civil war, people said the United States
*  are, and after they said the United States is. Before FDR, the 10th Amendment, reserved rights
*  to the states. Afterwards, it was just federal regulation of everything. As we go forwards in
*  time, you're seeing states break away from the feds on gun laws, drug laws, sanctuary cities,
*  okay? Many other kinds of things. And now Florida, for example, has its own guard that's not
*  a national guard, but like a state guard. Other states are doing this.
*  And that's a force of decentralization, saying that parallels in reverse.
*  In reverse. Right? So you're having to make America states again.
*  Nice.
*  Okay. That's what I think happening, right? I'm not saying I, well, I think there's aspects of that
*  that are good. There's aspects that are bad, but just like that's kind of the angle, right?
*  But then that's, I mean, from your perspective, that's probably not enough, right? That's not.
*  It's part of the future. Let's just say.
*  I think you suggested all kinds of ways to build different countries. I think that's probably one
*  of them. You said like start micro-countries or something like this. I forgot the terminology.
*  Yeah. Micro-nations. Yeah. I actually think of them as, the better term is micro-states,
*  because they're actually not nations. That's why they don't work. But micro-states are better,
*  right? Coming back to the difference between the nation and the state. The nation is like,
*  the nation state is a term that people use without expanding it. But nation comes from
*  the same root word as like natality. So it's like common descent, common birth, right? Common origin,
*  like the Japanese nation. That's a group of people that have come down from history, right?
*  Hence nationalism.
*  Yeah. Whereas the state is like the administrative layer above them. It's like labor and capital,
*  like labor and management. Okay. The American state stood over the Japanese nation in 1946
*  after the war. Right. So you weren't talking about tradition, that doesn't matter.
*  Traditionally.
*  In terms of like, I thought you meant nation is a thing that carries across the generations.
*  There's a tradition, there's a culture and so on. And state is just the layer.
*  I mean, that's also another way of thinking about it, right?
*  There's a reversal there as well. Okay.
*  Yeah. So I mean, one way of thinking about it is, one nation under God and divisible
*  is no longer true. America is at least two nations, the Democrat and Republican,
*  in the sense of their own cultures, where I can show you graph after graph. You've seen the
*  polarization graphs. I can show you network diagrams where there's this graph of polarization
*  in Congress where there's red and blue, they're separate things. There's this article from 2017
*  showing how shares on Facebook and Twitter are just separate sub graphs. They're just separate
*  graphs in the social network and they're pulling apart. Those are two nations. They're not under
*  God because people in the US no longer believe in God. And they're very much divisible because
*  96% of Democrats won't marry Republicans in a high percentage of other way.
*  And what that means is in one generation, ideology becomes biology. These become ethnic groups. It
*  takes on the character of Hoodoo and Tutsi or Protestant and Catholic, Sunni and Shiite. It's
*  not about ideology. If you think about all the flips during COVID, right? Where people were on
*  one side versus the other side, it's tribal. It's just tribe on tribe. And so it's not universalist
*  that identity of American makes less sense than the identity of Democrat and Republican right now,
*  or perhaps identity of individual states. What I think that's a good or bad thing,
*  I think that's unfortunately, whatever it is, it's the arrow of history, right?
*  On the opposite side of things, India is actually was 562 princely states at the time of Indian
*  unification from 1947 to 19... 1947, when they got independence from the British,
*  it was 562 princely states. Most people don't know that part. They got, or outside India,
*  don't know the part. It got unified into a republic only by like 1950. And India is like actually a
*  modern... India is like Europe. It's kind of like the European Union in the sense that we didn't
*  have a unified India in the past. It was something with a lot of different countries like...
*  Northern South India or like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are as different as Finland and Spain, okay?
*  But India is moved in the direction of much more unification, like much more centralization or
*  what have you, whereas the US is decentralized. You go, okay, few more things, there are flips
*  and I'll finish this off. Today we're seeing the rise of the pseudonymous founder and starved
*  societies. All the way back in the 1770s, we saw pseudonymous founders of starved countries,
*  namely the US, right? The Federalist Papers. Today we're seeing so far unsuccessful calls
*  for wealth seizures in the US. Back then we saw FDR's Executive Order 6102, which was a successful
*  seizure of gold. I expect we may see something like that, an attempted seizure of digital gold.
*  And I think that'll be one of the things that individual states like Florida or Texas may not
*  enforce that. And I think that's actually the kind of thing where you could see like a breakup
*  potential in the future, right? One other thing that kind of rhymes is in many ways like the
*  modern US establishment, the story that you hear is the victories in 1945 and 1865 legitimate the
*  current establishment. That is, being the Nazis, being the Confederates, right? So they beat the
*  ethnic nationalists abroad and they beat the, quote, secessionists at home, right? And the
*  ethnic nationalists were Aryan Nazis and the secessionists were slave owners and against
*  freedom and so on and so forth, okay? I'm not disputing that. I'm just saying that that's just
*  like the way people think about it. There's a possibility, and I'm not saying it's 100%
*  at all, okay? But if you're a sci-fi writer, there's a possibility that the US loses to
*  the ethnic nationalists abroad, except this time they're Chinese communists, non-white communists,
*  as opposed to Aryan Nazis, which seemed like the total opposite, okay? And there's a possibility
*  that there is a financial secession at home where it's Bitcoin maximalist states that
*  are advocating for freedom, the opposite of slavery. See what I'm saying?
*  Oh boy, that's dark. You're looking for major things in history that don't yet have a-
*  Cognate going forward, right?
*  And that's a nice way to think about the future.
*  It is only one model and any mental model or something like that. That's why I say
*  as a sci-fi scenario, it's just like a scenario one could contemplate, right?
*  Where the new version has, I mean, the Chinese communists do not think of themselves as Aryans,
*  right? But they are ultra-nationalists. And the Hitler comparisons, people talk about Hitler
*  endlessly, like Saddam is the new Hitler, everybody's the new Hitler, et cetera.
*  If there is a comparison to quote Nazi Germany, it is CCP China in a sense, why? They are non-English
*  speaking, manufacturing powerhouse with a massive military build out under one leader that is a
*  genuine peer competitor to the US on many dimensions and in fact, exceeding on some
*  dimensions of technology and science, right? The problem is it's a boy who cried wolf. People
*  say this a zillion times, right? And that is like, I'm not saying this by the way crucially,
*  I think China is very complicated and there's hundreds of millions of people, probably half
*  in China that disagrees with the current ultra-nationalist kind of thing, right?
*  And so I kind of hate it when innocent Chinese people abroad or whatever are just attacked on
*  this basis or what have you. Plus, the other thing is that many Chinese people will say, well, look,
*  relative to where we were when Deng took over in 1978, we built up the entire country. We're
*  not starving to death anymore and the West wants to recolonize us and so on. I understand where
*  that's coming from. This way you want to be able to argue different points of view. With that said,
*  there's one huge difference, right? Which is Nazi Germany was like 70 million people
*  and the US was 150 million and the Soviet Union was 150 million and the UK was like 50 million.
*  So they were outnumbered like five to one. China outnumbers the US four to one.
*  This is going to be a fun century under this model.
*  Under this model, things are going to be potentially crazy. Plus, people are like, oh,
*  I think this is, again, I have nothing personal. There's this guy, Peter Zion, he writes these
*  books, right? I probably agree with about 20 or 30%, but I disagree with a lot of the rest.
*  A bunch of it is basically about how China is really weak and America is really strong
*  and the rest of the world is screwed. I think there's absolutely problems in China and
*  the current management is actually messing a lot of things up. We could talk about that.
*  But I do think that the US is fighting its factory. So one thing Zion will talk about is how
*  America has this blue water Navy, all the aircraft carriers and China has nothing,
*  it's got bookcase, et cetera. Well, China ships things all around the world.
*  It probably has one of the most active fleets out there in terms of its commercial shipping.
*  In terms of building ships, here's a quote, China's merchant shipbuilding industry is the
*  world's largest, building more than 23 million gross tons of shipping in 2020. US yards built
*  a mere 70,000 tons the same year, though they typically average somewhere in the 200,000s.
*  That is a 100 to 300 X ratio just in shipbuilding. Pretty much everything else you can find in the
*  physical world is like that. We're not talking like two X, we're talking they can put together
*  a subway station in nine hours with prefab and the US takes three years. When you have a thousand X
*  difference in the physical world, the reason the US was won against Nazi Germany in a serious fight
*  is they had this giant manufacturing plant that was overseas and they just outproduced and they
*  supplied the Soviets also with lendlies. The Soviets talked about how they would not have won
*  the war without the Americans. People are like, oh, the Russians fought the Germans. The Russians
*  armed by Americans fought the Germans. It's a Soviet Union, they're not actually able to make
*  high quality stuff. There obviously are individual people in Soviet Russia who were innovative. I'm
*  not taking that away. There's a tradition of amazing, I just want to be like, there's individual
*  Russians who obviously I admire, Mendeleev and Klimov and so on. There's amazing Russian
*  scientist engineers. I'm not saying that- In general, from brilliant folks like yourself
*  that criticize communism, it's too easy to say nothing communism produces is good,
*  which of course is not true. There's a lot of brilliant people and then a lot of even,
*  there's a lot of amazing things that have been created. Yeah. They had some amazing mathematicians,
*  amazing scientists and so on. However- Great branding on the red and yellow. The branding
*  is stellar. Nazi Germany to excellent branding with the flag and so on. It ends there in terms
*  of compliments. Yeah. Well, actually they copied a lot of stuff from each other. There's this
*  movie called The Soviet Story. It basically shows a lot of Nazi and Soviet propaganda things next
*  to each other. You can see guys almost in the same pose. It's almost like, you know how AI will do
*  style transfer? You can almost see, because the socialist realism style of the muscular brawny
*  worker, very similar to the style of the Aryan Superman pointing at the vermin or whatever.
*  Then there's the crappy open source version that tries to copy, which is Mussolini.
*  That does the same exact thing, but does it kind of shittier.
*  Right. My main thing about this is basically trying to fight your factory
*  in the physical world is probably not going to work. People are, I think, overconfident on this
*  stuff. With that said, I think we want to, the future is not yet determined. At all odds,
*  we want to avoid a hot war between the US and China would be-
*  Do you think it's possible that we'll get a war?
*  We're doing these things like Pelosi going to Taiwan and trying to cause something. Look,
*  again, this is one of these things which is complicated because, obviously, there's more
*  than one perspective on this. Again, you've got the US establishment, the US conservative,
*  the Taiwanese perspective, the Chinese perspective, all the bystanders over there. There's more than
*  one perspective on this. If you're one of China's many neighbors, you look at China with apprehension.
*  Vietnam, for example, has fallen into, or not fallen into, is partnering with India because
*  they're mutually apprehensive of China. China's not making great friends with its neighbors. It's
*  demonizing Japan. It's so ultra-nationalist nowadays. If you're a Taiwanese, you're like,
*  yeah, I do not want to be under the Chinese surveillance state. I completely understand
*  that. Some people are pro-reunification, others aren't, but there's more trend in some ways
*  for independence. Okay, fine.
*  But there's also an increasing temperature across the entire world. As we sit here today,
*  there are speeches by Vladimir Putin about the serious possibility of a nuclear war.
*  That escalates the heat in the room of geopolitics.
*  It escalates the heat in the room, of course. The thing is, people have this belief that because
*  something hasn't happened, it won't happen or it can't happen. But there were a lot of measures
*  people took during the Cold War to make sure a nuclear exchange didn't happen. The whole
*  mutually assured destruction thing and communicating that out and the balance of
*  terror. There were smart guys on both sides who thought through this and there were near misses.
*  There's that story about the Soviet colonel who didn't order a nuclear strike because he thought
*  it was just an error in the instruments. Okay, what's the point? The point is, for example,
*  policy going to Taiwan, that didn't strengthen Taiwan. If you're going to go and provoke China,
*  I thought Scholar Stage, his Twitter account, had a good point, which is, if you're actually
*  going to do it, then you strengthen Taiwan with huge battalions of arms and material and you make
*  them a porcupine and so on and so forth. Instead, her going and landing there and mooning China and
*  then flying back in the middle of a hot war with Russia, that's absolutely in the middle of an
*  economic crisis. Can you pick battles or whatever? You don't have to fight Russia and China at the
*  same time. It's kind of insane to do that. Plus, even with Ukraine, some people were like, oh,
*  this was a victory for the US military policy or something. There's a guy who, I'm not trying to
*  beat him up or anything, he's like, this is in March, thread on US security assistance to Ukraine,
*  it's working. Ukraine might be one of the biggest successes of US security assistance.
*  The reason is US didn't focus on some high-end shiny objects but on core military tasks that
*  focus should remain. It's like, how is this a success? The West gave massive arms to Ukraine
*  only after the invasion, but not enough before to deter. Now, Ukraine is like this Syria-like
*  battleground with a million refugees or whatever the number is. Their country is blown to
*  smithereens, thousands of people dead, whatever thousand dollar gas in Europe with 10X energy,
*  radicalized Russians, the threat of World War III or even nuclear war.
*  Shooting somebody, that's not the point of the military. The point is there's a million ways
*  to smash Humpty Dumpty into pieces and unleash the blood-drenched tides and have people shooting
*  each other and killing each other. It's really hard to maintain stability. That's what competence
*  is, is deterrence and stability. There's not a success in any way. It's like an absolute
*  tragedy for everybody involved. Right? Yeah. I mean, deterrence, of course,
*  is the number one thing, but there's a lot to be said there. But I'm a huge
*  not fan of declaring victory as we've done many times when it's the wrong.
*  Yeah. I mean, the other thing about this is the whole mission accomplished thing during your
*  life. Mission accomplished is what I meant. Yeah. Exactly. Mission accomplished was obviously,
*  the thing is Russia lives next door to Ukraine. Just like Iraq lives next door to Iran and
*  Afghanistan is next door to Pakistan and China. If the US eventually gets tired of it and leaves,
*  those guys are next door. Right? Who knows what's going to happen here. Okay.
*  One of the problems is the whole Afghanistan thing or the Iraq thing is the lesson for people
*  was the uncertainty. They're like, is the US going to fight? Don't know. Will the US win if
*  it fights? Don't know. Therefore, roll the dice. That uncertainty is itself tempting to folks like
*  Putin or whatever. Right? So point is coming all the way back up, we were talking about
*  how history, futures are passed and FDR, like the business plot, FDR failed, but the tech companies
*  were able to deplatform Trump. Right? And the left libertarian would say, do we want that much
*  corporate power? Okay. And so we gave the four case for Trump deplatforming, protecting democracy,
*  the Trump supporter case against, which is on the secret history of the shadow campaign to save the
*  2020 election, basically that article, the left libertarian or libertarian case against. And then
*  to me, what is, I am more sympathetic to the libertarian slash left libertarian against,
*  and then also maybe the fourth group, which is the non-American case, right? Which is to say,
*  every, you know, Amlo, he was the head of state of Mexico, I think at that time. Okay. Amlo,
*  Macron, other folks, everybody who's watching this around the world basically saw, let's say,
*  US establishment or Democrat aligned folks just decapitate the head of state digitally, right?
*  Just boom, gone. Okay. And they're like, well, if they can do that in public to the US president,
*  who's ostensibly the most powerful man in the world, what does the Mexican president stand
*  against that? Nothing. Right? Like these US media corporations, these tech companies are so insanely
*  powerful. Everybody's on Twitter or what have you, other than China, leaving them aside. They've got
*  their own root system. If somebody tried to deplatform Xi Jinping off of Sino Weibo, they'd
*  probably just fall through a trap door, you know, their whole family, right? But for the rest of
*  the world, that is hosting their business, their politics on these US tech companies, they're like,
*  regardless of whether it was justified on this guy, that means they will do it to anybody. Now,
*  the seal is broken. Just like the bailouts, as exceptional as they were in the first year,
*  everybody was shocked by them. Then they became a policy instrument. And now there's bailouts
*  happening. Every single bill is printing another whatever billion dollars or something like that.
*  Right. Can I ask on your thoughts and advice on this topic? If I or anyone were to have a
*  conversation with Donald Trump, first of all, should one do so? And if so, how do you do it?
*  And it may not necessarily be Trump. It could be other people like Putin and Xi Jinping and so on.
*  Let's say people that are censored, right? Like people that platforms in general,
*  see as dangerous. Hitler, you can go, we keep bringing it up.
*  Of course, that's the ultimate edge case, right? In the sense of that saying like something must
*  be done. This is something therefore this must be done. Right. I've heard that one before.
*  No, right. I love it. So this,
*  can I just use that as an explanation with confidence for everything I do?
*  Yeah, sure. There you go. Right. Something must be done. This is something therefore must be done.
*  Therefore this must be done. So that is the like the two all kinds of regulations, all kinds of
*  things are kind of justified on that basis. Right. There's a version of that, which is punch a Nazi.
*  I decide who is a Nazi. You're a Nazi. Therefore I punch you and that's justified. Yeah. Yeah. And,
*  you know, like people say, oh, how many people are calling Israelis, you know, like these things,
*  right? And so the problem with argumentum ad hellerum is it just, I mean, people will say
*  Obama's a Nazi. Everyone is going to say everybody's a Nazi. Right. But there is a social consensus
*  about who, let's set the Nazis aside, but who is dangerous for society. Okay. But now let's talk
*  about that. All right. So basically I think a more interesting example than Hitler in this context is
*  Herbert Matthews. So Fidel Castro, before he became the communist dictator of Cuba,
*  was on the run. He was like Osam Bin Laden at the time. He was like a terrorist that the Cuban
*  regime had seemingly defeated. And what Herbert Matthews did is he got an intro to him. He went
*  to the, you know, place where he was hiding out. He gave an interview and he printed this hagiography
*  in the New York Times with this like, you know, photo of Castro looking all, you know, mighty and
*  so on. And he's like, Castro is still alive and still fighting. Okay. And there's this book on
*  this called The Man Who Created Fidel. Okay. Where basically NYT's article was crucial positive press
*  that got Castro's point of view out to the world and helped lead to the communist revolution that
*  actually impoverished Cuba, led to like gay people being, you know, like discriminated against there,
*  led to people fleeing, you know, and drowning trying to escape. Right. That's an example of
*  where platforming somebody led to a very bad outcome. In fact, many of the communist dictators
*  in the 20th century had like their own personal journalists. Right. For example, there's a guy,
*  John Reed. He's an American. He's buried, you know, if I get this right, I think he's buried
*  at the Kremlin wall. Okay. Why is an American buried there? Okay. Because he wrote a book called
*  Ten Days That Shook the World that whitewashed the entire Soviet revolution and the, you know,
*  the Russian revolution in 1917, October revolution, and made these guys out to be the good guys when
*  they were actually genocidal psychopaths. Okay. He got their point of view out to the world and
*  it was a totally misleading point of view. All right. What do you think he was thinking?
*  He's like, he saw the psychopathy. You know, sometimes it's not obvious. Well, the French
*  revolution had already happened. So people kind of knew that this sort of psychopathic,
*  you know, killing in the name of equality could produce bad results. Right. And, but it's more
*  than that. Right. So it's John Reed, it's Herbert Matthews, it's Edgar Snow. Okay. So these are all
*  people who should be extremely famous. Right. So Edgar Snow is Mao's journalist. Okay. So he wrote,
*  you know, here's the, there's actually an article in this how 1930s reporter from Missouri became
*  China's ideal, ideal journalist. Okay. And he wrote various books, including like Red Star Over
*  China. Okay. And it's just a hagiography of Mao. Right. Yeah. And then of course you've got Durante
*  and he is like Stalin's biographer. Right. Just to recap, John Reed brought Lenin's message to the
*  world. Mao is dead. Durante helped Stalin starve out the Ukrainians. Mao is dead. Edgar Snow was
*  Mao's biographer. And Herbert Matthews was like Castro's. This guy, David Halberstam in Vietnam,
*  who was effectively Ho Chi Minh's. He basically went and took leaks from a communist spy. I'll
*  give you the exact name. Pham, I'm going to mispronounce this, but it's perfect spy, the
*  incredible double life of PHAM, Pham Zuan Anh, Time Magazine reporter and Vietnamese communist agent.
*  That guy was the source of many fabricated stories that David Halberstam printed in the
*  New York Times that led to the undermining of the South Vietnamese regime. And, you know,
*  for example, stories of Buddhist being killed and so on. Ashley Rinsburg in The Great Lady Winked
*  writes this whole thing up at length so you can go and read it for his account.
*  But basically all of these communist dictators had a journalist right alongside them as their
*  biographer. Yeah. Okay. But those are tools of the propaganda machine versus-
*  Well, so my point is these are five examples that are on the far left that should be balanced also
*  against the Times running profiles of Hitler on the far right. We know that the Times actually
*  also ran a whole thing, which was Hitler's like mountain retreat or something like that. Do you
*  know about that story? What year was this? I'll tell you in a second. Hitler at Home in the Clouds.
*  Oh boy. Please tell me it's like early 30s. I think it's, oh yeah, this is auto-detolish us.
*  This is actually a guide that Ashley Rinsburg writes up in The Great Lady Winked, right?
*  1937.
*  1937. There's another one where I think the date is wrong, but essentially these titles are like,
*  where Hitler dreams and plans. He lives simply, you know, right? And there's another one,
*  Hare Hitler at Home in the Clouds. Okay. The thing about this is absolutely there are folks who are
*  hate geographers of the far right, but whether you're talking Lenin and John Reed or
*  Stalin and Walter Durante of the New York Times or Castro and Herbert Matthews, again, of the New
*  York Times or Edgar Snow and Mao or David Halliburstam and Ho Chi Minh, again, of the New
*  York Times. You start to see a pattern here where the guys who are being platformed and given a
*  voice are these guys who end up being like far left, you know, lunatics, right? And I think part
*  of the issue here is, you know the saying about how communists don't understand self-interest,
*  nationalists don't understand other interests. And so nationalists are more obvious. Isn't that
*  good? I thought it was good.
*  That's pretty good.
*  Right? So the nationalist is very obvious in the sense of like, they're for the Aryans. They're
*  not even for like the Slavs or whatever, right? Like, you know, basically, you know, had Hitler
*  constructed a different ideology, you know, then like he might've gotten more support in Eastern
*  Europe or whatever, right? But he also called the Slavs inferior, not just, you know, basically
*  everybody was inferior to the Aryans, okay? Except maybe the English or whatever, but that was it,
*  right? Oh, and the Japanese are honorary Aryans or something. So the nationalist declares the
*  supremacy of their own race or culture or what have you and doesn't understand people's other
*  interests. But he also pumps up his own guys, okay? Same with, you know, in some ways China
*  today, same with Japan back in the day. Whereas the communist has a message that sounds more
*  appealing. It's a universalist message ostensibly, but it's actually a faux universalism because
*  it's actually particularism. Like during the Soviet Union, communism, this faux universalism
*  was basically a mask for Russian nationalism, you know, where, you know, or at least Soviet
*  nationalism where in particular Russians were pushed into many territories and, you know,
*  Russian speakers were, you know, like privileged in, you know, the Eastern Europe and the Baltics.
*  Of course, Russians themselves were oppressed at home as sultan's rights here, both victim and
*  victimizer of the regime. Their churches were crushed and so on. As compensation, they were
*  agents of empire. It's a tragedy all around, right? I'm not, you know, I think Russians are being
*  hard done in many ways. They've had a very hard, hard century. They've also done hard by others.
*  Okay. It's complicated. Those journalists you mentioned, just to elaborate, maybe you
*  can skewer with me. I wonder what you think. Sure. But I think conversation, like not to sort of
*  glorify any particular medium, but there's something, one of the reasons I like long form
*  podcasts or interviews, long form, unedited interviews, there's been shows throughout the
*  20th century that do that kind of thing, but they seem to be rare. There is that's podcast made it
*  much more popular and common is it somehow makes it easier not to do this kind of bullshit
*  journalism that the gotcha stuff. Yeah. I feel like asking interesting and deep questions allow,
*  I think you could sit down with Hitler in 1940, 1941, 1942, and the podcast actually
*  serve a purpose. In 41 and 42, mid-World War II?
*  A mid-World War II, a purpose of one, which is very important, get good information for the future
*  so history can study it and two, reveal to the world the way a man thinks that is beyond the
*  propaganda. So all this stuff is complicated, but today, so in the specific issue of the folks you
*  were talking about, like Putin, Xi, Trump, right? For those folks, they are very clearly outgrouped
*  for both the US left and right, which is, you'll say the Western left and right, which are your
*  audience. There's folks who are tankies and there are folks who are MAGA who are sympathetic.
*  So what are tankies? Tankies are those who are,
*  they may call themselves tankies. Let's say they're anti-imperialist left and MAGA right,
*  okay? For different reasons are against the US establishment and for Putin or Xi or something
*  like that as an agent against the US establishment, right? So leaving those aside, the point is that
*  most of your audience is sort of on guard, vaccinated in a sense, right? Versus Xi and
*  Putin and Trump, right? They know the counter arguments and so on and so forth, okay? In which
*  case, I wouldn't think interviewing them would be like that big a deal relatively because there's
*  so much other coverage and so on out there. I think it's probably okay. However, for something
*  like when what John Reed was doing and so on, when he was the sole source of information about
*  the Russian revolution, right? That's different. That's different, right? So it's something about,
*  it kind of gets back to the competitive environment and so on. There's no dearth of folks who are
*  writing critical coverage of these three men, right? And so if I felt that that was insufficient,
*  then you might need more of it, right? Just like, for example, nowadays with Stalin, there are a lot
*  of articles and books and PDFs and so on on it. But at the time, not as much. At the time, not as
*  much, right? That's why I brought those guys, right? Because often it's kind of like, have your stock
*  shelves at a supermarket and so seem totally out of left field? No, but shoes, but the same thing,
*  seers, I used to work with seers. The thing that is the most popular is the thing that's not on the
*  shelf because it's been sold out, right? So in some ways, this is similar to that famous photo
*  that people have, and I thought of the image that people have on Twitter of the plane and the parts
*  that are shot versus not, right? The survivorship bias, right? And one way of kind of thinking
*  about it is the guys who you think of as bad guys or possible bad guys or controversial guys or
*  whatever are those you've already got some vaccination to. That's why you think of them at
*  all. Whereas the folks that I mentioned, the regulators, invisible, right? Salzberger,
*  you know Zuckerberg, you know his pros and cons, you know who he is as a person. You don't even
*  know Salzberger exists, most people, right? Despite the fact that he's like, certainly is powerful,
*  you know, he owns the New York Times, he inherits it. He also got dual class stock, just like Zuck,
*  but he's invisible, right? Well, that's why I think studying the knowns, the people that are known
*  can help you generalize to the way human nature is. And then you start to question, are the same
*  kind of humans existing in places that wield power? And you can assume they are, they do exist
*  there and then you can start to infer and ask questions. So this is kind of what I try to do is
*  like, what is the dark matter? What is the question that is not being asked or what have you, right?
*  And so, you know, that's not to say that you need to be so anti-mimetic that you only do that. But
*  I think you need to do that as well as understand what is good about the conventional wisdom. And
*  for example, if you notice a lot of what I talk about is like the V1, V2, V3, where as critical
*  as I am of, let's say, the FDA, I recognize that people want a regulated marketplace and how do we
*  do better? As critical as I can be of the Fed, I recognize that some kind of monetary policy is
*  necessary and Satoshi came up with a better one, right? As harsh as one can be a critic of the
*  current system, it is really incumbent, as difficult as that is, upon one to come up with
*  a better version. Just like academia, as much as I think current science is corrupted, what I propose
*  is a way to actually improve on that. And actually any true scientists say, yes, I want my work to be
*  reproducible. Yes, I want citations to be important statements and so on and so forth. And we don't
*  have to get everybody to agree with that, but just enough to build that better version and not regress.
*  Yeah, there's an implied optimism within the V1, V2, V3 framework. Let me ask you at a high level
*  about social media because you are one of its prominent users to communicate your wisdom.
*  I use Twitter, I wouldn't really think of it as quick, communicate my wisdom per se or anything
*  like that. I use Twitter like I might use GitHub as a scratch pad for just kind of floating concepts.
*  And I've got, okay, here's a frame on things. Let me kind of put it out there and see what people
*  think, get some feedback and so on. Don't you think it has a lasting impact, your scratchbook?
*  I think it's good, but basically like, if I say that's what's my primary thing on Twitter,
*  it's that. It's a scratch pad for me to kind of put some concepts out there,
*  iterate on them, get feedback on them and so on and so forth.
*  Do you think it's possible that the words you've tweeted on Twitter is the most impact you will have
*  on the world? Is that possible?
*  Is it possible? Well, my tweet is a good question. I think the network state will be,
*  I think, important. Or I hope it, well, the book.
*  The book is a concept.
*  Good question.
*  The movement.
*  The movement.
*  Right. In the sense that Zionism shows that it is possible to have a book and then a conference
*  and then a fund and eventually in the fullness of time with a lot of time and effort to actually
*  get a state, right? And as I mentioned earlier, a lot of countries are small countries,
*  but I didn't mention there's a guy who's the head of Kazakhstan and he made a remark. He's like,
*  if we allow every nation that wants to have self-determination to have a state,
*  we'd have 600 countries rather than 190. Because there's many opposites of a nation state,
*  but one of the opposites is the stateless nation. And so you know where the network state is popular?
*  In places like Catalonia, Catalonian nationalists, in Catalonia, guys who are committed
*  Catalonian nationalists. So Catalonia, you know, this region of Spain, right? The thing is that,
*  again, V1, V2, V3, the nation state is V2 and it beat the city state, which is like V1.
*  And the network state I think of as a potential V3, which combines aspects of V1 and V2.
*  So Catalonia or the Basque region, these are underneath the nation state of Spain,
*  but many Catalonians think of themselves as part of a separate nation. Not all,
*  except many. Okay? And so they want a state of their own. Who doesn't if you're a nation?
*  They've got a legitimate claim from history, language, culture, all that stuff, right?
*  The Basques do as well. The Kurds do as well. Okay? Lots of ethnic groups around the world do.
*  So in the game of musical chairs, that was the formation of current national borders,
*  they lost out. Right? So what do they do? Well, one answer is they just submit to the Spanish state
*  and they just speak Spanish and their culture is erased and their history is erased and so on.
*  The second is they do some sort of Ireland-like insurgency, the troubles to try to get a thing
*  of their own, which is obviously bad for other kinds of reasons, right? You know, violent, et cetera.
*  What this Catalonian nationalist said is like, look, well, we can't give up on our existing path.
*  The network state is a really interesting third option. I mean, by the way, I hadn't talked to
*  this guy, V. Partal, okay? And he's got this site called Vilaweb, sorry. It can be, meaning the
*  network state can be especially appealing to us. Catalans are now embarking on the task of having
*  a normal and current state in the old way and this is a project that we cannot give up. But this
*  does not mean that at the same time, we are not also attentive to ideas like this and we do not
*  try to learn and move forward, right? Meaning, you know, the network state, right? Because that's
*  the third way, which says, okay, maybe this particular region is not something where you're
*  going to be able to get, you know, a state. But just like there's more Irish people who live
*  outside of Ireland, right? Just like, you know, the Jewish people, you know, didn't actually get
*  a state in Poland or what have you, they had one in Palestine. Perhaps the Catalonians could crowd
*  from territory in other places and have essentially a state of their own that's distributed, okay?
*  Now, again, what people are really going to say is, well, that's going to lead to conflict with
*  the locals necessarily and so on and so forth. But if you're parallel processing, you don't have the
*  all-in-one bucket aspect of I must win here and the guy on the other side is like, I must win.
*  You have optionality. You can have multiple different nodes around the world. Just like
*  there's multiple Chinatowns, you can have multiple Catalonian towns, right? And some places, you
*  might be able to just buy an island and that becomes, you know, the New Catalonia, right?
*  Just like in, I think there's a region called New Caledonia and that's in the Southwest Pacific. So
*  maybe New Catalonia is somewhere else, right? So if you're flexible in that, now, of course,
*  a bunch of people will immediately say, they'll have 50 different objections to this. They'll say,
*  ah, you don't get it. The whole point is the land and, you know, so on. They've been there for
*  generations. They'll say, I do get it. But this Catalan nationalist who's like literally written
*  in Catalonian for, I don't know how many years, right? Is basically saying this is worth thinking
*  about. And so it's a peaceful third way. Yeah, but it's interesting. I mean, it's a good question
*  whether Elon Musk, SpaceX and Tesla will be successful without Twitter. Yeah, I don't think
*  as successful. I mean, obviously they existed before Twitter and a lot of the engineering
*  problems are obviously non-Twitter things, right? But Twitter itself has certainly probably helped
*  Musk with Tesla sales. The engineering, no, that's not what I mean. Oh, go ahead. The best people in
*  the world solve the engineering problems. Yes, but he hires the people to solve them and he knows
*  enough about engineering to hire those people. That's the point I'm making is on Twitter, the
*  legend of Elon Musk is created. The vision is communicated and the best engineers in the world
*  come to work for the vision. It's an advertisement of a man of a company pursuing a vision. I think
*  Twitter is a great place to make viral ideas that are compelling to people, whatever those ideas are,
*  and whether that's the network state or whether that's humans becoming a multiple planetary species.
*  Here is a remark I had just before the pandemic related to this, okay, about Twitter helping Elon
*  just beyond that for a second. Maybe centralization is actually also underexplored in the design space.
*  For example, today's social networks are essentially governed by a single CEO, but that
*  CEO is a background figure. They aren't leading the users to do anything. What if they did?
*  One example, could Elon Musk's then 30 million followers somehow get us to Mars faster?
*  Tools for directed collaborative work by really large groups on the internet are still in their
*  infancy. You can see a piece of what I was talking about, the scratch pad thing, the network state
*  being a group which can do collective actions. This is kind of the thing, right? So technologies
*  for internet collaboration that could be very useful to the software for future network states.
*  Operational transformation is how Google Docs coordinates edits. Conflict-free replicated
*  data types is another alternative easier to code in some ways than operational transformation.
*  Microtasks like Mechanical Turk, Scale AI, and Earn.com before we sold it.
*  Blockchains and crypto obviously. The Polymath project where a bunch of people parallel processed
*  and we're able to solve an open math problem by collaborating.
*  Wikipedia with its flaws that we talked about. Social networks and group messaging. All these
*  are ways for collaborating. They're not just simply attacking or doing something on the internet.
*  This is something that Elon could use, right? What works and what doesn't about Twitter?
*  If there's something that's broken, how would you fix it? A million things I can say here.
*  A few things. First is fact checking. I had this kind of fun, I thought it was a funny tweet.
*  To anyone who wants to quote, ban lying on social media. Please write down a function
*  that takes in a statement and returns whether it is true. If you can start with the remand hypothesis,
*  that would be amazing. Yeah. Okay. That's kind of funny, right?
*  That's funny. And so now- That joke landed on like five people.
*  Sure. You want to explain the joke? Go. Well, no, there's a lot of problems,
*  decidability where the truth, that's what proofs in math is. The truth of the thing is actually
*  exceptionally difficult to determine. And that's just a really nice example. The problems that
*  persist across centuries that have not been solved by the most brilliant minds, they're
*  essentially true or false problems. That's right. And so when people are saying,
*  when they were saying they want to ban lying on social media, fact check social media,
*  the assumption is that they know what is true. And what do they mean by that? They really mean
*  the assertion of political power. Right? With that said, do I think it could be useful to have
*  some kind of quote fact checking thing? Yes, but it has to be decentralized and open source.
*  You could imagine an interesting concept of coding trugal, like a Google, that return was true. It's
*  like a modified version. Right? It's like GPT-3, but the stable diffusion version where it's open.
*  Okay. And so now anybody, stable diffusion shows it is possible to take an expensive AI model and
*  put it out there. Right? So you have, you know what a knowledge graph is? Like basically, you
*  wouldn't actually, whether you have it as RDF or like a triple store kind of thing, or some of the
*  representation, it's like an ontology of A is a B and B has a C and it's got probabilities on the
*  edges sometimes and other kinds of metadata. And this allows Google to show certain kinds of one
*  box information where it's like, what is Steve Jobs', what is Lorene Powell Jobs' age or birthday?
*  They can pull that up out of the knowledge graph. Right? And so you can imagine that trugal
*  would have both deterministic and statistical components. And crucially, it would say whether
*  something is true according to a given knowledge graph. And so this way, at least what you can do
*  is you can say, okay, here's the things that are consensus reality, like the value of the
*  gravitational constant will be the same in the MAGA knowledge graph and the US establishment
*  knowledge graph and the CCP knowledge graph and the, I don't know, the Brazilian knowledge graph
*  and so on and so forth. Okay. But there's other things that will be quite different.
*  And at least now you can isolate where the point of disagreement is. And so you can have a form
*  of decentralized fact checking that is like, according to who, well, here is the authority
*  and it is this knowledge graph. Right? So that's like a kind of thing. Right?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  So that's one concept of what next social media looks like. There's actually so much more.
*  Another huge thing is decentralized social media. Okay. Social media today is like China under
*  communism in a really key sense. There's a great article called The Secret Document that Transformed
*  China. Do you know what China was like before 1978? I know about the atrocities. Sure. So,
*  but there- To put some flesh on the bones, so to speak. Okay. So basically-
*  There's a good book I'm reading because I think a lot of documents became public recently.
*  And so- There's a window when it opened up. Now
*  it's probably closing back down again, but- But great biographies because of that were written,
*  like I'm currently reading Mao's Great Famine by Frank de Carter, which is, whoo boy.
*  It's crazy. Okay. Yeah. Here's the thing is,
*  capitalism was punishable by death in living memory in China. Just to explain what that meant.
*  Okay. I mean, that's what communism was, right? It was literally the same China that has like the
*  CCP, you know, the entrepreneurs and Jack Ma and so on and so forth. 40 something years ago,
*  capitalism was punishable by death. To put, to give you a concrete example,
*  this is a famous story in China. It may be apocryphal, but it's what, you know,
*  the folks have talked about. There's a village in Xiao Gang and basically all the grain that
*  you were produced was supposed to go to the collective. And even one straw belonged to the
*  group. At one meeting with communist party officials, a farmer asked, what about the teeth
*  in my head? Do I own those? Answer, no, your teeth belong to the collective. Okay. Now, the thing is
*  that when you're taking a hundred percent of everything, okay, work hard, don't work hard,
*  everyone gets the same. So people don't want to work. Right. So what happened? These farmers
*  gathered in secret and they did something that was like, would have gotten them executed. They
*  wrote a contract amongst themselves and said, we all agree that we will be able to keep some of our
*  own grain. We will give some of them to the regime. So when it comes to collect grain,
*  they've got something. We'll be able to keep some of it. And if any of us are killed for doing this,
*  then the contract said that the others would take care of their children.
*  Okay. So to keep some of what you earned. I mean, just think about how-
*  They formed a mini capitalism society within the secret capitalism society amongst five people.
*  Right. So now that they could keep some of what they earned, right? Keep some of what they earned,
*  they had a bumper harvest. And you know what happened with that bumper harvest?
*  That made the local officials really suspicious and mad. They weren't happy that there was a
*  bumper harvest. They're like, what are you doing? You're doing capitalism, right? And in, you know,
*  a few years earlier, they might've just been executed. And in fact, many were. That's what
*  it means when you see millions dead. Millions dead means guys were shot for keeping some grain
*  for themselves. Okay. It means like guys came and kicked in the door of your collective farm and,
*  you know, raped your wife and took you off to a prison camp and so on and so forth. That's what
*  communism actually was. Okay. It hasn't been depicted in movies. There's a great post by Ken
*  Billingsley in the year 2000 called, if I get this right, Hollywood's Missing Movies. Okay.
*  This is basically here. I'll paste this link so you can put in the show notes. All right.
*  This is worth reading. It's still applicable today, but now that we have stable diffusion,
*  now we have all these people online. Now that Russia and China are America's national bad guys,
*  you know, as they were before, they are again, perhaps we'll get some movies on what communism
*  actually was during the twin century and how bad it was, right? And, you know, vaccinating people
*  against that as well as against Nazism, which they should be. Okay. The point of this, go ahead.
*  No, because I'm congratulating myself on the nice because you're sending me excellent links
*  on WhatsApp and I just saw that there's an export chat feature. Yes. Great. Because we also have
*  disappearing messages on. So I was like, all right, this is great. Great. I'll be able to get it.
*  This, your ability to reference sources is incredible. So thank you for this.
*  Otherwise, if I say something, it sounds too surprising. So that's why I want to make sure I
*  have. Yeah. So like, yeah, I mean, people would be like shot for holding some grain. So what
*  happened though was Ding Xiaoping said, okay, we're not going to kill you. In fact, we're going to
*  actually set up the first special economic zone in Shenzhen. He didn't try to flip the whole country
*  from communist to capitalist in one go and said, he's like, we can reform in one place.
*  And in fact, he fenced it off from the rest of China and it did trade with Hong Kong and he
*  spent his political capital on this one exception. It grew so fast that gave him more political
*  capital. You know, some people think actually that the Sino-Vietnamese war was Ding's way of
*  just distracting the generals while he was turning China around to get it back on the capitalist
*  road. And what he did was the opposite of a rebranding. He did a reinterpretation. Like a
*  rebranding is where the substance is the same, but the logo has changed. Okay. You know, you're now,
*  you were Facebook, you're now meta. That's a rebranding, right? Reinterpretation is where
*  the logo and the branding is the same. They're still the CCP. They're still the Chinese communist
*  party, but they're capitalist now, the engine under the hood. It's deniable. Okay. And this is a very
*  common, once you realize those are different things, it's like swap the front end, swap the
*  back end. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead and put it. Right. Yeah. I'm enjoying your metaphors and way
*  of talking about stuff. Yeah. So I get, yeah, yeah. Swap. You could, yeah. Rebranding and swap the
*  front end. Reinterpretation, swap the back end. That's right. Once you, you know, once you realize
*  that you're like, okay, I can just like, as an engineer, you can kind of, okay, sometimes I want
*  to do some of the front end, sometimes I want to do the back end. Sometimes it's explicit. And
*  sometimes the user doesn't need to see it and it's on the back end. Lots of political stuff,
*  you know, is arguably not just best done on the back end, but always done on the back end.
*  One of the points I make in the book is left is the new right is the new left is, you know,
*  if you look through history, the Christian king, the Republican conservative, the CCP entrepreneur,
*  the WASP establishment, these are all examples of a revolutionary left movement becoming the
*  ruling class right. Okay. Like the Republican conservative, just as that one example, I go
*  through an extended description of this in the book, but the Republicans were the radical
*  Republicans, the left of 1865. They won the revolution and their moral authority led them
*  to have economic authority in the late 1800s. You wouldn't want a Democrat Confederate trader
*  as the head of your railroad company, would you? Right? So all the Confederate traders that were
*  boxed out from the plumb positions in the late 1800s. And so what happened was the Republicans
*  turned their moral authority into economic authority, made tons of money. The Democrats
*  then started repositioning, not as a party of the Southern racist, but the poor, right? And, you
*  know, the cross of gold speech by William Jenkins-Brian was part of that. There's a gradual
*  process that reaches a crucial mark with the election of FDR, where it's actually not the 1932
*  but 1936 election that black voters switched over to FDR. Okay. That was actually the major flip to
*  like 70% to the Democrats. Now they had repositioned as a party of the poor, not the party of the South.
*  Okay. And Republicans had lost some economic authority or rather they had moral authority,
*  they turned into economic authority. They started to lose some moral authority. The loss of moral
*  authority was complete by 1965. That was actually mop up. People dated, you know, the civil rights
*  movement as the big way where the Republicans lost moral authority. It's not really, that was a mop
*  up because 1936, 30 years earlier was when black voters switched to the Democrats. Okay. So 1965
*  was another 10 points moving over of black voters to Democrats. Republicans had completely lost
*  moral authority a hundred years after the civil war. Okay. Then the next 50 years, that loss of
*  moral authority meant that they lost economic authority because now you wouldn't want a Republican
*  bigot as a CEO of your tech company anymore, would you? Right. So by 2015, 2020, now you have,
*  it's like two sign waves that are staggered, right? Moral authority leads to economic authority,
*  leads to loss of moral authority, leads to loss of economic authority. And so now you have the
*  the Democrats have completed 155 year arc from the defeated party in the civil war to the dominant
*  party in the establishment. All the woke capitalists are now at the very top. And now the same
*  repositioning is happening where if you're so woke, why are you rich? You get it, right? Like, you
*  know, if you're so smart, why aren't you rich is the normal kind of thing, right? If you're so woke,
*  if you're so holy, why is like, for example, the BLM founder, why do they have this million dollar
*  mansion, right? If you're so woke and it's all about being good and you're anti-capitalist,
*  how come you seem to be raking in the money, et cetera, right? This is an argument which I'm
*  not sure how long it will go. It might take years to play out, might take decades to play out.
*  I think it probably on the order of a decade. You're going to see in my view, the repositioning,
*  if the Democrats are the woke capitalists, the Republicans will eventually become,
*  are becoming the Bitcoin maximalists. Why? Because, you know, if one guy picks left,
*  the other guy picks right. It's literally like magnets kind of repelling. They're sort of forced
*  into the other corner here, right? And the Bitcoin maximalists will essentially, where this guy says
*  centralization, they say decentralization, where they defend the right of capital to do anything,
*  the maximalists will say, actually, you're all cantillionaires. You're all benefiting from
*  printed money. You don't have anything that's legitimate. You don't actually own anything.
*  It's all a handout from the government and so on and so forth, right? And so that's
*  a counter positioning that will basically attack the wokes by how much money they're making.
*  They're not contesting the ideology. So when one guy signals economics, you signal culture. When
*  their guy signals culture, you signal economics. That's actually, that's the whole thing I can
*  talk about. Should I talk about that for a second? Sure. Is this integrated into the forces that you
*  talk about? You've talked about the three forces that trifecta forces that affect our society,
*  which is the wokes, let's say. Woke capital, communist capital, crypto capital.
*  You talk so fast. And I think so slow. No, no, no. Woke capital, communist capital, and crypto
*  capital. Can you explain each of those three? We actually talked about each of the three in part,
*  but it'd be nice to bring them together in a beautiful triangle. Then I will also come back
*  up and I'll talk about how the CCP story relates to social media and decentralized social media.
*  Sure. All right. So NYTCCPBTC is woke capital, communist capital, crypto capital.
*  And communist capital is the simplest. It is, you must submit. The communist party is powerful.
*  CCP is powerful and you are not. If you're in China, you just submit. CCP is an embodiment of
*  communist capital that you're talking about. Well, yeah. So basically, and by the, in China,
*  they call it CPC. So basically they don't like it usually if you say CCP, right? So
*  the communist party of China as opposed to Chinese communist party over there. Basically,
*  that is capitalism. That is a Chinese pool of capital, that billion person pool, okay?
*  That's WeChat and it's Alibaba and it's entire kind of thing. That is one
*  social network with currency. The whole thing is vertically integrated.
*  When we say communist, what do you mean here? Why is the word communist important?
*  Why don't you just say China? So is communist an important word?
*  It's just, it's, well- Or is it just a catchy label?
*  It's a catchy label, but I think it's also important because it seems it's paradoxical,
*  right? I had a thread on this. The future is communist capital versus woke capital versus
*  crypto capital. Each represents a left-right fusion that's bizarre by the standards of the
*  1980s consensus. It's PRC versus MMT versus BTC, right? Why is it bizarre by the standards of
*  the 1980s consensus? Well, in the 1980s, you wouldn't think the communists would become
*  capitalists, but they did. You wouldn't think that the wokes, the progressives, right,
*  would become so enamored with giant corporations and their power, right? They've seen something
*  to liken that, right? You also wouldn't think that the non-Americans or the post-Americans
*  or the internationalists would be the champions of capital because you'd think it's the American
*  nation, right? So rather than the conservative American nationalists being the defenders of
*  capital, you have the liberal Americans who are with capital, you have the communist Chinese
*  who are with capital, and you have the internationalists who are with capital.
*  And it's the conservative American nationalists who are in some ways against that,
*  which is kind of funny, right? So it's like this weird ideological flippening that
*  if you take the long lens, you have these poles that kind of repel each other, okay?
*  So just on the CCP-NYT-BTC thing- NYT, by the way, is woke capital.
*  Yeah. What is NYT? So its formula is a little interesting. If CCP is just, you must submit
*  because they're powerful, okay? And then you bow your head because the Chinese Communist Party
*  is strong. Woke capital is you must sympathize. Why do you bow your head, Lex? Oh, because you're
*  a white male. Therefore, you're guilty. You must bow your head because you are powerful.
*  Yet notice it ends in the same place, in your head looking to the ground, right? In China,
*  it's because they're powerful, so therefore you must bend your head. For the Wokes, it's the
*  left-handed version where you are powerful and it's shameful, so you should bow your head.
*  Right? Right. Okay? But it ends in your head bowed. It's an ideology of submission. It's not that
*  subtle, but it's like somewhat subtle. And then finally, crypto-capital is head held high. You
*  must be sovereign, okay? And one of the things I point out in the book is each of these poles
*  is negative in some ways when taken to extreme, but also negative in its opposite. For example,
*  obviously just totally submitting to total surveillance is bad, but a society where
*  nobody submits is San Francisco where people just rob stores and walk out in the middle shoplifting
*  all these goods and nothing happens, right? A society where you have the woke level of
*  sympathy where you get to the kind of insanity of math is white supremacist and whatever nonsense
*  is happening today is terrible, but a society that's totally stripped of sympathy is also not one
*  that one would want to be part of, right? Whether it's 4chan's actual culture or its
*  feign culture or something like that or some weird combination, that's also not good. It's like Russia
*  in the 90s, like nobody trusts anybody. That's also bad. And being totally sovereign, that sounds
*  good and there's a lot that is good about it. And I'm sympathetic to this corner, but being totally
*  sovereign, you go so capitalist, so sovereign that you're against the division of labor. You
*  don't trust anybody. So you have to pump your own water and so on. So you actually have a reduced
*  standard of living over here. And conversely- It's like survivalist or whatever.
*  Survivalist type of stuff, right? And you just go kind of too crazy into that corner.
*  And then of course though, the other extreme of having no sovereignty is the, you will own
*  nothing and be happy. Everything's in the cloud and can be deleted at any point, right? So each
*  of these has badness when it's there, but also its total extreme opposite is bad. And so you want to
*  carve out like an intelligent intermediate of these three poles. And that's the decentralized
*  center or the re-centralized center I call. Now with that said, I think there is a repositioning
*  in particular of vote capital that is happening. And I think if the 2000s was the global war on
*  terror and then the channel just changed to wokeness in the 2010s. And when I mean channel
*  change, have you seen Paul Graham's graph or actually David Rosato's graph that Paul Graham
*  posted? No, but this is a good chance to say that Paul Graham is awesome. Okay. Yeah. And so here
*  is this graph. Okay. David Rosato's data analysis, I think that put this together. So basically this
*  is a graph of the word usage frequency in New York Times, 1970 to 2018. And he's got some controls
*  there. Paul Graham tweets hypothesis, although some newspapers can survive the switch to online
*  subscriptions. None can do it and remain politically neutral, quote newspaper or record.
*  You have to pick a side to get people to subscribe. And there's a bunch of plots
*  on the X axis is years on the Y axis is the frequency of use. And sexism has been going up,
*  misogyny has been going up, sexist, patriarchy, mansplaining, toxic masculinity, male privilege.
*  All these terms have been going up very intensely in the past decade.
*  Yeah. But really 2013 is the exact moment. You see these things, they're flat and then just go
*  vertical, mansplaining, toxic masculinity. What precisely happened in 2013?
*  Ah, so I talk about this in the book, but I think fundamentally what happened was tech hurt media
*  and their revenue dropped by about $50 billion over the four years from 08 to 2012.
*  Tech helped Obama get reelected and media was positive on tech until December 2012. They wrote
*  like the nerds go marching in the Atlantic. Then after January 2013, once Obama was disconsed,
*  then the knives came out because basically these tech guys were bankrupting them. They were through
*  supporting them. And so the journals got extremely nasty and just basically they couldn't build
*  search engines or create social networks, but they could write stories and shape narratives.
*  So a clear editorial direction went down that essentially took all of these weapons that had
*  been developed in academia to win status competitions in humanities departments.
*  And then they just deployed them. And essentially somebody observed that
*  wokeness is the combination of Foucauldian deconstruction and civil rights, where
*  deconstruction takes away the legitimacy of the old order. And then civil rights says,
*  okay, the only thing that's good is this, which says the old order is also bad in a different way,
*  but this is what's good. And that is the underpinning ideology that all these words
*  have embedded in them, like an ideology. And everybody is thinking about it is,
*  this is not my reference, but I'll cite it anyway, the glossary of the Greek military junta.
*  The creation and or use of special terms are employed by the junta as propaganda tools
*  because essentially the word itself embeds a concept. You can Russell conjugate something one
*  way or the other. Russell conjugation is a concept that I sweat, you perspire, but she glows. You can
*  always take something. You are uncontrollably angry, but he is righteously indignant. Okay.
*  Um, you have a thin skin, they clap back. Right? So once you kind of realize that these words have
*  just been chosen in such a way as to delegitimize their target, and they all went vertical in 2013,
*  and they were suddenly targeted against their erstwhile allies, you know, in tech, but also
*  just across the country, you can see that this great awakening, that's what Iglesias called it
*  by playing words to the great awakening, right? This kind of spasm of quasi religious extremism,
*  I wouldn't call it religious because it's not God centered, it's really state and network centered.
*  So I call it a doctrine, which is a superset of religion and political doctrine.
*  This, uh, these words went vertical and the, all the terrorism stuff you just noticed kind of fell
*  off a cliff. That was the obsession of everything in the two thousands and just channel change.
*  Right? It's amazing how that happened. It's not, it's not like, not like any of the pieces got
*  picked up. Some of those words are still raging, of course. And there's, uh, victims to this woke
*  ism movement and, um, but in a weird way, even though some parts of it, just like, you know,
*  Syria, like there's wars in the Middle East, it's still keep raging. There's, there's certainly
*  active fronts of wokeism, you know, but in a sense, the, the next shift is already on, you know, why
*  it's a pivot from wokeism to statism in many ways. NYT is sort of, and more generally the
*  US establishment is sort of kind of coming, you may not believe this, they're kind of coming back
*  to the center a little bit in the same way that Lenin after the revolution implemented the new
*  economic policy, which you may be aware of, right? Which was just like X percent more capitalism.
*  He kind of boot on the neck, take control, but then ease up for a bit. And the so-called net men
*  during the twenties were able to eke out something. There was like, you know, oh, okay, fine. He's
*  going to be easier on us. Then it intensified again, because basically by loosening up, they
*  were able to consolidate control. They weren't putting as much pressure on it, right? Then it
*  went extremely intense again, right? Similar to like Mao's like a hundred flowers thing, let a
*  hundred flowers bloom and, you know, everybody came out and then he founded all the people who
*  were against him and he executed a bunch of them, right? So what's happening now is NYT is, and more
*  generally the US establishment is somewhat tacking back to the center where, you know, they're not
*  talking BLM and abolish the police. They're saying fund the Capitol police, right? They've
*  gone from the narrative of 2020, which was meant to win a domestic contest, where they said America
*  is a systemically racist country, tear down George Washington, we're so evil, to the rhetoric of
*  2022, which is we're the global champion of democracy and every non-white country is supposed
*  to trust us. Now, obviously those are inconsistent, right? If you're in India or you're in Nigeria and
*  you just heard that America is calling itself the same guys, by the way, saying it's so institutionally
*  racist, systemically racist, and you're saying, well, we're the leader of the free world and the
*  number one. Obviously there's an inconsistency between the domestic propaganda and the foreign
*  propaganda, right? There's a contrast between abolish the police and put 2 billion for the
*  Capitol police. You can reconcile this and you can say the US establishment is pro-federal and
*  anti-local and state. So abolish the local police who tend to be, you know, Republican or rightist,
*  but fund the FBI, fund the Capitol police who tend to be, you know, just like in the
*  Soviet Union as a national things like the KGB, right? They were for the state, but there were
*  always local nationalist ethnic insurgencies in like Estonia and other places, right? So you can
*  reconcile them, but nevertheless on its face, those are contradictory. So what are you going to
*  get, I think? I think you're going to get this rotation where a fair number of the folks on the
*  authoritarian right are kind of pulled back into the fold a bit, okay? These are the cops
*  and the military and whatnot, some of them, because as this decade progresses, you're going
*  to see the signaling on American statism as opposed to wokeism, okay? Which is 30 degrees
*  back towards the center, right? Conversely, on the other side, you're going to have the left
*  libertarians and right libertarians who are signaling crypto and decentralization and so on,
*  okay? And so the next one isn't red versus blue, it's orange versus green. It's the dollar versus
*  Bitcoin. And so you have the authoritarians, the top of the political compass versus the
*  quote libertarians, right? And here's the visual of that. So that's why like, you know, as I wrote
*  the book and after I was like, you know, I'm already seeing this shift happening from war on
*  terror to wokeism to American statism, right? And here, just take a look at this visual.
*  Interesting. So the visual is an animation transforming the left versus right libertarian
*  versus authoritarian to Bitcoin, dollar versus crypto. That's right. And some folks switch sides,
*  right? Because you have folks like, you know, Jack Dorsey and a lot of the tech founders in basically
*  the lower left corner, right? Who were blue but are now going to become orange or are orange.
*  And you have folks in the upper right corner who are going to at the end of the day, pick the dollar
*  and the American flag over the internationalist ideals of cryptocurrency. The realigning, as you
*  call it. Let me ask you briefly, we do need to get a comment, your visionary view of things.
*  We're at a low point in the cryptocurrency space from a shallow analysis perspective,
*  or maybe in a deeper sense, if you can enlighten me. Do you think Bitcoin will rise again?
*  Yes.
*  Do you think it will go to take on fiat, you know, to go over a million dollars to
*  go to these heights?
*  I mean, I think it's possible. And the reason I think it's possible is I think a lot of things
*  might go to a million dollars because inflation.
*  Because inflation.
*  Right.
*  That was an important point, right?
*  Yes, it's a very important point, yes.
*  Because you're seeing essentially,
*  yes.
*  Right, sort of the choke pointing on energy is pushing up prices across the board for a lot
*  of things. China's not doing us any favors with the COVID lockdowns. Putin's not doing the world
*  any favors with this giant war. There's a lot of bad things happening in the physical world,
*  right? You know, you have, I mean, when China, Russia, and the US are all, and Europe is, you
*  know, like there's folks who are just insane about degrowth, and they're against, you know,
*  they're pushing for burning coal and wood, right? So a lot of prices are going up in a really
*  foundational and fundamental way. And with that said, also, the dollar is in some ways strengthening
*  against certain other things because a lot of other countries are dying harder, right? You know,
*  and you've got riots in Sri Lanka and riots in Panama and riots in, you know, all these places,
*  right? So it's very complicated because you've got multiple different trends going in the same way.
*  Bitcoin maximums would just say infinity over 21 million. And so therefore you print all the
*  dollars, there's only 21 million bitcoins, so Bitcoin goes to infinity. But it can be something
*  where lots of other currencies die and the dollar is actually exported via stable coins.
*  Okay. But I do think-
*  Still moves, fiat still moves somehow into the cryptocurrency.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's kind of like Microsoft where Windows is still around,
*  right? No, actually it's still around. It's still a multi-hundred billion dollar company.
*  He doesn't mean it. He doesn't mean it. Don't worry. All my machines are Windows and still boot.
*  Are they? Okay, okay.
*  I don't know a single Mac.
*  Really? Okay. You are unusual on that. So at least for our-
*  It's not ideology, just convenience.
*  Fine. They actually now post set the other. They do make some good stuff, right? Microsoft Teams is
*  good. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff. And UCO has done a lot of innovative things like GitHub.
*  Yeah. Well, there's an acquisition, but still, they give them credit for it.
*  The acquisition, the pivoting of vision and motivations and focus and all that kind of stuff.
*  Anyway, yes. Microsoft does an analogy metaphor for something.
*  Well, yeah. So basically just like, they didn't need a turnaround, but they did endure to the
*  present day. They didn't die from Google app. I mean, for the massive attacks on them, they
*  didn't die. They are less powerful, but they make more money, right?
*  Yes. And I think that might be something that,
*  I mean, our best case scenario is the US establishment or CCP has more power over fewer people.
*  Okay. I see.
*  And so, but you can exit. If you're there, you're kind of knuckling under or whatever,
*  but you can exit, right? And so I mentioned those three poles. CCP is obviously a billion people,
*  1.4 aligned under the digital Yuan and so on, right? NYT is the entire, it's the tech companies,
*  it's the US dollar, it is the establishment. And then crypto capital is everybody else.
*  But I actually think that over time, that third world is web three this time, and that's the third
*  pole, and that's India and it's Israel, and it's lots of American conservatives and left libertarians
*  and libertarians, and it's also lots of Chinese liberals. All the folks who are trying to get out
*  of China because it's become so nationalist and crazy and difficult for capitalism.
*  And so if you take basically non-establishment Americans on both left and right, okay? The
*  bottom two quadrants in the political compass I talked about. You take the liberal Chinese,
*  you take the Israelis and the Indians. Why? Because they don't, both of them have a lot
*  of tech talent, right? They're the number one and number two demographics for tech founders.
*  And they want to, while they are generally sympathetic to the West, right? And they're
*  more ties to the West. They also are more cautious about national interests rather than just starting
*  fights, you know, where that's how they would think about it, right? They just, you know,
*  India thinks of Brazil as a poor country. Israel thinks of itself as a small country. And so
*  therefore it needs to not just get in every fight just for the sake of it. And so need to maintain a
*  cautious distance with China, but not like do what Pelosi is doing and try and start like a big
*  thing, okay? I think Israel is similar where it's maintaining diplomatic relations with China. It's
*  more friendly towards China than the US is. India and Israel, I think, are two sovereign states that
*  have a lot of globally mobile tech talent that obviously have ties to the West with the large
*  diaspora that are hard to demonize, you know, in the sense of willing to argue on the internet.
*  Let's put it like that, in English, right? It's very important. And them plus enough Americans
*  plus enough Chinese can set up another poll that is not for Cold War or military confrontation,
*  but for peace and trade and freedom and so on and so forth, right? That's the center as opposed to
*  the, you know, left of the, you know, the woke American US establishment or the right of the
*  ultra nationalist CCP, right? That's what I think about. Now, what I would say here is the reason I
*  think these are the kind of the three poles, you can argue against this, right? You can say it's
*  unipolar world. America's totally dominant. That's one argument. You can say it's a bipolar world.
*  It's just the US versus China. Everybody else will have to be forced to align with one or the other.
*  Jayashanker, you know, actually explicitly rejected this. He's like, look, there's a
*  billion people in India. It's coming up on, it will eventually be like the number three economy.
*  It's on the rise. He's got the history and culture. He thinks he's entitled to have India's
*  entitled to have its own side, right? In such a thing. It's a funny way of putting it, right?
*  But it's also true. And so you could say it's unipolar. You could say it's bipolar. You could
*  say it's just multipolar and everybody is kind of there, you know, India, Israel, these are groups
*  out there, but I actually think it's going to be tripolar. And the reason it's tripolar is
*  these three pools are the groups that have enough media and money and scale and whatnot to really
*  kind of be self-consistent civilizations. Obviously China's like the vertically integrated,
*  like Apple or whatever, just like one country. Maybe a stable ideology.
*  A stable ideology. That's right. Right. Obviously the, you know, the Bogues have
*  control of lots of institutions. They've got the US establishment and they've got the tech companies,
*  they've got the media companies and so on. But crypto is basically everybody else. And crucially,
*  crypto has inroads in China and America where it's hard to demonize it as completely foreign
*  because there's many, many, many huge proponents of the universalist values of crypto in America
*  and China because it is true global rule of law and free speech and you know, so on. It
*  is genuinely universalist in a way where America can no longer be, you know, the number one rule
*  of the rules-based order is America is always number one. And China doesn't even pretend to
*  maintain a rules-based order, right? Whereas for all those countries that don't want to either be
*  dominated by the US media corporations that can or social media that can just censor Trump,
*  nor do they want to be dominated by China. This is an attractive alternative, a platform they can
*  make their own, right? So that's where I think, you know, I wrote an article on this in foreign
*  policy on here. Here's two articles that talk about this a little bit. It's called Great Protocol
*  Politics. And then here's another one on the sort of domestic thing. Bitcoin is civilization for
*  Barry Weiss. Okay. But I want to just come up the stack a little bit and just return to that original
*  point which I diverged on, which was why I gave the whole example of how we got into China because
*  I talked about how China had gone from communist to capitalist and letting people have just a share
*  of what they owned, right? With social media, we're still in kind of the communist era of social
*  media almost where whatever you earn on social media, like Google takes its cut, Twitter takes
*  a hundred percent, you're nothing for all your tweets or anything like that. Not only do you
*  earn nothing, you might get a little rev share on TikTok or YouTube, you can do okay, right?
*  But not only do you earn either nothing or a little bit, you have no digital property rights,
*  even more fundamentally. You are at the just the whim of a giant corporation can hit a button and
*  everything you worked for over years, gone. Okay. Even if that is quote the current state of affairs,
*  state of affairs rather, that is not the right balance of power to be able to unperson somebody
*  at the touch of a key and take away everything in the digital world when we're living more and more
*  in the digital world. We need to check on that power and the check on that power is crypto and
*  its property rights and its decentralization, right? Then when I say decentralization, I mean
*  your money and your digital property is by default yours and there has to be a due process
*  for someone to take that away from you. All work is online, all your money is online,
*  your presence is online. That can just be taken away from you with the press of a key that just
*  gives bad governments, bad corporations, so much power that that's wrong, right? That's why I'm a
*  medium and long-term bull on crypto, simply because the check on this thing and that if you think
*  about in terms of just abstract decentralization is one thing, but you think about it in terms of
*  property rights, it's quite another. Now, what that also means is once you have property rights
*  and you have decentralized social media, it'll be like the explosion of trade that happened after
*  China went from communist to capitalist. Literally billions of people around the world are no longer
*  giving everything to the collective. They own the teeth in their head now, finally.
*  Okay. It's funny, right? So your LexFreeman.eth, you own it, the keys are on your computer. The
*  bad part is, of course, they can get hacked or something like that. Then you can deal with that
*  with social recovery. There's rates of securing keys. But the good part is, tada, you actually
*  have property rights in the Hernando de Soto sense. You have something you own, ownership,
*  digital ownership. The cloud is great, but crypto gives you some of the functionality of the cloud
*  while also having some of the functionality of the offline world where you have the keys.
*  So it's a V3, right? It's a continuous theme, right? The V1 was offline, I've got a key,
*  I own it, I have de facto control. V2 is the cloud, someone else manages it for me,
*  it's hosted, I get collaboration and so on. V3 is the chain where you combine aspects of those,
*  right? You have the global state of the cloud, but you have the local permission and controlling of
*  the private key. Okay. So that's why I'm a medium to long-term ultra bull on crypto.
*  There's a podcast I gave with Asymco where I talked through how crypto actually doesn't just
*  go after finance. So it's gold and it's wire transfers and it's crowdfunding and it's all
*  finance with DeFi, but it's actually also search and it's social and it's messaging.
*  It's actually even operating systems and eventually cloud and whatnot. Do you want me to
*  talk about that briefly? Yeah. Yeah. If you can briefly see how broad you see the effect of crypto.
*  So first, crypto is fundamentally a new way of building back end systems, right?
*  So if you think about how big a deal it was to go from AT&T's corporate Unix to Linux,
*  it's permissionless, right? When you went from, as much as I admire a lot of the stuff that
*  Sam Altman and Greg Brockman have done at OpenAI, I mean, they're phenomenal in terms of research.
*  They've pushed the envelope forward. I give them a ton of credit, right? Still, it was great to see
*  stable diffusion out there, which was open source AI, right? And so from a developer,
*  from a power user standpoint, whenever you have the unlocked version, like an unlocked cell phone,
*  it's always going to be better, right? So what crypto gives you, obviously it's every financial
*  thing in the world. You can do stocks, bonds, et cetera. It's not just like the internet wasn't
*  just a channel. It wasn't like radio and TV and internet. It was internet radio and internet TV
*  and internet this and internet that. Everything was the internet. All media became the internet.
*  Crypto is not an asset class. It's all asset classes. It's crypto stocks and crypto bonds,
*  et cetera. In a real sense, private property arguably didn't exist in the same way before
*  crypto. International law didn't exist before crypto. How are you going to do a deal between
*  Brazil and Bangladesh? If a Brazilian company wants to acquire a Bangladeshi company, they usually
*  have to set up a US adapter in between because otherwise what are the tax or the other obligations
*  between the two? You set up a US adapter or a Chinese adapter to go between, but now that
*  Brazilian and Bangladeshi can go peer to peer because they're using blockchain, right? They
*  can agree on a system of law that is completely international and that's code so each party can
*  diligence it without speaking Portuguese and Bengali, right? That's why I am a long-term
*  bull on crypto. I just described the finance case. Let me go through the others, right? Social.
*  You have the private keys for your ENS. You have apps like Farcaster. You basically have
*  decentralized social media where there's different variants. Some you just log in with your crypto
*  username. Others, the entire social network and all the likes and posts are on chain like Diso,
*  but there's several different versions, right? Search. Once you realize block explorers are an
*  important stealth threat to search, they're very high traffic sites like blockchain.com and either
*  scan that Google has just totally slept on. They don't have a block explorer. You don't have to do
*  anything in terms of trading or anything like that. Google does not have a block explorer. Why? They
*  don't think of it as search, but it is search. It's absolutely search. It's a very important
*  kind of search engine. Once you have crypto social, you now show that you're not just indexing in a
*  block explorer like on chain transactions, but on chain communications. Okay? Now you suddenly see,
*  oh, the entire social web that Google couldn't index. It could only index the world web
*  and not the social web. Now it's actually the on chain signed web because every post is digitally
*  signed. It's a new set of signals. It's way easier to index than either the worldwide web or the
*  social web because it's open and public. So this is a total disruptive thing to search in the medium
*  term because it's a new kind of data set to index, right? So that's how it's a threat to social,
*  to search. It is a threat to messaging. Why? Because or it's disruptive eventually because the
*  ENS name, as I mentioned, is like a universal identifier. You can send encrypted messages
*  between people. That's a better primitive to base it on. WhatsApp is just claiming that they're
*  end-to-end encrypted, but with an ENS name or with a crypto name, you can be provably audibly
*  end-to-end encrypted because you're actually sending it back and forth because the private
*  key is local. That itself, given how important that is, you could man in the middle signal or
*  WhatsApp because there's a server there. So end-to-end encrypted messaging will happen
*  and with payments and all this other stuff. So you get the crypto messaging apps. You get
*  operating systems. Why? Well, the frontier of operating systems, I mean, look, Windows,
*  Linux, and Mac OS have been around forever. But if you actually think about what is a blockchain,
*  well, there's operating systems, there's web browsers. A blockchain is the most complicated
*  thing since an operating system or web browser because it's a kind of operating system. Why?
*  It's got something like Ethereum. It has an EVM. It's got a programming language. It's got an
*  ecosystem where people monetize on it. They build front-end apps and they build back-end apps. They
*  interoperate between each other. This is the frontier of operating systems research. People
*  haven't thought of it that way. It's also the frontier of a lot of things in databases.
*  You will get a crypto LinkedIn where there's zero-knowledge proofs of various credentials.
*  Basically, every single Web2 company, I can probably come up with a Web3 variant of it.
*  Ethereum is... I mean, and this is high praise for both parties, but Ethereum is like the crypto
*  stripe or the Web3 stripe. You will see versions of everything else that are like this. But I kind of
*  described search, social, messaging, operating systems, the phone. Solana is doing a crypto
*  phone. Why do you want that? Again, digital property. Apple was talking about running some
*  script to find if people were having CSAM, like child porn or whatever, on their phones.
*  Even NYT actually reported that Google ran something like this and found false positives.
*  Some guy had to take a photo of a kid for medical diagnosis. It got falsely flagged as CSAM. He lost
*  access to his account. Total nightmare. Imagine just getting locked out of your Google account,
*  which you're so dependent on. As more and more of your digital life goes online,
*  is it really that much ethically different if it's the Chinese state that locks you out
*  or an American corporation? Basically, it's operationally very similar. You just have no
*  recourse. You're unpersonsed. The crypto phone becomes insanely important because you have a
*  local set of private keys. Those are the keys to your currency and your passport and your services
*  and your life. Become something that you just hold on you with your person at all times,
*  like your normal phone. You might have backups and stuff, but the crypto phone is an insanely
*  important thing. That's search, that's social, that's messaging, that's operating systems,
*  that's a phone. That's a lot right there. Yeah, that's beautiful. Can I have 120 seconds to just
*  finish up a few more thoughts on social media? Yes, please.
*  Okay. AI and AR. There's massive impact, obviously, of AI and social media. You're
*  going to have completely new social media companies, gestures, other things. TikTok,
*  having some of the AI creation tools in there is just like a V1 of that. There's this whole
*  thread with everything stable diffusion is unlocking. But basically, this is going to melt
*  Hollywood. US media corporations that took a hit in the 2010s, we're now going to be able to have
*  everyone around the world able to tell their story. All the stuff about AI ethics and AI bias,
*  the ultimate bias is centralized AI. Only decentralized AI is truly representative.
*  You cannot be faux representative. You cannot claim that Google is representing Nigerians and
*  Indians and Brazilians and Japanese. Those folks need to have access themselves. That's
*  a fundamental ethical argument against centralized AI. It's unethical and it's like this faux thing
*  where you might have faux diversity in the interface, but you haven't actually truly
*  decentralized it. This is the woke capitalism. You justify it with the wokeness and you make the
*  money by centralizing it. But the actual way of doing it is letting it free for the world
*  and letting people build their own versions. If people want to build an Asian Lord of the Rings,
*  they can do that. If they want to build an Indian one, they can do that. Whatever they want.
*  That is the argument for AI decentralization and for how that kind of links to this.
*  I love that AI decentralization fixes the bias problem in AI, which a lot of people seem to
*  talk about and focus on. Yeah. Centralization is inherently
*  unrepresentative fundamentally. You can mathematically show it. It's not representing the world.
*  The decentralization allows anybody to pick it up and make it their own.
*  Centralization is almost always a mask for that private corporate interest where it's like,
*  one of the things about the woke capitalism thing, by the way, is the deplatforming of
*  Trump was political. Other things are political. But do you know what deplatforming started with?
*  In the late 2000s, early 2010s, all the open social stuff was when deplatforming was being
*  used as a corporate weapon against Meerkat and Zynga and Teespring. These were companies
*  that were competing with features of TweetDeck, et cetera. They're competing with features of
*  Twitter or Facebook and the API was cut off. That was when actually progressives were for
*  net neutrality and an open internet and open social against the concentration of corporate
*  power and so on. Remember that? What's going to happen is both those two things, the political
*  and the corporate are going to come together. Why? In the Soviet Union, denunciation was used as a
*  tool to, for example, undercut romantic rivals. There's a great article called the Practice of
*  Denunciation in the Soviet Union, which talks about all these examples where the ideological
*  argument was used to kick somebody into the 300-like pit that existed at the center of the
*  Soviet Union. Anybody could be kicked into the pit at any moment. And ta-da, well, Ivan's out and now
*  hey, Anna, whatever, right? Okay. That same thing is going to be used by woke capitalists,
*  is being used by woke capitalists, where the woke argument is used to justify pushing their
*  competitor out of the app store or downracking them in search. Well, again, you wouldn't want
*  a bigot to be in search who could compete with us or whatever, right?
*  And conversely, so the wokeness is used to make money, and the money is used to advance the
*  ideology. It's like this kind of back and forth. Sometimes, right now you think of those as
*  independent things, but then they fuse, okay? And so that's very clear with the AI bias arguments,
*  where it just so happens that it's so powerful, Lex, this technology is so powerful in the wrong
*  hands, it could be used, so we will charge you 99.99 for every use of it. How altruistic is that? Is
*  that amazingly altruistic? It's really good, right? So once you kind of see that, as I said,
*  whenever they're positioning in economics, you can go in culture. When they're positioning on
*  culture, you can go in economics. If they're so woke, why are they rich? If they're so concerned
*  about representation, why is it centralized? Answer, they're not actually concerned about it,
*  they're making money, right? Okay. So that is, I think, in a few words, blows up a lot of the
*  AI bias type stuff, right? Okay. They're basically, they're biasing AI. All right.
*  So the amount of stuff that can be done with AI now, it also helps the pseudonymous economy,
*  as I was talking about with the AI Zoom. So you have totally new sites, totally new apps that
*  are based on that. I think it may, I mean, it changes, you're going to have new Google Docs,
*  all these kinds of things. You might have, once you can do things with just a few taps,
*  you might have sites that are focused more on producing rather than just consuming, because
*  with AI, you can change the productivity of gestures. You can have a few gestures,
*  for example, the image to image thing with the stable diffusion, where you make a little
*  cartoon third graders painting and it becomes a real painting. A lot of user interfaces will
*  be rethought now that you can actually do this incredible stuff with AI, it knows what you want
*  it to do. Right. So, and I saw this funny thing, which was a riff on Peter Thiel's line,
*  which is AI is centralized and crypto is decentralized. And somebody was saying,
*  actually, it turns out crypto is centralized with the CBDCs and stable coin and so on,
*  but AI is getting decentralized with stable diffusion. Ha ha. Right. Which is funny. And
*  I think there's centralized and decentralized versions of each of these. Right. And finally,
*  the third poll that actually, Thiel, he talks about AI and crypto, but the third poll is actually,
*  that's sort of underappreciated because people think it already exists, is social. That just is
*  keeping on going. Right. And obviously the next step in social is AR and VR. Why is it so obvious?
*  Because it's meta, it's Facebook. Now I saw this very silly article. It's like, oh my God,
*  Facebook is so dumb for putting a $10 billion into virtual reality. Right. And I'm like,
*  okay, the most predictable innovation in the world, in my view, is the AR glasses. Have you
*  talked about this on the podcast before? AR and VR? Of course a lot, but AR is not
*  as obvious actually. Okay. So AR glasses, what are AR glasses? So you take StampShed Spectacles,
*  Google Glass, Apple's AR kit, Facebook's Oculus Quest 2, right? Or MetaQuest 2, whatever. Okay.
*  You put those together and what do you get? You get something that has the form factor of glasses
*  that you'd wear outside, okay, which can, with a tap, record or give you Terminator vision on
*  something or with another tap go totally dark and become VR glasses. Okay. So normal glasses,
*  AR glasses, VR glasses, recording. It's as multifunctional as your phone, but it's hands
*  free and you might actually even wear it more than your phone. In fact, you might be blind
*  without your AR glasses because one of the things I've shown in the book early on are like floating
*  sigils. Did I show you that? So this is a really important just visual concept.
*  That right there shows with AR kit, you can see a globe floating outside. Okay. Secret societies
*  are returning. This is what NFTs will become. The NFT locally on your crypto phone, if you hold it,
*  you can see the symbol. And if you don't, you can't. By the way, for people just listening,
*  we're looking at a nice nature scene where an artificially created globe is floating in the air.
*  Yes, but it's invisible if you're not holding up the AR kit phone.
*  Yes.
*  Right? So-
*  So only you have a window into this artificial world.
*  That's right. And then here's another thing which shows you another piece of it. And this is using
*  ENS to unlock a door. So this is an NFT used for something different. So the first one is using the
*  NFT effectively to see something. And the second is using the NFT to do something. Okay. So based
*  on your on-chain communication, you can unlock a door. That's a door to a room. Soon it could be a
*  door to a building. It could be the gates to a community. It could be your digital login. Okay.
*  Amazing.
*  What this means is basically a lot of these things which are like individual pieces get synthesized,
*  right? And you eventually have a digital, just like you have a digital currency,
*  or digital currencies unify concepts like obviously gold, stocks, bonds, derivatives,
*  every kind of financial instrument, plus Chuck E. Cheese tokens, karma, everything that's fungible
*  and transferable. The digital passport unifies your Google style login, your private keys,
*  your API keys, your NFTs, your ENS name, your domain name, all of those kinds of things,
*  and your key card for your door and so on, right? So the AR glasses are what probably, I don't know,
*  it'll be Facebook's version three or version four. Apple is also working on them. Google is also
*  working on them. You might just get a bunch of those models at the same time. It's like predicting
*  the iPhone, just like Dorsey knew that mobile was going to be big, and that's why he had 140
*  characters for Twitter because it was like an SMS code limitation and Twitter was started before
*  the iPhone. AR glasses are an incredibly predictable invention that you can start thinking about the
*  future of social is in part in person. Okay. And it also means people might go outside more. Why?
*  Because you can't see a monitor in the sun, but you can hit AR and maybe you have a full screen
*  thing and you just kind of move your fingers or something and you can tap. You have to figure out
*  the gesture. You don't want to have gorilla arms. Maybe you do have a keyboard outside or just even
*  you could even have a desk like this. If you can touch type, you can imagine something where you
*  look down and you can see a keyboard with your AR glasses and it registers it, and then you can
*  type like this. And probably you could have some AI that could figure out what you meant rather
*  than what you were doing. Okay. So that's AI and social media. That's AR and social media.
*  But really one last thing I'll say, which is the non-obvious, non-technological part,
*  is I think we'll go from very broad networks, which are hundreds of millions or billions of
*  people like Twitter and Facebook, which have many small communities in them, to much smaller networks
*  that have a million or 10 million people, but are much deeper in terms of their affiliation.
*  And this is the long-term trend in tech because you're going from eyeballs in the 1980s,
*  eyeballs in the 1990s, to daily active users in the 2000s, to holders in the 2010s. So you go from
*  just like, oh, I'm just a looky-loo to I'm logging in every day to I'm holding a significant percentage
*  of my net worth. And then this decade is when the online community becomes primary. You're a netizen.
*  The digital passport is your main identity. And so this is not, see the problem with Facebook or
*  Twitter is it's a bunch of different communities that don't share the same values fighting with
*  each other. This brings us back to the network state where you have one community with shared
*  values, shared currency, and it's full stack. It's a social network and it's a cryptocurrency
*  and it's a co-living community and it's a messaging app and it's a this and it's a that.
*  And it's like a Sonia, with a million people, you can actually build a lot of that full stack.
*  That starts to get to what I call a network state.
*  There should be a standing applause line here. This is brilliant. You're an incredible person.
*  This was an incredible conversation. We covered how to fix our government, looking at the future
*  of governments moving into network state. We covered how to fix medicine, FDA, longevity,
*  that was just like a stellar description. Really, I'll have to listen to that multiple
*  times to really think and thank you for that, especially in this time where the lessons learned
*  from the pandemic are unclear to at least me. And there's a lot of thinking that needs to be done
*  there. And then just a discussion about how to fix social media and how to fix money.
*  This was brilliant. So you're an incredibly successful person yourself. You taught a course
*  at Stanford for startups. That's a whole nother discussion that we can have, but let me just ask
*  you, there's a lot of people that look up to you. So if there's somebody who's young in high school,
*  early college, trying to figure out what the heck to do with their life, what to do with their
*  career, what advice could you give them? How they can have a career they can be proud of,
*  or how they can have a life they can be proud of? At least what I would do,
*  and then he can take it or leave it or what have you. Yeah, to maybe to your younger self,
*  advice to your younger self. My friend Novel, a lot of what he puts out is the very practical
*  brass tacks, next steps. And I tend towards the macro. Of course, we both do both kinds of things.
*  But let's talk brass tacks, next steps, because I actually am practical, or at least practical
*  enough to get things done, I think. Just like you said, you're breaking up the new book into three.
*  Yes. It's motivation, theory, and practice. Motivation, theory, and practice.
*  That's right. And- So it's about practice.
*  So let's talk practice. Okay.
*  Especially in visual scale. Right. So first,
*  what skill do you learn as a young kid? So let me just give what the ideal full stack thing is.
*  And then you have to say, okay, I'm good quantitatively, I'm good verbally,
*  I'm good this, I'm good that. So the ideal is you are full stack engineer and full stack influencer,
*  or full stack engineer, full stack creator. So that's both right brain and left brain.
*  What does that mean with engineering? That means you master computer science and statistics.
*  Okay. And of course, it's also good to know physics and continuous math and so on. That's
*  actually quite valuable to know. And you might need to use a lot of that continuous math with
*  AI nowadays, right? Because a lot of that is actually helpful, right? Great descent and whatnot.
*  But computer science and stats are to this century what physics was to the last. Why? Because,
*  for example, what percentage of your time do you spend looking at a screen of some kind?
*  A large percentage of the time.
*  A large percentage of the time, right? Probably more than, for many people, it's more than 50%
*  of their waking hours. If you include laptop, you include cell phone, tablet, your watch,
*  maybe a monitor of some kind, right? All those together, it's a lot, okay?
*  And then that's going to only increase with AR glasses, okay? Which means most of the rest
*  of your life will be spent in a sense in the matrix, okay? In a constructed digital world,
*  which is more interesting in some sense in the offline world, because we look at it more,
*  changes faster, right? And where the physics are set by programmers, okay? And what that means is,
*  you know, physics itself is obviously very important for the natural world. Computer science
*  and stats are for the artificial world, right? And why is that? Because every domain has algorithms
*  and data structures, whether it's aviation, okay? You go to American Airlines, right?
*  They're going to have, you know, planes and seats and tickets and so on. So there's data structures,
*  and you're going to have algorithms and functions that connect them. You're going to have tables
*  that those data is run to. If it's Walmart, you're going to have SKUs and you're going to have shelves,
*  you're going to have data structures and you have algorithms to connect them. So every single area,
*  you have algorithms and data structures, which is computer science and stats. And so you're
*  going to collect the data and analyze it, right? And so that means if you have that base of CS and
*  stats where you're really strong and you understand, you know, the theory as well as the practice,
*  right? And you need both, okay? Because you need to understand, you know, obviously basic stuff like
*  big O notation and whatnot, and you need to understand all your probability distributions,
*  okay? You know, a good exercise, by the way, is to go from the Bernoulli trials, right? To everything
*  else, because you can go Bernoulli trials to the binomial distribution, to the Gaussian. You can
*  also go from, you know, Bernoulli trials to the geometric distribution and so on. You can drive
*  everything from this, right? And computer science includes not just big O, but software engineering.
*  Well, computer science is theory, software engineering is practice, right? You could argue
*  probability and stats is theory, and then data science is practice, right? And so-
*  You include all of that together.
*  I include all that as a package. That's theory and practice, right? I mean, look, it's okay to use
*  libraries once you know what's going on under the hood, right? That's fine, but you need to be able
*  to kind of write out the whole thing yourself. I mean, it's...
*  That could be true, could not be true. I don't know. Are you sure about that? Because-
*  Well, you should implement-
*  You might be able to get quite far standing on the shoulders of giants.
*  You can, but it depends. Like, you couldn't build... Well, okay. Somebody-
*  Maybe you could. However you were going to finish that sentence, I could push back before-
*  You could probably push back, right? But here's what I was going to say. I was going to say,
*  you couldn't really... You couldn't build Google or Facebook or Amazon or Apple without somebody
*  at the company who understood computer architecture and layout of memory and
*  theory of compilers. But you might want to... See, the thing is, if you just look at libraries,
*  you might be able to understand the capabilities and you can build up the intuition of what a great
*  specialized engineer could do that you can't. Yeah. For example, do you know, at least a while
*  back, facebook.com, it's just a single C++ compiled binary. It was like hip hop. They had a PHP
*  compiler where they had just one giant binary. I may be getting this wrong, but that's what I
*  recall, right? Yeah. I mean, it should be simple. It should be simple. And then you have guys like
*  John Carmack who comes in and does an incredibly optimized implementation that actually-
*  Well, yeah, more than that, right? Yes, right. But go ahead.
*  There are some cases with John Carmack by being an incredible engineer is able to bring to reality
*  things that otherwise would have taken an extra five to 10 years.
*  Yeah. Or maybe even more than that. This is the great man theory of history versus the determinist
*  waves of history are pushing things along. The way I reconcile those is the tech tree model of
*  history. You know, like civilization, you're playing a game civilization. Yeah. So like
*  civilization, you've got the tech tree and you can go and be like, okay, I'm going to get spearmen or
*  I'm going to do granaries and pottery, right? And so you can think of it as something where
*  here's everything that humanity has right now. And then Satoshi can push on this dimension of
*  the tech tree. So he's a great man because there wasn't a Leibniz to Satoshi's Newton,
*  right? Like Vitalik, as amazing as he is, was five years later or thereabouts, right? There
*  wasn't contemporaneous like another person that was doing what Satoshi was doing. It's truly
*  Sui generis, right? And that shows what one person can do. Like probably Steve Jobs of Apple,
*  given how the company was dying before he got there and he built it into the most valuable or
*  put on the trajectory to become the most valuable company in the world, it shows that there is,
*  great man, right? Maybe more than just being five or 10 years ahead, like truly shaping
*  where history goes, right? But on their hand, of course, that person, Steve Jobs himself,
*  wrote that email that recently was first thing saying that he doesn't grow his own food and he
*  didn't even think of the rights that he's got, someone else thought of those and whatnot.
*  And so it is always a tension between the individual and society on this, right?
*  But coming back, so CS and stats, that's what you want to learn. I think physics is also good
*  to know because you go one level deeper and of course, all these devices, you're not going to
*  be able to build LIDAR or things like that without understanding physics, right?
*  You mentioned that as one side of the brain. What about the other?
*  Right. So CS and stats is that side. Okay. And then you can go into any domain, any company,
*  kick butt, add value. Right. Okay. So now the other side is creator, right? Becoming a creator.
*  First, online, like social media is about to become far, far, far more lucrative and monetizable.
*  People are not updated. They kind of think it's like over or something like that, or it's old
*  or whatever. But with crypto, once you have property rights and social media, now it's not
*  what Google just allows you to have, but it's what you own, right? You actually have genuine property
*  rights. And that's just completely changed everything. Just like the introduction of
*  property rights in China changed everything. It might take some lag for that to happen,
*  but you can lend against that, borrow against that. You own the digital property, right?
*  And you can do NFTs, you can do investments, you can do all this other stuff, right?
*  So in many ways, I think anybody who's listening, who's like, I want to build a billion dollar
*  company. I'm like, build a billion dollar company, yes. Also build a million person media operation
*  or a million person following or something online, right? Because a US media company is simply not
*  economically or socially aligned with your business. I mean, the big thing that I think,
*  you know, tech and media actually, it's funny, there's this collision and sometimes there's an
*  admin smashing event and there's like a repositioning, right? And media attacked tech really hard in the
*  2010s, as well as many other things. And now post 2020, I think it's now centralized tech and media
*  versus decentralized tech and media. And centralized tech and media is NYT and Google,
*  which have all become Wokified, the establishment companies. But decentralized tech and media is
*  like Substack, a lot of defectors from the US establishment, from the NYT have gone to Substack.
*  But also all the founders and funders are much more vocal on Twitter, whether it's Mark Anderson,
*  Jack Dorsey, Jeff Bezos, Zuckerberg. Zuck is just cutting out the establishment and just going
*  direct to posting himself or posting the Jiu-Jitsu thing, which he recently did, or going and talking
*  to Rogan, right? And so you now have this sort of Adam smash and like kind of reconstitution.
*  Why is that important? Well, look, once you realize US media companies are companies and,
*  you know, their employees, Salzburg employees are just dogs on the leash, right? They're
*  hitmen for old money, assassins for the establishment. They're never going to
*  investigate him, okay? There's this thing right now, like some strike that or possible strike
*  that's going at the New York Times. Obviously, the most obvious rich corporate zillionaire,
*  the epitome of white privilege is, you know, and again, I'm not the kind of person who thinks white
*  is an insult, right? But the guy who inherited the company from his father's father's father's
*  in the NFL, right? You know, you're supposed to have the Rooney rule where you're supposed
*  to interview diverse candidates for the top job. You know, the other competitors for the top job
*  of the publisher of the New York Times were two cousins of Salzburg. So it's three,
*  cis straight white males in 2017 who competed for this top job. And everybody in media was like,
*  silent about this coronation. They have this coronation article in the Times about this,
*  right? So you have this meritless nepotist, right? This literally rich cis white man who
*  makes millions of dollars a year and it makes like 50 X the salary of other, you know,
*  NYT journalists, okay? And, you know, lives in a mansion and so on while denouncing,
*  this is a born rich guy who denounces all the built rich guys at a company which is far wider
*  than the tech companies he's been denouncing, okay? And again, there's a website called
*  tech journalism is less diverse than tech.com, which actually shows the numbers on this, right?
*  Here, I can look at these numbers, right? So why do I say this? Well, centralized US media has lost
*  a ton of clout. Engagement is down. You've seen the crypto prices down, like stock prices have
*  crashed. That's very obvious and quantifiable. Less visible is that media engagement has crashed,
*  right? By the way, yeah, there's a plot that shows in the X axis, percent white,
*  and then the Y axis are the different companies. And the tech companies are basically below 50%
*  white and all the different media, tech journalism companies are all way above, you know, 70, 80, 90,
*  90 plus percent white. And hypocrisy, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, again, I'm not the kind
*  of person who thinks white is an insult, but these guys are, and they are the wokest whites
*  on the planet, right? It's like ridiculous, right? You know, it's like anyone who's homophobic,
*  anyone who's, it feels like it's a personal thing that they're struggling with.
*  Maybe the journalists are actually the ones who are racist.
*  Well, actually, you know, it's funny you say that because there's this guy,
*  A.M. Rosenthal, okay? And, you know, on his gravestone was, he kept the paper straight, right?
*  And actually, he essentially went and this is the managing editor of the New York Times for almost,
*  you know, from 69 to 77, executive editor from 77 to 86. And it was a history.
*  Oh my Lord.
*  Yeah. History of basically keeping, you know, gay reporters out. So essentially, the way to think
*  about it is New York Post reported that, just to talk about this for a second, because it's so
*  insane, all right? New York Post reported, and I've got some of this in the book, okay? But.
*  Abe Rosenthal, managing editor of the New York Times from 1969 to 1977, executive editor from
*  1977 to 1986. His gravestone reads, he kept the paper straight.
*  And then here's Jeet here on this. He kept the paper straight. As it happens, Rosenthal was
*  a notorious homophobe. He made it a specific policy of the paper not to use the term gay. He denied
*  a plum job to a gay man for being gay. He minimized the AIDS crisis. So like, you know, the thing
*  about this is this is not like a one-off thing, okay? The New York Times literally won a pulitzer
*  for choking out the Ukrainians for helping starve 5 million Ukrainians to death. And now has
*  reinvented themselves as like a cheerleader to stand with Ukraine, right? They were for, you know,
*  Abe Rosenthal's homophobia before they were against it, right? They were like, if you saw the link,
*  I just pasted it in, okay? During BLM, you know, it's credibly reported that, and I haven't seen
*  this refuted, the family that owns the New York Times were slaveholders. Somehow that stayed out
*  of 1619 and BLM coverage, right? So they were literally getting the profits from slavery to
*  help bootstrap, you know, what was the times or, you know, went into it. They actually did this
*  article on like the compound interest of slaveholders in Haiti and how much they owed people,
*  right? If you apply that to how much money they made off of slaves, I mean, can anyone name one
*  of Salzburger's slaves? Like, can we humanize that, put a face on that, show exactly, you know, who
*  lost such that he may win, right? And so you stack this up and it's like, you know, for the Iraq war
*  before they were against it. And it's like, yeah, sure, Bush, you know, did a lot of bad stuff there,
*  but they also reported a lot of negative, you know, not negative coverage, like false coverage,
*  right? About WMDs, like, you know, the whole Jewish military. And so it's like this amazing thing
*  where if some of the most evil people in history are the historians, if the, you know, they actually
*  ran this ad campaign in the 2017 time period called the truth. So giant Orwellian billboards,
*  right? Which say, you know, the truth is essential here. It looks like this.
*  This was when? This was just a few years ago, 2017. This is in New York. A billboard by the New York
*  Times reads, the truth is hard to know. The truth is hard to find. The truth is hard to hear. The
*  truth is hard to believe. The truth is hard to accept. The truth is hard to deny. The truth is
*  more important now than ever. And this is like, uh, yeah, this is 1984 type of stuff. Yeah. Now
*  here's the thing. Do you know what other truth? Yeah. Big truth period. Big white board.
*  So, okay. What other national newspaper proclaimed itself the truth in constantly every, every day?
*  You know, this one actually. Oh, you mean Prada? Yeah. There you go. That's right. What is it?
*  What is the Soviet translation? What's the Russian translation of Prada is truth. Yeah. That's so
*  sorry. That didn't even connect to my head. Yes. Yeah. Truth. Unironically, huh? And again, it just
*  so happens that- Is this an onion article? Right. So it's like, you know, Pravda, like at least
*  they're a communist. These guys have figured out how to get charged people $99 a year or whatever
*  it is for the truth. Wow. That's actually even amazing. Right? So the corporate truth. So when
*  you stack all that up, right? Basically legacy media has delegitimized themselves, right? Every
*  day that those quote investigative journalists don't investigate Salzburger shows that they are
*  so courageous as to investigate your boss, but not their own. Yes. Ta-da. Total mass drop,
*  right? That's like just obvious, right? Now, once you realize this and, you know, every influencer
*  who's coming up, every creator realizes, okay, well, that means I have to think about these
*  media corporations as competitors. They are competitors. They are competitors for advertisers
*  and influence. They will try basically what the media corporations did partially successfully
*  during the 2010s is they sort of had this reign of terror over many influencers where they'd give
*  them positive coverage if they supported sort of the party line and negative coverage if they
*  didn't. Okay. But now the soft power has just dropped off a cliff, right? And, you know,
*  many kinds of tactics that, you know, establishment journalists do, one way of thinking of them is
*  like as a for-profit stasi. Why? Because they may stalk you, dox you, surveil you. Like,
*  they can literally put, you know, like two dozen people following somebody around for a year,
*  and that's not considered stalking, right? That's not considered spamming. They are allowed to this
*  and make money doing this. Whereas if you so much as criticize them, oh my God, it's an attack on
*  the free press, blah, blah, blah, right? But you are the free press and I'm the free press. Like,
*  we're the free press. Again, it goes back to the decentralized, you know, that free speech is not
*  like some media corporations thing. It's everybody's right. And what actually happened
*  with social media, what they're against is not that it is an attack on democracy,
*  it's that it's the ultimate democracy because people have a voice now that didn't used to have
*  a voice. You know what I'm saying? Freedom of the press belongs to those who own one, right? That
*  old one, right? Or never argue with the man who buys ink by the barrel, right? Yeah. In a real way,
*  the entire things that were promised to people, freedom of speech, free markets,
*  like a beggars democracy, it's like, oh yeah, you can have freedom of speech, but not freedom
*  of reach because you're just talking to yourself in your living room in Buffalo, New York, right?
*  Maybe you can gather some friends around. You didn't have the licenses to get
*  like a TV broadcast license, radio license, you don't have the resources to buy a newspaper.
*  You didn't have practical reach or distribution, okay? What happened was all these people in the
*  US and around the world suddenly got voices and they were suddenly saying things that the
*  establishment didn't want them to say. And so that's what this counter-decentralization
*  has meant, both in the US and in China, this crackdown. But it's as if like a stock went up
*  like 100X and then dropped like 30%. All the deplatforming stuff, yes, it's bad, okay? It's
*  a rearward move, but in the long arc, I think we're going to have more speech. I think the
*  counter-decentralization may succeed in China, but I don't think it's going to succeed outside it
*  because you're trying to retrofit speech and thought controls onto an ostensibly free society,
*  right? Now that check got cash, people actually have a voice, it's not going to be taken away
*  from them very easily, right? So how does this relate to my advice to young kids? Once you have
*  that context, once you realize, hey, look, Apple didn't like do deals with Blackberry,
*  okay? Amazon didn't collaborate or give free content to Barnes and Noble. Netflix
*  was not going and socializing with employees of Blockbuster. These employees of establishment
*  media corporations are your competitors, okay? They are out for clicks, they are out for money,
*  they will, if they literally choke out the Ukrainians before making themselves into champions
*  of the Ukrainian cause, they'll basically do anything, you know? And so when you realize that,
*  you're like, okay, I need to build my own voice, okay? If you're Brazilian, you're Nigerian,
*  you're in the Midwest or the Middle East, right? If you're Japanese, wherever you are,
*  you need to build your own voice because outsourcing that voice to somebody else and having it put
*  through the distorting filter, which maximizes the clicks of the distorting kind of thing,
*  it's just not going to be in one's own interest. You don't have to even agree with everything I'm
*  saying or even all of it to just be like, well, look, I'd rather speak for myself. I'd rather go
*  direct if I could speak unmediated in my own words, right? Because the choice of a word is
*  actually very important, right? So that's the second big thing. And this is the thing that
*  took me a long time to understand, okay? Because I always got the importance of math and science,
*  and in fact, I would have been probably just a career academic or mathematician in another life,
*  maybe statistician, something like that, electrical engineer, et cetera. But the importance of creating
*  your own content and telling your own stories, if you don't tell your own story, the story will be
*  told for you, right? The sort of flip of winners write history is if you do not write history,
*  you will not be the winner. You must write a history, okay? As kind of a funny way of putting
*  it, right? Yeah, chicken and egg, yeah. Contrapositive, right? And now what does that
*  mean practically, okay? So in many ways, the program that I'm laying out is to build
*  alternatives, peaceful alternatives to all legacy institutions, right? To obviously to the Fed,
*  right, with Bitcoin, to Wall Street, with DeFi and with Ethereum and so on, to academia with
*  the Ledger of Record and the on-chain reproducible research that we talked about,
*  to media with decentralized social media, decentralized AI. You can melt Hollywood with
*  this, okay? Melt the RIAA, melt the MPAA. I mean, there's some good people there, but everybody
*  should have their own movies. People should be able to tell their own stories and not just wait for
*  it to be cast through Hollywood, and Hollywood's just making remakes anyway, okay? So you can tell
*  original stories and you can do so online and you can do so by hitting a key and the production
*  values will be there now that the AI content creation tools are out there. I mentioned
*  disrupting or replacing or building alternatives to the Fed, to Wall Street, to academia, to media.
*  I mentioned to Wikipedia, right? There's things like Golden, there's things like, there's a bunch
*  of Web3-ish Wikipedia competitors that are combining both AI and crypto for property rights.
*  You'll also need alternatives to all the major tech companies. That was the list that I went
*  through with decentralized search and social and messaging and operating systems and even the
*  crypto phone, okay? And then finally, you need alternatives to US political institutions and
*  more generally and Chinese political institutions. And what are those? That's where the network
*  state comes in. And the fundamental concept is if, as I mentioned, only 2% of the world can become
*  president of the United States about the number of Americans who are native born and over 35 and so
*  on and so forth, but 100% of the world can become president of their own network state. What that
*  means is, and this is kind of related to those two points, right? If you're an individual and you're
*  good at engineering and you're good at content creation, okay? Like somebody like Jack Dorsey,
*  for example, or Mark Anderson, actually a lot of the founders are actually quite good at both
*  nowadays. Look, Bezos is actually funny on Twitter when he allows himself to be. You don't become
*  a leader of that caliber without having some of both, right? If you've got some of both,
*  now no matter where you are, what your ethnicity is, what your nationality is, whether you can get
*  a US visa, you can become president of a network state. And what this is, it's a new path to
*  political power that does not require going through either the US or the Chinese establishment.
*  You don't have to wait till you're 75. You don't have to become a gerontocrat or spout the party
*  line and so on. The V1 of this is folks like Francis Suarez or Naib Bakele of El Salvador,
*  but Suarez is a great example where, while not a full sovereign or anything like that,
*  in many ways, the skills of a tech CEO where he just put up a call on Twitter and helped build
*  Miami, recruited all these people from all over. And it wasn't the two-party system, but the end
*  city system. He just helped build the city by bringing people in, okay? And when I say Suarez
*  is a V1, I love Francis Suarez. I love what they're doing. The next iteration of that is
*  to actually build the community itself rather than just kind of taking an existing Miami.
*  You're building something that is potentially the scale of Miami, but as a digital community.
*  And how many people is that? Well, the Miami population is actually not that large.
*  It's like 400-something thousand people. You could build a digital community like that.
*  So if you have the engineering and you have the content creation and you build your own distribution,
*  you own your own thing, you can become essentially a new kind of political leader
*  where you just build a large enough online community that can crowdfund territory and
*  you build your vision of the good. And anybody could build the vision of the good.
*  Talking about 8 billion people. There's no more inspiring. Sometimes when we look at how things
*  are broken, there could be a cynical paralysis, but ultimately this is a really empowering message.
*  I think there is a new birth of global freedom and that in the fullness of time, people will look at
*  the internet as being to the Americas, what the Americas were to Europe. A new world in the sense
*  of this cloud continent has just come down. If you spend 50% of your waking hours looking at a screen,
*  20%, you're spending all this time commuting up to the cloud in the morning and coming back down.
*  You're doing these day trips and it's got a different geography and all these people are
*  near each other that were far in the physical world and vice versa. And so this will, because
*  it's this new domain, it gives rise to virtual worlds that eventually become physical in the
*  same way that most people don't know this that well, but the Americas really shaped the old world.
*  Many concepts like the ultra capitalism and ultra democracy of the new world, the French
*  Revolution was in part, I mean, that was a bad version, but that was in part inspired by the
*  American. There are many, many movements that came back to the old world that started here.
*  And the same way, I don't call it the mainstream media anymore. I call it
*  the downstream media because it's downstream of the internet.
*  That's right.
*  And there's this guy a while back who he had this meme called the one kilo year American empire,
*  that everything's American and so on. And his, I think fundamental category error is he considers
*  the internet to be American. But you know why that's not the case? Because, and it'll be very
*  obviously so I think in five or 10 years. Why? Because the majority of English speakers
*  online by about 2030 are going to be Indian. Okay. They just got 5G LTE super cheap internet
*  recently, the last few years. It's like one of the biggest stories in the world that's not really
*  being told that much. Okay. And they've been lurking. And here's the thing. And this took me
*  a long time to kind of figure out, not to figure it, but to communicate. I actually realized this
*  in 2013, but these folks don't type with an accent. Okay. They speak with an accent,
*  but they don't type with an accent. And all the way back in 2013, when I taught this Coursera
*  course, I was like, who are these folks? I had hundreds of thousands of people from around the
*  world sign up. It was a very popular course even then. Okay. And hundreds of thousands of people
*  signed up. I was like, who are these folks? And there were like Polish guys and like this lady
*  from Brazil. And they knew scumbag Steve and good guy Greg, but they didn't know the Yankees or
*  hot dogs or all the offline stuff of America. They didn't know physical America. They knew
*  the digital conversation, the Reddit conversation and what became the Twitter conversation.
*  For example, I just saw this YouTube video where there's an Indian founder and he just said,
*  just casually like, oh, I slid into his DMs like this. Right. It was kind of a joke,
*  but he said it in an Indian accent and everybody laughed. Everybody knew what he meant.
*  And you're like, wait, that is a piece of what people think of as American internet slang.
*  That's actually internet slang, which will soon be said mostly by non-Americans. Now,
*  what does that mean? That means that just like the US was a branch of the UK and it started with
*  English and certainly there's lots of antecedents you can trace back to England, but nowadays,
*  most Americans are not English in ancestry. There's Germans and Italians, Jewish people,
*  African-Americans, everybody. In the same way, the internet is much more representative of the
*  world than the USA is. It may have started American, but it got forked by the rest of the
*  world. That's right. And it gives a global equality of opportunity. It's even more capitalist
*  than America's. It's even more democratic than America is, just as America is more capitalist
*  and democratic than the UK. The meme has escaped the cage of its captor.
*  By the way, that doesn't mean I'm – so I want to be very clear about something.
*  When I say this kind of stuff, people will be like, oh my God, you hate America so much.
*  And that's not at all what I'm saying. It's like, first, take Britain, okay? Would you think of the
*  US or Israel or India or Singapore as being anti-British? Not today. They're post-British,
*  right? In fact, they're quite respectful to – I mean, look at the Queen and so on. People respect
*  the UK and so everyone's coming there to pay their respects.
*  Might not be the greatest example, but yes, go on.
*  Well, put it like this. They're not burning the British flag in effigy or anything. Essentially,
*  the point is each of these societies is kind of moving along their own axis. They're not
*  defining every action in terms of whether they're pro-British or anti-British, right?
*  Once you have kind of a healthy distance, people can respect all the accomplishments of the UK,
*  while also being happy that you're no longer run by them. And then you can have a better
*  arm's length relationship, right? That's what post-British means. It is not anti-British,
*  not at all. In fact, you can respect it while also being happy that you've got your own sovereignty,
*  right? And you're happy that Britain is doing its own thing. I'm glad they're doing well, right?
*  Okay. They're actually doing some special economic zone stuff now.
*  In the same way, if you think of it as not being pro-American or anti-American,
*  because that's a with us or against us formulation of George Bush. Rather than just,
*  everything must be scored as pro-American or anti-American. You can think of post-American,
*  that not everything has to be scored on that axis. There are certain things around the world,
*  which should be able to exist on their own and you should be able to move along your own axis.
*  Perhaps an obvious example, is longevity pro-American or anti-American? No,
*  it's on its own axis. It's moving on its own axis. And new states and new countries should
*  be able to exist that do not have to define themselves as anti-American to do so. They're
*  just post-American. Friendly to, but different from. That's totally possible to do and we've
*  got examples of that, right? And so when I talk about this, I'm talking about is really in many
*  ways, US and Western ideals, but manifested in just a different form, right? And also crucially,
*  integrative of global ideals. These are in a sense, are global human rights,
*  are global values, which is freedom of speech, private property, protection from search and
*  seizure. And actually, so that's all the Bill of Rights type stuff. And I saw something that I
*  thought was really good recently. That's a good first cut. That's something that I might want to
*  include. I credit him, of course, in the V2 of the book, a digital Bill of Rights. Okay. And so this
*  was a really good, decent first cut at a digital Bill of Rights. Okay. And he talks about the right
*  to encrypt, the right to compute, the right to repair, the right to portability, right? So
*  encrypt is perhaps obvious, e-commerce and everything. Compute, like your device, it's not
*  like you can't just have somebody intercept it or shut down your floating points. That might
*  sound stupid, but in the EU, they're trying to regulate AI. And by doing that, they have
*  some regulation that says like logic is self-regulated. Did you see this?
*  No, it's hilarious.
*  But click the tweet that I sent you just before this one. Right? So I was like, you know, in woke
*  America, they're abolishing accelerated math because math is quote, white supremacist.
*  Not to be outdone, Europe seeks to regulate AI by regulating logic itself. You can't reason without
*  a license, right? Article three, for purposes of this regulation, the following definitions apply.
*  AI system is software that's developed with one or more of the techniques and approaches listed in
*  Annex 1. And you know what's in Annex 1? In Annex 1, logic and knowledge-based approaches.
*  So step away from the if statement. Okay? And the thing is, if you've dealt with these bureaucracies,
*  the stupidest possible interpretation, I mean, think about if you think, oh, no, no, that wouldn't
*  make any sense. It wouldn't do that. The entire web has been uglified by the stupid cookie thing
*  that does absolutely nothing, right? The actual way to protect privacy is with user local data,
*  meaning like decentralized systems, right? Where the private keys are local.
*  No, I'm just laughing at the layers of absurdity in this. Step away from the if statement. I mean,
*  it's hilarious. It's very, very clumsy. It's us struggling how to define the digital bill of rights,
*  I suppose, and doing it so extremely clumsily. It's funny. You know, like I heard this thing,
*  which is like, Europe's like, well, look, the US and China are way ahead of us in AI,
*  but we're going to be a leader in AI regulation. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And something we haven't
*  mentioned much of in this whole conversation, I think, may be implied between the lines is
*  the thing that was in the constitution of the pursuit and happiness. And the thing that is in
*  many stories that we humans conjure up, which is love. I think the thing that makes life worth
*  living in many ways. But for that, you have to have freedom. You have to have stability. You have
*  to have a society that's functioning so that humans can do what humans do, which is make friends,
*  make family, make love, make beautiful things together as human beings.
*  Balaji, this is like an incredible conversation. Thank you for showing an amazing future.
*  I think really empowering to people because we can all be part of creating that future.
*  And thank you so much for talking to me today. This was an incredible, obviously the longest
*  conversation I've ever done, but also one of the most amazing and enlightening. Thank you.
*  Thank you, brother, for everything you do. Thank you for inspiring all of us.
*  Well, Lex, this was great. And we didn't get through all the questions.
*  We didn't. Just for the record, we didn't get, I would venture to say we didn't get through 50%.
*  This is great. This is great. And I had to stop us from going too deep on any one thing,
*  even though it was tempting. Like those chocolates, those damn delicious looking chocolates
*  that was used as a metaphor about 13 hours ago, however long we started the conversation.
*  This was incredible. It was really brilliant. You're brilliant throughout
