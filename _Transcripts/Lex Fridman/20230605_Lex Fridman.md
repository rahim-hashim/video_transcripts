# Bert Kreischer: Comedy, Drinking, Rogan, Segura, Churchill & Kim Jong Un | Lex Fridman Podcast #382
**Lex Fridman:** [June 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TmV6KEYkK0)
*  You know who drank? It's Churchill. That's my, hold on, that's my guy.
*  Yeah. You know that's my guy, right? So he, uh, he did champagne.
*  You don't have to tell me a thing about Winston Churchill. He, I found out about his daily
*  routine. Yeah. So his daily routine was a big breakfast, cigar, coffee, eggs, sunny side up,
*  toast, bacon, sausage, tomato, beans, uh, fruit, orange juice, soft scotch, cigar in bed. And he
*  sit there for three hours and then he'd get in the bathtub and drink champagne. And then he'd go to
*  lunch and have some goose with more champagne. And then he'd take a nap. And like, I love that. So
*  every year on the day of his death, and he's January 24th, I celebrate Winston Churchill's
*  life by living the way he did. And so I have breakfast in bed with a soft scotch and I just
*  party all day. That would be the guy to drink with. The following is a conversation with Bird
*  Kreischer, a standup comedian, podcaster, actor, and a man they call the Machine.
*  I've been a fan of his comedy and podcasts for many years, and I highly recommend you watch him
*  on Birdcast, Two Bears, One Cave with Tom Segura, his cooking show called Something Is Burning,
*  and finally the new movie that tells the story of the man, the legend, the machine.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast. Disappointed? Please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Bird Kreischer.
*  Yeah. Sun also rises. And they're like, no, the sun also rises. And I went, oh,
*  oh yeah, that is fucking badass. Yeah. And then I'm like always late to the party with anything.
*  And then that night we were all doing Coke. And it was like five in the morning and we ended up
*  on the roof of my apartment in Greenwich Village. And it's like, I'm a sunset guy, I grew up in
*  Florida, but sunrises in New York are electric blue, like electric blue. And I was like,
*  the sun also rises. Yeah. He was so good with just a handful of words, the simplicity,
*  the choice of words, like basically his process is carving down. Right drunk, edit, sober. Right
*  drunk, edit, sober. Yeah. But he was good at like, at like a small amount of words to get a point
*  across. I'm the exact fucking opposite. Well, he's also said the first draft of anything's always
*  shit. Is that, is that true for you? I think so. It's the best one I have. It goes downhill from
*  there. So for you, editing is destroying the original genius. The first time I tell it,
*  the first time I tell it, it's perfect. It's perfect. It just, it works. And then I go great.
*  And then I take it and I try to fix it and make it better and jazzier. I just joke and razzle dazzle
*  about my daughters and I drive them past a deaf child sign. And I just told it on stage. It just
*  happened. And Louis was in the audience. He was, I love that joke. I said, really? He was, yeah.
*  And I just told it and I went, done. Louis CK says he likes a joke. It's fucking, it's in the special.
*  And I tried to fucking razzle dazzle that joke into like a 15 minute bit. It got to the point
*  where it was so obnoxious. It was so bad that I told him, I did a podcast with him. I said,
*  what did you like about that joke? Cause I can't get it to work anymore. Cause it was just simple.
*  It was simple that your daughter didn't know how they figure out where deaf kids lived.
*  And what? That's it? He's like, yeah. I was like, nothing about gun control. And he was like, huh?
*  I was like, oh fuck man. I really fucked that joke up. And then I had to, I had to go back to
*  the beginning of it. But that first time that's when, that's when the joke comes out purest for me.
*  And then it's always chasing back to get that, get that first telling. Some jokes are different.
*  Like the machine, obviously there's a much longer story and like, and like escape room for this one.
*  The longer stories take a little work, but the simple ones, like, like the deaf child in pajamas
*  and those first times are perfect. What do you think is, is it about the machine story that works
*  that was so captivating for people?
*  I think it's a, I think, I don't know. I really wish I, I don't know. I think it's a good story.
*  I think it's a good story. I think everyone has something similar that happened in their life
*  where they had a crazy night and that no one believed and they told their friends and their
*  friends and, and, and, or they experienced that with a friend like that. And, and, and I think,
*  I think that's gotta be it. I really don't know. I think there's a part of, I think there's a part
*  of the, like our community of, of comedy fans that were that early desk squad that was fun to watch
*  someone take something from the podcast and turn it into a bit on stage. I think there was a lot
*  of that, but I think people identify with a wild, crazy night that got out of control that
*  they've probably had too. I think I don't fucking know.
*  Do you think Putin knows who you are because of that story?
*  I hope so. I fucking hope so. I hope so. But there's, there's a part of me that,
*  that you gotta understand is like, I'm not, I say stuff like that. I'm sure there's someone
*  hears that and they go, who is this fucking narcissist? You're like, no, that's not it.
*  I'm just telling you the truth. Like, I understand what I'm supposed to say. Well, you know, I don't
*  know. I, you know, I, I don't know. That's hard to say, but I don't fucking give a shit about that
*  guy. I'm not that guy. I'm telling you everything that comes out of my mouth. The second it comes
*  out, I'm going to be a hundred percent honest. I don't know any other way to live. I kind of hope
*  so. That would be fucking cool. And I look, I know he's a bad, I guess he's a bad dude. I don't follow
*  politics done, but it'd be cool if like one day someone's like, uh, he's, he's on his computer and
*  somebody goes, and he's like, yeah, yeah. And he's like, and he's like, and it shows it to him. And,
*  and he's like, and it shows it to him. And, and then he's like,
*  fucking this guy, huh? It's not out of the realm of possibility that Putin has watched it. I mean,
*  this podcast, this has kind of made me realize how like small the world is. I've gotten to me some
*  incredibly like, especially the people you've had, like that's, I mean, that's the thing where I go.
*  It's gotten really crazy. The internet's really insane and Netflix is really insane. And the
*  reach of like people that like, this is really simple, but like, I'm a big fan of the show,
*  drink champs. I didn't think in a million years nor would ever know who I was. And then he offered
*  me to come to his podcast. And then when I got there, he told me he was a fan of mine. And I went
*  like, I remember moving to New York, listening to you and Capone, like I'm sitting there going,
*  wow. Like, and, and then, and the phone calls I've gotten since the movie came out and, uh,
*  since razzle dazzle came out have been really insane. When you realize
*  as much as I know about people and I like, there's people I'm fans of that don't know who I am,
*  that are like, they're like some pitcher in Florida that I follow the kids. I like,
*  I was fun to watch him pitch. There was a softball player in Tempe that she's do catching drills.
*  And I was really in the softball with my daughter and we watched her catching girls.
*  There's a girl deglaze or who me and my daughters will watch her dance videos. And then I hit her
*  up. She's like, you know who I am. And you're like, Oh yeah, that's the way the world works.
*  Uh, what world leader would you drink with? If you could see Russian Putin.
*  So Putin doesn't drink much. Zalensky drinks more. But also not much.
*  Boris Yeltsin would have been a good one. He would have been a good one. I mean, like I go,
*  Hitler was a pussy. Like he drank wine with a, with a cup, with a spoonful of sugar in it.
*  You know, the drink was Churchill. That's my, hold on. That's my guy.
*  Yeah. You know, that's my guy, right? No, I don't know. That's a guy.
*  So he, uh, he did champagne. You don't have to tell me a thing about Winston Churchill.
*  He, I found out about his daily routine. Yeah. So his daily routine was a big breakfast,
*  cigar, coffee, eggs ovary, eggs, sunny side up toast, bacon, sausage, tomato, beans, uh, fruit,
*  orange juice, soft scotch, cigar in bed. And he'd sit there for three hours and he'd hold morning
*  breakfast and that's, they'd come in and he'd run through his day. And then he'd get in the bathtub
*  for fucking an hour and drink champagne. And then he'd go to lunch and have some goose or whatever
*  the fuck they ate back then with more champagne. And then, and then, and then, I mean, and then
*  he'd take a nap and like, I love that. So every year on hit the day of his death and he's January
*  24th, I celebrate Winston Churchill's life by living the way he did. And so I have breakfast
*  in bed with a soft scotch and I just party all fucking day. That would be the guy to drink with.
*  That would be the guy if you could pick anyone to drink with. He drank every day throughout the day.
*  He lived like 94. And was one of the most heroic figures in human history. Never, never surrender.
*  I mean- What a fucking badass thing. You know, he taught, he taught the queen, the queen was like,
*  like a window licking idiot, right? Like she was, she had a third grade education. So like,
*  her dad dies and she's like 10 or 12 or whatever. The first thing they do is they pull her out of
*  school. They're like, you're done learning. You're just going to be the queen. You're going to know,
*  this is what you need to learn. Don't make, let people make eye contact with you. Put your hand
*  out like this. Don't let people touch you. So she like, she had like a really, I saw the, by the way,
*  I didn't do this research. I just watched the crown. Okay. And Winston Churchill kind of taught
*  her about world politics and was that they like coming and she'd be like, Winston, what did we do
*  in Africa? And he's like, this is going to be a tough one. And so, yeah. So, but Winston Churchill's
*  the badass. But if I had to drink with someone living, like drink, there's like, there's a too
*  obvious one. Like obviously it's fucking Kim Jong-un, right? You kind of want to- He drinks. No, he does.
*  You think my IVs are good in the morning? You know, Kim Jong-un's IVs are next. You're like,
*  I feel up. And he's like, it's unfit. I mean, he would be a badass to drink with. I think he drinks
*  hard liquor. I think it's Scotch, Johnny Walker blue. That's what I've heard. I don't know where
*  you heard this, but I like this. Okay. So I say things like that, but then I'm sure I, I, I, I,
*  I don't know if you ever party with someone who just parties a little different than you. And then
*  you notice like, like sometimes celebrities, like athletes, and then like you're at a strip club and
*  then they, they talk weird to a woman. You're like, oh, that's not me. I'm so sorry. So that'd be the
*  thing. The atrocities would be hard to get past with him. Not just the atrocities, but the way of
*  being. I agree with you. I actually don't like drinking with rich and powerful people often.
*  There's something weird about them. Yeah. Not, not all of them. And I don't like, I don't like a
*  drinking meeting. Like when someone goes- What's drinking meeting? Like, like- What's that?
*  Then people go like, Hey, uh, I'm taking you out tonight. We're drinking. Yeah. And then I go, oh,
*  that's not the way I like to do it. It gives me anxiety. Like, um, our lives are very different.
*  You and I? Yeah. Were you in a fraternity? No. We could start there. No, I was not.
*  And the differences continue from there, I'm sure. So when you get your pledge of pen,
*  they take you out and their whole thing is you're going to, we're getting you fucked up.
*  That energy is not my energy. I don't like that. Like it's, I just go, why don't we just get drunk
*  and feel really good about ourselves? Like I never liked took mushrooms to see Jesus. I just
*  wanted to enjoy a rain X on a windshield. Like, so like that, that for me, uh, is like one of my
*  things. So if, if Kim Jong-un flew me to North Korea to drink with him, I'd be like, I'd have
*  to start really getting blackout drunk on the plane to enjoy drinking with him that day.
*  What's your favorite, like different occasions, what's your favorite drink? What's your favorite
*  way of drinking? It's, it's, I've got, it varies. So what are the different contexts here? It's like
*  one-on-one. One-on-one? Like you sit down with, I don't know,
*  Rogan invites you like it's a Godfather to sit down and finally have a talk about something.
*  It's going to be whiskey. It's going to be like a nice whiskey. Neat. No, I like it on the rocks.
*  I like lots of rocks. It won't be something expensive because Rogan is not, he's not a fancy
*  boy. You know, like he's a real regular, he's a really regular dude. He's gotten less regular,
*  the more millions of dollars he has. There's parts of him where you're like, like where you're like,
*  oh wow, we can do this. Um, but he's a, he'd be like Jack on the rocks or like Buffalo Trace or
*  one of the, maybe a little whiskey he's buying Rogan be a whiskey rocks. And then like, that's
*  a good, I haven't hung out with Joe by ourselves. I take that back. I was with him the other night,
*  but like, I would be cool. My times with Joe's are always on podcasts. Yeah. And his, I missed
*  the times where it was, where you just have you and him at a, at a, at the store late night.
*  Yeah. I I'm okay with podcasts. Like I used to think this is like a performative or something
*  like this, but it's not really, it's just a chance to really sit down. I enjoy it because of the
*  people I could never sit down with. Like David Cross. I wouldn't never sit down with David Cross
*  because we don't run in the same circles and, but it's nice. He has something to promote. And
*  then he comes to my house and then we can sit down for an hour and talk. And then I, and then
*  or Kevin Smith, like people I would never really hang out with Tom. I enjoy being alone with Tom
*  more off Mike. Yeah. We have a lot of history. There's a lot of things, secrets we know about
*  each other. And there's a lot of secrets going on in our, each other's lives that I would never
*  share on podcasts that I, that I can talk to him about. And I really appreciate his,
*  and I know this isn't on brand of us beating each other up, but like I really appreciate his insight
*  as a, as a dad and as a dude and as a son, but, but he makes me giggle harder than anyone. So
*  doing a podcast is fun. So there's something on a podcast that's performative for you with him.
*  And then there's a part- With me and him, cause we're trying to make each other laugh,
*  but I'll tell you, if we're going back to drinks, I'll tell you like a great,
*  a great afternoon drink is a Campari spritz. That's my, one of my favorite drinks in the world.
*  I don't even know what that is. Campari spritz. Campari is an interesting alcohol
*  because I think it's a bitter or it's a liqueur and it's got a weird rooty, earthy taste. It's
*  red. So it looks like Kool-Aid. That's why I got into it. I thought Campari on ice would be oh,
*  so nice as an old commercial, but man, it's fucking like sucking the green giants. Dick.
*  It is earthy. What's earthy? It's like, it's, it tastes like roots. It's, it's not, it's not,
*  it's there's a bitterness and like a, it's just not great. And then someone introduced me to
*  a Negroni, which is Campari and gin and a little soda water. And then Campari spritz,
*  Campari spritz is Campari, Prosecco and soda water in like a wine glass. And it is
*  so enjoyable. It's got so many different profiles to it where you get the bitterness,
*  but the sweetness of the Prosecco and then it flattens it out with the soda water and it looks
*  like Kool-Aid. So I love it. That's one of my favorite drinks. To share in what context? Oh,
*  you're in Italy and you've been walking around Venice and everyone went their own ways. And the
*  whole family comes back together and you meet at a statue and, and your wife's sweating and she's
*  uncomfortable and your daughters are 16 and 18 and they're like, what are we going to, what are
*  we doing with the rest of the day? And you go, Hey guys, it's Europe. Does anyone want to Campari
*  spritz? And everyone goes, I don't know what that is. And you go for Campari spritz. Now it's,
*  it's a minor in alcohol, so it's not going to light them up, but it gives them a little bit of
*  a buzz where they're like, dad, these are nice. Isla didn't drink hers. So I drank hers. Georgia
*  had hers. Leanne had hers and we ordered another round. I ordered an, and they're
*  fucking refreshing and the buzz is perfect. It's not too much because it's just a little bit of
*  champagne. It's some Campari. If the buzz is perfect and then a couple of them, and then they
*  kind of disappear and then you just walking around again. That's a great fucking drink.
*  You ever drink alone? So there's a two kinds of alone. One is alone, like at a bar.
*  There's other people, but they're strangers, right? They're kind of like out there.
*  Keep going. Walk me through all the alone and then I'll tell you the rest.
*  There's all kinds of, there's a alone on a train. We're transporting.
*  I've dragged him alone on a train. And then there's just alone in an empty home.
*  Or a hotel room. Hotel. And it's Sunday night and you're packing your bag and you got a flight at
*  6 AM. But road house is on and you're like, shit. So you get out of the front desk and go,
*  is the bar still open? And they go, yeah, can I order some to take to my room? Sure. How about
*  six Heineken's? Six Heineken's? Yeah, my wife wanted one too. She's not up there.
*  You murdered her. And you just say to yourself, I'm just getting six so that if I have four,
*  I just know I have two extra ones. And then you go through six and you're like, oh man,
*  I'm not done yet. Dude, I've drank in every alone scenario you can possibly think of.
*  I've drank alone in a helicopter with a dude who didn't know I was drinking. I was like,
*  can I drink in here? And he was like, absolutely not. And then I poured it into a flask and opened
*  it and drank it. And he's like, dude, we're in a fucking helicopter. You don't think I smell that?
*  The best alone drinking you can ever do, in my opinion, now we're getting to the weeds on it,
*  is alone behind someone's back. What do you mean? Like when they don't know you're drinking,
*  but you're drinking. Like Christmas shopping. And your wife says, all right, let's all split up.
*  And you go, cool. And it's like 11 o'clock on a Sunday and they just opened that bar by the
*  elevator in the Beverly center. And you just sneak over and you go, hey man, can I get a double
*  jack on the rocks, ox rots? And they're like, sure. And you just have it and you just go,
*  let's just, and then you're off. And then you're like, yeah. And then you just little sneak one,
*  sneak it, sneak it. And then you're buzzed and nobody knows. And then your wife's like,
*  have you been drinking? You're like, yeah, I'm drinking by myself in a fucking mall
*  on Christmas. How sad do you think I am? And then you go, yeah, I am.
*  Uh, what about mood? Do you ever drink in a dark place?
*  So I broke, I had a chick break up or a chick cheat on me. Uh, when I was, when I came back
*  from Russia and she sought my, my best friend and I didn't know how to deal with the emotions I had.
*  And my buddy, Mike Osborne said, I can tell you this, if you drink, they go away. And I went,
*  okay. And that was the first and kind of last time I ever did that because I did it. I've done it.
*  I've done it a couple of times, but I try to avoid, I try to avoid if there's emotion going
*  to alcohol, like meaning I'd not want to say anxiety, but like depression, I kind of sit in
*  the depression because or anxiety, I lean towards alcohol, like anxiety, like about flying or, or,
*  or just like getting worked up on over something. But with depression, I try to avoid alcohol and
*  just sit in it. Um, cause I, I, because I've gone there before, but anxiety is up. I land,
*  I land all the time. But depression, heartbreak, all that, you just sit in the feeling.
*  Yeah. Heartbreak is a weird one for me. So like the last time I got my heart broken,
*  Leanne dumped me. Um, we were dating for like four months and she broke up with me.
*  And my instinct was to have a drink. My friends went to this, uh, this, uh,
*  Middle Eastern restaurant and I told him what was going on. And my buddy, Cora's like, let's
*  get a cocktail. And I was like, I don't want one. I got to figure this out because I want this chick.
*  And if I start drinking, I'll be like, ah, fuck it. So I got to figure it out. Like I wonder,
*  I'm going to find out my dad dies one day or my mom, but my dad will be the rough one. My mom
*  will be equally as rough. My dad and I were really close. And I wonder if I've thought about this a
*  lot, if I'll have a drink dealing with that. Like I think about that a lot. I keep saying,
*  everything I get with my dad is extra. My dad, my dad had a a hundred percent blockage in his
*  widow maker twice and both times they saved his life. And he got a stint, I think 12 or 13 years
*  ago. And then he just got a stint this last year. But so I, everything I get to do, I feel like is
*  extra. And so, you know, he was just at the premiere of my movie and he got to see that.
*  And he had a very emotional response. And I got, I got that from him. And I was like that, that's
*  little icing on the cake. I did, you know, the arena in Tampa was the first time he ever saw me
*  do standup. That was like a little extra. So all these things I'm getting with him are all extra.
*  So I have, you know, at least 74. So yeah, that'll be a tough one.
*  RG Well at the premiere, he was what, proud?
*  KS Yeah, he came out, he was sobbing, crying. And he goes, I've underestimated you your whole life.
*  And I was like, what? And he was like, and he just, and he was shaking. He goes, I just
*  underestimated you. I didn't know. I didn't know you were this, I didn't do whatever. It was really
*  hard to understand him to be honest with you. I don't know totally what he said. He might've
*  just not liked the movie. RG I think you were hearing what you wanted to hear. What did you
*  learn about life from your father? KS It's not going to make sense. I want to feel like sometimes
*  I'm like a professional fucking wrestler. Because all I care about is you come and see me do standup.
*  So whatever I got to do to get you there. But the number one thing, my one takeaway from that man's
*  humility, and I applied, I've applied it in different ways throughout my career. On my 26th birthday,
*  he gave me a really aggressive speech. He, I was hungover and I just thought he was going to say,
*  happy birthday. So I picked up the phone and I was like, Hey, and he was like, you are a tremendous
*  piece of shit. And then he broke me off. You have no humility. You have no this, you have never
*  succeeded at anything. You're, you're, you're lying to yourself. You're lying to everyone around you.
*  You're not doing what you're going after your dream. I broke you. I failed you as a father,
*  this and that. I was like, I thought you're going to wish me happy birthday. And so in that speech,
*  he told me if I wanted something, I had to go at it and I had to go after it as hard as I could.
*  And I had to do whatever it could. I could do to achieve that. In this case, it was working,
*  offering to do anything at the comedy club to get on stage. He told me, I told him,
*  that's not how it works. And he said, no, that's how it works for some poor kid from Harlem.
*  Because that kid needs it. He goes, you've grown up with privilege your whole life. You don't need it.
*  You think you're going to be fine. And so I went and I ended up getting a job at the door, but I,
*  it was, it was, it was, it's humbling. It's really like, it's, it's makes me feel,
*  it made me feel uncomfortable. And so that humility is, it's the first time I really
*  understood humility. And I've applied that in many respects in like, in like getting to be a paid
*  regular at the comedy store that happened late in life for me, which I think most people would give
*  up and be like, fuck that. I'm already a touring comic. I'm on TV. I don't need that. But it's
*  something I wanted and I knew I wanted. So I just humbly went after it. And then I think I
*  still apply it when it comes to selling tickets or selling a project to the fans
*  or even to doing podcasts. I try to be as honest as I can about whatever I'm going through or
*  whatever I'm dealing with. But when it comes to like selling things, I don't have, I don't have a
*  problem trying to make fun of myself or get in front of people so that they know that I have a
*  show. Cause the thing I'm good at, the one thing I know I'm good at stand up. And I say that humbly,
*  but like, I want them to come there. So like I've heard people make fun of me like before. They're
*  like, yeah, I'm not some, I'm not some clown in a speedo who's one is going to, I'm a real comic.
*  And I go, okay. But I want them to have my shows and you can be that guy and I'll be this guy.
*  Yeah. The clown in the speedo.
*  Yeah. It's like, what are you going to do? Funny people make fun of me for taking my shirt off.
*  Like I guess behind my back, no one ever does it to me. Like no one would ever,
*  comics aren't that manly.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  But I always go like, what do you care? What do you care?
*  And you love taking shirt off more than anything.
*  You know, when something becomes meme and becomes super popular, it, it becomes easy to not love the
*  thing anymore to get tired of it. You still love it. Well, more than anything. I like being shirtless
*  more than having a shirt. I'm very uncomfortable in a shirt. Yeah. Like right now. And I've tactile
*  issues. Like I have legit tactile issues. I'm most comfortable in stretchy jeans with a loose
*  fitting belt and then these shirts exactly. But I don't, I like more like a V neck. I can feel this
*  on my neck right now. I can feel it on my arms. And so I'm, I'll sit a certain way because it,
*  it just rubs me wrong. But yeah, I'm more comfortable shirtless. I can never wear what you're wearing.
*  Uh, yeah. Well, this is my shirtless. Each of us have to find our place in this world in terms
*  of fashion. I would love to be able to wear what you wear. Yeah. Cause it looks good.
*  It feels like an escape from convention.
*  What you or me? Both of us. Yeah. Cause this, nobody wears this
*  unless you work security for somebody. Yeah. But it looks good on you. Does it? I don't know.
*  You know, I think people think, I don't know, like they would say, like, what, what if you lose weight,
*  you can't take your shirt off anymore. Go, no, I can take my shirt off. If I can out of your mind,
*  I'm gonna take my shirt off all the time. Uh, you mentioned, uh, early on heartbreak after the Russia
*  trip with a girl who slept with your friend. Um, let's go back to Hemingway quotes. The best way
*  to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them. So to go all in with the trust.
*  I love Hemingway so much. Um, have you been betrayed in your life? Yeah. What do you think
*  about trust? That's an interesting question. Um, I've been betrayed in my professional life
*  a couple of times by really close friends. And, uh, I'm not someone who can't, like I have a
*  mantra that, I mean, I'm, I don't know if people have heard it or not. And I hate, I hate sharing
*  it, but it's, but it's true. The mantra is, so you think I'm weak. Like, do you think it's like,
*  that's my thing. Cause I feel like people take advantage of me and I go, so you think I'm weak.
*  You forget everyone that like the, and I'm named the, the people that have betrayed me.
*  I'm a larger man than all of them. And, and, but I, and so that's what really fucks with me is I go,
*  so you think I'm weak. Like where I grew up, when you do stuff, there was physical consequences.
*  I grew up in Florida. Like I've been beaten up a bunch. I'm not saying I can fight, but like,
*  I'm not scared of getting beaten up. And the, the times that I've been betrayed and, and,
*  and even, I know even like by Ari, whichever, let people see that drugging as a betrayal.
*  And I did for a period, but it was, it was only because it was Ari and he was my, one of my best
*  friends and me and him had to work through that. Cause I, I couldn't not love him. Like I couldn't
*  not have him in my life. He meant, he means a lot to me. He really does. He's a great friend to have,
*  but he's also, I don't know what was going on with him at that time, but he made a bad decision and I
*  had to forgive him for that because I knew he, he knew my mantra. I think I'm harder to trust
*  people now. I'm not as apt to trust people at all, but there was a moment, I don't know if I've ever
*  shared this and I don't know how this will sound, but there was a moment that information got leaked
*  about a thing and all my managers and agents, both, both Tom and my Tom and our managers and agents
*  would like to separate, either separate us or one of us, one of them get both of us. It's just more
*  lucrative for them. So they have always kind of pitted us against each other a little bit and they
*  do it subtly. They'll do it to me and my team, and then his team will do it to me. And then my team
*  will do it to him and his team will do it to him. And there was a moment where information got leaked
*  about this thing I was doing. And my team was like, just so you know, your, your boy Tommy
*  is, is the rat. And I had to, it was the one time and Leanne said, do you think Tom would do that?
*  I said, I don't know how faith works. Like I'm not a super religious person, but I will tell you that
*  I believe in Tom and I don't think he did it. And I will stand by that ignorantly. And, and I will,
*  and I will ride or die with him because I cannot live in a world where I don't trust him.
*  Yeah.
*  If I don't trust him, then I am so fucked. And, and it wasn't him. It wasn't him. And it was,
*  it's a cool feeling to know that you could like, that you could blindly trust someone,
*  blindly have faith in someone, know that they're, they have your best interest at heart.
*  But yeah, it took me a while to get there. Rogan helped me get there because I wasn't trusting him
*  or Joey or Tommy or anyone. I wasn't trusting anyone. I'd gotten in a bad thing and I just
*  wasn't trusting anybody. And Rogan was like, yo man, we're trying to be your fucking friend.
*  And I was like, yeah, I don't, I don't need friends. I couldn't understand what,
*  why Rogan was interested in me. And I said to like someone, I was like, is he gay? Like,
*  what the fuck? And then he was just a nice guy. He was just a nice guy.
*  It'd be hilarious if Joe was sexually attracted to this whole time. This whole time is the reason
*  he keeps inviting you back. I would be more excited. I would be more excited
*  if just, if he tried to kiss me on the lips once just in just like in a Scotty, Scotty J way from
*  boogie nights where he's like, what do you like my car? Yeah. You know, nobody would believe that
*  story. No one. Yeah. If I was Joe, I would kiss dudes all the time. And then, and then when they
*  didn't kiss back, oh, you know, I don't know. No one will ever believe you. Yeah. Well, when you
*  trust people like that and they fuck you over, that can really, really, really hurt.
*  You end up on a treadmill in a hotel room, fighting with them. You fight with them all
*  the time. You fight with them all the time. You fight with them constantly. And it's, and I,
*  and I have this thing like, where I can ruminate on an idea and I can't get it out of my head.
*  And I hear the words they say and I, and I, and. So all in your head on a treadmill in your head,
*  just fighting, just fighting and then. Yeah. And then one day you get past it.
*  Like one day you just go, eh, fuck them. I'm not going to give them real estate. And then you just
*  forget about them. And then they reach out and they'll try to be a Dick or a bully because they're
*  bullies. They're bullies is what they are. Don't ever forget it. They're fucking bullies and they
*  got bullied. It's not their fault. They got bullied. And then they try to bully you and you're,
*  and you don't have any connection anymore. And you're like, oh, you can go fuck yourself.
*  You can actually go fuck yourself. You're not my boss. You're not my wife. You don't fuck me.
*  Don't pay me. Get the fuck out of my life. But this kind of mantra of the, you're not weak.
*  You still want to be able to be fragile to the world and appear weak almost.
*  Why am I am. I mean, that's the problem is I think I am pretty fucking weak. Like I'm not the
*  strongest dude out there. I have really thin skin. I get my feelings hurt all the time. And so, but
*  like, but it sucks when you watch like your friend see something in you that you go,
*  or they go, fuck him. He's not paying attention. Fuck him. Let's just fuck him. Let's take his
*  money. You know, fuck him. He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. Look at me. He's a drunk
*  alcoholic. And you go, Oh no, bitch, I pay attention. Like I'm wide awake. I'm here. I'm
*  working my ass off. You're not going to fucking. Well, that's the tough thing about like you and
*  Tom Segura. You're at the top of your game on top of the world. Some of the most famous comics in
*  the world. And you could see money start to creep in like a business decisions. Yeah.
*  I don't know. It's a tough, it's a tough place. It's really tough. It's really tough. You know,
*  especially as we're growing and, and uh, I'll tell you what it, I don't know how much I'm allowed to
*  say, but I can tell you this. We had a business deal where feelings were getting involved and
*  money was involved in that. And the money was causing the feelings. And one of us said to the
*  other person, our feelings are more important than the money. So let's just split the money.
*  And it was, and it was, and it was, and, and it was, it was really like a solid moment where I,
*  where both of us were like, that is how we should run this. Yeah. That's the interesting
*  things that like with bands, you'll have like popular bands that split and even, even though
*  it's clear that the contribution is not even it's like, uh, there's a front man and all that kind of
*  stuff, but it's ultimately the right thing to do to say, fuck you to the money for the most part
*  and prioritize the feelings. Yeah. Especially because like, I couldn't do it without him.
*  He couldn't do it without me. We do it separately. We'll have guest bears on. Some will blow up.
*  Some won't. You can never figure it out, but when we're together, it does well. And so we need each
*  other for it to work. And we've, you know, like I said, we're on a handshake deal with two bears
*  and no one likes that, but we're like, Hey, I mean, we, I don't like to the point where I like,
*  he'll call me and go, yo, we have a deal to do this for X amount. Are you in? And I go, yeah,
*  I will check the books. I don't need to. I don't, I don't, I know him. I just know him.
*  Yeah. What do you love most about Tom Segura?
*  We saw a gay couple one time. It was a good start. And there was one guy was in khakis and one guy
*  was in jean shorts with a Python around his neck. And Tom goes, if we were gay, which one would you
*  be? I said, I'm fucking Python. And he was like, yeah, I'm khaki. And I go, really? And he goes,
*  yeah, that's why we work. And he goes, all relationships are for pythons and khakis.
*  And I went, really? And he goes, look at you and Leanne, who do you think you are? I go,
*  Python. And he goes, she's khaki. And he goes, me and push. I go, oh, she's Python. He goes,
*  and I'm khaki. He goes, I'll always be khaki. And sometimes I'll have a relationship around the
*  Python, but it's, I'm usually a khaki. And I was like, yeah, I am a little bit of a lunatic.
*  I'll tell you the one of the moment that explains me and him that the world will never see. It was
*  just a great moment. We got stem cells with Rogan one weekend and one day, and I'd had surgery in my
*  arm and I didn't want to do it. I was terrified. And Tom just said, just come out and meet up with
*  us. Tom knew he was going to make me get them. And so I got them and he, you know, Joe's there.
*  And so we're just all talking. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And Tom can see that I'm spinning out a
*  little bit and I get in the car and you know, Tom's got a Porsche. So we're like right next to each
*  other. And I just want to feel if it's swollen and it is a little swollen because I just got an
*  injection. And then, and Tom's driving and he's got his hand on the thing. He just puts his hand
*  on my arm and he goes, you're okay. He just, he was watching. He knows me so well that he knows
*  that I'm spinning out of control. He's like, you're okay. And then I was like, and I felt okay. I was
*  like, you're right. I'm okay. What the fuck am I doing? My brain's that brain.
*  Man, that guy got so much love in him. Dude, he does. He has, you know,
*  he had a fantastic relationship with his dad. And, and, and I think whatever that did,
*  that dude did to create that dude, he hit it out of the fucking park. Cause he has so much
*  love that he doesn't need reciprocated like at all. Like he can just love. And then he feels good for
*  him to give and to like take care of someone. And like, you know, he started the whole birthday
*  gift thing. Cause and he didn't need to, he just was like, Hey man, I had this bike. I thought
*  you'd like it. And then of course I've turned it into a fucking bit. And now we're upside down,
*  120 upside down on a fucking race car that we can't make our money back on.
*  Oh, that dude, I could go on and on about Joe Rogan. Joe Rogan is the most selfless individual
*  I've ever met. He doesn't care if he has you on the podcast. He wants you to be the funniest
*  person in the room. He wants you to be the smartest person in the room. Let me tell you something.
*  Joe Rogan is 10 times smarter and funnier than me. He's a fucking smart guy. He's a fucking
*  smart guy. He's the smartest person in the room. Let me tell you something. Joe Rogan is 10 times
*  smarter and funnier than me. He wants you to shine. He wants you, he wants to put you over to his
*  fans. He, that shit did not exist before he started doing his podcast. People didn't share
*  you with their fans. No one was like, Hey man, come on on the road with me. They brought you on
*  the road because they wanted you to suck and they put you in bad scenarios. Joe Rogan wanted you to
*  shine. He gave, he gave so many people beautiful career, gave them careers, gave them. Joe could
*  have looked at his podcast as his thing. This is my thing. I bring on these guys. I'm going to be
*  the funniest guy in the fucking room. I know some guys that have done that. It might be me. It might
*  be time I talk over people and not listen really well. Joe had did the opposite. Now I look, I've
*  tried to learn from Joe on my podcast and do the same. That guy, when you think about it, you name
*  10 of his friends. I bet eight of them are doing arenas right now. They're all doing theaters. All
*  his friends do theaters. All his friends do theaters. He is, he is just, you know, I, I, he,
*  and he won't accept this compliment. I tried paying it to him in, in Austin when I was in Austin last
*  night. He's not good at accepting compliments. I gave him a gift too. And I said, Hey, I need,
*  I need to show you. I can't just tell you this because it's going to fall in deaf ears. I need
*  to give you a minute. So you have something. So, you know that I think about you and I'm grateful
*  for having you in my life a lot for many reasons. I have more friends in my life because of you.
*  He taught me how to trust people. Again, I have a career because of you have a major motion picture
*  because of you. I do arenas because of you without you in my life. A lot of these things maybe never
*  would have happened. I never would have told the machine on stage. I wouldn't have gotten, I would
*  have never started a podcast. I wouldn't have three podcasts. Like, I mean, all these things are,
*  are things he not just, he didn't just take me to the water one time and give me a drink. He,
*  he gave me a machete and he said, this is how I get to the water. You gotta put your own path,
*  but just give me a heads up. You can also use my path whenever you want. I mean, he, he is the most
*  selfless individual. He will go down in history as one of the 10 most important people in standup
*  comedy without a doubt. He changed the game. It didn't exist like this before him. And,
*  and he won't accept that compliment. What was the gift you gave him? I can't tell you. Is it a dildo?
*  It was a dildo. It was a double sided dildo. I go, Hey, when you get free time, can we
*  scissor fuck each other? You're happily married for 19 years. So I think you're a good man to ask,
*  how do you find love? How do you find, how do you date in order to find a love of your life,
*  of a lifetime? This is going to sound off, but don't, don't tie yourself down. Meaning like,
*  don't spend time fucking with those little mini shrimp and peeling them every night.
*  When you know you're looking for a lobster. Yeah. Like, and so I think what happens with a
*  lot of guys, they just, they're so busy and like just getting pussy and going from here to here to
*  here. I was never that guy. I always wanted, I always wanted to find someone who understood me.
*  I always wanted that. And so, you know, granted, I haven't had sex with a lot of chicks, but that's,
*  and it's, and it's not by choice. I'm saying like, maybe there was times I would have done it, but I,
*  but I know that I was always looking for someone to figure out, to get me. And then, and then I
*  will say this when you know, you know, when you know, you know, when you think there's, I can't
*  imagine a life without this person. That, that, that happened to me. And I can only say my
*  experiences. I had Leanne, I loved her and I, and I didn't even realize it. And the second she dumped
*  me, I went, oh, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, I, I don't get to live a great life without her. She's the
*  thing that's going to give me a great life. I knew it undisputed. I went for a run and she dumped me.
*  I went to my shower. I cried. I went to Barnes and Noble. I bought men from Venus, women from Mars.
*  I watched Fight Club in my closet. I didn't drink. I drank a lot of NyQuil to sleep. And then I went
*  for a hike in Runyon Canyon. I was running back down outpost by Ben Affleck's house and,
*  and the sun was setting and I just said, God, if you're listening,
*  just give me this chick back. I'll never fuck it up. This is the one. I won't fuck it up. I won't
*  cheat. I'm not going to be a bad dude. I want to have kids with her. I'll be there. I'll be a great
*  fucking dude. I'll take her out on dates. Like I'll love this chick. And I got home and she was
*  in my room in a sundress and I was like, Oh fuck, he lit. I didn't know he was real. I was like,
*  shit man, give me like one more night. Let me get some strange tail real quick before I commit
*  forever. But I think when you know, you know, this is so silly, but I follow that in business.
*  Like when you know, you know, and like my assistance with us and someone goes, how did you,
*  how do you find a good assistant? I go, when you know, you know, like people will show you who they
*  are. I can tell you when I fell in love with my assistant, we were doing a TV show and, and,
*  and we worked past dinner and all the dinner places were closed. And he just said, Hey,
*  I got like four meals. I didn't know which one you'd want. So I got four different meals for you.
*  I ordered them. They're up in your room and just let me know whichever you want. I'll take care of
*  the rest of them. And I was like, Oh, that, that dude thinks about other people before himself.
*  He didn't even get himself dinner. He just got me four dinners. And I was like,
*  fuck. I did the same thing with my social media manager. The way she was operating was I was like,
*  I feel like she's thinking about me. And we connected on so many levels on so many levels.
*  I could talk to her about things and ideas I had. And then I was like, okay, I want her. I want him.
*  I want, I think you, I think it's gotta be that thing when you know, you know, and it can be so
*  simple as like, like a personal trainer or like a jujitsu class or like just where you go, oh,
*  I'm connecting right now. But you have to allow yourself to notice that person.
*  I think you do. I mean, I think you have to put yourself out there and you have to be available
*  for it. You know, that's the hardest part is just being available for it. Cause so many people just
*  want to be busy, just dating. I just want to have someone in my life. I don't want to be bored. I
*  don't want to, what if I die alone? I don't want to, I like just be available for it.
*  What is it? You said peeling the baby shrimp when you could be having a lobster
*  lobster is still a lot of work. I have to say.
*  Yeah, but well, yeah, but it's lobster. This is a fucking baby shrimp or like,
*  and you ever get, you ever get the ones in Brazil where you just go fuck it. I'll eat the shell.
*  I don't care anymore. Like I'm so fucking hungry. You just handful of lobster, like it's popcorn or
*  baby shrimp, like it's popcorn. I've done that in Vietnam. I've done that. I've where I just go,
*  it's too much work. So when you're in it, what's the secret to successful marriage?
*  What do women want? Oh, fuck that's, I'm the wrong guy to answer that. I think
*  how to make love to a woman by her pressure. How do you make love to a woman? I'll tell you how I
*  do it. I go down on her first, make sure she has an orgasm. And then I get my turn and that's over
*  pretty quick. It's like, it's like your ears pierced, it doesn't feel a little prick and it's over.
*  I don't know if I've done a great job keeping her happy. I think I keep her interested. Like I think
*  I keep her occupied. Like I'm like a little bit of a rodeo clown. Like I don't know. I mean,
*  like I know we're happy right now. I know we're really happy, but I don't know if I ever did
*  as good a job as she did. Like she's always been like, she's always been a gangster. Like done,
*  did everything, just does everything. She does it all. She does everything, like fucking everything.
*  She loves it. She just does it. And then she shows love for you by taking care of you.
*  And so like, I have a lot of time just been this like, almost like step and repeat husband where
*  it's like I come in to take a picture like, Hey, Monday, Tuesday. All right. I'm on the road
*  Wednesday. Take care guys. Or like travel channel. I'd leave for two weeks at a time. I left for the
*  movie for three months. So like, I don't know that I've ever done a bang up job. I buy it like, I go,
*  I remember one time I was just like, I don't cheat on her. I don't hit her. I don't yell at her.
*  I'm a pretty good fighter. I'm a really good fighter. Like, like I'm good at like going like,
*  Hey, we're on the same team. Oh, you mean deescalation. I'm really good at like, I'm
*  very self, I'm very accountable. I'm very self correcting. Like if, if we're in a fight and she
*  points something out and I go, Oh, you're right. I go, fuck. You're right about that. You're right.
*  You're totally right. Oh, in the moment. In the moment. I'm really good at that. And my wife's
*  not, she's not a good apologizer. Like she needs to sleep on an apology and then she can do it. I
*  can apologize in the moment if I realize I'm wrong and I'm really quick to find my fault.
*  Yeah. I look for my fault because I go, tell me what I did. Adversely as a parent,
*  I have pulled my daughters aside and been like, yo, that wasn't you. That was mom. Yeah. I'm giving
*  you a heads up because I don't want, cause I got really confused as a kid. Cause my dad always made
*  sure I knew I was wrong. And sometimes I wasn't. And then as a kid, you're kind of fucked up. You're
*  like, well, how do I know if I'm wrong? And I think that raises. So I was really good with my
*  girls going like, yo, and then, and then parenting Georgia taught me a lot about self-correcting.
*  Self-correcting was that? My oldest. I only, I parented like my dad parented, like just like,
*  raise your voice, get up to here. That's it. No, that doesn't fuck this. How come the dogs
*  don't have goddamn leashes on the collars on their necks? And so with Georgia, I had to learn
*  through therapy that if the, if the, if the consequences here and the highest it goes is
*  here, then why the fuck wouldn't they lie and do everything? Cause they go, well, I know what it's
*  like to hear, but if you can vary your consequence with a child and find some conversation in it,
*  then all of a sudden they're like, well, fuck. Well, I don't want to lie. Cause this does,
*  this does suck. I like this. I like where we talk and he says, right. A thousand words on
*  why driving around your kids in a car, kids in a car is bad. So threatened extreme violence every
*  once in a while, just to let them know the dog can fucking bite. The dog can bark, the dog can bite,
*  but if you pet him on his belly, a wag its tail. Yeah. Do you worry about being a way too much?
*  I mean, you're one of the most creative content pushers and creators out there. You're just
*  innovating constantly putting stuff out there, but do you worry that pulls you away from like
*  the mundane experience of life that can bring contentment and happiness?
*  Yeah. I feel like sometimes it cannibalizes your real life where you start going,
*  you start thinking in promo videos or you start looking at a vacation as a bit.
*  We should go zip lining. Why don't you do, what shoes you wear? And I like,
*  it can definitely cannibalize your life. My wife's really good at going like, no,
*  like no phones. The girls are really good. The girls, when I started Instagramming stuff,
*  they started saying stuff like dad hits mom. And I'm like, Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys. They're like,
*  no, put your phone away. Dad, dad and less boys. And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop,
*  stop, stop. Yeah. What's, what are some secrets, words of wisdom you can say for how to be
*  successful online and all the, everything you've learned, you're kind of like the Mr. Beast of
*  comedy, just innovating constantly in terms of how to promote stuff, in terms of how to present
*  stuff across the different social media and across YouTube podcasts, all that stuff.
*  I think the number one thing is don't be afraid to suck. No one sees the shit that sucks.
*  It doesn't get views. It just gets forgotten. Yeah. It gets forgotten. The good stuff they
*  remember. And then that's all they bring up. The stuff that sucks just goes away. And they're like,
*  oh yeah, did you do that? I don't even think I saw that. Fuck it. Who cares? Yeah. You know,
*  it's like, it's like, I watched one of my favorite stories about this is a guy named Sean Patton.
*  I was explaining Instagram stories to him and Ari and Mark Norman. And I was explaining that
*  you can set now sell tickets on Instagram stories. It was back when they swiped up instead of tap
*  the button, swipe up and they didn't understand it. And I said, let me show you. And I put up
*  tickets for sale. And I said, you know, Hey guys, swipe up. And then I just showed him in
*  10 minutes. Look, this is how many people swiped up as 145 people. It's a lot of people to buy
*  tickets for a fucking comedy club. And they were like, Whoa. And they're like, what do you do
*  stories about? I go fucking anything. Who gives a shit? Just anything. And some things work. Some
*  things don't. And I watched Sean Patton. Shout out to Sean Patton. Try for about 15 minutes to do an
*  Instagram story about his cup of tea. He was making a cup of tea and he was making it. And he kept
*  going, Hey, okay, hold on. Hold on to me. I was filming him from the couch. I was filming all
*  these attempts. I filmed every single one of my like 15 different stories of him trying to do that.
*  I had 145,000 views on each story. He never posted it. He never posted it. And I was like,
*  I was like, man, if he had just posted that one, he never posted anything in his stories.
*  That one 145,000 people would have gone to his story to see that cup of tea being made and see
*  which one he finally went with. And so sometimes I think the biggest mistake you can make is just
*  not doing it. Just do it. Just post it. Turn the camera on. The idea will show up. And that's the
*  number one thing. Just turn the camera on and it'll come up. You'll figure it out.
*  Do you do multiple takes or no?
*  Maybe I do three. And I'm talking even like in the dance video I did where I did the hip hop dance.
*  I did two takes on that. When I had the marching band come to my house, I did two takes on that.
*  Once you start doing more takes, you lose the fun of it, I think. And then the fun ones,
*  my favorite one I've ever done without a doubt, my favorite promo I've ever done is
*  I needed, they added a second show in some city and they added a second show like Friday and
*  Saturday and our third show. And I said, they just told me, I was like, fuck, I'm leaving like
*  tomorrow. I need to sell tickets. So I said, real quick, girls, meet me outside. And Leanne's like,
*  girls are doing homework. I gotta go take five seconds. I put on a speedo. I got the American
*  flag. I gave Isla the hose. I gave Leanne the leaf blower and I gave Georgia the drone.
*  And I just had Georgia drone it back to reveal the leaf blower and the mist you were seeing was
*  coming from Isla and Leanne. I'm in a speedo with the American flag. I have Bob Seeger playing,
*  rambling, grambling man. And that night Larry the Cable Guy texted me and he goes, this is
*  fucking genius. And I was like, it was just, and it was just like, yo, just, let's just shoot something.
*  Who gives a fuck? Like just shoot something. Just say something and put a little, just do a little
*  movement into it. And those are my, back in the day, I used to be, I watched a bunch of my promo
*  clips back from back in the day. I used to be really good. Now it's like, I'm promoting so
*  fucking many things. I'm just like, I'm almost like, I'm exhausted by my promotions.
*  Yeah. Because you know, the, the well can dry up in terms of ideas.
*  Yeah. And it's like, how many times am I going to show a picture of my ass? My ass sells really good.
*  Whatever my ass is on Instagram, fucking million views guaranteed, a million views.
*  Your ass.
*  And, and, and, and it's, and it's an active post. Like people are like,
*  I did the best one I did the other day was where I superimposed my ass on my front
*  and it just looked beautiful. No views.
*  Also you got reported. Oh, I see.
*  It looked like a front vagina.
*  Oh, is that what it was?
*  Yeah, I think so. But like, but yeah, my ass, like I'm, I'm in a place right now where I am promoting,
*  I'll be promoting this movie. I'll be promoting this movie until it goes to a streamer. I'll be
*  promoting it. Uh, shamelessly. I am proud of it. I had a great time shooting it. It's in theaters.
*  It'll be on video on demand. It'll be on a streamer. I'm sure. I don't know, but I'm sure.
*  I'm promoting fully loaded my summer festival with 19 different comics. I'm promoting the tops off
*  world tour that starts again this fall. I'm promoting my cruise, the fully loaded cruise.
*  I'm promoting red rocks. I'm promoting so many things that today was the very first time in my
*  career where I said in January, I'm going to take a break. I'm going to take a break and go like,
*  Hey man, let's, let's get your resting heart rate down. Let's, let's get some sleep.
*  Let's, let's maybe take off like three months from drinking. Like let's just really like slow it
*  down and also not think when you're thinking in promo all the time, it can be a little exhaust.
*  I mean, you think you think it's exhausting to look at my feet. It's exhausting to be my feet.
*  I'm my feet. Yeah. And sometimes less is more. One of the things that,
*  Nope, nope, nope.
*  One of the things that inspires me about Rogan, for example, is he almost never does this kind of
*  stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Or in the house, how long does his podcast cause you're right. Less is more.
*  How would it seem to like once a month? No, he does it three times a week. More is more is perfect.
*  But for example, when he does like a story or something like this, he does one take.
*  It's kind of shitty. It's the same. It's the same. It's elk with a bunch of jalapenos,
*  a knife that he had sent to him by a fucking knife maker and him going, look at this, look at this,
*  it's a Traeger smoker. I reverse seared this. This is what's great. Look at this. I'm about to
*  put it in the butter. And like, this is grass fed butter. This elk really raises my testosterone.
*  Rogan is it's you're right with guys like Rogan, when he does do a story, they're a little precious.
*  Yeah. And there's, I don't think he's, he's ever done a second take at any of those stories.
*  No, you have to really admire that. Like if the shot is framed poorly, if the audio sucks,
*  doesn't matter. Does that matter? Do you remember when he, this is like, like I can get in the weeds
*  on Rogan, but, and especially when it's Instagram, do you remember when he got his polar plunge and
*  he couldn't sit in a minute and then the next day, and then he must've gotten it on the internet bad.
*  He must've gotten it bad. The next day he sat in for 20 minutes and he lowered his core temperature
*  by like two degrees. And it took him like a month to get that back. That is that fucking man. What
*  an interesting, you know, I told you at the beginning, we were just talking. I like, I really
*  enjoy, I draw inspiration from men I'm not like. You, David Goggins, Cam Haynes, Andrew Huberman,
*  Huberman I love, fucking, I mean, there's so many guys like that Rogan, you know,
*  Tim Kennedy, like there are a lot of guys that are like just very different men than me. And I love
*  Jocko Wilnick. Like I love, I love reading their stuff or listening to their audio books or
*  listening to their podcasts because I'm so not like that. But that for me, when I add a little
*  bit of that in my life, like I remember you went, I don't know what you were doing, but you were
*  walking us through your day and it was so fascinating. It was like, it was like, I ran eight miles today.
*  I listened to an audio book, I was running eight miles and then I came and I worked for about three
*  hours straight on AI stuff. And I'm like, and I was like, wait, you sat at a desk? Like you like sat
*  at a desk and like, and I actually, I wouldn't even know what to do. I would start doing crafts.
*  Like I wouldn't like that you went, I was like, is your computer like-
*  Yeah. Have you sat for like four hours focused on a single task?
*  Me? No. Oh, I have a hard time sleeping for four hours.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I don't have that, I don't have a brain that like, I really admired it when I listened to you
*  do it. Cause then you were like, you were fasting at the time, you were doing your fast and then you
*  talk about what you ate. And I was jealous. I wanted to be able to be like that. And I think
*  at that time we started, I think you were doing maybe bone broth or something. And we started
*  doing bone broth pretty religiously and adding that into a fast. Cause I was like, it does,
*  for someone like me, it does feel cool to add a little bit of control into life.
*  So integrating a little bit of a way of being from another person that you're not like-
*  Yeah. Like so David Goggins is consistently pushing himself. I love, I did it over the
*  pandemic more, but I loved going, today I'm running a marathon. I'm going to get on the treadmill and
*  it's not going to be all at once, but I'm going to get through a marathon today. So let's get up,
*  get me six miles from coffee and let's see if we can do like five miles. And then know that we
*  started there. And that was really fun to like, Cam Haynes does that too, where he goes like,
*  he almost just sets the limit and then achieves that. His son Truett is really fascinating
*  because his son Truett's right now is trying to get the, and like, I bet people would never think
*  that this is who I watch, but I get real inspiration from those people because I showed Jaco,
*  I showed a clip to Jaco, to Isla because Isla's like me, like a person of her fluids,
*  impulse. I walked in on her one time, she was in the pantry in a bathrobe in the dark,
*  drinking a root beer. And I opened the door and she went, I said, what? She goes, I thought you
*  were mom, shut the door. And I shut the door to let her finish the root beer. She has a hard time
*  waking up. So I look, come in here. I want you to see this clip from Jaco. She goes, who's Jaco?
*  I say he's a Navy SEAL. She goes, he works at the zoo? I went, no. He said Navy fucking SEAL.
*  I go, it's a bad ass job. She goes, it's a silly name. And I went, no, it's not, it isn't a silly
*  name. These guys are the toughest dudes in the world. She goes-
*  She's kind of right though about the silly name. I never even realized that.
*  Well, yeah, you talk to a child. And so I go, watch this, what he says about waking up. So it
*  hits the thing and Jaco goes, first thing you do when you hear that alarm clock, you could roll
*  over, you could go back to bed, you could hit snooze, but you get out of bed. And that's your
*  first victory. And Isla hits pause and she goes, how great is that nap right after you hit snooze
*  though? It is pretty funny. I go, hang on, you're missing the point. You need to listen to this whole
*  speech. He's with Casey Neistat when he's telling this speech. He's with Casey Neistat. And so I hit
*  it. And then he goes, and then you've got a victory under your belt. Then you go to the gym and you
*  work out and I go, are you listening to Isla? And she goes, yeah. And he goes, and then when
*  you go to work, now you've got two victories. You've worked out and you've woken up on time.
*  You didn't hit that snooze button. So when you go into that break room and you see donuts and she
*  hits pause, she goes, if he's about to say no to donuts, I'm done listening. I go, he's definitely
*  going to say no to donuts. Do you think he's going to have a donut? And she goes, you like this guy?
*  I go, I fucking love him. And she goes, do you think he'd like you? And I go, what do you mean?
*  She goes, dad, you hit snooze, you skip working out and you love donuts. And I'm like, yeah,
*  you're making a good fucking point. I go, but I do love that, I love to watch that brain work
*  and go, I don't hit snooze. I don't hit snooze now. I go, fuck it, because I'm up.
*  And then I go to the gym every single morning. I go to the gym every single morning. And today
*  is National Donut Day. I didn't have a donut. And so I try to apply these a little bit,
*  the other side of me is like, tonight, after we do this, I'll do another podcast and then I'm going
*  to call Leanne and go, yo, we're in Beverly Hills, meet me out here. Let's go have drinks. Let's go
*  have a fucking couple Campari spritz. Let's go over to a friend's house and overnight, let's get some
*  edibles and let's fucking have a night about it. Get some sushi, go have sex in the hot tub. And
*  I got to work out at fucking 10 in the morning. I got to tell you, that nap when you press snooze
*  is the sweetest. That's my first victory is pressing snooze and getting the nap onto the
*  belt. Have you ever had, I had, so this morning I didn't work out. I'd press at like five in the
*  morning until about six. You're going hard right now. Yeah. And then I had a podcast. I saw you
*  flew to Austin. I was like, what? Yeah. Just run around theaters and now you're back. Yeah,
*  run around theaters to do, to promote the movie. And then look, you only get one shot at these
*  movies. So you might as well do it. And look, it's really hard to get people to go into movie
*  theater right now. And so I woke up at like six, did five or six to seven, did press.
*  And then I went and I said, and I'm really into a podcast, a history podcast right now.
*  And I was listening to this one about the conquistadors. And I was like,
*  before when I woke up, I was like, I wouldn't mind going back to that. And I said, I'll tell you what,
*  I'm going to take a little nap and go now. I slept good last night. I slept like seven hours last
*  night. Boy, that 30 minute nap, it felt like five hours. And I woke up going, I can readjust my
*  sleep score. That has to be in the 97. That was the best fucking nap. Those little snooze naps are
*  monsters. You know, there's, I don't care. That's probably for me, one of the peak experiences of
*  life is those naps. I don't know what that is. Have you ever slept in a tour bus?
*  A tour bus versus a regular bus. Like a tour bus, like meaning like in a bunk. No,
*  I've taken a lot of buses in my life though. Like mean like just like a, like a gray.
*  Those are very different and a public transit. Listen, they,
*  that's just part of part of life. And a great hunt. I was on a great home.
*  One time, I was on the great home with time, right? When notorious BIGs album came out in college
*  and I was going from Tallahassee down to Tampa and the dude got on the tour bus,
*  got on the bus next to me, black dude. And he sat down. He said,
*  where you headed? And I said, Tampa. He said, you grew up in Tampa. I said, yeah. I said,
*  you and he goes, yeah. I said, you go to school of fam and it gives it a family and floor say the
*  two schools, one's black, one's white. And he goes, no, I just got out of prison. I said,
*  you got a prison? And he goes, yeah. Yeah, man. I got out of prison. I stabbed a dude
*  and, and, and I've been in prison. I just got out today. He goes, what are you listening to?
*  I said notorious BIG and he goes, oh shit, that's out. And I went, yeah. And he goes,
*  I want to hear it. Can I hear it? And I was like, yeah. And he used my headsets,
*  the whole bus ride to Tampa. I didn't have the bombs. Like he stabbed a man. They're yours now.
*  I just sat next to him and I was like, is it, are you enjoying it? He's like, this is good.
*  No tour bus naps. Yeah. When you're in a bunk, it's ice cold. Bus isn't moving. Five o'clock.
*  You got like, we work out from like up until like five o'clock, five 30 show starts at seven,
*  but that five o'clock to six, six 30 nap, it's pitch black. It's like a coffin and it is ice
*  cold. And you got all your pillows and blankets in there and you put a little history podcast on in
*  the corner and you just listen to like Kurtman Bosch or like, oh my God. So you're talking about
*  like five, six PM for seven PM show. Oh, it's the best nap you'll ever have. You wake up
*  so refreshed. Yeah. Like I've woken up from naps, like where I'm like,
*  fuck yeah. Like there are those, those tour bus naps are the best. I think having a full productive
*  day and then like five, six PM to get a nap. And then you do something really stressful after that,
*  like really hyper like, like a show. But if I do like, I really liked doing podcasts like late at
*  night after a nap. I think I've fucked up my podcast rhythm because we're doing them in the
*  day. And so sometimes I'm just like, like if I work out in the morning, I'm good on a podcast,
*  but if I don't work out, I suck on a podcast. I'm just like, uh huh. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool.
*  No, I, I, I'm my favorite is I used to do this a lot. I haven't done it in a while is
*  a full busy day nap at home, box of wine on the treadmill and do that until like midnight.
*  Watching TV box of wine, box of wine on a treadmill. It's the best. How are you,
*  wait, how are you sipping it? Like you have a glass, but you have a box, the box fits on the
*  corner on the treadmill. So you just got a little spigot and you just sit there and just put on
*  like guys grocery games or like just something. It's like a, you walk in or are you running?
*  I walk, I walk at like a three, five. So what will happen is if you started at three,
*  started three casual walk, 20 minutes, you're going to mile in and then you're going to feel
*  loose, get up to a three, five. You can do seven miles on these things and just, and just, and
*  you're just enjoying your night. And especially like my wife, back in the day when we lived in
*  our old house, my wife would come into the man cave and she sat on the couch and we watched TV
*  together and like watch game of Thrones and you just like for an hour and you just get on the
*  treadmill and do it. Oh man, I loved having done that as much lately. That was the fucking-
*  So you can lose yourself. You can forget yourself.
*  You forget you're on a treadmill and you just start like walking and you're sweating
*  and you're having wine. And then at certain points you're like, like you, like you start
*  jogging, especially like we were watching, not all quiet on the restroom front. What's the one
*  where they've got to, they've got to get the message to the frontline.
*  I would run like I was in World War II. I would run when they would run and it was fucking awesome.
*  And I would be like, cause they were doing drinks. They'd be like, take a drink. You gotta run up
*  there. And I'd be like, okay. Yeah. I'm really into, I'm really into history podcast right now.
*  Like I've been in them for a while. 20th century or everything.
*  Everything, everything. I listened to, was it Marcus Aurelius and Cleopatra today?
*  Uh, in the middle of the podcast, they're like, you know, just, you know,
*  Cleopatra wasn't as hot as everyone says. I was like, why are you saying that?
*  You guys tell me she's a six. She looks like Snooki. Like, why, let me,
*  let me dream that she looked like Kim Kardashian. And then I listened to that one today.
*  I listened to World War II a lot. A lot of books on World War II, a lot of podcasts about it.
*  What's your favorite theater, the Pacific or European?
*  Uh, no, European. I Pacific. Well, because my family's so much of it has died in that theater.
*  So dude, so much of it. I hate to sound cliche,
*  like a Marlon Schwarzenegger in an eighties movie, but it's personal.
*  Keith, well, you know what I find funny about that is Lenin. It was Lenin, right?
*  John Lennon. No, no, no. Was it Lenin was World War II, right? Or was it Stalin?
*  Stalin, Stalin, Stalin thought him and Hitler would be friends.
*  Yeah. I think that's so cute that he was like, we're going to be buddies. Like we're boys.
*  And then Hitler was like, oh, fuck you. I'm Hitler, bro. This is what I do.
*  Well, at first he was like, fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll be friends.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Hey, then call me, call me better yet. I'll show up in winter. How's that
*  sound? That, uh, that, uh, I find, I find all of that so fascinating. When I was a kid, I had a hard
*  time understanding how, cause we were always at war with Russia when I was a kid. And I had a hard
*  time understanding how we could be on the same team as Russia in World War II. And I was like,
*  wait, how did that turn south? And then you listen to podcasts. Yeah. I'm that all of that, all of
*  that, like all of the World War II, I got really into the, the Pacific shit for a while, but I'm
*  really deep in the, in, in the whole, we, we, we went to Normandy from the Cliffs of Dover and
*  to think, so that's the fucking beach. That's the fucking beach. Oh shit. This is cold as fuck.
*  These dudes jumped in ice cold water and this isn't like a cool beach. Like this is,
*  and it's just so insane to, and then to see like the, the, it's pretty intense.
*  I don't know why I got into history late in life. I wasn't, I was kind of into it,
*  but I'm really into it now. And I love just learning a little something about,
*  you know, today was, I listened to like the Noiser has a great history stuff. It's like history for
*  dummies. I think like I get to, I can't listen to the really smart stuff starts losing me too many
*  names that I'm calling. Yeah. Well, Dan Carlin is always the best. Your podcast with Dan Carlin
*  was so fucking good. He's, he is, I mean, I only know about Martin Luther because of Dan Carlin.
*  I only know, like I would have, I made a joke about some Lutheran the other day and everyone
*  laughed and I was like, did you guys listen to the same podcast I did? Because I just am quoting Dan
*  Carlin. I, that his podcast, I mean, we all quoted the same shit about Genghis Khan, about how he
*  could shoot a dove off a horseback, but we knew that all four hoofs had to be off the ground.
*  At the same time they shot, they would sometimes take their meat and stick it under their saddles.
*  And that, I mean, Dan Carlin is, he is the motherfucker. Yeah. God, those were, ma'am,
*  discovering podcasts was the coolest time of my life. And the interesting thing about him is,
*  is audio. And so it's the voice. So for me, I mean, everybody has a story with a prostitute in a
*  motel. Dan Carlin was my prostitute in the motel. I invited him to a motel. I don't even remember
*  in the middle of nowhere, he shows up with that voice and the rest, the rest is history.
*  So good. Things they will never know what happened. Cause he liked you.
*  Oh boy, did he like, no, I'm just kidding. I'm really running with it.
*  Yeah. Yes, we did. We got along with it. I mean, he's an incredibly kind and thoughtful person,
*  constantly self-critical thinking he's not good enough. He just works on those episodes forever.
*  Forever. And he just thinks that there's these, just like with Goggins, there's these
*  other historians that I think like weigh on him. Like they're going to judge him or something like
*  this in his mind. I talked to it with them, but Daniel Petelian, and I guess,
*  his thing is, I guess his hangup is, Carlin's is, he's not like this, like,
*  he doesn't feel like he's a real historian, but he is. I mean, it's the way he shares the story.
*  Look, we had a history teacher in seventh grade who was a con artist. And he came and taught her
*  seventh grade and he was a total con artist. All he taught us about was barnstorming,
*  barnstorming and the JFK assassination. I walked away having such an appreciation for barnstorming,
*  very small blip on Americana. But I know a lot about barnstorming because of this guy,
*  because he was passionate about barnstorming. It was the funnest seventh grade history class
*  I've ever taken my entire life. You mentioned tour bus. What's the
*  best road trip you've been on? Have you driven across the country, just you?
*  No. We had one road trip in college where a bar had burned down and we found out that the alcohol
*  was still in the bar. So we took my Jetta over to the bar and we emptied out the bar of all the
*  burnt up liquor. We didn't know what anything was. We threw it into the trunk with no clothes,
*  like no clothes. And we said, let's just start driving. And we drove from Tallahassee and ended
*  up in West Virginia and just drove, just drove. It was like five dudes. We drank, one person drove.
*  I wasn't a big drinker in college until I went to Russia. And so I drove the majority of the way.
*  And then we'd get somewhere and we'd get a hotel room. And it was one of the most epic
*  fucking weekends of just debauchery and chaos. And I think we took mushrooms and we
*  went down a river in tubes. So it's most about the bond between the five people versus
*  throwing yourself into meeting strangers and this kind of stuff.
*  Yeah. And it was when I was trying to be a poet at that time. And so we were-
*  Actual poetry?
*  Yeah. It was a really bad part of my life.
*  Well, music is there too somewhere.
*  Yeah. I tried to be in a band too. That didn't work out the way I wanted it to.
*  I'm not a good serious person. I'm a good funny person. I'm good to be the fool,
*  but I'm not good. When I try to be serious, it looks foolish. And so even like someone showed
*  me throwing out the first pitch the other day as something and all I could see is my gut flying
*  everywhere. And I was like, that's why it went viral. I was like, fuck, I thought it was my
*  throwing style. That was a pretty epic one. The best road trips I ever took was during the pandemic.
*  During the pandemic, when we were doing that drive-in movie theater tour,
*  I created a drive-in movie theater tour when no one was working. And the very first one,
*  no one had left our houses. We all went to my house. We got my tour bus. We had just wrapped,
*  the day the tour bus showed up, we just wrapped the cabin, just wrapped doing the cabin on Netflix.
*  And we got COVID tested. We got in the tour bus and we said, let's create our bubble and stay safe.
*  And that night we drove, I think just outside Gallup and we stayed in a,
*  no one had been outside and we stayed at a KOA, Camp on Arrival, and we watched thunderstorms come
*  in on a lake and we were all smoking cigars and drinking IPAs. And it was fucking mad. And that
*  whole road trip, we road tripped across the country to start the tours. And then we just,
*  and we were outside for the first time and it was that period of my life. I'm so grateful.
*  I didn't make a ton of money because we had a big crew and I was trying to make sure everyone,
*  because no one had paid bills in a while. But that fucking tour was the funnest. We took a pickleball,
*  we took a disc golf, everything was wide open in the middle of the country. You could do things,
*  but we were still in our bubble. And we lived in that tour bus. And at night, we just get back in
*  the tour bus by ourselves and get fucking wasted. And I mean, that fucking run, nothing will ever
*  be like that. Yeah, because you rediscovered the humanity, the camaraderie, because the pandemic
*  killed that. They suffocated us from their basic connection. Yeah. And there was this,
*  you always had an anxiety attack halfway through that you got COVID. And this one,
*  COVID was killing people. And you were like, I know I've got COVID. And then we'd come in
*  to Sedona. And this is also why I didn't make a ton of money. We'd come in to Sedona and we'd get
*  a house in Sedona for five days, an Airbnb. And we'd all isolate there before we went home to our
*  families. I remember the first time we did it, we didn't isolate. We just pulled back into LA and
*  all our families were freaked out. So I had to live on the tour bus at a different house.
*  It was 4th of July and I came in and they were doing an egg toss. And they're like, well, you
*  can do an egg toss. And this is how bad my anxiety gets. You can do an egg toss with your daughter,
*  Isla. So Isla and I did an egg toss and we fucking got it to like legit, like 40 fucking feet where
*  I was throwing overhand, lobbing them to her. And the egg cracked in her hands and it broke over her
*  face. And I got in bed that night, high on weed, fucking drunk. And I went, what if I gave my
*  daughter COVID from an egg toss? I go, that would be the most horrific way to kill a child.
*  She got it from an egg toss. It broke in her face. Her dad did COVID. Yeah.
*  I mean, that's the scariest thing about COVID, I think, is not you dying, but because of you,
*  somebody else dies. Oh, I got it. That's the fear, I think, that really like took hold on people.
*  That's why they were way more cautious than perhaps they needed to be. It's just like,
*  I don't want to be the guy that's responsible for killing somebody I love or somebody that somebody
*  else loves. Leanne gave everyone in our family COVID. She came up to me and she gave me a hug
*  after Christmas and gives me a hug. I said, what's the matter? And she goes, I think I have COVID.
*  I go, bitch, six feet. What the fuck are you doing? Back it up, Fauci. And then she went,
*  when we went to all, and then she had it and it went away and we were all fine. And we're like,
*  okay. We can still go to Park City. So we all go to Park City. Then Georgia gets COVID. And then
*  Georgia starts crying and she goes, I think I gave you COVID. And I was like, I'm fine. She goes,
*  you're at high risk. And I'm like, what? She's like, you're a fat alcoholic. I'm like, whoa,
*  easy. Where the fuck, what about feelings? And then Georgia got COVID. Me and I were still in
*  Park City. Leanne had it. My tour bus came up, picked Georgia up. Georgia and Leanne took them
*  back to LA. And I was, I was there and I tested and then we got on the plane and I cough and
*  Isla's got her mask on. And Isla just looks at me, you know, the best, the one thing we miss are the
*  eyes over masks. And then we get home and I had COVID. And Isla's like, if you gave me fucking
*  COVID. And then she never got COVID. She never got COVID. You mentioned IPAs. What's the lay
*  of the land of great beers in this expansive world of ours? I like Pilsners. I'm a Pilsner guy.
*  I'm an ice cold beer guy. Ice cold Pilsner. I like an ice cold beer. I like an ice cold. One of the
*  best beer buzzes I ever had is we had bought a new house, but we weren't building it. And over COVID,
*  I didn't drink for like three months, four months until we decided to go back out on tour. And we
*  figured that out. And I was in the backyard and Leanne came back with like two tall boy,
*  German Pilsners and cracked them. She goes, let's have a beer. And I was like, fuck yeah.
*  And man, that second, that beer buzz is different than anything. Because the second it touches you,
*  you feel the sparkle and you're just like, yeah, baby, I'm back. And then she's like,
*  you want another one? I'm like, fuck yeah. And then we have another one. And then,
*  and that beer buzz is, especially afternoon beer buzz is just so pretty. It's different than a
*  night beer buzz. Night beer buzz is like, oh, I guess we'll have a beer and then I'll have a couple.
*  I gotta go to work tomorrow. All right. But that afternoon irresponsible beer buzz,
*  Pilsner, Pilsner, there's, I don't mind an IPA, but it's gotta be at, it's gotta, I gotta be at
*  somewhere. I gotta be at somewhere. They gotta have an IP, like, I like a local IPA. It's gotta
*  be food involved. And then I'm enjoying an IPA. I threw up an IPA in a bathtub in
*  Salt Lake City one time. It was bad.
*  What do you mean? Oh, you threw up in the bathtub. Okay.
*  No, no, no. I was drinking in the bathtub.
*  Like bathtub with some water in it or?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  You're sitting in the bathtub.
*  No, I'm getting ready to take a shower. And I had a growler of IPA. It's about six in the morning.
*  I have to fly that day to Vegas to jump off the stratosphere. All I need is a little bit of a buzz
*  to get myself on this fucking plane. I have anxiety going through my fucking head
*  because I'm jumping, I'm gonna be the first person to jump off the stratosphere.
*  And so I'm drinking an IPA out of a growler in a bathtub at six in the morning.
*  And it just didn't sit right. And I threw it up and I was off IPAs for like 10 fucking years.
*  I didn't have another IPA until I was like 46. Because I was like, all I could think about was
*  throwing up that IPA in a bathtub in a shower and being like, I'm gonna throw up thinking about it.
*  But yeah, I didn't fuck with IPAs for a while. And then during the pandemic, I got back into IPAs.
*  I was that way with Jack and Coke, Jack Daniels and Coke.
*  Really?
*  Got so drunk many, many years ago that just couldn't look at it for a few years.
*  I can't touch, what's Janice Joplin's drink? Southern Comfort. I can't touch Southern Comfort.
*  So you just drink it straight?
*  Southern Comfort is at 40%. That's hard.
*  No, it's almost like a liqueur. Honestly, it's really sweet. Jack, Double Jack on the Rocks,
*  Lots of Rocks. I had a quote that I got a video that went viral about, I'll never quit drinking.
*  And I have not gotten on a plane since that without having a flight attendant not even ask what I want.
*  Walk up with a Double Jack on the Rocks, Lots of Rocks. I mean, it happens.
*  So on times I don't want to drink. I flew to Austin the other day, I was like, I'm not drinking.
*  On the plane, because I felt sick. And man, he walked up and he goes, Double Jack on the Rocks,
*  Lots of Rocks. I was like, fuck, you know it. But yeah, that's my drink.
*  Wait, what's your drink? I thought you'd be a vodka guy.
*  Well, vodka, I associate with a lot of moments in my life of happiness, because
*  vodka is associated with shots and camaraderie. And there's Eastern Europe in general,
*  a bunch of guys get together and you celebrate life intensely. People fight, people just feel,
*  people experience life in a deep way, just get too drunk for a reason. But I don't see that as
*  drinking drinking. That's like a journey towards a destination. To me, drinking is like whiskey neat
*  or beer, like you said, ice cold beer. This is that afternoon beer. For a person like me,
*  who's extremely regimented and disciplined, sometimes you get the situation. I just remember,
*  I mean, I remember there's a bar at MIT where I just remember in the afternoon, there was a
*  business meeting. I sat down, we started with a beer and they're really crisply cold, some kind of
*  lager. And then just one beer and two beers. And all of a sudden you say, fuck it. Let's just,
*  the rest of the day, this is what this is. And you said, bright, like you just like,
*  nature is beautiful out there. And you just said, fuck it to all the meetings,
*  fuck it to everything else. Just the camaraderie, the just talking about life, being silly,
*  being, you know, all of that. See that, see you're describing something I'll never get
*  because I'm not regimented. I would love, I would love, I would love, only for the moment that you
*  get to have, you get the most precious little angels breath that anyone's going to get because
*  you live this life that's dialed in and it's scheduled. And so when you say, fuck it,
*  it's like, that's like me doing coke. Like, it's like, oh, fuck it. And you can just do that with
*  beer. That is fucking amazing. I would love to live a regimented life just to get the chance to go,
*  hey guys, I'm not performing surgery today. Fuck it. Hey guys, this bus full of kids,
*  kids gotta drive itself home. Fuck it. I couldn't even tell you, you know what's so interesting about
*  me and you is that you know I'm a fan of yours. I couldn't even, I don't really know what AI is.
*  Like other than like dildos or AI, right? Like, like if it has some electronics in it,
*  no, I don't think a dildo classifies as a robot. Cause I thought that's how they were going to take
*  over fucking mankind. Just well, they start with these, the fucking womanizer that knows how to eat
*  a pussy. And then they're like, we don't need men anymore. But like, it's so interesting that I
*  couldn't even, like I can barely tell you what my dad does for a living. He's a lawyer. I could kind
*  of like, he's called me and say, Hey man, you gotta stop talking about what I do. Cause you're not
*  doing it right. I go, what do you mean? He's like, that's not, whatever you're saying I do, I don't
*  do. And so, but like, I couldn't even begin to explain your job to my daughter.
*  Well, I think there's the way you do the job, which is the way you experience life, the regimented,
*  just even just a nine to five job, right? You work nine to five? No, but I work much more than that.
*  But there's no, every kind of lifestyle has its complexities. I think nine to five means you have
*  to wake up at a certain time every day. Do people tell you to pull it back and then like,
*  Hey, you're working too hard. Yeah. A lot of people, what I want in my life, what I love in my life,
*  especially people close to me are the ones that say work harder. Cause everybody- How do you get
*  them? How do you get them? I don't have anyone in my life that does that. Everybody's always worried
*  about me. Yeah. Everyone's worried about me. Everyone's always worried about me. The only thing,
*  no one ever says, if I showed you my DMs right now, my texts, all it is is like, Hey man,
*  I'm worried about you. Like Joe, I love Joe to death. Not once has he, he always, I don't know
*  if you've seen the caring Joe eyes where like, I'm worried about you. Where it's like,
*  and you're like, Hey man, don't do that. And he's like, I'm worried about you. And you're like,
*  don't worry about me. I'm working. It's, I'm just working. I love working. I love what I do.
*  I love what I do. I can only imagine that you love what you do as much as I love what I do
*  because that's all I ever want to think about. It's all I ever want to talk about. It's all I
*  ever want to be like, I, I, I, when my wife wants me to take a August and whatever the August,
*  whatever the fuck, that's not a number. That's no, but like July and August off after we do
*  fully loaded. And I was like, no, I was like, what do you mean? Like, so like, well, I'll just,
*  am I like sitting in a chair and stuff? She's like, no, you can do like take up a hobby. I go
*  writing jokes. Can I get on stage? Can I do sets in the city? Cause I'm not going to fucking,
*  do you want me to like, like, I don't understand what I don't understand. People who don't,
*  I don't understand people who don't have the drive to work all the time. I don't understand that. I
*  envy it. I envy it. Cause I go, I would love to just be like, I'm going to play video games. I
*  can't play a video game. If I did, I'll be on Twitch trying to make money. Like I love,
*  how do you find so many girls you need to work harder? Yeah. Especially when they see like,
*  I don't know what you look like, but I, I look tormented when I'm working very hard. Like it means
*  like it's easy to worry for my wellbeing. It's not like I'm happy go lucky, but I'm happy
*  underneath it. Am I working too hard is like on a plane every other day or every day
*  getting up at six, working out and then going into like two in the morning or one in the morning
*  and then going to sleep and then getting up at six, working out, getting on a plane,
*  going to another place. Like that's what my working is just a lot of travel in mine.
*  If I didn't drink on planes, I don't think anyone would probably worry about me at all. They'd be
*  like, no, you're doing great. But the working out is there. So I got to ask you, cause you and I
*  seem to have a similar relationship with the running. I like this idea of a slow treadmill.
*  I like running slow, like a 10 minute mile or something like this. So I'll just run forever.
*  Just listening to an audio book, listen to Brown noise. Think I love it. What's Brown noise?
*  It's actually Brownian noise, but short Brown noise. It's kind of like white noise, but deeper.
*  So it's just noise like that. Oh wow. It's kind of sounds like a waterfall. I'll just listen to it.
*  Something happens to me. I think there's, you can ask a cube of a minute about this. I don't,
*  but apparently there's some science that kind of focuses the mind and so on.
*  It's funny because I think sometimes people don't get about running is they go,
*  they get on and they put it on like a six right away on like a treadmill and they go,
*  I can't do this for fucking 30 minutes, but you can if you build yourself up to your six
*  and you play games. I play games with myself a lot. Like I'll play games where I go.
*  And I can do this. I can do this. I can do this almost not all day long, but I can do this a lot
*  longer. Like I did it for two hours the other day before my workout or no hour and a half before
*  my workout where I started at 3.5 walking. And then I, and then I get my jog up to like a five.
*  And then I'm like 5.5, then I go six. And then I go, and once I'm at a six, my body's really loose.
*  And so then I'll go, all right, bring it down to a 3.5. And then I go punch it to a 7.5 for a quarter
*  of a mile. And then let's walk at a four. Let's jog at a five. Right. I can do that. I love,
*  they're called fartlets, I think. And I love those like where that's like, it's
*  regimented running and sprinting at certain levels. I love that. And I love also when I
*  work out to listen to music, but put on foreign language cooking shows on Netflix.
*  Trey Lockerbie Can you explain that?
*  Ben Fisk They just put it on mute. You don't need to hear it. For some reason,
*  they're sexier. The way they're shot, they're sexier. And it's like, street food Asia. And
*  they're just watching them make street food in Asia. There's one called broth. It's called broth,
*  the nation of broth. And they're just making broths. And you're like, fuck, I want some broth.
*  Trey Lockerbie So this is South America. This is Asia.
*  Ben Fisk South America, Asia. They do one on pizzas. I've watched this one on pizzas.
*  I've watched it. There's like four episodes. I've watched every episode so many times that my trainer
*  goes, God, that's that fucking I would I could watch that again. Yeah. I love watching foreign
*  language cooking shows on mute. When I work out while blasting music. All right. Well,
*  I usually run outside, but I do. I can't think I don't mind hiking. And I like I do like you know
*  what my fun thing, the fun thing I would do and this is a this is ripped off totally from campaigns
*  is I like to go. There's a great hike called Freiman Canyon out in the valley where I live.
*  And I'd be like, all right, I'm gonna run to frame from a canyon. I'm gonna jog to
*  Freiman Canyon. I'm gonna hike Freiman Canyon. And then I'm gonna jog back.
*  And they wonder how long that is. I don't think about it. Just know that that's your thing.
*  Just know that that's your thing. And then all sudden, you're like, shit, that was eight miles.
*  You're like, that's a fucking beast. The hike doesn't even feel like anything. The hike once
*  you do the jogs, the hard part there, the jog home is a fucking cakewalk. I had the best jog
*  when I was in Serbia. I had the best jog I think was in Hyde Park. I think the name of the parks
*  Hyde Park. It was get this it was 80% downhill. Wow. So this jog, you started the park and it was
*  like, and I'll do it like this for you. You went like downhill like this, downhill like this,
*  like this. And then it was like a little steep incline to get to the beginning of it. So it
*  was like a little like nice like lower back pain. You're like, okay, okay. And then the jog was
*  perfect. And you did it four times. It was four miles. I loved it. My very first day I did it,
*  a butterfly got in front of me. It's like six in the morning. Six in the morning,
*  a butterfly got in front of me and it ran the whole first mile in front of me. And I just,
*  it was like so surreal. It would disappear and then it would show back up in front of me.
*  You sure it was real?
*  Yeah, definitely real. And then the next day, and so I go, I'm on the right path. I'm on the
*  right path. The next day I go for a jog, six in the morning and it rained. And as I'm doing
*  this steep uphill incline, a tree collapsed in front of me. Just went, and I went, whoa,
*  a tree fell in the woods and I was here to see it. Shut the fuck up. I was like, that's crazy.
*  And it didn't hit me. I'm on the right path. And then I started getting overthinking it. Like the
*  next day I saw a condom and I was like, this is a good place to go. I was like, people fucked here
*  last night. But yeah, that was one of the best jogs I've ever had. I could do that. I could run
*  that park every single day and no one jogged that park in Serbia.
*  I actually recently had a condom on my doorstep and I wanted to ask whoever is up there above
*  what that means. What the, you know, what the story behind that is.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a pissed off UPS guy. Was it compromised?
*  What do you mean compromised?
*  Was there stuff inside it?
*  Oh, I didn't look.
*  I mean, very few people put on the condom and go, it's not for me. I'm going to take it off.
*  It's a little tight.
*  Well, it could be to send a message, like a horse's head kind of thing.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I don't know. I don't know what the message is exactly.
*  Do you use condoms? If you had one next time, would you use a condom?
*  I don't know what a condom is. I never heard of it.
*  Good call.
*  I'm learning.
*  Good call.
*  I've learned about sex from you today.
*  If my wife dies, there's no condoms in my future. I'll get it. I don't care. I have babies. I don't
*  give a shit.
*  You're a man of principle. I like it.
*  Mark Maron wrote something about your book many, many, many ages ago, Life of the Party.
*  I think there's an interesting question in there.
*  So first of all, wrote eloquently about you.
*  Burke Reicher is one of the great American wild men, a gonzo warrior driven not by cynicism
*  or desire to reveal dark truths, but instead by a deep, almost essential need to have a good time,
*  no matter what. His stories track the trials and tribulations of a big hearted dude trying to
*  fit in, help out and party and find himself. After all is said and done,
*  we arrive with him at the true humility of joy.
*  When was this desire for pure joy born in you? It seems like you are driven towards this joy.
*  Yeah.
*  I think I arrived at it in college. I wasn't always the guy I am. I was really a pretty
*  serious dude when I got to college.
*  Like dark brooding serious?
*  Yeah. I wanted to be like Eddie Vedder. I wanted to be like a poet and a fucking lead singer.
*  And I wanted to be taken seriously and I wanted to be attractive and I wanted to be
*  you know, like I wanted to be wanted by chicks and respected by dudes and you know,
*  and slowly but surely I think the bird I really am chipped away at that and was like,
*  hey man, like I would say funny things that would surprise me they were so funny. Meaning like
*  in my fraternity, I'd say things that were the funniest thing that I go, how did I think of that?
*  And then slowly I was like, and I remember as I chipped away at that and as I got older,
*  I would lean towards that we would go on a bus trip to like Clemson and I would get on the
*  walkie talkie on the bus and I would do stand up for like an hour. I just make jokes for an hour.
*  And I loved the impulse of like, you know, you get on the bus and everyone's like,
*  we're gonna drink and you get that one group of girls that wasn't gonna drink
*  and then to break them. And they're like, oh fuck it fine, let's drink. And then that to watch that
*  happen and I think then once I and then when I went to Russia, this is so cliche for me to say,
*  but interacting with those young banditi, they were pretty serious dudes. They didn't have like,
*  they were pretty stoic dudes. And when you could make them laugh, it was like a real joy.
*  The silliest things. I remember, you know, we were told there was a club, it was called Cafe
*  Europa or maybe Cafe Americana. Those were where everyone really hung out, like all the real dudes,
*  the real dudes in St. Petersburg. And they had told us that like, they told us in our class that
*  Russian women didn't have tampons. So they were like, bring tampons to give to the babushka,
*  the dvuchka that ran the floor. After all this time, the fact that you're Russian sucks is awesome.
*  Yeah. You keep mispronouncing words horribly. Horribly. I'm so fucking bad. I am so bad. You
*  know, that's how I got the name of the machine, right? Yeah. I was trying to say I'm a machine.
*  Yeah. And I said I'm a car. Yeah. And they just were like, huh?
*  And so I came into the room one night with a top pocket full of tampons. Yeah. And they were like,
*  what are those for? I said, girls, how are we going to pick up girls? And the look on their face was
*  so, it was so pure joy. I remember the first night I pulled out lemons. And this is, it sounds make
*  believe now to say it because it's been in the movie. And I brought out lemons, we were in lemon
*  drops. I had vodka and lemons and sugar and a pocket knife and a fanny pack. And I put out lemons
*  and this guy Igor goes, oh, the machine runs on lemons. Like it was just so foreign that you
*  would need lemon for them. And so I think, and I made friends with those guys, like friends,
*  whatever you can, but like definitely me and that guy Igor were legit friends. Legit friends.
*  But from a place of joy, like bringing joy to life. Yeah. It was like real. Seeing them light up.
*  And then I remember backpacking through Europe after that and realizing I could bring a spark
*  of fun to like a campfire. And I had little tricks. Like I learned all the currencies around
*  the world. And so I, I challenged people to a currency game. I go, let's go head to head. You
*  say, you, you name a country in the currency and I'll name a country in the currency. And I would,
*  I would slow roll them. I just do all the dollars, right? The Chinese dollar, the American dollar,
*  the Australian dollar. I run through all the dollars and they'd be like, you only know the
*  dollars. And then I, and then I get, start getting really deep. I could make an event out of a night
*  in, in Europe. I could make an event. I remember we were in a Strausburg and the bar was supposed
*  to close, but I had friends coming to the bar. They had the train hadn't gotten in yet. And I said,
*  I said, don't close the bar. I'll stand on the bar and I'll entertain everyone in this room. I'll
*  dance. I'll do whatever. If you just keep the bar open. And the guy goes, if you can keep me laughing,
*  I'll keep the bar open. And I danced and, and made this guy laugh on a bar for legit. I'm not even
*  like legit 30 minutes until my friends walked in and they're like, what the fuck's going on?
*  I had this ability to, to, to, without humility, I hadn't mind looking like a fool and like doing,
*  and there were really stupid jokes at the time, just very like base American frat boy jokes.
*  But I had a spark. And when I came back, I feel, I feel like I learned how to like,
*  to do that and do funny things that were like fun. Like I would, we go to a football game
*  and I'd, I'd, I brought a camera around with me a lot. I like to take pictures.
*  And I remember one of the jokes I'd go is I go, Hey, everybody, I told my parents, I have a lot
*  of friends. Can you guys gather around and we'll take a picture? And so like 50 people would lean
*  around like, Hey, and like just the dumbest silliest things. And, and, and, and I, and I
*  wasn't a big self promoter. So these would happen. And I would just, I was just doing them for me and
*  my friends. I'd bring a guitar out and I just make up songs. And, and, uh, and, and so I think in,
*  in watching this, this serious Bert get chipped away at until my like six and a half year of
*  college where it was just this silly guy and then Rolling Stones written about me. And I'm like,
*  and then I'm like, and I remember a couple serious dads going, yo, you got a chance to turn this into
*  something. You need to go to new, you need to follow your dream. And I tried to stand up the
*  first night and I was like, I maybe not, wasn't the funniest guy, but man, they laughed and we had a
*  good time for 30 minutes and it worked and it was stream of consciousness. And I was like, yeah.
*  And then of course, you know, that same little path you take gets convoluted in, in, in New York,
*  cause you want to be a serious comic and you want to be taken seriously and you want to be edgy.
*  And you want to say the, and then slowly but surely that you're the real Bert chips away at it.
*  And he's like, yo, man, just fucking take your shirt off, kill a beer. Like fucking tell the
*  machine story. Tell a story about your stupid kids. Like just, you don't need to be the fucking edgiest
*  dude in the room. Leave that to the good ones. Let, let Bill and fucking Joe and Tom, they're the,
*  those are the legit fucking gangster comics. They're, I mean, those are the fucking,
*  I'm, you're never going to out fucking Chappelle. Those, those guys are fucking gangsters. Do what
*  you do. Have fun, make life fun and seize the day and fucking try to bring a spark to people
*  and let them forget about their fucking day. And the, the interesting thing about alcohol that I've,
*  I don't really like drinking in terms of the actual physical, like how it makes me feel,
*  but there's the, the camaraderie that happens. I wish there was another way to get there,
*  but I don't think there is that joy you get of just everybody getting together and taking shots
*  or drinking, not the polite kind of drinking, but just everybody just the fuck it kind of drinking.
*  Yeah. And when someone goes, all right, I'm in like that, that's the funnest. And then especially
*  when you have a big group and there's like a big group and like we were at the premiere the other
*  night and, and, and I was working, I was legit working. I do, I'm trying to sell the movie to
*  outlets, media outlets and bust them with the boys. My wife flew them in to surprise me
*  and they're over on the red carpet and they're like, yo, let's, let's skull a beer. Let's kill a beer.
*  And I was like, oh, and then I'm like, oh, fuck it. I don't give a, this is what life's about.
*  And that moment where they're like, yeah, that's the funnest fucking, especially when I can get
*  Leanne to do it. When I get Leanne to get a drink and she'll, and she's like, like I wasn't supposed
*  to drink last night. And she was like, you want to just, we still have a glass of wine in the front
*  yard. And you're like, oh, my heart skipped a beat. I go glass of wine in the front yard. Are we
*  going to talk wild? Are we going to say crazy shit to each other? Like fuck. Yeah. The front yard,
*  front yard. Yeah. You're doing the front yard. Let the dogs play big trees in the front yard.
*  Why are you sitting on the, where were you sitting? Sitting in the, in the Adirondacks on the front
*  porch, letting the dogs play, letting the dogs rest in the front yard. Maybe go over, pick some
*  cherries, look at the fucking trees, hear the wind going through the front yard. And then you go to
*  the backyard. That's where the cigar comes out a little more privacy, but yeah, red wine, red wine,
*  maw back. Keep our sulfites low. Yeah. Wine is a whole nother one too. I feel sophisticated. Oh yeah.
*  I've, I've went, I traveled, um, before Ukraine, I went to Paris for the first time and drank wine
*  there. And I felt like I was a sophisticated man, you know, dude, I mean, I speak much French,
*  but you don't need to, you don't need to just start smoking too. Just have a fucking cigarette.
*  I was going to start writing poetry, dude, and Hemingway. There's a, like a glass of wine in
*  Italy and like, uh, like I just thought like we went, we went, ah, the most beautiful fucking day
*  of my life. Just outside Florence, they have all the vineyards and stuff. And we took a Vespa tour
*  and, uh, and it was fucking, and Isla's too young to ride. So she's on the back and now everyone can
*  drink there. You know, you're not supposed to drink and drive Vespas, but they don't, they go,
*  a glass of wine is nothing. And you're like, okay, I guess I'll have a couple then. If you think one's
*  nothing, then I think two's nothing also. So this is drunk Burt on a Vespa. Drunk, not even drunk,
*  but just lightly, lightly feathered where, and it's beautiful. My wife hasn't been drinking.
*  Georgia has, Georgia's too young. Isla is too young, but I had dinner, we had a couple
*  and we're going through these hills and it starts raining and it starts raining. And I go, Isla,
*  what are we missing? And she goes, music, big boy. And I go, what do you want to hear? And then she
*  just starts going, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga. I can't stop this feeling. She's
*  screaming it behind. And then I hear Georgia screaming it and then Leanne singing it. And then
*  Sandy and her two daughters are singing it. We're all in these Vespas and we're all singing it.
*  And I swear to God, if I hadn't been lightly feathered, I don't know if I would have been
*  like, Isla, what are we missing? Cause you know, alcohol will give you that thing. Like what's next?
*  What's bigger? How do we take this to the next level? And then I got this little girl
*  who's still my little girl at that moment when she's singing, sing it. All the good times,
*  give me not so hard. And then we stop at the light and all of us are looking and it's pouring rain.
*  I mean, I remember sobbing, crying, sobbing, crying, sobbing, crying. And then I was like,
*  let's get these fucking Vespas up and get to a vineyard. And then we went to a vineyard and
*  all the girls tried a little wine. No one got buzzed or anything, but you're just sitting there
*  with your family going like, fuck dude. And I'm not certain you get that without a little bit of.
*  A little bit. But then a lot is also interesting. I had a lot of whiskey with Rogan once.
*  I think I saw that.
*  Yeah.
*  I think I saw that with Whitney too, and the push-up concert contest.
*  With David Goggins. The only time I met David Goggins in person,
*  one of the great embarrassments of my life is trashed out of my mind. I'm trying to say how
*  much of a fan I am. And I could tell by the look in his eye that what is actually coming out of my
*  mouth is not good. It's not good. And his wife is embarrassed standing right there also. Just
*  everybody's embarrassed for me. And I'm trying my best. And then somehow I find myself a minute
*  later doing push-ups with him as a challenge. I wasn't counting. All I knew I'm not stopping.
*  And he was polite enough to stop. I think probably like 50, I don't know.
*  There's a gift someone gives you when they get drunk and they allow you. They get drunk and they
*  lower their guard and they allow you to see them that way. It's a gift. It's a real gift.
*  It's just as cool as pulling someone aside and going, yo, I'm into anime. Are you cool with that?
*  And then they're going, yeah, can I show you some cool anime? And then you're like, that's not my
*  thing. But it's like a cool thing. It's like sharing cool music with someone or telling them
*  something about your childhood. When you get drunk, real drunk around someone, you're giving
*  them a gift. And that gift is, I want you to see me for everything I am. You're not going to get
*  any lies. You're not going to get any bullshit. This is me at my absolute worst. I have a rule.
*  I will never, never get mad at someone for getting too fucked up.
*  Because they're giving you a gift. They're saying like, yo, I did this on accident,
*  but I trust you enough to let you know that this is who I am and this is what you're getting.
*  I love it. I love it. Especially when it comes to someone you don't expect like you.
*  Shut the fuck up. David Gawkins should have hugged you and said, thanks for showing me this.
*  Yeah. I guess that really haven't, you're right. I haven't thought of it that way.
*  There's an intimacy to that. That is a gift of like fragility. Like this is me. I mean,
*  I'm a very loving drunk, but I'm, boy, am I a dumb drunk. I'm just dumb.
*  I bet you haven't seen dumb drunk. Well, dumb in terms of the eloquence of the
*  words that are coming out of my mouth. So like, you're just not stitching words together correctly
*  to make sentences. No. I turn into Hemingway Lawson translation. Like I'll start saying random
*  words, but like translated to Japanese and back to English. It's not making sense,
*  but there's love. Like I think what you feel is this kind of desire to connect that I think I
*  always feel towards other people, but when I'm drunk, I'm just say, fuck it. I don't need to be
*  polite. I'll just be loving fully. Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, it's cool when people let you see that
*  in them because some people are really like measured, like no one drink and then I'm done.
*  I don't want to know. And you're like, Oh, show me a little more. And then like, it's cool. And I
*  never get like, I love my favorite moments in the next morning when they're like, do I make an ass
*  out of myself? And you get to say, not at all. Yeah. Not at all. That's the coolest thing.
*  Cause some people, bad people will leverage that over. Yeah. You can, you can see it's a
*  bully tactic. They'll leverage that the bad interactions I've had with in this business
*  that we were talking about earlier. They were people that, that when you got fucked up,
*  they used it against you. They held it over your head and they said, listen, man,
*  I don't know what the fuck, but if you want, and you're like, hold on. And then, and then they
*  made you, they gaslight you into thinking you were the only one that was fucked up. And you're like,
*  okay, I guess I know who you are now. And I was like, didn't you get fucked up a little bit too?
*  Like, I know we smoked weed and I thought we ate Xanax, but like, what about the,
*  I know I had a couple beers, but like, I wasn't that fucked up.
*  Well, Whitney is really good at that because she's the person I woke up next morning and she
*  said, yeah, you're wonderful. You were eloquent. You were great. I, I'm sure she was making that
*  up completely. It was funny. I got blackout drunk at Whitney's roast of me, like blackout drunk.
*  Don't remember any of it. And don't remember any of it. Don't remember speaking on the microphone.
*  I don't remember talking in the microphone. And, and I, I, I did the set apparently. Yeah.
*  And I said to Whitney, like in a real moment of vulnerability, Whitney's like a sister to me,
*  like a legit sister. My daughter's called her aunt Whitney, Leanne, she's like a sister to Leanne.
*  If she comes over to do a podcast, Whitney will show up an hour early and sit with Leanne out in
*  Leanne's Rose garden and just talk. And Whitney, I, I said the next day I called Whitney and I was
*  getting on a plane and I was, knew I was hungover. I said, how bad was I last night? She goes, you
*  were fucking fantastic. And just didn't let me sit with it. And then I watched the video and I was
*  like, oh, I was fucking out of control. I was way out of control. Thank you for lying to me.
*  Yeah. So while being a wild out there comic, she's also this like caring and loving human being.
*  So interesting. She is, she has the most nurturing sensibility. She is, she sends my daughter's gifts
*  out of nowhere, just out of nowhere. They send Georgia gifts up at college. It's just a gift
*  box. Like she is just, she takes care of people. That's her love language. And she's also the person
*  that taught me what, what the hell love language even means. Apparently there's a book and there's
*  like five of them. Oh, you and Whitney, I would love to sit in a fucking room and watch you two talk.
*  Yeah. She has a robot that looks like her. And, um, that's the future. That robot.
*  I told her she should have that robot do porn. Let someone fuck that robot. And then, and she,
*  she had deep fake the face if she wants, but I go promoted, promoted special that way.
*  Like a full on, not like showtime soft core porn, like full on porn.
*  Full on like to do like, she's like, hi, welcome inside. You look tired. Do you need a drink?
*  Yeah. Oops. I'm stuck in the dryer. You know,
*  what's the promotion you're most proud of that you've done
*  without a doubt. It's gotta be when I took dance lessons. Yeah, that was epic because I tried to
*  get Joe and Tom and Ari to do it for sober October. I was rooting for you. And they said, no,
*  Joe's like, absolutely not. I knew Joe was going to say no, but Joe's a legit dancer.
*  Like he can legit dance. He took like dance lessons for a movie and is apparently an amazing
*  dancer. And so you're right. He could have said yes. He could have said yes. Cause I remember
*  listening to that podcast where you really made the pitch. Yeah. And I said, we all take hip hop
*  dance lessons. It's your cardio is through the roof. And those, you do an hour dance lesson,
*  then we all do a hip hop dance. And then we all put our hip hop dances against each other. And we
*  see who has the best hip hop dance. It's different than the typical stuff we do. It's fun. And we
*  can also work out, we can do everything, but like, let's do hip hop dance. And Joe adamantly was
*  like, that's a horrible idea. I will not do that. And then, and then Tom and Ari just, you know,
*  just whatever they were like, yeah, I side with Joe, we'll do something else. And then I was like,
*  I knew I liked hip hop dance. And so I was like, I'm gonna take hip hop dance lessons anyway. I'm
*  gonna just do it over sober October. And I'm just gonna, I'm gonna fucking do it. And then maybe,
*  maybe I'll do a hip hop dance video and then show it to them and let them rate me. And then we did
*  it. And I, and it was $1,200 and I, for hip hop dance lessons for like a month or whatever,
*  for like a couple of weeks. And then when we did it, I thought, you know what, I bet we could put
*  tour dates next to this. Cause it's, it turned out being like kind of good, but kind of funny.
*  I got, but we could put tour dates next to this. And it was the beginning of me figuring out
*  the whole, like my promos were short and quick and they were always like something silly. What's up
*  guys? It's your boy, Bert Kreischer. And then that one blew up and immediate, I was announcing the
*  tour and immediately every tour date sold out. And then every, we added shows that day, we added
*  shows and every one of those sold out. And I was like, whoa. And then Tom was like, the fuck was
*  that? And I was like, I think I just sold out my whole fucking tour. And, and then Tom, and then
*  when Tom did his one like that and put his tour dates on it, went over the top, he sold out his
*  tours. And he was like, whoa. He's like, dude, I sold out every fucking show we've added shows.
*  I'm doing like an arena here. And this is before we were doing arenas. I was like, shut the fuck up.
*  And that changed my game where I was like, all right, so everything's gotta be. And then,
*  and then I was like, I don't mind spending a little money. And then the next one I did was
*  the marching band. And I was just like, and, but it was, you know, it's real crazy. I just said,
*  can you guys get me a marching band? And they were like, yeah, it's like, it's like 2400 bucks. I go
*  cool. And they're like, what do you want them to do? And I go, I don't know. We'll figure it out.
*  And they came over and they had outfits and they were like, so where do you want us to play? I
*  go, what song do you guys know? And then they didn't even know each other. They were all hired
*  people and they were like rubber band man. And I was like, oh, sure. Yeah. And then we just
*  scripted it out. I was like, all right, I'll pretend it's a regular thing. Let's go wait till
*  walk out and then I'll blow a whistle. And then you come out with the, and then, and then we,
*  we got like two videos out of that and that sold out dates. And then I was like, fuck.
*  And then, and then, and then, and then, and then the real baller one, the fucking real one,
*  the real one was I tore all the muscles in my arm going into, in shooting the movie. And I ripped
*  all the tricep muscles off and they were retracted. So I had to go in for surgery.
*  And the anesthesiologist said to me the night before he's like, what music do you want going
*  in, going under? And I was like, what? And he goes, you can pick your music going under.
*  I said, wait, hold on. What is it? Like, he goes, I go, is it like casual? And he was like, yeah.
*  I said, I'm doing a promo read going under. He goes, what do you mean? I said, I'll explain
*  it to you tomorrow, but I'm going to, I'm not going to count backwards. I'm just going to do
*  a promo read until I pass out and my phone's going to fall on the ground. All I need you to do is hit
*  stop record. And so they rolled me into surgery. I had Red Rocks. I had only sold like 75% of Red
*  Rocks, which is the biggest 10,000, the biggest venue that I'd ever played in. And I rolled in
*  with my thing with CCR playing in the background. And I just was like, as I lay here on this mat,
*  or on this steel pile, terrified as I go into surgery, I want you to know one thing. I'm playing
*  Red Rocks September 10th. And I started doing my promo read and he was like, yeah, I go,
*  Jimmy Buffett's there the night before and the night after. He's like, for real? I go, yeah,
*  you want to come? He's like, hell yeah. He's like, all right. He's like, you're going under.
*  And he hits it. I go, oh, sure. And I dropped the phone, woke up at a surgery. And the first thing
*  I said is, where's my phone? And he goes, you got it. And Leanne's like, I've already watched it.
*  It's good. And I went, for real? And so like, that was a, that was a, that was a, that was a big one.
*  That was a big one too. Yeah, that was genius. But that was sort of opportunity, kind of jumping
*  in an idea. Have you ever met Mr. Beast, Jimmy? No. So he, he's, I got to hang out with him for
*  a day, listen to brainstorm with the team ideas. He kind of sounds like you, but on steroids in
*  terms of like, first of all, willing to spend any amount of money on an idea. Like anything,
*  anything is allowed. Anything is allowed. I love that energy. The only thing is no like rated R
*  stuff. So he's really trying to go like, for the broader audience, for kids and so on. So that's
*  the limitation. So you can't do, like most of the ideas that pop into my head when anything's allowed
*  is kind of dark. But the point is to really aggressively brainstorm every single day at the
*  Y board. Like what, and he does that for YouTube shorts too, for one minute videos. Really? And
*  just like really like, what is the coolest thing we could possibly do? I love that. I love that
*  energy. And that energy, most people don't do that. And they should basically YouTubers do that
*  because they're obsessed about this particular YouTube algorithm and so on. And Jimmy is the
*  best at that, but like that can benefit you if you're a scientist, if you're a comedian,
*  if you're whatever, just go all out. There's something really authentically fun about
*  just coming up with a really stupid idea and just going, let's see what happens. Who gives a fuck?
*  We've had those, like, I thought I could catch an arrow one time. And my wife's like,
*  absolutely fucking not. And I go, I really think I can. I go, let's just get really close, shoot it.
*  And then I'll see if I can catch it. And she's like, no, that's not what you're doing. And then
*  my cousin's like, hey, we could cheat it to make you look like you caught an arrow. And I went,
*  what? He was like, okay, let's do it like this. And so we did it. And I sold a ton of tickets.
*  It looked like I really caught it. Everyone knows I didn't catch an arrow. I mean, for the movie,
*  we did a promo. Legendary was like, you do all the promos. And we did a promo and I thought I could
*  slide out of my car like Tom Cruise did in a helicopter and with roller skates and get behind
*  the car and then skate behind the car. And we just ran over my foot. And it was real and it was
*  scary. But we just caught it all. And in doing it, my cousin's like, give me the read. And I'm like,
*  my movie comes out Memorial Day weekend. I think we have to go to the hospital. And then we went
*  to the hospital and I'm in a Speedo with a helmet on, one broken roller skate. And then that did
*  really well. And so like I said, the whole thing is just turn the camera on. You never know what's
*  going to fucking happen. And don't be afraid to look stupid and all that kind of stuff. Just go
*  all out. Fucking ego is the death of comedy. Like when you really give, like, it's hard to be the
*  coolest guy in the room and still want to be a comedian. It's just let yourself be whoever you
*  are. And you'll see the great ones. They're like that. They don't, they're just regular fucking
*  dudes. And you get some real slick ones. Like Dave's probably might be the coolest guy in the
*  fucking room. He might really might be. But I think that's just who the fuck he is.
*  Who are the outside your close friend group? Who are the greats to you? Top five.
*  Outside of my friend group. So like for me, probably Norm McDonald, Mitch Hedberg,
*  George Carlin, Thompson Gore, number one. Oh yeah. No, I wanted to say that. It's an interesting
*  pairing. No, Mitch Hedberg, David Tell, David Tell, every, everybody deeply respects David.
*  More than even his comedy. I love the show where he was insomniac. He's so good at just
*  the natural comedy of human interaction. He's a brilliant comic. He's just a brilliant fucking
*  mind. Norm McDonald's fucking genius, an absolute genius. I mean, look, you know,
*  Chappelle and Bill Burr are the two best in our generation, in my opinion. And that's,
*  you know, and that's understanding that like, I'm still friends with some of the best in our
*  generation, but like just the way their brains work is really on a next level. Like, you know,
*  those are guys, Stan Hope is the same way. Just fucking genius. You know, Rogan, Segura,
*  those are my friend group. That's my really close friend group. But like those other guys,
*  but they're not like, that's like, yeah. Louis CK. Oh, Louis CK. Fuck, he's amazing.
*  It's hard to do because you start like forgetting the people and then it's almost like people go,
*  oh, so you didn't like that person? You're like, no, I fucking love that person.
*  Yeah. I mean, there's, for me, like Robin Williams, which is a whole nother thing.
*  Oh, yeah. Sarah Silverman. Fucking, I love Janine. I'm a fucking big Janine fan. I love her
*  brain. Marin's fucking hilarious. You know, Patton's brilliant. David Cross. I mean, there's like,
*  it's, you know, it's really to ignore those guys. And those guys were like the whole forefront of
*  the alternative comedy front. They're fucking amazing. Yeah. And the people that have like
*  Marin or Joe that have podcasts, it's interesting. It's an interesting pairing because you get to
*  know like everything about them, but then they're also comedians. And I've gotten, I've gone to Joe's
*  club a lot. I listen to Joe and just that whole group of comics do comedy and go to the same set
*  over and over and over and to see how it changes. It's really cool. It's the coolest thing. When I
*  first started to watch someone like a tell was really brilliant at it because you'd watch him
*  tinker with a set. Yeah. And he'd have an idea like hitting someone over the head with a hammer from
*  behind and then he'd work it nine different ways, you know, and you'd be like, whoa. So the hitting
*  hammer in the head is the thing that he's working on. I hope Eddie Murphy comes back.
*  He's one of the greats. Chris Rock. Chris Rock's fucking bring the pain is like the reason I got
*  in comedy. Yeah. Do you have advice for young folks? You seem like a stellar example of a
*  successful human being or more seriously a very kind of nonlinear life. Do you have advice for
*  young people in high school and college? How to have a good life that can be proud of.
*  Don't worry too much about what you do when you get older.
*  But when you do start worrying, find the thing you love and it'll never feel like work.
*  The to fucking I can't imagine what it must feel like to be a lawyer and have to read papers or
*  whatever they do all day and know that that's my day. I mean, it must feel like what I was
*  school felt like for me. If you find that thing you love to do, you will work endlessly,
*  effortlessly and hard as fucking shit every day and you'll love every day of your life.
*  Find what you love and let it kill you. Bukowski said that.
*  Then that's the fucking thing because that's what I'm doing. I'm letting it fucking take. I'm
*  fucking I'm on that fucking bullet train to fucking nowhere on this fucking comedy journey.
*  I love it. I love it. So it's like the Hunter S. Thompson thing. What is it? However you put it,
*  basically you're not supposed to be end up in a well-preserved box. You slide in sideways,
*  smoke, just beat up. Yeah. Just a giant mess. I love those guys that can really live that life
*  that are like, yeah, man, I'm breaking it. I'm breaking it down like a guy like Tony Hawk or
*  Matt Hoffman. They're like, yeah, if I don't fucking break the fuck out of this thing before
*  I, then I'm not doing it right. Then again, there's also Churchill who tried to break the
*  thing and he couldn't, lived into his nineties, a bad motherfucker. Just a bad motherfucker.
*  So I guess the only hope we can have for Burk Chrysler is that you're going to be the Winston
*  Churchill of comedy. My life is lived perfectly. If I'm 95 years old and all my friends are dead,
*  they're like, can you believe that Wolf got Rogan? Yeah. Can you believe Segura,
*  600 pounds and they had to carry him out in a crane out of that house?
*  Can you believe that it's just Burk Chrysler and Joey Diaz left?
*  Just standing there in October. So October, just the two of you left. Just laughing.
*  I'm 95 at the Mark Twain awards and they're like, Burk Chrysler, still fucking here. Who saw that
*  coming? I hope so. Bert, I'm a huge fan of yours. It meant so much to me when you said that you knew
*  who I was, like we were talking about. It just, it's so cool. It's so cool. Thank you for putting
*  so much joy and love out there in the world. I'm a huge fan and thank you for the love you've given
*  me. Thank you, man. I am a huge fan of yours. You keep doing you. I'll keep doing me. And then
*  let's see if we can meet in the middle sometime and have a cold beer in the afternoon. Love you,
*  brother. Love you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Burk Chrysler. To support this
*  podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some
*  words from Hunter S. Thompson. Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving
*  safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skin in broadside in a cloud of smoke,
*  thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, wow, what a ride.
*  Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
