# Norman Naimark: Genocide, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and Absolute Power | Lex Fridman Podcast #248
**Lex Fridman:** [December 12, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vrz8YDl9CeA)
*  The following is a conversation with Norman Neymarck, a historian at Stanford specializing in genocide, war, and empire.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now here's my conversation with Norman Neymarck.
*  Did Stalin believe that communism was good, not just for him, but for the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the world?
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  I mean, Stalin believed that, you know, socialism was the be-all and end-all of, you know, human existence.
*  He was a true Leninist.
*  And in Lenin's tradition, this was, you know, what he believed.
*  I mean, that set of beliefs didn't exclude other kinds of things he believed or thought or did.
*  But no, the way he defined socialism, the way he thought about socialism, you know, he absolutely thought it was interesting.
*  He believed that it was the best of the Soviet Union and of the world.
*  And in fact, that the world was one day going to go socialist.
*  In other words, I think he believed in eventually in the international revolution.
*  So given the genocide in the 1930s that you described, was Stalin evil, delusional or incompetent?
*  Evil, delusional or incompetent?
*  One of those words, you know, which has a lot of kind of religious and moral connotations.
*  And in that sense, yes, I think he was an evil man.
*  I mean, he, you know, eliminated people absolutely unnecessarily.
*  He tortured people, had people tortured.
*  He was completely indifferent to the suffering of others.
*  He couldn't have carried a wit, you know, that millions were suffering.
*  And so, yes, I consider him an evil man.
*  I mean, you know, historians don't like to use the word evil.
*  It's a, you know, it's a word for moral philosophers.
*  But I think it certainly fits who he is.
*  I think he was delusional.
*  And there is a wonderful historian in Princeton, a political scientist actually, named
*  Robert Tucker, who said he suffered from a paranoid delusional system.
*  And I always remember that of Tucker's writing, because
*  what Tucker meant is that he was not just paranoid, meaning, you know, I'm paranoid,
*  I'm worried you're out to get me, right?
*  But that he constructed a whole
*  plots of people, a whole systems of people who were out to get him.
*  So, in other words, his delusions were that there were all of these groups of people out
*  there who were out to diminish his power and remove him and remove him
*  from his position and undermine the Soviet Union, in his view.
*  So, yes, I think he did suffer from from delusions.
*  And this had a huge effect because whole groups then were destroyed by his by his
*  activities, which he would construct based on on these delusions.
*  He was not incompetent.
*  He was an extremely competent man.
*  I mean, I think most of the research that's
*  gone on, especially since the Stalin archive was opened at the beginning of the century.
*  And I think almost every historian who goes in that archive comes away from it
*  with the feeling of a man who is enormously hardworking, intelligent,
*  you know, with an acute sense of politics, a really excellent sense of,
*  you know, political rhetoric, a fantastic editor,
*  you know, in a kind of agitational sense.
*  I mean, he's a real agitator, right?
*  And of a, you know, a really hard worker.
*  I mean, somebody who works from morning till night, a micromanager in some ways.
*  So his competence, I think, was really extreme.
*  Now, there were times when that fell down, you know, times in the 30s, times in the 20s,
*  times during the war where he made mistakes.
*  It's not as if he didn't make any mistakes.
*  But I think, you know, you look at his stuff, you know, you look at his archives,
*  you look what he did. I mean, this is an enormously competent man who in many,
*  many different areas of enterprise, because he, you know, he had this notion
*  that he should know everything and did know everything.
*  I remember one archive, D'Ela, it's called, you know, a kind of folder that I looked
*  at where he actually went through the wines that were produced in his native Georgia
*  and wrote down how much they should make of each of these wines, you know,
*  how many, you know, barrels they should they should produce of these wines,
*  which grapes were better than the other grapes, sort of correcting, in other words,
*  what people were putting down there.
*  So he was, you know, his competence ranged very wide,
*  or at least he thought his competence ranged very wide.
*  I mean, both things, I think, are the case.
*  If we look at this paranoid delusional system, Stalin was in power for 30 years.
*  He is, many argue, one of the most powerful men in history.
*  Did, in his case, absolute power corrupt him or did it reveal the true nature
*  of the man and maybe just in your sense, as we kind of build around this genocide
*  of the early 1930s, this paranoid delusional system, did it get built up over time?
*  Was it always there?
*  It's kind of a question of
*  did the genocide, was that always inevitable, essentially, in this man,
*  or did power create that?
*  I mean, it's a great question.
*  And I don't think you can I don't think you can say that it was always
*  kind of inherent in the man.
*  I mean, the man without his position and without his power,
*  wouldn't have been able to accomplish what he eventually did in the way
*  of murdering people, murdering groups of people, which is what genocide is.
*  So, you know, I don't I it wasn't sort of in him.
*  I mean, there were and again, the new research has shown that, you know,
*  his childhood was not a particularly nasty one.
*  People used to say, you know, the father beat beat him up.
*  And it turns out actually it wasn't the father was a mother once in a while.
*  But but basically, you know, he was not an unusual young Georgian kid or student even.
*  And, you know, it was it was the growth of the Soviet system and him
*  within the Soviet system, I mean, his own development within the Soviet system,
*  I think that led, you know, to the kind of mass killing that occurred in the 1930s.
*  You know, he essentially achieved complete power by the early 1930s.
*  And then as he as he rolled with it, as you would say, you know, people would say,
*  you know, it increasingly became murderous.
*  And there was no,
*  you know, there were no checks and balances, obviously, on that that murderous system.
*  And not only that, you know, people supported it in the NKVD and elsewhere.
*  He learned how to manipulate people.
*  I mean, he was a superb, you know,
*  political manipulator of of of those people around him.
*  And,
*  you know, we have we've got new transcripts, for example, of, you know,
*  Politburo meetings in the early 1930s.
*  And you read those things and you know, he uses humor and he uses sarcasm,
*  especially he uses verbal ways to undermine people, you know, to control
*  their behavior and what they do.
*  And he's a really, you know, he's a real,
*  I guess, manipulator is the right word.
*  And he does it.
*  He does it with,
*  you know, a kind of skill that on the one hand is admirable and on the other hand,
*  of course, is is terrible because it ends up, you know,
*  creating the system of terror that he creates.
*  I mean, I guess just to linger on it, I just wonder how much of it is a slippery
*  slope in the early 20s, 1920s,
*  did he think he was going to be murdering even a single person, but
*  thousands and millions?
*  I just wonder.
*  Maybe the murder of a single human being just to get them,
*  you know, because you're paranoid about them potentially threatening your power,
*  does that murder and open a door?
*  And once you open the door, you become a different human being.
*  A deeper question here is the soldier
*  Knitzen, you know, the line between good and evil runs in every man.
*  Are all of us once we commit one murder in the situation, does that open a door
*  for all of us? And I guess even the further deeper
*  questions, how easy it is for human nature to go on the slippery slope that ends in genocide?
*  There are a lot of questions in those in those questions.
*  And, you know, the slippery slope question that I would I would answer,
*  I suppose, by saying,
*  you know, Stalin wasn't the most likely successor of Lenin.
*  There were plenty of others.
*  There was there were a lot of political
*  contingencies that emerged in the 1920s that made it possible for Stalin to seize power.
*  I don't think of him as a, you know, if you would just know him in 1925,
*  I don't think anybody would say much less himself that this was a future mass murderer.
*  I mean, Trotsky mistrusted him and thought he was, you know,
*  a mindless bureaucrat.
*  You know, others were less mistrustful of him.
*  But, you know, he managed to gain power
*  in the way he did through this bureaucratic and political maneuvering
*  that was very successful.
*  You know, the slippery slope, as it were,
*  doesn't really begin until the 1930s, in my view.
*  In other words, once once he gains complete power and control of the Politburo,
*  once the the the
*  programs that he institutes of the five year plan and collectivization go through,
*  once he reverses himself and is able to reverse himself or reverse the Soviet path,
*  you know, to give various nationalities their, you know, their ability to develop
*  their own cultures and sort of internal politics.
*  Once he reverses all that, you know, you have the Ukrainian famine in 32, 33.
*  You have the murder of Kirov, who is one of the leading figures,
*  you know, in the political system.
*  You have the suicide of his wife.
*  You have all these things come together in 32, 33 that then, you know,
*  make it more likely, in other words, that bad things are going to happen.
*  And people start seeing that too around him.
*  They start seeing that it's not a slippery slope.
*  It's a it's a dangerous.
*  It's a dangerous situation,
*  which is emerging, and some people really understand that.
*  So I don't I really do see a differentiation then between the 20s.
*  I mean, it's true that Stalin during the Civil War, there's a lot of good research
*  on that, you know, shows that he already had some of these characteristics of being,
*  as it were, murderous and being, you know, being
*  dictatorial and pushing people around and that sort of thing.
*  And that was all there.
*  But I don't I don't really see that as kind of the necessary stage for the next
*  thing that came, which was the 30s, which was really terror of the worst sort,
*  you know, where everybody is afraid for their lives and most people are afraid
*  for their lives and their families lives and where torture and that sort of thing
*  becomes a common part, you know, of who what people had to face.
*  So it's a different it's a different world.
*  And people will argue, they'll argue this kind of Lenin-Stalin continuity debate.
*  You know, that's been going on since I was an undergraduate.
*  Right. That that that argument, you know,
*  was Stalin the natural sort of next step from Lenin or was he something completely
*  different? Many people will argue, you know, because of Marxism, Leninism,
*  because of the ideology that, you know, it was it was the natural it was a kind
*  of natural next step. I don't think so.
*  You know, I would I would tend to lean the other way.
*  Not absolutely. I mean, I won't make an absolute argument
*  that what Stalin became had nothing to do with Lenin and nothing to do with
*  Marxism, Leninism, it had a lot to do with it.
*  But, you know, he takes it one one major step further.
*  And again, that's why I don't like the slippery slope, you know, metaphor,
*  because that means a leap of slow and easy. It's a leap.
*  And we call, you know, I mean,
*  historians talk about the Stalin revolution, you know, in twenty eight and twenty nine,
*  you know, that he in some senses creates a whole new system, you know,
*  through the five year plan, collectivization and seizing political power the way he does.
*  Can you talk about the 1930s?
*  Can you describe what happened in Horda Mora,
*  the Soviet terror famine in Ukraine in the 32 and 33?
*  Yes. So millions of Ukrainians.
*  Right. It's a long story, you know, but let me try to be as succinct as I can be.
*  I mean, the Holodomor, the terror famine of 32, 33 comes out of in part
*  an all union famine that is the result of collectivization.
*  You know, collectivization was a catastrophe.
*  You know, the more or less of the so-called coolax,
*  the more or less richer farmers.
*  I mean, they weren't really rich. Right.
*  Anybody with a tin roof and a cow was considered a coolock, you know,
*  and other people who had nothing were also considered coolocks if they opposed collectivization.
*  So these coolocks were talking millions of them.
*  Right. And Ukraine, it's worth recalling.
*  And I'm sure you know, this was a heavily
*  agricultural area and Ukrainian peasants, you know, were on in the countryside and
*  resisted collectivization more than even Russian peasants resisted
*  collectivization, suffered during this collectivization program.
*  And they, you know, burned sometimes their own houses.
*  They killed their own animals.
*  They were shot, you know, sometimes on the spot.
*  Tens of thousands and others were sent into exile.
*  So there was a conflagration in the countryside.
*  And the result of that conflagration in Ukraine was terrible famine.
*  And again, there was famine all over the Soviet Union, but it was especially bad
*  in Ukraine, in part because Ukrainian peasants resisted.
*  Now, in 32, 33, a couple of things happened.
*  I mean, I've argued this in my writing and, you know, I've also worked on this.
*  I continue to work on it, by the way, with
*  with a museum in Kiev that's going to be about the Holodomor.
*  They're building the museum now and it's
*  going to be a very impressive set of exhibits and talk with historians all the time about it.
*  So what happens in 32, 33, a couple of things.
*  First of all, the Stalin develops an even stronger, I say even stronger because they
*  already had an antipathy for the Ukrainians, an even stronger antipathy
*  for the Ukrainians in general.
*  First of all, they resist collectivization.
*  Second of all, he's not getting all the grain he wants out of them and which he
*  needs, and so he sends in then people to expropriate the grain and take the grain
*  away from the peasants, these teams of people, you know, some policemen,
*  some urban thugs, some party people, some poor peasants, you know, take part to go
*  into the villages and forcibly seize grain and animals from the Ukrainian peasantry.
*  They're seizing it all over.
*  I mean, let's remember again, this is all over the Soviet Union in 32 especially.
*  Then, you know, in December of 1932, January of 33, February of 33,
*  Stalin is convinced the Ukrainian peasantry
*  needs to be shown who's boss,
*  that they're not turning over their grain, that they're resisting the expropriators,
*  that they're hiding the grain, which they do sometimes, right?
*  That they're basically not loyal to the Soviet Union, that they're acting like
*  traders, that they're ready, and he says this, you know, I think it's Kaganovych,
*  he says it too, you know, they're ready to kind of pull out of the Soviet Union
*  and join Poland. I mean, he thinks Poland is, you know, out to get Ukraine.
*  And so he's going to then essentially break the back of these peasantry.
*  And the way he breaks their back
*  is by going through another expropriation program, which is not done in the rest
*  of the Soviet Union, so he's taking away everything they have, everything they have.
*  There are new laws introduced where they will actually punish people, including
*  kids, with death if they steal any grain, you know, if they take anything from the,
*  you know, from the fields.
*  So, you know, you can shoot anybody, you know, who is looking for food.
*  And then he introduces measures in Ukraine,
*  which are not introduced into the rest of the Soviet Union.
*  For example,
*  Ukrainian peasantry are not allowed to leave their villages anymore.
*  They can't go to the city to try to find some things.
*  I mean, we've got pictures of, you know,
*  Ukrainian peasants dying on the sidewalks in Kharkiv and in Kiev and in places like
*  that who've managed to get out of the village and get to the cities.
*  But now they can't leave.
*  They can't leave Ukraine to go to Belarus today or to Russia,
*  you know, to get any food.
*  There's no, he won't allow any relief to Ukraine.
*  A number of people offer relief, including the Poles, but also the Vatican offers relief.
*  He won't allow any relief to Ukraine.
*  He won't admit that there's a famine in Ukraine.
*  And instead, what happens
*  is that Ukraine turns into the Ukrainian
*  countryside, turns into what my now
*  past colleague who died several years ago, Robert Conquest, called a vast Belsen.
*  And by that, you know, the images of bodies just lying everywhere, you know,
*  people dead and and dying, you know, of hunger, which is by the way, I mean,
*  as you know, I've spent a lot of time studying genocide.
*  I don't think there's anything worse than dying of hunger.
*  From what I have read, I mean, you see terrible ways that people die.
*  Right. But dying of hunger is just such a horrible, horrible thing.
*  And so, for example,
*  we know there were many cases of cannibalism in the countryside because there
*  wasn't anything to eat, people were eating their own kids.
*  Right. And Stalin knew about this.
*  And again, you know, we started with this question a little bit earlier.
*  He doesn't.
*  There's not a sign of remorse, not a sign of pity.
*  Right. Not a sign of any kind of human emotion that normal people would have.
*  What about the opposite of
*  joy for teaching them a lesson?
*  I don't think there's joy.
*  I'm not sure Stalin really understood emotion.
*  Joy, you know, I think he felt it was necessary to get those sob's, right,
*  that they deserved it.
*  He says that several times.
*  This is their own fault. Right.
*  This is their own fault.
*  And as their own fault, you know, they get what they deserve.
*  Basically, how much was the calculation?
*  How much was it? Reason versus emotion?
*  In terms of you said he was competent,
*  was there a long term strategy or was this strategy based on emotion and anger?
*  No, I think actually the right answer is a little of both.
*  I mean, usually the right answer in history is something like a little.
*  No, you can't. You can't.
*  It wasn't just I mean, first of all, you know, the Soviets
*  had it in for Ukraine and Ukrainian nationalism, which they really didn't like.
*  And by the way, Russians still don't like it.
*  Right.
*  So they had it in for Ukrainian nationalism.
*  They feared Ukrainian nationalism.
*  As I said, you know, Stalin, Stalin writes,
*  you know, we'll lose Ukraine, you know, if these guys win, you know.
*  So there's a kind of long term determination, as I said, you know,
*  to kind of break the back of Ukrainian national identity and Ukrainian
*  nationalism as any kind of separatist force whatsoever.
*  And so there's that rational calculation.
*  At the same time, I think Stalin is annoyed
*  and peeved and angry on one level with the Ukrainians for resisting
*  collectivization and for being difficult and for not, you know, not conforming
*  to the way he thinks peasants should act in this situation.
*  So you have both things.
*  He's also very angry at the Ukrainian
*  party and eventually purges it for not being able to control Ukraine and not be
*  able to control the situation. You know, Ukraine is in theory the bread
*  basket, right, of Europe. Well, how come the bread basket isn't
*  turning over to me all this grain so I can sell it abroad and, you know,
*  build new factories and support the workers in the cities?
*  So there's a kind of annoyance, you know, when things fail.
*  And this is absolutely typical of Stalin.
*  When things fail, he blames it on other people and usually groups of people, right?
*  Not individuals, but groups again.
*  So a little bit of both, I think, is the right answer.
*  This blame, it feels like there's a playbook that dictators follow.
*  I just wonder if it comes naturally or just kind of evolves.
*  Because, you know, blaming others and then telling these narratives and then creating
*  the other and then somehow that leads to hatred and genocide.
*  It feels like there's too many commonalities
*  for it not to be a naturally emergent strategy that works for dictatorships.
*  I mean, it's a good it's a very good point.
*  And I think it's one, you know, that, you know, has its merits.
*  In other words, I think
*  you're right that there's certain kinds of strategies by dictators that, you know,
*  are common to them, a lot of them do killing.
*  Not all of them of that sort that Stalin did.
*  I've written about Mao and Pol Pot, you know, and Hitler.
*  And, you know, there there is a sort of, as you say, a kind of playbook
*  for political dictatorship, also for, you know, a kind of communist totalitarian way
*  of functioning, you know, and that that way of functioning was described
*  already by Hannah Arendt early on when she wrote The Origins of Totalitarianism.
*  And and and she more or less writes the playbook and Stalin does follow it.
*  The real question, and it seems to me, is to what extent, you know, and and how deep
*  does this go and how often does it go in that direction?
*  I mean, you can you can argue, for example, I mean, Fidel Castro was not a nice man.
*  He was a dictator. He was a terrible dictator.
*  But he did not engage in mass murder.
*  Ho Chi Minh was a dictator,
*  a communist dictator who grew up, you know, in the communist movement, went to Moscow,
*  you know, spent time in Moscow in the 30s and went to find found the Vietnamese
*  Communist Party. You know, he was a horrible dictator.
*  I'm sure he was responsible for a lot of death and destruction.
*  But he wasn't a mass murderer.
*  And so you get those, you know, I mean, I would even argue others.
*  Others will disagree that Lenin wasn't a mass murderer, you know, that he didn't.
*  He didn't kill the same way, you know, that Stalin killed or people after him.
*  They're communist dictators, too, after all, Khrushchev was a communist dictator.
*  But he stopped this killing.
*  And, you know, he's still responsible for a gulag and people sending off sent off
*  into a gulag and imprisonment and torture and that sort of thing.
*  But it's not at all the same thing.
*  So there are some, you know, like Stalin, like Mao, like Pol Pot, you know, who
*  commit these horrible, horrible atrocities,
*  extensively engaging in my view in genocide.
*  And there are some who don't.
*  And, you know, what's what's the difference?
*  Well, you know, the difference is partly in personality, partly in historical
*  circumstance, you know, partly in, you know, who is it that controls the reins of power?
*  How much do you connect the ideas of communism or Marxism or socialism
*  to Holladamore, to Stalin's rule?
*  So how naturally is he kind of alluded to?
*  Does it lead to genocide?
*  It's also
*  I mean, in some ways, I've just addressed
*  that question by saying it doesn't always lead to genocide, you know, in the case
*  again, you know, Cuba is not pretty, but it didn't have there was no genocide
*  in Cuba and same thing in North Vietnam.
*  You know, even North Korea, as awful as it is, is terrible dictatorship.
*  Right. And people's rights are totally
*  destroyed. Right.
*  They have no freedom whatsoever.
*  You know, is not as far as we know, genocidal.
*  Who knows whether it could be or whether if they took over South Korea, you know,
*  mass murder wouldn't take place and that kind of thing.
*  But my point is, is that the ideology
*  doesn't necessarily dictate genocide.
*  In other words, it's an ideology, I think,
*  that that makes genocide sometimes too easily possible.
*  Given, you know, the way it thinks through history as being, you know,
*  you're on the right side of history and some people are on the wrong side of
*  history and you have to destroy those people who are on the wrong side of history.
*  I mean, there is something in, you know,
*  Marxism, Leninism, which which, you know, has that kind of language and that kind
*  of thinking. But I don't think it's necessarily that way.
*  There's a wonderful historian at Berkeley named Martin Melia, who has written on,
*  you know, wrote a number of books on this subject.
*  And he was very, very, he was very, he was convinced that the,
*  you know, that the ideology itself,
*  you know, played a crucial role in the murderousness of the Soviet regime.
*  I'm not completely convinced, you know, when I say not completely convinced,
*  I think there are, you could argue with different ways,
*  equally valid, you know, with equally valid arguments.
*  I mean, there's something about the ideology of of communism that allows you to
*  decrease the value of human life, almost like this philosophy.
*  If it's OK to crack a few eggs to make an omelet.
*  Right. So maybe that if you can reason like that,
*  then it's easier to take the leap of for the good of the country,
*  for the good of the people, for the good of the world.
*  It's OK to kill a few people.
*  And then that's where I I I wonder about the slippery slope.
*  And I know, again, you know, I don't think it's a slippery slope.
*  I think it's
*  I think it's dangerous.
*  No, I think it's dangerous.
*  But I don't I don't consider, you know, I don't like Marxism, Leninism,
*  any better than the next guy.
*  And I've lived in plenty of those systems to know how they can beat people down and
*  how they can, you know,
*  destroy human aspirations and and human interaction between people.
*  But
*  they're not necessarily murderous systems.
*  They are systems that contain people's autonomy, that
*  force people to into work and labor and lifestyles that they don't want to live.
*  I spent a lot of time, you know, with with East Germans and Poles,
*  you know, who lived in and even and even in the Soviet Union,
*  you know, when the post Stalin period
*  where people lived lives, they didn't want to live, you know, and and had that didn't
*  have the freedom to choose.
*  And that was terrifying in and of itself.
*  But these were not murderous systems.
*  And they and they and they, you know, ascribed to Marxism, Leninism.
*  So I suppose it's important to draw the
*  line between mass murder and genocide and mass murder versus
*  just mass violation of human rights.
*  Right. Right.
*  And the leap to mass murder,
*  you're saying
*  maybe easier in some ideologies than others, but it's not clear that somehow one
*  ideology definitely leads to mass murder and not exact.
*  I wonder how many factors, what factors, how much of it is a single charismatic
*  leader, how much of it is the
*  conflagration of multiple historical events, how much of it is just dumb,
*  the opposite of luck.
*  Do you have a sense where if you look at a moment in history.
*  Predict
*  looking at the factors, what there's something bad is going to happen here.
*  When you look at Iraq, when Saddam Hussein first took power,
*  well, you could or you can, you know, go even farther back in history.
*  Would you be able to predict?
*  So you said you already kind of answered
*  that with Stalin saying there's no way you could have predicted that in the early
*  20s. Is that always the case?
*  You basically can't predict.
*  It's pretty much always the case.
*  In other words, I mean, history is a wonderful,
*  you know, discipline and way of looking at life and the world in retrospect,
*  meaning it happened, it happened and we know it happened.
*  And it's too easy to say sometimes it happened because it had to happen that way.
*  It almost never has to happen that way.
*  And, you know, things.
*  So I very much
*  am of the school that emphasizes, you know,
*  contingency and choice and difference and different paths and not, you know,
*  not necessarily a path that has to be has to be followed.
*  And those, you know, and, you know, sometimes you can you can you can
*  mourn about things.
*  I mean, you can think, well, something's going to happen.
*  And usually, usually the way it works.
*  Let me just give you one example.
*  I'm thinking about an example right now, which was the war in Yugoslavia,
*  you know, which came in the 1990s and eventually eventuated in genocide in Bosnia.
*  And, you know, I remember very clearly, you know, the 1970s and 1980s in Yugoslavia.
*  And people would say, you know, there's trouble here and, you know,
*  something could go wrong.
*  But no one in their wildest imagination
*  thought that there would be outright war between the two.
*  Then the outright war happened, genocide happened.
*  And afterwards, people would say, I saw it coming.
*  So you get a lot of that,
*  especially with pundits and journalists and that's I saw it come.
*  I knew it was happening.
*  You know, well, I mean, what happens in the human mind and it happens
*  in your mind, too, is, you know, you go through a lot of alternatives.
*  I mean, think about January 6th,
*  you know, in this country and all the different alternatives
*  which people had in their mind or or before January 6th,
*  you know, after the after the last election, you know, things could have gone
*  in lots of different ways.
*  And there were all kinds of people choosing different ways it could have gone.
*  But nobody really knew
*  how it was going to turn out.
*  Wasn't it smart people really understood
*  that there'd be this Kakamemi uprising on January 6th, you know, that almost,
*  you know, caused this enormous grief.
*  So all of these kinds of things in history, you know, are deeply contingent.
*  They depend on, you know, factors that we cannot predict.
*  And, you know, and it's the joy of history that it's open.
*  You know, you think about how people are now.
*  I mean, let me give you one more example and then I'll shut up.
*  But, you know, there's the environmental example.
*  You know, we're all threatened, right?
*  We know it's coming. We know there's trouble, right?
*  We know there's going to be a catastrophe at some point.
*  But when? What's the catastrophe?
*  Yeah, what's the nature of the catastrophe?
*  Everyone's a catastrophe. Right.
*  Is it going to be wars because resource
*  constraints is going to be hunger, is it going to be like mass migration
*  of different kinds that leads to some kind of conflict and immigration?
*  And maybe it won't be that big of a deal.
*  And a total other catastrophic event will
*  completely challenge the entirety of the human civilization.
*  That's my point. That's my point.
*  That's my point.
*  You know, we really don't know.
*  I mean, there's a lot we do know.
*  I mean, the warming business and all this kind of stuff, you know,
*  scientifically there, but how it's going to play out.
*  And everybody's saying, you know, different things.
*  And then you get somewhere in 50 years or 60 years, which I won't see.
*  And people say, aha, I told you it was going to be X or it was going to be Y or
*  it was going to be Z. So I just don't think in history you can.
*  Well, you can't predict.
*  You simply cannot predict what's going to happen.
*  It's kind of when you just look at Hitler in the 30s for me,
*  oftentimes when I kind of read different accounts,
*  it is so often certainly in the press, but in general, me just reading about Hitler,
*  I get the sense like this is a clown.
*  There's no way this person will gain power.
*  Which one? Hitler or Stalin?
*  Hitler.
*  No, no, no. With Stalin, you don't get a sense he's a clown.
*  Right. He's a really good executive.
*  Right. You think you don't think it would lead to mass murder,
*  but you think he's going to build a giant bureaucracy, at least with Hitler.
*  It's like
*  like a failed artist who keeps screaming about stuff.
*  There's no way he's going to.
*  I mean, you certainly don't think about the atrocities, but there's no way he's
*  going to gain power, especially against communists.
*  There's so many other competing forces that could have easily beat him.
*  So but then you realize, like, you know,
*  event after event where this clown keeps dancing and all of a sudden he gains more
*  and more power and and just certain moments in time he makes
*  this strategic decisions in terms of
*  cooperating or gaining power over the military, all those kinds of things
*  that eventually give him the power.
*  I mean, this this clown is one of the most
*  impactful in the negative sense, human and human beings in history.
*  Right. And even the Jews who are there and are being screamed at and discriminated
*  against and whose, you know, there's a series of measures taken against them
*  incrementally during the course of the 1930s.
*  But very few who leave.
*  Yeah. I mean, some pick up and go and say, I'm getting the hell out of here.
*  You know, and, you know, some Zionists, you know, try to leave, too,
*  and go to the United States and stuff, but
*  go to Israel and Palestine at the time, but
*  or to Britain or France.
*  But in general, you know, even even the Jews who should have been very sensitive
*  to what was going on, you know, didn't really understand
*  the extent of the danger.
*  And it's really hard for people to do that.
*  You know, it's it's almost impossible, in fact, I think.
*  So most of the time in that exact situation.
*  Nothing would have happened or there would be some drama and so on.
*  It'd be there's some bureaucrat and but every once in a while in human history,
*  there's a kind of turn and maybe something catalyzes something else.
*  And just it accelerates, accelerates, escalates, escalates.
*  And then war breaks out or totally
*  you know, revolutions break out. Right.
*  Can we go to the big question of genocide?
*  What is genocide?
*  What are the defining characteristics of genocide?
*  Dealing with genocide is a difficult thing when it comes to the definition.
*  There is a definition of the December 1948 UN
*  Convention on the prevention and punishment of genocide is considered
*  to sort of major document of definition in the definitional sense of genocide.
*  And it emphasizes, you know, the intentional
*  destruction, you know, of an ethnic, national, racial or religious group.
*  Those are the four groups again,
*  comma as such.
*  And what that means basically is destroying the group as a group.
*  In other words, there's a kind of beauty in human diversity and different groups
*  of people, you know, Estonians, you know, a tribe of Native Americans,
*  South African tribes, you know, the Rohingya in Myanmar.
*  There's a kind of beauty humanity recognizes in the distinctiveness of those groups.
*  You know, this was a notion that emerges really with romanticism after the French
*  revolution in the beginning of the 19th century with Herder mostly.
*  And this beauty of these groups then
*  is what is under attack in genocide.
*  And it's with intent.
*  You know, the idea is that it's intentional destruction.
*  So this is a kind of, you know,
*  analogy to first degree, second degree and third degree murder.
*  Right. First degree murder.
*  You know, you're out to kill this person and you plan it and you go out and you do it.
*  Right. That's intent.
*  Manslaughter is not intent.
*  You end up doing the same thing, but it's different.
*  So,
*  you know, the major person behind the
*  definition is a man named Raphael Lemkin.
*  I don't know if you heard his name or not, but he was a Polish Jewish jurist who came,
*  you know, from Poland, came to the United States during the war and had been a kind
*  of
*  crusader for recognizing genocide.
*  It's a word that he created, by the way,
*  and he coined the term in 1943 and then published it in 1944 for the first time.
*  Geno meaning people and side meaning killing.
*  Right. And so Lemkin then had this term
*  and he pushed hard to have it recognized.
*  And it was in the UN Convention.
*  So that's the rough definition.
*  The problem with the definition, the problems with the definition are several.
*  You know, one of them is,
*  is it just these four groups, you know, racial, religious, ethnic or national?
*  See, this comes right out of the war.
*  And what's in people's minds in 1948
*  are Jews, Poles, Russians, Yugoslavs sometimes who were killed by the Nazis.
*  That's what's in their mind.
*  But there are other groups, too, if you think about it, you know, who are killed,
*  social groups or political groups.
*  And that was not allowed in the convention, meaning for a lot of different reasons.
*  The Soviets were primary among them.
*  They didn't want other kinds of groups,
*  let's say, Kulaks, for example, to be considered.
*  That's a social group or peasants, which is a social group.
*  So or a political group.
*  I mean, let's take a group.
*  You know, communists killed groups of people,
*  but non-communists also killed groups of people in Indonesia in 1965, 66.
*  They killed, you know, no, exactly, but roughly 600000 Indonesian communists.
*  Well, is that genocide or not?
*  You know, and my point of view, it is genocide,
*  although it's Indonesians killing Indonesians.
*  And we have the same problem with the Cambodian genocide.
*  I mean, we talk about a Cambodian genocide,
*  but most of the people killed in the Cambodian genocide were other Cambodians.
*  They give it the name.
*  They're ready to recognize this genocide because they also killed some other
*  peoples, meaning the Vietnamese, Aham people who are, you know, Muslim,
*  Muslim, smaller Muslim people in the area and a few others.
*  So the question then becomes, well,
*  does it have to be a different nationality or ethnic group or religious
*  group for it to be genocide? And my answer is no.
*  You know, you need to expand the definition.
*  It's a little bit like with our Constitution.
*  We got a Constitution.
*  But we don't live in the end of the 18th century, right?
*  We live in the 21st century.
*  And so you have to update the Constitution over the centuries.
*  And similarly, the Genocide Convention needs updating, too.
*  So that's how I work with the definition.
*  So this is this invention.
*  Was it an invention?
*  This beautiful idea, romantic idea that there's groups of people and the group is
*  united by some unique characteristics.
*  That was an invention in human history,
*  that this idea, not the individual senses it was.
*  I mean, it's not, you know, there are things that are always constructed in one
*  fashion or another, and the construction, you know, more or less represents the reality.
*  And what the reality is always much more
*  complicated than the construction or the invention of a term or a concept or a way
*  of thinking about a nation, right?
*  And this way of thinking of nations, you know, as again, you know,
*  groups of religious, linguistic,
*  not political necessarily, but cultural entities is something that was essentially invented.
*  Yes. Yes.
*  I mean, you know, if you look at there are no Germans in the 17th century.
*  There are no Italians in the 17th century.
*  Right.
*  And they're only there after, you know, the invention of the nation, which comes
*  again, mostly as out of the French Revolution and in the Romantic movement,
*  a man named Johann Gottfried von Herger, right, who was the really the first one
*  who sort of went around, collected people's languages and collected their sayings
*  and their dances and their folkways and stuff and said, isn't this cool, you know,
*  that there are Estonians and that they're Latvians and that there are these other
*  these interesting different peoples who don't even know necessarily
*  that they're different peoples. Right.
*  That comes a little bit later.
*  Once the concept is invented, then people start to say, hey, we're nations, too.
*  You know, and the Germans decide they're a
*  nation and they unify and the Italians discover they're a nation and they unify
*  instead of being, you know, Florentines and Romans and, you know, Sicilians.
*  But then beyond nations, there's
*  political affiliations, all those kinds of things.
*  It's fascinating that, you know, you start look at the early Homo sapiens and then
*  there's obviously tribes, right.
*  And then that's very concrete.
*  That is your graphic location.
*  It's a small group of people and you have
*  warring tribes probably connected to just limited resources.
*  But it's fascinating to think that that is then taken to the space of ideas,
*  to where you can create a group at first to to appreciate its beauty.
*  You create a group based on language, based on maybe even political,
*  philosophical ideas, religious ideas, all those kinds of things.
*  And then that naturally then leads to getting angry at groups and making them
*  the other and then hatred. Right.
*  That comes more towards the end of the 19th century, you know, with the influence
*  of Darwin, I mean, you can't blame Darwin for it, but neo-Darwin, Darwinians,
*  you know, who start to talk about, you know, the competition between nations,
*  the natural competition, the weak ones fall away, the strong ones get ahead.
*  You know, you get this sort of combination also with,
*  you know, modern antisemitism and with racial thinking, you know,
*  the racial thinking at the end of the 19th century is very powerful.
*  So now, you know, at the end of the 19th
*  century versus the beginning of the 19th century, you know,
*  you can be a German and be a Jew and there's no contradiction.
*  Yeah. As long as you speak the language
*  and you dress and think and act and share the culture.
*  By the end of the 19th century, people say no, no, you know, they're not Germans.
*  They're Jews. They're different. They have different blood.
*  They have different. They don't say genes yet.
*  But, you know, that's sort of a sense of people.
*  And that's when, you know, there's this sense of superiority, too, and inferiority.
*  You know, that they're inferior to us.
*  Yeah. You know, and and that we're the strong ones.
*  And we have to, you know, and Hitler, by the way, just adopts this hook line and
*  sinker. I mean, there are a whole series of thinkers at the end of the 19th and
*  beginning of 20th century who he cites in Mein Kampf, you know, which is written in
*  the early 1920s that, you know, basically pervades this racial thinking.
*  So nationalism changes.
*  So nationalism in and of itself is not bad.
*  I mean, it's not bad, you know, to share
*  culture and language and and, you know, folkways and
*  and a sense of common belonging and nothing bad about it inherently.
*  But then what happens is it becomes, you know, frequently is used and becomes,
*  especially on fascism, becomes dangerous.
*  And it's especially dangerous when the two
*  conflicting groups share geographic location.
*  That's right. So like with Jews.
*  You know, I come, you know, I'm a Russian Jew.
*  And it's always interesting.
*  I take pride in.
*  And, you know, I love the tradition
*  of the Soviet Union, of Russia, I love America.
*  So I love these countries.
*  They have a beautiful tradition in literature and science and art and all
*  these kinds of things, but it's funny that people, not often,
*  but sometimes correct me that I'm not Russian.
*  I'm a Jew.
*  And it's it's a nice reminder.
*  Yes, that that is always there,
*  that desire to create these groups.
*  And then when they're living in the same place for that division between groups,
*  that hate between groups can explode.
*  And I just I wonder why is that there?
*  Why does why does the human heart tend so easily towards this kind of hate?
*  You know, that's a big question in and of itself.
*  You know, the human heart is full of everything, right?
*  It's full of hate. It's full of love.
*  It's full of indifference. It's full of apathy.
*  It's full of energy. So, yeah, I mean, hate is something, you know, that
*  I mean, I think
*  and, you know, along with hate, you know, the ability to really hurt
*  and injure people is something that's within all of us.
*  You know, it's within all of us.
*  And it's just something that's part of who we are
*  and part of our society.
*  So, you know, we're shaped by our society
*  and our society can do with us often what it wishes.
*  You know, that's why it's so much nicer to live in a more or less beneficent
*  society like that of a democracy in the West than to live in the Soviet Union.
*  Right. I mean, because,
*  you know, you have more or less the freedom to do to do what you wish and not to be
*  forced into situations in which you would have to then do nasty to other people.
*  Some societies, as we talked about, you know, are more
*  are more have have proclivities towards, you know, asking of its people
*  to do things they don't want to do and and forcing them to do so.
*  So, you know, freedom is a wonderful thing
*  to be able to choose not to do evil is a great thing, you know, whereas in some
*  societies, you know, you feel in some ways for not so much for the NKVD bosses,
*  but for the guys on the ground, you know, in the 1930s or not so much for the
*  Nazi bosses, but for the guys, you know, in the police
*  battalion that were told, go shoot those Jews, you know,
*  and you do it not necessarily because they force you to do it,
*  but because your social, you know, your social situation,
*  you know, encourages you to and you don't have the courage not to.
*  Yeah, I was just,
*  as I often do rereading Victor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning,
*  and he said something that just I often pull out sort of lines.
*  The mere knowledge that a man was either a camp guard or a prisoner tells us almost
*  nothing. Human kindness can be found in all groups, even those which as a whole,
*  it would be easy to condemn.
*  So that's speaking to
*  you feel for those people at the lowest level implementing the orders
*  of those above. Right.
*  And also you worry yourself what will happen if you were given those same orders,
*  you know, I mean, what would you do?
*  What kind of reaction would you have in a similar situation?
*  And, you know, you don't know.
*  I could see myself in World War II
*  while fighting for almost any country that I was born in.
*  There is a love of community.
*  There's a love of country that's just, at least to me, comes naturally,
*  just love of community and countries want such community.
*  And I could see fighting for that country,
*  especially when you're sold a story that you're fighting evil.
*  And I'm sure every single country was sold that story effectively.
*  And then when you're in the military and you have a gun in your hand or you're
*  in the police force and you're ordered, go to this place
*  and commit violence, it's hard to know what you would do.
*  It's a mix of fear.
*  It's a mix of.
*  Maybe you convince yourself, you know, what can one person really do?
*  And over time, it's again that slippery slope
*  because you could see all the people who protest, who revolt.
*  They're ineffective.
*  So like if you actually want to practically help somehow, you're going to convince
*  yourself that you can't one person can't possibly help.
*  And then you have a family.
*  So you want to make you know, you want to protect your family.
*  You tell all these stories and over time,
*  it naturally convince yourself to dehumanize the other.
*  Yeah, I think about this a lot.
*  Mostly because I worry that I would be a good German.
*  Yeah, no, no, that's right.
*  That's right. And one of the you know, one of my tasks as a as a teacher, right?
*  Our students and I have, you know, classes on genocide.
*  I have one now
*  and another one, by the way, on Stalin,
*  but the one on genocide, you know, one of my tasks is to try to
*  try to get get the students to understand this is not about weird people who live
*  far away and in time and in place, but it's about them.
*  You know, and that, you know, that's a hard lesson, but it's an important one,
*  you know, that that this is in all of us, you know, it's in all of us.
*  And there's nothing, you know,
*  and you just try to gird yourself up,
*  you know, to try to figure out ways that maybe you won't be complicit
*  and that you learn how to stand by your principles.
*  But it's very hard.
*  It's extremely difficult.
*  And you can't.
*  The other interesting thing about it is not predictable.
*  Now, as they've done a lot of studies of polls, for example, who during the war
*  saved Jews, you know, well, who are the polls who saved Jews versus those who
*  turned them in? It's completely unpredictable.
*  You know, sometimes it's the worst anti-Semites who protect them because they
*  don't believe they should be killed. Right.
*  And sometimes, you know, it's not predictable.
*  It's not as if the humanists among us,
*  you know, are the ones who, you know, can consistently show up, you know,
*  you know, and experience danger, in other words, and are ready to take on danger
*  to defend, you know, your fellow human beings, not necessarily.
*  I mean, sometimes simple people do it,
*  and sometimes they do it for really simple reasons.
*  And sometimes people you would expect to do it don't, you know, and you've got that
*  mix and it's just not predictable.
*  One thing I've learned in this age of social media is it feels like the people
*  with integrity and the ones who would do the right thing are the quiet ones.
*  In terms of humanists, in terms of activists, there's so many points to be
*  gained of declaring that you would do the right thing.
*  It's the simple, quiet folks.
*  Because I've seen quite on a small, obviously much smaller scale,
*  just shows of integrity and character when there were sacrifice to be made and it was
*  done quietly, this sort of the small heroes.
*  Those are you're right there.
*  It's surprising, but they're often quiet.
*  That's why I'm distrustful of people who kind of proclaim that they would do the
*  right thing. Right.
*  And there are different kinds of integrity, too.
*  I mean, I edited a memoir of a Polish
*  underground fighter, a member of the underground who was in Maidanek,
*  in the concentration camp in Maidanek,
*  and it was just an interesting mix of different kinds of integrity.
*  You know, on the one hand,
*  you know, it really bothered him deeply
*  when Jews were killed or sent to camp or that sort of thing.
*  On the other hand, he was something of an anti-Semite.
*  You know, he would, you know, sometimes if Jews were his friends, he would help them.
*  And if they weren't, sometimes he was really mean to them.
*  You know, and you could in their various levels, you know, a concentration camp is
*  a terrible social experiment in some ways.
*  Right.
*  But you learn a lot from how people behave.
*  And what you see is that, you know, people
*  behave sometimes extraordinarily well in some situations and extraordinarily poorly
*  in others, and it's mixed and you can't predict it.
*  And it's hard to hard to find consistency.
*  I mean, that's the other thing.
*  It's, you know,
*  I think we claim too much consistency for the people we study and the people we
*  think about in the past, you know, they're not consistent anymore than we knew.
*  We are consistent. Right.
*  Well, let me ask you about human nature here on both sides.
*  So first,
*  what have you learned about human nature for studying genocide?
*  Why do humans commit genocide?
*  What lessons?
*  First of all, why is a difficult question?
*  But what insights do you have into humans
*  that genocide is something that happens in the world?
*  That's a really big and difficult question.
*  Right. And it's it has to be parsed, I think, into different kinds of questions.
*  You know, why does genocide happen?
*  You know, which the answer there is frequently political, meaning, you know,
*  why Hitler ended up killing the Jews?
*  Well, it had a lot to do with the political history of Germany and wartime
*  history of Germany, right, in the 30s.
*  And, you know, it's traceable to then.
*  No, like you mentioned it yourself.
*  You can't imagine Hitler in the mid 20s turning into anything
*  of the kind of dictator he ended up being in, the kind of murderer, mass murderer,
*  he ended up being. So so.
*  And the same thing goes, by the way, for Stalin and Soviet Union and Pol Pot.
*  I mean, these are all essentially political movements where the polity state
*  is seized by an ideological or, you know, party, single party movement,
*  and then is moved in directions where where mass killing takes place.
*  And the other question, you know, separate that question out.
*  The other question is why do ordinary people participate?
*  Because the fact of the matter is
*  just ordering genocide is not enough.
*  Just saying, you know, go get them is not enough.
*  There have to be people who cooperate and who will do their jobs, you know,
*  both at the kind of mezzo level, the middle level of a bureaucracy,
*  but also at the everyday level, you know, people who have to pull the triggers
*  and that kind of thing and, you know, force people into the gas chamber
*  and grab people, you know, in Kiev in September 1941 at Babi Yar and push them,
*  you know, towards the ravine where the machine gunners are going to shoot them
*  down, you know, and those are all such different questions.
*  The question of,
*  you know, the especially the lower level, people who actually do the killing
*  is a question which I think we've been talking about, which is that within all of us,
*  you know, is the capability of being murderers and mass murderers.
*  I mean, to participate in mass murder,
*  I won't call them laws of social psychology, but the character of social psychology.
*  You know, we will do it in most cases.
*  I mean, one of the shocking things that I
*  learned just a few years ago studying the Holocaust is that you could pull out.
*  In other words, if they order a police battalion to go shoot Jews,
*  you didn't have to do it.
*  You could pull out. They weren't going to.
*  They never killed anybody. They never they never executed anybody.
*  They never even punished people for saying, no,
*  I know I'm not going to do that.
*  So people are doing it voluntarily.
*  They may not want to do it.
*  You know, they give them booze to try to, you know, numb the pain of murder
*  because they know there's there is pain.
*  I mean, people experience pain when they murder people, but they don't pull out.
*  And so it's the character of who we are in society, in groups.
*  And we're very, very influenced.
*  I mean, we're highly influenced by the groups in which we operate and, you know,
*  who we talk to and and who our friends are within that group and who is the head
*  of the group. And I mean, you see this even I mean, you see it in any group,
*  you know, whether it's in the Academy, right, at Stanford or whether it's,
*  you know, in a labor union or whether it's in a church group in Tennessee or wherever.
*  You know, people pay attention to each other and they and they're
*  unwilling frequently to say, no, this is wrong.
*  Even though all of you think it's right, it's wrong.
*  I mean, they just don't do that usually,
*  especially in societies that are authoritarian or totalitarian.
*  Right. Because it's it's harder because there's a backup to it.
*  Right. There's the NKVD there.
*  There's the Gestapo there. There are other people there.
*  So you just, you know, they may not be forcing you to do it.
*  But but your social being,
*  plus this danger in the in the distance, you know, you do it.
*  But then if you go up the hierarchy at the very top, there's a dictator,
*  presumably, you know, you go to like middle management bureaucracy.
*  The higher you get up there,
*  the more power you have to change the direction of the Titanic.
*  Right. Right. Right.
*  But nobody seems to do it.
*  Right. Or what happens?
*  And it does happen. It happens in the German army.
*  I mean, it happens in the case of the Armenian genocide
*  where we know their governors who said, no, I'm not going to kill Armenians.
*  What kind of business is this? They're just removed.
*  They removed and you find a replacement very easily.
*  So, you know, you do see people who stand up and again,
*  it's not really predictable who it will be.
*  I would maintain.
*  I mean, I haven't done the study of the of the Armenian governors who said no.
*  I mean, the Turkish governors who said no to the Armenian genocide.
*  But, you know,
*  there are people who do step aside every once in a while in the middle level.
*  And again, they're German generals who say, wait a minute,
*  what is this business in Poland when they start to to kill Jews or in Belarusia?
*  And, you know, they're just pushed aside.
*  You know, if they don't do their job, they're pushed aside or they end up doing it.
*  And they usually do end up doing it.
*  What about on the victim side?
*  I mentioned man search for meaning.
*  What can we learn about human nature,
*  the human mind from the victims of genocide?
*  So Victor Frankl talked about the ability to discover meaning and beauty,
*  even in suffering.
*  Is there something to be said about,
*  you know, in your studying of genocide that you've learned about human nature?
*  Well, again, I don't I have to say I come out of the study of genocide with a very
*  pessimistic view of human nature, a very pessimistic view, even on the victim's
*  side, even on the victim's side, I mean, the victims will eat their children.
*  Right. Ukrainian case, they have no choice.
*  You know, the victims will rob each other.
*  The victims will form hierarchies within victimhood.
*  So you see, let me give you an example.
*  Again, I told you I was working on my Danek
*  and there's in my Danek at a certain point in 42,
*  a group of Slovak Jews were arrested
*  and sent to my Danek.
*  Those Slovak Jews were group.
*  Somehow they stuck together.
*  They were very competent.
*  They were, you know, many of them were businessmen.
*  They knew each other.
*  And for a variety of different reasons within the camp.
*  And again, this shows you the diversity of the camps.
*  And also, you know, these images of black and white in the camps are not very useful.
*  They ruled the camp.
*  I mean, they basically had all the important jobs in the camp,
*  including jobs like beating other Jews
*  and persecuting other Jews and persecuting other peoples,
*  which they did.
*  And this Polish guy who I mentioned to you,
*  who wrote this memoir, hated them because of what they were doing
*  to the Poles. Right.
*  And he, you know, he's incensed
*  because aren't these supposed to be the intermention, he says.
*  And look what they're doing.
*  They're treating us, you know, like dirt.
*  And they do. They treat them like dirt.
*  So, you know, in this kind of work on my Danek, there's certainly parts of it
*  that, you know, were inspiring,
*  you know, people helping each other,
*  people trying to feed each other, people giving warmth to each other.
*  You know, there's some very heroic
*  Polish women who end up having a radio show called Radio My Danek,
*  which they put on every night in the women's camp, which is, you know,
*  to raise people's spirits and they sing songs and do all this kind of stuff,
*  you know, to to try to keep themselves from,
*  you know, the horrors that they're experiencing around them.
*  And so you do see that and you do see, you know, human beings acting
*  in support of each other.
*  But, you know,
*  I mean, Primo Levi is one of my favorite writers about the Holocaust and about the
*  camps, and, you know, I don't think Primo Levi saw anything.
*  You know, I mean, he had pals, you know, who he helped and who helped him.
*  I mean,
*  but he describes this this kind of, you know, terrible inhuman environment,
*  which no one can escape, really. No one can escape.
*  He ends up committing suicide, too, I think, because of his his sense of we don't
*  know exactly why, but probably because of his sense of what happened in the camp.
*  I mean, later he goes back to Italy, becomes a writer.
*  So I don't I don't, especially in the
*  concentration camps, it's really hard to find places like Wickel-Frankle where you
*  can say, you know, I am
*  moved in a positive way, you know, by what happened.
*  There were cases, there's no question people hung together.
*  They tried to help each other.
*  But but, you know, they were totally, totally caught in this in this web of genocide.
*  See, so there are stories.
*  But the thing is, I have this sense, maybe it's a hope that within most, if not
*  every human heart, there's a kind of like flame of compassion and kindness and love
*  that waits, that longs to connect with others, that ultimately unmasks,
*  overpowers everything else. If you just look at the story of human history.
*  The resistance to violence and mass murder and genocide
*  feels like a force that's there, and it feels like a force that's more powerful
*  than whatever the dark
*  momentum that leads to genocide is.
*  It feels like that that's more powerful.
*  It's just quiet.
*  It's hard to tell the story of that little flame that burns within all of our hearts.
*  That longing to connect to other human beings.
*  And we there's something also about human
*  nature and us as storytellers that we were not very good at telling the stories
*  of that little flame or much better telling the stories of atrocities.
*  No, you know, I think maybe I fundamentally disagree with you.
*  I think maybe I fundamentally I don't disagree that there is that flame.
*  I just think it's just too easily doused.
*  And I think it's too easily goes out in a lot of people.
*  And
*  I mean, like I say, I come away from this work, a pessimist.
*  You know, there is this work by a Harvard psychologist.
*  Now I'm forgetting it. Steven Pinker.
*  Yes, yes.
*  Steven Pinker that shows over time, you know,
*  and, you know, initially I was quite skeptical of the work.
*  But in the end, I thought he was quite convincing
*  that over time
*  the incidence of homicide, you know, goes down.
*  The incidence of rape goes down.
*  The incidence of genocide, except for the big blip, you know,
*  in the middle of the 20th century goes down,
*  not markedly, but it goes down generally that, you know, more that norms,
*  international norms are changing how we think about this and stuff like that.
*  I thought I thought he was pretty convincing about that.
*  But think about think about, you know, we're we're modern people.
*  I mean, we we've advanced so fast in so many different areas.
*  I mean, we should have eliminated this a long time ago, a long time ago.
*  You know, how is it that, you know, we're still facing this business
*  of genocide in Myanmar and Xinjiang and, you know, Tigray in Ethiopia,
*  you know, the potentials of genocide there and all over the world.
*  You know, we still we still have this thing
*  that we cannot handle, that we can't deal with.
*  And, you know, again, you know, electric cars and planes that fly from here to Beijing.
*  Think about the differences between 250 years ago or 300 years ago and today.
*  But the differences in genocide are not all that great.
*  I mean, the incidence has gone down.
*  I think Pinker has demonstrated.
*  I mean, there are problems with his methodology, but on the whole,
*  I'm with him on that book.
*  I thought in the end it was it was quite well done.
*  So.
*  You know, I do not I have to say I'm not
*  I'm not an optimist about what this human flame can do.
*  And, you know, I once I once someone once said to me when I posed a similar kind
*  of question to a seminar, a friend of mine at Berkeley once said,
*  remember original sin, Norman?
*  Well, I don't you know, that's very Catholic.
*  And I don't I don't really think in terms of original sin.
*  But in some ways, you know, her point is we carry this with us.
*  You know, we carry with us a really
*  potentially nasty mean streak that can do harm to other people.
*  But we carry the capacity to love, too.
*  Yes, we do. And so we do.
*  That's part that's part of the deal.
*  You have a bias in that you have studied
*  some of the darker aspects of human nature and human history.
*  So it is difficult from the trenches,
*  from the muck to see a possible sort of way out through love.
*  But it's not obvious that that's not the case.
*  You mentioned electric cars and rockets and airplanes.
*  To me, the more powerful thing is
*  the Wikipedia, the Internet.
*  Only 50 percent of the world currently has access to the Internet.
*  But that's growing in information and knowledge and wisdom,
*  especially among women in the world.
*  As that grows, I think it becomes a lot more difficult if love wins.
*  It becomes a lot more difficult for somebody like Hitler to take power,
*  for genocide to occur, because people think
*  and the masses, I think the people have power when they when they're able to think
*  and they can see the full kind of.
*  First of all, when they can study your work,
*  they can know about the fact that genocide happens, how it occurs,
*  how the promises of great charismatic leaders lead to great destructive mass genocide.
*  And just just even studying the fact that the Holocaust happened
*  for a large number of people is a powerful preventer of future genocide.
*  Like one of the lessons of history is just knowing that this can happen,
*  learning how it happens, that normal human beings,
*  leaders that give big promises can also become evil and destructive.
*  The fact knowing that that can happen is a powerful preventer of that.
*  And then you kind of wake up from this
*  haze of believing everything you hear and you learn to just in your small local way
*  to give put more love out there in the world.
*  I believe it's possible.
*  It's not it's not so good to push back.
*  I'm not it's not so obvious to me that in the end.
*  I think in the end, love wins.
*  That's my intuition, but money on it.
*  I have a sense that this genocide thing
*  is more and more going to be an artifact of the past.
*  Well, I certainly hope you're right.
*  I mean, I certainly hope you're right.
*  And,
*  you know, it could be you are.
*  We don't know.
*  But the evidence is different.
*  The evidence is different.
*  And,
*  you know, the capacity of human beings to do evil to other human beings is repeatedly
*  demonstrated,
*  you know, whether it's in massacres in Mexico or, you know,
*  ISIS and the ZD Kurds or, you know, you can just go on and on.
*  Syria. I mean, look what I mean.
*  Syria used to be a country, you know, and now it's
*  you know, it's been a mass grave and and people then have left in the millions,
*  you know, for other places.
*  And, you know, I'm not saying,
*  you know, I'm not saying I mean, the Turks have done nice things for the Syrians
*  and the Germans welcomed in a million or so and actually reasonably absorbed them.
*  I mean, it's all it's not.
*  I'm not saying bad things only happen in the world.
*  They're good and bad things that happen.
*  You're absolutely right.
*  And,
*  but I don't think we're on the path
*  to eliminating these bad things, really bad things from happening.
*  I just don't think we are.
*  And I don't think there's any I don't think the facts demonstrated.
*  I hope I hope you're right.
*  But but I think otherwise otherwise it's just an article of faith.
*  Well,
*  you know, which is perfectly fine.
*  It's better to have that article of faith than to have an article of faith
*  which says, you know, things should get bad or things like that.
*  Well, it's not it's not just fine.
*  It's the only way if you want to build a better future.
*  So optimism is a prerequisite for engineering a better future.
*  So like, OK, so a historian has to see clearly into the past.
*  An engineer
*  has to has to imagine a future that's different from the past,
*  that's better than the past, because without that,
*  they're not going to be able to build a better future.
*  So there's a kind of saying like you have to consider the facts.
*  Well, at every single moment in history,
*  if you allow yourself to be
*  too grounded by the facts of the past, you're not going to create the future.
*  So that's kind of the tension that we're living with.
*  To have a chance, we have to imagine that the better future is possible.
*  But one of the ways to do that is to study history,
*  which engineers don't do enough of, which is a real problem.
*  You know, it's a real problem.
*  Or basically a lot of disciplines in science and so on don't don't don't do
*  enough of. Right.
*  Can you tell the story of China from 1958 to 1962?
*  What was called the Great Leap Forward,
*  orchestrated by Chairman Mao Zedong, that led to the death of tens of millions
*  of people, making it arguably the largest famine in human history.
*  Yes, I mean, it was, you know, a terrible set of events
*  that led to the death. You know, people will dispute the numbers.
*  You know, 15 million, 17 million, 14 million, 20 million people died.
*  Many people say 30, 40, 50 million.
*  Some people will go that high, too. That's right. That's right.
*  Essentially, Mao and the Communist Party leadership,
*  but it was mostly Mao's doing, decided he wanted to move the country into communism.
*  And part of the idea of that was rivalry with the Soviet Union.
*  You know, Mao was a good Stalinist, or at least felt like Stalin was the right kind
*  of communist leader to have, and he didn't like Khrushchev at all.
*  And he didn't like what he thought were Khrushchev's reforms and also Khrushchev's
*  pretensions to moving the Soviet Union into communism.
*  So Khrushchev, you know, started talking about giving more power to the party,
*  less power to the state.
*  And if you have more power to the party versus the state,
*  then you're moving into communism quicker.
*  So what Mao decided to do was to engage
*  in this vast program of building what were called people's communes.
*  And these communes, you know, were enormous conglomerations of essentially
*  collective farms, you know, and what would happen on those communes
*  is there would be, you know, there would be places for people to eat and there
*  would be places for the kids to be raised in, you know, essentially kind
*  of separate homes and they would be schooled.
*  Everybody would turn over their metal,
*  which was one of the actually turned out to be terribly negative phenomenon,
*  their metal pots and pans to be melted to then make steel.
*  Every of these big communes would all have little steel plants and they would build
*  steel and the whole countryside would be transformed.
*  Well, like many of these sort of, I mean, a true megalomaniac project,
*  you know, like some of Stalin's projects too.
*  And this particular project, then, you know, the people had no choice.
*  They were forced, you know, to do this.
*  It was incredibly dysfunctional for Chinese agriculture
*  and ended up, you know, creating, as you mentioned, a terrible famine
*  that everybody understood was a famine as a result of this.
*  I mean, there were some there were also some problems of nature at the same time
*  and some flooding and bad weather and that sort of thing.
*  But it was really a manmade famine.
*  And Mao said at one point, you know, who cares, you know, if millions die?
*  It just doesn't matter. We've got millions more left.
*  I mean, he would periodically say things like this that
*  showed that like Stalin, he had, you know,
*  total indifference, you know, to the fact that people were dying in large numbers.
*  It led again to cannibalism and to
*  terrible wastage all over the country and millions of people died.
*  And there was just no stopping it.
*  You know, there were people in the party
*  who began to kind of edge towards telling Mao this wasn't a great idea, you know,
*  and that he should back off, but he wouldn't back off.
*  And the result was, you know, catastrophe in the countryside and all these people
*  dying and then they, you know, compounding the problem was the political elite,
*  which then, you know, if peasants would object or if certain people would say,
*  no, they beat the hell out of them, you know, they would beat people,
*  you know, who didn't do what they wanted them to do.
*  So it was it was really, really
*  a horrific set of events on the Chinese,
*  the Chinese countryside.
*  I mean, you know, and people people wrote about it.
*  I mean, we we learned about it.
*  There were people who were keeping track of what was going on and eventually
*  wrote books about it. So, you know, so we have I mean, we have pretty good
*  documentation, not so much on the numbers.
*  Numbers is numbers are always a difficult problem.
*  You know, I'm facing this problem, by the way, this is a little
*  bit separate with the Holodomor where, you know, Ukrainians are now claiming
*  11.5 million people died in Holodomor.
*  And, you know, most people assume it's
*  somewhere in the neighborhood of four million, four point five million, maybe.
*  So you have wildly different numbers that come out.
*  And we have different kinds of numbers, as you mentioned, too,
*  with the Great Leap Forward.
*  So it was a huge catastrophe for China and now only backed off when he had to.
*  And then, you know, revived a little bit
*  with the Red Guards movement later on when when, you know, he was he was upset
*  that the bureaucracy was resisting him a little bit when it came to the Great Leap.
*  But he had to he had to back off.
*  It was such a such a terrible catastrophe.
*  So one of the things about numbers is that you usually talk about deaths.
*  But with with the famine, with starvation.
*  The thing I often think about that's
*  impossible to put into numbers is the number of people.
*  And the degree to which they were suffering,
*  you know, the number of days spent in suffering.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And so, I mean, death is.
*  I death is just one of the consequences of suffering.
*  To me, it feels like one, two, three years or months and then years
*  of of of not having anything to eat
*  is worse.
*  And that's sort of those those aren't put into numbers often.
*  That's right.
*  And the effect on people long term, you know, in terms of their mental health,
*  in terms of their physical health, their ability to work, all those kinds of things.
*  You know, I mean, Ukrainians are working on
*  there are people working on this subject now, you know, the long term effect of
*  of the hunger famine on them.
*  And I'm sure there's a similar kind of
*  long term effect on Chinese peasantry of what happened.
*  You know, I mean, you're destroying multi generational.
*  Yes, multi generational.
*  That's right. That's right.
*  And, you know, it's a it's a really you're absolutely right.
*  This is a terrible, terrible way to die.
*  And and it lasts a long time.
*  And sometimes you don't die, you survive.
*  But, you know, in in the kind of shape where you can't you can't do anything.
*  I mean, you can't you can't function.
*  Your brain's been injured, you know.
*  No, it's a really these these famines are really horrible.
*  You're right.
*  So when you talk about genocide, it's often talking about murder.
*  Where do you place North Korea in this discussion?
*  We kind of mentioned it.
*  So in the what is it, the arduous March.
*  Of the 1990s.
*  Where was mass starvation?
*  Many people describe mass starvation going on now in North Korea.
*  When you think about genocide, when you think about.
*  Atrocities going on in the world today, where do you place North Korea?
*  So take a step back when the there were
*  all these courts that were set up for for Bosnia and for Rwanda and and and for other
*  genocides in the 1990s and then
*  the decision was made by the international
*  community, UN basically to set up the international criminal court, which would then
*  try genocide in the more modern period and the more contemporary period.
*  And the ICC lists three crimes, basically, you know, the the genocide,
*  crimes against humanity and war crimes
*  and subsumed to crimes against humanity are a lot of the kinds of things you're
*  talking about with North Korea, I mean, it's it's torture.
*  It's artificial, sometimes artificial famine or famine, you know, that is not.
*  Not necessary, right, not necessary to have it.
*  And other there are other kinds of, you know, mass rape and stuff like that.
*  There are other kinds of things that fit
*  into the crimes against humanity.
*  And that's sort of where I think about North Korea as committing crimes
*  against humanity, not genocide. And again, remember genocide is is meant to be.
*  I mean, some people there's disagreement
*  among scholars and jurists about this, some people think of genocide as the crime
*  of crimes, the worst of the three that I just mentioned.
*  But some think of them as co equal.
*  And the ICC, the International Criminal
*  Court, is dealing with them more or less as co equal, even though we tend to think
*  of genocide as the worst. So, I mean, what I'm trying to say is
*  that, you know, I don't want to I don't want to split hairs.
*  I think it's sort of morally and ethically
*  unseemly, you know, the split hairs about what is genocide and what is
*  the crime against humanity, you know, this is for lawyers, not for historians.
*  Terminology wise.
*  Yeah, yeah. You know that you don't want to get into that because it I mean,
*  it happened with Darfur a little bit where the Bush administration had had declared
*  that Darfur was a genocide and the UN said, no, no, it's, you know, it wasn't genocide.
*  It was a crime against humanity.
*  And then, you know, that confused things versus clarified them.
*  I mean, we damn well knew what was happening.
*  People were being killed and being attacked.
*  And and so, you know, on the one hand,
*  I think the whole concept and the way of thinking.
*  About history, using genocide as an important part of human history is is crucial.
*  On the other hand, I don't like to
*  get get involved in the hair splitting of what's genocide and what's not.
*  So so that, you know, North Korea, I tend to think of, like I said, as
*  as committing crimes against humanity and and, you know, forcibly incarcerating
*  people, torturing them, that kind of thing, you know, routinely incarcerating,
*  depriving them of certain kinds of human rights can be considered a crime against
*  humanity, but I don't think of it in the same way I think about genocide,
*  which is an attack on a group of people.
*  Let me just leave it at that.
*  What in this if we think about if it's OK, can we loosely use the term genocide here?
*  Just let's not play games with terminology, just bad
*  crimes against humanity, right?
*  Of particular interest, the ones that are going on today still,
*  because it raises the question to us, what do people outside
*  of this, what role do they have to play?
*  So what role does the United States or what role do I as a human being
*  who has food today, who has shelter, who has a comfortable life?
*  What role do I have when I think about North Korea, when I think about Syria,
*  what I think about maybe the Uyghur population in China?
*  Well, I mean, the role is the same role I have, which is to teach and to learn and to
*  get the message out that this is happening, because the more people who
*  understand it, the more likely it is that the United States government will try to
*  do something about it,
*  within the context of who we are and where we live.
*  Right. And so, you know, I write books, you do shows, you know,
*  or maybe you write books, too.
*  I don't know.
*  I do not write books, but I tweet.
*  You tweet. OK, that's good, too.
*  Inelegantly. But that's not the I guess that's not the point.
*  Yes. So certainly this is true.
*  And in terms of a voice, in terms of words, in terms of books, you are,
*  I would say, a rare example of somebody that has powerful reach with words.
*  But I was also referring to actions.
*  In the United States government, what are the options here?
*  So war has costs and war seems to be, as you have described,
*  sort of potentially increased the atrocity, not decrease it.
*  If there's anything that challenges my hope for the future is the fact that
*  sometimes we're not powerless to help, but very close to powerless to help,
*  because trying to help can often lead to, in the near term,
*  more negative effects than positive effects.
*  That's exactly right.
*  I mean, you know, the unintended consequences of what we do
*  can frequently be as bad, if not worse, than, you know, trying to relieve
*  the difficulties that people are having.
*  So I think, you know, you're caught a little bit, but it's also true.
*  I think that we can be more forceful.
*  I think we can be more forceful without necessarily war.
*  You know, there is this idea of the so-called responsibility to protect.
*  And this was an idea that came up, you know, after Kosovo.
*  Which was what, 1999.
*  And when,
*  you know, the Serbs looked like they were going to engage in a genocidal program
*  in Kosovo, and it was basically a program of ethnic cleansing,
*  but it could have gone bad and gotten worse, not just driving people out,
*  but beginning to kill them.
*  And the United States and Britain and others intervened, you know,
*  and Russians were there, too, as you probably recall.
*  And
*  I think, correctly, people have analyzed this as a case in which genocide was
*  prevented or stopped. In other words, the Serbs were stopped in their tracks.
*  I mean, some bad things did happen.
*  We bombed Belgrade and the Chinese embassy and things like that.
*  But, you know, it was it was stopped.
*  And following upon that, then there was a kind of international consensus
*  that we needed to do something, I mean, because of Rwanda, Bosnia and the positive
*  example of Kosovo, right, that genocide did not happen in Kosovo.
*  And I think that argument,
*  you know, has been substantiated anyway.
*  And this notion of the or this
*  doctrine or whatever of the of the responsibility to protect them was adopted
*  by the UN in 2005.
*  Unanimously.
*  And what it says is there's a hierarchy of measures
*  that should be well, let me let me take a step back.
*  It starts with the principle that sovereignty of a country is not you don't
*  earn it just by being there and being your own country.
*  You have to earn it by protecting your people.
*  So every this was all agreed with all the nations of the UN agreed, you know,
*  Chinese and then Russians to that, you know, sovereignty is there
*  because you protect your people against various depredations, right,
*  including genocide, crimes against humanity, you know, forced imprisonment,
*  torture and that sort of thing.
*  If you violate.
*  That
*  justification for your sovereignty,
*  that you're protecting your people, that you're not protecting them.
*  The international community has the obligation to do something about it.
*  All right.
*  Now, then they have a kind of hierarchy of things you can do, you know, starting
*  with, I mean, I'm not quoting exactly, but, you know, starting with kind of push
*  and pull, you know, trying to convince people, don't do that, you know, to Myanmar.
*  Don't don't do that to the Rohingya people.
*  Right.
*  Then it goes down the list, you know,
*  when you get to sanctions or threatening sanctions and then sanctions, you know,
*  like we have against Russia, but you go down the list, right?
*  You go down the list and eventually
*  you get to military intervention at the bottom, which they say is the last thing.
*  You know, and you you really don't want to do that.
*  And not only do you not want to do it,
*  but it had just as you said, this is you pointed out, it can have
*  unintended consequences.
*  Right. And we'll do everything we can short,
*  you know, of military intervention.
*  But, you know, if necessary, that can be undertaken as well.
*  And so the responsibility to predict, I think, is, is, is,
*  you know, it was not implementable.
*  One of the things it says in this last category, right,
*  military intervention is that the intervention cannot create more damage
*  than it relieves. Right.
*  And so for Syria,
*  we came to the conclusion, you know, that I mean, the international
*  community in some ways said this in so many words, even though the Russians were
*  there, obviously, we ended up being there and that sort of thing.
*  But the international community basically said, you know, there's no way you can
*  intervene in Syria.
*  You know, it's just no, no way without causing more damage, you know,
*  than you would relieve. So, you know, in some senses,
*  that's what the international community is saying about, you know,
*  Xinjiang and the Uighurs, too.
*  You know, I mean, you can't even imagine
*  what hell would break loose if there was some kind of military trouble, you know,
*  to threaten the Chinese with.
*  But
*  you can go down that list with the military leadership of Myanmar.
*  And you can go down that list with the Chinese Communist Party.
*  And you can go down the list with
*  others who are threatening, you know,
*  with Ethiopia and what it's doing in Tigray.
*  And, you know, you can go down that list and start pushing.
*  I think what happened.
*  There was more of a willingness in the 90s and in, you know,
*  right at the turn of the century, you know, to do these kinds of things.
*  And then, you know, when Trump got elected and, you know, he basically said,
*  you know, America first and out of the world,
*  we're not going to do any of this kind of stuff.
*  And now Biden has the problem of trying
*  to rebuild consensus on how you how you deal with these kinds of things.
*  I think it's not impossible.
*  I mean, here I tend to be maybe more of an optimist than you.
*  You know, I think it's not impossible
*  that the international community can muster some internal fortitude
*  and push harder, short of war, you know, to get the Chinese and to get the,
*  again, Myanmar and to get others to kind of back off of violations of people's
*  rights the way they are routinely doing it.
*  So that's in the space of geopolitics.
*  This is a space of politicians and you and so on.
*  Yes. The interesting thing about China, and this is a difficult topic, but.
*  There's so many financial interests.
*  That not many voices with power and with money speak up, speak out against China.
*  Because it's a very interesting effect, because
*  it costs a lot for an individual to speak up
*  because you're going to suffer.
*  I mean, China just cuts off the market.
*  Like if you have a product, if you have a company and you say something negative,
*  China just says, OK, well, then they knock you out of the market.
*  And so any person speaks up, they get shut down immediately.
*  Financially, it's a huge cost, sometimes millions or billions of dollars.
*  And so what happens is everybody of consequences,
*  financially, everybody with a giant platform is extremely hesitant to speak out.
*  It's a very it's a different kind of hesitation.
*  It's financial in nature.
*  I don't know if that was always the case.
*  It seems like in history people were quiet because of fear, because of threat of violence.
*  Here, there's almost like a self-interested
*  preservation of financial of wealth.
*  And I don't I don't know what to do that.
*  I mean, I don't know if you can say something there like
*  the genocide going on because people are financially self-interested.
*  Yeah, no, I think I mean, I think the analysis is correct.
*  And it's not only but it's not only corporations, but it's, you know,
*  it's the American government that represents the American people that also feels
*  compelled not to challenge the Chinese on human rights issues.
*  But the interesting thing is, it's not just, you know, I know a lot of people from China and,
*  first of all, amazing human beings and a lot of brilliant people in China.
*  They also don't want to speak out.
*  And not because they're sort of, quote, unquote, like silenced,
*  but more because they're going to also lose financially.
*  They have a lot of businesses in China.
*  They, you know, they're running.
*  In fact, the Chinese government and the country has a very interesting structure
*  because it has a lot of elements that enable capitalism within a certain framework.
*  So you have a lot of very successful companies and they operate successfully.
*  And then the leaders of those companies,
*  many of whom have either been on this podcast, they want to be on this podcast.
*  They really don't want to say anything negative about the government.
*  And the nature of the fear I sense is not the kind of fear you would have in Nazi Germany.
*  It's a very kind of it's a mellow like, why would I speak out
*  when it has a negative effect on my company, on my family, on my in terms of finance,
*  strictly financially?
*  And that's
*  that's difficult.
*  That's a different problem to solve.
*  That feels solvable because it feels like it's a money problem.
*  If you can control the flow of money
*  where the government has less power to control the flow of money,
*  it feels like that's solvable.
*  And that's where capitalism is good.
*  This where a free market is good.
*  So it's like that's where a lot of people in the cryptocurrency space.
*  I don't know if you follow them.
*  They kind of say, OK, take the monetary system, the power to control money away
*  from governments, make it a distribute, like a lot of technology to help you with
*  that. That's a hopeful message.
*  In fact, a lot of people argue that kind of Bitcoin and these cryptocurrencies can
*  help
*  deal with some of these
*  authoritarian regimes that lead to violations of basic human rights.
*  If you can control if you can give the power to control the money to the people,
*  you can take that away from governments.
*  That's another source of hope where technology might be able to do something good.
*  That's something different about the 21st century than the 20th is there's
*  technology in the hands of billions of people.
*  I mean, I have to say,
*  I think you're a naive when it comes to technology.
*  I mean, I don't I'm not someone who understands technology.
*  So it's wrong of me, you know, to argue with you because I don't really spend much
*  time with it, I don't really like it very much.
*  And I'm not,
*  you know, I'm neither a fan nor a connoisseur.
*  So I just don't really know.
*  But what human history
*  basically, and that's a big statement, you know, I don't want to pretend I can tell
*  you what human history has shown, but, you know, technology
*  atom bomb. I mean, that's the perfect example of technology.
*  You know, what happens when you discover new things?
*  It's a perfect example.
*  What's going on with Facebook now?
*  This is an absolutely perfect example.
*  You know, and, you know, I once I once went to a lecture
*  by Eric Schmidt about the future, you know, and about all the things that were
*  going to happen and all these wonderful things like, you know, you wouldn't have
*  to translate yourself, anything you wouldn't have to.
*  You wouldn't have to read a book, you know, you wouldn't have to drive a car.
*  You don't have to do this. You don't have to do that.
*  What kind of life is that?
*  So, you know, my view of technology is it's it's subsumed,
*  you know, to the political,
*  social and moral needs of our day and should be subsumed to that day.
*  It's not going to solve anything by itself.
*  It's going to be you and me that solve things if they're solved.
*  There are political systems that solve things.
*  Technology is neutral on one level.
*  It is simply a human.
*  I mean, they're talking now about how
*  artificial intelligence, you know, is going to do this and is going to do that.
*  I'm not so sure there's anything necessarily positive or negative about it,
*  except it does obviously make work easier and things like that.
*  I mean, I, you know, I like email and I like, you know,
*  word processing and that sort of all that stuff is great.
*  But but actually solving human.
*  Relations in and of itself or international
*  relations or or conflict among human beings.
*  I mean, I see technology as, you know,
*  causing as many problems as it solves and maybe even more.
*  You know, the maybe maybe maybe.
*  Yeah. The question is, so like you said, technology is neutral.
*  I agree with this.
*  Technology is a is a toolkit, is a toolset
*  that enables humans to have wider reach and more power.
*  The printing press, the the rare reason I can read your books is, I would argue.
*  So first of all, the printing press and then the the Internet.
*  Wikipedia, I think, has immeasurable effect on humanity.
*  Technology is a double-edged sword.
*  It allows bad people to do bad things and good people to do good things.
*  It ultimately boils down to the people,
*  what the people and whether you believe
*  the capacity for good outweighs the capacity of bad.
*  And so you said that I'm naive.
*  It is true. I'm naively optimistic.
*  I would say you're naively cynical about technology.
*  Here we have one overdressed, naïve optimist and one brilliant,
*  but nevertheless, technologically naïve cynic.
*  And we don't know.
*  We don't know that whether the capacity for good or the capacity
*  for evil wins out in the end.
*  And like we've been talking about, the trajectory of human history
*  seems to pivot on a lot of random seeming moments.
*  So we don't know.
*  But as a builder of technology, I remain optimistic.
*  And I should say kind of
*  when you are optimistic, it is often
*  easy to sound naive.
*  And I'm not sure what to make of that small effect, not to linger on specific
*  words, but I've noticed that people who kind of
*  are cynical about the world somehow sound more intelligent.
*  No, no. The issue is how do you how are you?
*  How can you be realistic about the world?
*  It's not optimistic or pessimistic.
*  It's not cynical.
*  The question is, how can you be a realist?
*  Right. And you know, realism depends on
*  a combination of
*  knowledge and wisdom and
*  good instincts and that sort of thing.
*  And that is that's what we strive for, you know, is a kind of realism.
*  We both strive for that kind of realism.
*  But I mean, here's an example I would give you.
*  What about again, we've got this environmental issue, right?
*  And technology has created it.
*  It's created it.
*  I mean, the growth of technology, I mean, we all like to be heated well in our
*  homes and we want to have cars that run quickly and fast on gas.
*  And we all I mean, there's all we're all consumers and we all profit from this.
*  I don't I don't not everybody profits from it, but, you know, but we want to be
*  comfortable and technology has provided us with a comfortable life.
*  And it's also provided us, you know, with this incredible danger,
*  which it's not solving, at least not now.
*  OK, but it may solve.
*  Yeah. But it may.
*  It's only my view is, you know, it's going to what's going to happen.
*  A horrible catastrophe.
*  It's the only way it's the only way we will direct ourselves to actually trying to do
*  something about it.
*  We don't have the wisdom
*  and the.
*  Realism and the sense of purpose.
*  You know, what's your name?
*  Greta goes blah, blah, blah, something like that in her in her last talk about the
*  about the.
*  The environmental summit in Glasgow, whatever it was.
*  And,
*  you know, we just we just don't have it
*  unless we're hit upside the head really, really hard.
*  And then maybe,
*  you know, the business with nuclear weapons,
*  you know, I think somehow we got hit upside the head and we realized, oh, man,
*  you know, this could really do it to the whole world.
*  And so we started, you know, serious arms control stuff.
*  And,
*  you know, but up to that point, you know,
*  I mean, there was just something about, you know, Khrushchev's big bomb,
*  his big hydrogen bomb, which he exploded in the times.
*  I think it was the anniversary or something like that.
*  You know, I mean, just think what we could have done to each other.
*  Well, that's the double edge technology.
*  Yeah, I agree. It's a lot of people.
*  There's a lot of people that argue that nuclear weapons is the reason we haven't
*  had a World War Three. So nuclear weapons, the mutual assured destruction leads to a
*  kind of like we've reached a certain level of destructiveness with our weapons
*  where we were able to catch ourselves, not to create.
*  Like you said, hit really hard.
*  This is the this is the interesting question about
*  kind of hard, hard and really hard upside the head with the with the environment.
*  I would argue, see, we can't know the future, but I would argue as the pressure
*  builds, there's already because of this created urgency,
*  the amount of innovation that I've seen that sometimes is unrelated to the
*  environment, but kind of sparked by this urgency.
*  It's been humongous, including the work of Elon Musk, including the work of just
*  you could argue that the SpaceX and the new exploration of space is kind of sparked
*  by this environmental like urgency, I mean, connected to Tesla and everything
*  they're doing with electric vehicles and so on.
*  There's a huge amount of innovation in the space that's happening.
*  I could see the effect of
*  climate change resulting in more positive
*  innovation that improves the quality of life across the world than the actual
*  catastrophic events that we're describing, which we cannot even currently predict.
*  It's not like there's going to be there's
*  going to be more extreme weather events. What does that even mean?
*  There's going to be a gradual increase of the level of of water.
*  What does that even mean in terms of catastrophic events?
*  It's going to be pretty gradual.
*  There's going to be migration of people.
*  We can't predict what that means.
*  And in response to that, there's going to be a huge amount of innovators born today
*  that have dreams and that will build devices and inventions and
*  from from from space to vehicles to in the software world that enable education
*  across the world, all those kinds of things that will
*  on mass, on average, increase the quality of life on average across the world.
*  So it's not at all obvious that these
*  the things that the technologies that are creating climate change,
*  global warming, are going to have a negative net negative effect.
*  We don't know this.
*  And I'm kind of inspired by the dreamers, the engineers, the innovators and the
*  the entrepreneurs that build that that the wake up in the morning,
*  see problems in the world and dream that they're going to be the ones who solve
*  those problems. That's that's the human spirit.
*  And that I'm not exactly it is true that we need those deadlines.
*  We need to be freaking out about stuff.
*  And the reason we need to study history
*  and the worst of human history is that we can say, oh, shit, this too can happen.
*  It's a slap in the face.
*  It's a wake up call that if you're if you get complacent, if you get lazy,
*  this is going to happen and that listen, there's a lot of really
*  intelligent people, ambitious people, dreamers, skilled
*  dreamers that build solutions that make sure this stuff doesn't happen anymore.
*  So there's I think there's reason to be optimistic about technology, not in a
*  naive way, there's an argument to be made in a realistic way that like with
*  technology, we can build a better future.
*  And then Facebook is a lesson in the way
*  Facebook has been done is a is a is a lesson how not to do it.
*  And that lesson.
*  Serves as a as a guide of how to do it
*  better, how to do it right, how to do it in a positive way.
*  And the same the same every single sort
*  of failed technology contains within the lessons of how to do it better.
*  And I mean, without that.
*  What's the source of hope for human civilization?
*  You know that I mean, by way of question,
*  you have truly studied some of the darkest moments in human history.
*  Put on your optimist hat.
*  Where?
*  Yes, I
*  think there's a glimmers of it.
*  There's yes. What what is your source of hope for the future of human civilization?
*  Well, I think it resides in
*  you know, some of what you've been saying, which is the in the persistence
*  of this civilization over time, despite, you know, the incredible setbacks,
*  you know, two enormous world wars, you know, the nuclear standoff,
*  you know, the horrible things we're
*  experiencing now with climate change and migration and stuff like that.
*  That despite these things, you know, we are persisting and we are continuing.
*  And like you say, we're continuing to invent and we're continuing to try to solve
*  these problems and, you know, we're continuing to love as well as hate.
*  And, you know, that,
*  you know, I'm basically I mean, I have children and grandchildren and I think
*  they're going to they're going to be just fine.
*  You know, I'm not I'm not a
*  doom and gloomer, you know, I'm not a Cassandra saying the world is coming to an
*  end, I'm not like that at all.
*  You know, I think that,
*  you know, things will persist.
*  Another, by the way, source of tremendous optimism on my part, the kids I teach,
*  you know, I teach some unbelievably fantastic young people, you know, who are
*  sort of like you say, they're dreamers and they're and they're problem solvers and
*  they're they're I mean, they they have enormously humane
*  values and ways of thinking about the world and they want they want to do good.
*  You know, if you take the kind of.
*  I mean, this has probably been true all the way along, but I mean, the percentage of
*  do-gooders, you know, is really enormously large.
*  Now, whether they end up working for some
*  kind of shark law firm or something or or, you know, that that that kind of thing or
*  whether they end up human rights lawyers as they all want to be right.
*  Yeah.
*  The you know, is a different kind of question.
*  But but certainly,
*  you know, these young people are talented, they're smart, they're wonderful values,
*  they're energetic, they work hard, you know, they're focused.
*  And of course, it's not just Stanford.
*  I mean, it's all over the country.
*  You know, you have young people who really want to contribute and they want to contribute.
*  I mean, it's true.
*  Some of them end up, you know,
*  working to get rich.
*  I mean, that's inevitable.
*  Right. But but the percentages are actually rather small, at least at this age.
*  You know, maybe when they get a mortgage
*  and a family and that sort of thing, you know,
*  financial well-being will be more important to them.
*  But right now, you know, you catch this young generation and they're fantastic.
*  They're fantastic.
*  And they're not
*  what they're often portrayed as being, you know, kind of silly and naive and
*  knee jerk leftists and that they're not at all like that.
*  You know, they're really they're really fine young people.
*  So that's a source of optimism to me, too.
*  What advice would you give to those young
*  people today, maybe in high school, in college at Stanford, maybe to your
*  grandchildren about how to have a career they can be proud of,
*  have a life they can be proud of, pursue careers that are in the public
*  interest, you know, in one fashion or another and not just in their interests.
*  And that would be I mean, it's not bad to pursue a career in your own interests.
*  I mean, as long as you're it's something
*  that's useful and positive for the, you know, for their families or whatever.
*  But yeah, so I mean, I try to I try to advise kids to find themselves somehow,
*  find who they want to be and what they want to be and try to pursue it.
*  And the NGO world is growing, as you know, and
*  and a lot of young people are kind of throwing themselves into it.
*  And, you know,
*  human rights watch and that kind of stuff.
*  And, you know, they want to do that kind of work.
*  And it's it's very admirable.
*  I I tend to think that even if you're not
*  working in human rights, there is a certain way in which if you live
*  with integrity, the.
*  I believe that all of us or many of us have a bunch of moments in our lives
*  when we're posed with a decision, it's a quiet one.
*  Maybe it'll never be written about or talked about.
*  Well, you get to choose what do you
*  there's a choice that.
*  Is difficult to make, it might require a sacrifice, but it's the choice
*  that the best version of that person would make
*  this best way I can sort of say how to act with integrity.
*  It's the very thing that would resist
*  the early days in Nazi Germany.
*  It sounds dramatic to say, but those little actions
*  and I feel like the best you can do to avoid genocide
*  on scale is for all of us to live in that way to within those moments,
*  unrelated potentially to human rights, to anything else, is to take those actions.
*  Like I believe that all of us know the right thing to do.
*  I know that's right. I think that's right.
*  You put it very well.
*  I couldn't have done it better myself.
*  No, no, I agree.
*  I agree completely that there are, you know,
*  to live with truth, which is what Vaswell Havel
*  used to say, this famous Czech dissident, you know, talked about living in truth,
*  but also to live with integrity.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's really super important.
*  Well, let me ask you about love.
*  What role does love play in this whole thing in the human condition?
*  In all the study of genocide, it does seem that hardship
*  in moments brings out the best in human nature and the best in human nature is
*  expressed through love. Well, as I already mentioned to you,
*  I think hardship can
*  is not a good thing for you.
*  It's not the best thing for love.
*  I mean, it's better.
*  It's better to not have to suffer and not have to.
*  Yes, I think it is.
*  I think it's, you know,
*  as I mentioned to you, you know, studying concentration camps, you know,
*  this is not a place for love.
*  It happens.
*  It happens, but it's not really a place for love.
*  It's a place for rape.
*  It's a place for torture.
*  It's a place for killing and this place for
*  inhuman action, one to another, you know, and also, as I said,
*  among those who are suffering, not just between those who are.
*  And then there are whole gradations,
*  you know, the same thing in the gulag, you know, there are gradations all the way
*  from the criminal prisoners who beat the hell out of the political prisoners,
*  you know, who then have others below them who they beat down, you know,
*  so everybody's being the hell out of everybody else.
*  So I would I would not idealize in any way
*  suffering as a, you know, a source of beauty, a source of beauty and love.
*  I wouldn't do that.
*  I think it's a whole lot better for people to be relatively prosperous.
*  I'm not saying super prosperous, but to be able to feed themselves and to be able
*  to feed their families and house their families and take care of themselves.
*  You know, to foster.
*  Loving relations between people and,
*  you know, I think it's no accident that,
*  you know, poor families have much
*  worse records when it comes to crime and things like that, you know, and and also
*  to wife beating and to child abuse and stuff like that.
*  I mean, you just you don't you don't want to be
*  poor and indigent and not have a roof over your head.
*  Be homeless. I mean, it doesn't mean again,
*  you know, homeless people are are mean people.
*  That's not what I'm trying to say.
*  What I'm trying to say is that, you know,
*  what we want to try to foster in this country and around the world.
*  And one of the reasons, you know,
*  I mean, I'm very critical of the Chinese in a lot of ways, but I mean,
*  we have to remember they pulled that country out of horrible poverty.
*  Right. And I mean, there's still poor people in the countryside.
*  There's still problems, you know, with with want and need among the Chinese people.
*  But, you know, there were millions and millions of Chinese who were living
*  at the bare minimum of life, which is no way to live, you know, and no way again
*  to foster love and compassion and getting along.
*  So I want to be clear.
*  I don't speak for history. Right.
*  I'm giving you.
*  There used to be historians, you know,
*  in the 19th century who really thought they were speaking for history.
*  Yeah. You know, I don't think that way at all.
*  I mean, I understand I'm a subjective human being with my own,
*  my own points of view and my own opinions.
*  But I'm trying to remember this in this conversation that you're
*  despite the fact that you're brilliant and you've written brilliant books,
*  that you're just human.
*  Well, I am.
*  I am. That's it.
*  Yeah. No, no, that's absolutely true.
*  And I tell my students that, too.
*  I mean, I make sure they understand this is not history speaking.
*  You know, this is me and Norman.
*  And I'm, you know, and this is this is what it's about.
*  I mean, I spent a long time studying history and have enjoyed it enormously.
*  But,
*  you know, I'm an individual with my points of view.
*  And one of them is that I've developed over time
*  is that, you know,
*  human want is a real is a real tragedy for people and it hurts people.
*  And it also causes upheavals and difficulties and stuff.
*  So I feel for people, you know, I feel for people in Syria.
*  I feel for people in,
*  you know, in Ethiopia and Tigray, you know, when they don't have enough to eat.
*  And, you know, what that does, I mean,
*  it doesn't mean they don't love each other, right?
*  It doesn't mean they don't love their kids.
*  But it does mean that it's harder, you know, to do that and to and I'm not so.
*  I'm not so sure. It's obvious to me that it's harder.
*  There's suffering. There is suffering.
*  But the numbers we've been talking about deaths, been talking about suffering.
*  But the numbers were not quantifying.
*  The history that you haven't perhaps been
*  looking at is all the times that people have fallen in love deeply with friends,
*  with romantic love, the positive emotion that people have felt.
*  And I'm not so sure that amidst the suffering,
*  those moments of beauty and love can be discovered.
*  And if we look at the numbers, I'm not so sure the story is obvious
*  that, you know, again, I suppose you may disagree with Victor Franco.
*  I mean, too, maybe depending on the day.
*  I mean, he says that if there's meaning to this life at all,
*  there's meaning to the suffering, too, because suffering is part of life.
*  There's something about accepting.
*  The ups and downs, even when the downs go very low and within all of it,
*  finding a source of meaning, I mean, he's arguing from the perspective
*  of psychology, but just this life is an incredible gift almost no matter what.
*  And I'm not.
*  It's easy to look at suffering and think if we just escape the suffering,
*  it will all be better.
*  But we all die.
*  There's beauty in the whole thing.
*  And it is true that it's just from all the stories I've read,
*  especially in famine and starvation, it's just horrible.
*  It is horrible suffering.
*  But I also just want to say that
*  there's love amidst it and we can't forget that.
*  No, no, I don't. I don't forget it.
*  I don't forget it.
*  And I think it's from the stories.
*  Now, I don't want to make that compromise or that trade,
*  but the intensity of friendship in war, the intensity of love in war
*  is very high.
*  So I'm not sure what to make of these calculations.
*  But if you look at the stories, some of the people I'm closest with and I've
*  never experienced anything even close to any of this.
*  But some of the people I'm closest with is people I've gone through difficult
*  times with. There's something about that.
*  There's a society or a group where things are easy.
*  The intensity of the connection between human beings is not as strong.
*  I don't know what to do with that calculus, because I too agree with you.
*  I want to have as little suffering in the world as possible.
*  But we have to remember about the love
*  and the depth of human connection and find the right balance there.
*  No, there's something to what you're saying.
*  There's clearly something to what you're saying.
*  I was just thinking about Soviet Union when I lived there and
*  and people on the streets were so mean to one another and they never smiled.
*  And you grew up there.
*  You know, with you, where you're too young to know.
*  No, I remember. Well, I came here when I was 13.
*  OK, so anyway, I remember living there and just how hard people were on each other
*  on the streets. And when you got inside people's apartments, when they started
*  to trust you, you know, the friendships were so intense and so wonderful.
*  So in that sense, I mean, they did live a hard life,
*  but there wasn't a food on the table and there was a roof over their heads.
*  There's a certain line. There's a certain there are lines.
*  You know, I don't think there's one line, but, you know, it's kind of a shading.
*  And the other story I was thinking of as you were talking was not a story.
*  It's a history, a history, a book
*  by a friend of mine who wrote about love in the
*  camps, in the refugee camps for Jews in Germany after the war.
*  So these were Jews who had come mostly from Poland and were, you know, some
*  survived the camps, came from awful circumstances.
*  And then they were put in these camps, which were not joyful places.
*  I mean, they were guarded sometimes by Germans even, but basically under the
*  British control, and they were trying to get to Israel, you know, trying to get
*  to Palestine right after the war and how many pairs there were,
*  how many people coupled up.
*  But remember, this is after being in the
*  concentration camp, it's not being in the concentration camp.
*  And it's also being free, you know, to more or less free, you know, to express
*  their emotions and to be human beings after this horrible thing which they suffered.
*  So I wonder whether there's, you know,
*  as you say, some kind of calculus there where, you know, the level of suffering is
*  is such that it's just too much for humans to bear.
*  And,
*  you know, which I would suggest, I mean, I haven't studied this myself.
*  I'm just giving you my point of view, you know, my off the cuff remarks here.
*  But it was very inspiring to read about these couples who had met right in these
*  camps and started to couple up, you know, and get married and
*  and try to find their way to Palestine, which was a difficult thing to do then.
*  When did you live in Russia and the Soviet Union?
*  What's your memory of that time?
*  Well, so a number of different times.
*  So I went there. I first went there in 6970.
*  Wow.
*  A long time ago.
*  And
*  then I lived in Leningrad mostly, but also in Moscow in 1975.
*  So it was detente time.
*  But it was also a time of political
*  uncertainty and also
*  hardship for Russians themselves.
*  Standing in long lines.
*  I mean, you must remember this for food and for getting anything was almost impossible.
*  It was a time when Jews were trying to get out.
*  In fact, I just talked to a friend of mine from those days who I helped get out
*  and get to Boston and lovely people who managed to have a good life
*  in the United States after they left.
*  But it wasn't an easy time.
*  It wasn't an easy time at all.
*  I remember people set fire to their doors and their daughter was
*  persecuted in school once they declared that they wanted to immigrate and that sort of thing.
*  So it was a very it was a lot of anti-Semitism.
*  So it was a tough time.
*  Dissidents hung out with some dissidents and one guy was actually killed.
*  We think by the nobody knows exactly by the KGB, but his art studio was he had a
*  separate studio in Leningrad, St.
*  Petersburg today,
*  just a small studio where he did his art and somebody set it on fire.
*  And we think it was KGB.
*  But you never really know.
*  And he died in that fire.
*  So it was a tough time.
*  And
*  you knew you were followed.
*  You knew you were being reported on as a as a foreign scholar as I was.
*  There was a formal exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union.
*  And, you know, they let me work in the archives.
*  But then, you know, Ivanov got to work in the
*  in the physics lab at Rochester or something like that.
*  So it was a it was an exchange which sent
*  historians and literary people and some social scientists to Russia.
*  And they sent all scientists here to grab what they could from MIT and those places.
*  How is your Russian?
*  Has do you have any knowledge of Russian language that has helped you to understand?
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, I can read it fine.
*  And the speaking comes and goes,
*  depending on whether I'm there or I've been there recently or if I spend some
*  time there, because I really need you know, I have Russian friends who speak just
*  Russian, so, you know, when I'm there, I then, you know, I can communicate pretty
*  well, I can't really write it, unfortunately.
*  I mean, I can, but it's not very good.
*  But I get along fine.
*  What's your fondest memory of the Soviet Union of Russia?
*  Friends, friends, friends.
*  Was vodka involved or is it just vodka involved?
*  A little bit. You know, I'm not much of a drinker.
*  So I would, you know, they just make fun of me.
*  I'd make fun of myself.
*  That was easy enough.
*  I don't really like, you know, a heavy drink.
*  I've done a lot of that.
*  Not a lot. I've done some of that, but I never really enjoyed it and
*  would get sick and stuff.
*  But no, it's friends.
*  You know, one friend I made
*  in the dormitory, you know, it was a dormitory for foreigners, but also Siberians
*  who had come, you know, to Leningrad to study.
*  And so I met a couple of guys and one in particular from Omsk
*  became a wonderful friend.
*  And we talked and talked and talked outside.
*  You know, we would go walk outside because we both knew they were,
*  you know, people were listening and stuff.
*  And he would say, well, this is he was an historian.
*  You know, so we would talk history and he'd say, well, this was the case, wasn't it?
*  I said, no, I'm sorry, Sasha.
*  It wasn't the case. It was, you know,
*  we think Stalin actually had a role in killing Kirov.
*  I mean, we're not sure, but he said no.
*  I said, yeah. You know, so, you know, we had these
*  conversations and he was a he was
*  what I was. I don't know if he would agree with me or not.
*  I mean, we're still friends. So he was a he's going to check in with you.
*  Maybe he'll listen to the blog or I'll send it to him or something.
*  He was a kind of naive Marxist-Leninist.
*  And he thought I was, you know, I was, you know, I had this capitalist ideology.
*  He'd say, what ideology you have?
*  And I said, I don't have an ideology.
*  You know, I try to just put together kind of
*  reason and facts and accurate stories and try to tell them in that way.
*  No, no, no, no. You must do you know, you're a bourgeois, you know, this or that.
*  I said, no, I'm really not.
*  And and so we would have these talks and these kind of arguments.
*  And then, I mean, sure enough, you know,
*  we corresponded for a while and then he had to stop corresponding because he
*  became a kind of local official in Omsk.
*  And he sort of migrated more and more to being a Democrat.
*  And he was then in the, you know,
*  democratic movement under Gorbachev and, you know,
*  in the Council of People's Deputies, which they set up, which was, you know,
*  elected as a Democrat from Omsk and had a political career through the Eltsin period.
*  And once Putin came along, you know, it was over.
*  He didn't like Putin and, you know,
*  and Putin didn't like the Eltsin people, right, who were tried to be.
*  Some of them tried to be Democrats.
*  And Sasha was one who really did.
*  He just published his memoirs in Russian, by the way, which are very good.
*  I think.
*  Commander of the last.
*  That's what it's called.
*  It was hard.
*  It's hard to translate in English.
*  Commander of gift of last.
*  But I translated it for once for this is so beautiful.
*  Like the do you find that the translation is a problem or no?
*  It's such a different translation is very difficult with the Russian language.
*  I mean, it's the only language I know deeply except right.
*  Except English.
*  And it seems like so much is lost of the pain, the poetry, the beauty of the people.
*  And translators are to be treasured and good ones to be.
*  I mean, those who do the translations,
*  you know, when you read, you know, things in translation, sometimes they're quite
*  beautiful, you know, whether it's Russian or Polish or German or anything French.
*  Yeah, I'm actually traveling to Paris to talk to the famous translators,
*  the Dostoevsky Tolstoy,
*  and I'm just going to do several conversations with them about like you
*  could just sometimes just grab a single sentence and just talk about the
*  translation that that's that's.
*  And also, as you said,
*  I would love to be a fly in the wall with some of those friends
*  that you had, because the perspective on history, non-academic, sort of without just
*  as human beings is so different from the United States versus Russia.
*  When you talk about the way the World War
*  II is perceived and all those kinds of things, it's
*  it's fascinating.
*  It's a history also has an opinion and perspective.
*  And so sometimes stripping that away is really difficult.
*  And then I guess that is your job.
*  And at its highest form, that is what you do as a historian.
*  Well, Norman,
*  Spasibo, Basho, Stasile, Nisabella,
*  I really appreciate your valuable time.
*  It's truly an honor to talk to you and thank you for
*  taking us through a trip through some of the worst parts of human history and
*  and talking about hope and love at the end.
*  So I really appreciate your time today.
*  Thank you. Thank you.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Norman Neymarck.
*  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Stalin.
*  A single death is a tragedy.
*  A million deaths is a statistic.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
