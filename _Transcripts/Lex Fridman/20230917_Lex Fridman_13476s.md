# James Sexton: Divorce Lawyer on Marriage, Relationships, Sex, Lies & Love | Lex Fridman Podcast #396
**Lex Fridman:** [September 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUEjCXpOjPY)
*  we have been encouraged culturally to criticize people we're in long-term relationships with.
*  Not new relationships, new relationships, you put the person on a pedestal, you're allowed to just,
*  oh, they're wonderful. But every trope out there in every form of popular media is like the wife
*  rolling her eyes at the husband and the husband being like, oh, this loathsome harpy that castrated
*  me. As if people are just passive players in their lives. And I think that is an incredibly
*  toxic message to send to people. This is how we should be relating to our partner. We should not,
*  you don't take the piss out of your partner in front of people. The successful relationships
*  I've seen are where people are just cheering for their partner, where they are thick as thieves,
*  where there is just this feeling of like, man, they like each other. They got each other's back,
*  you wouldn't believe. Man, you could take sides against anybody, but take sides against their
*  partner, you're going down. And when you see a couple that has that, that's so hard to break.
*  But I think that comes from having a steadfast, yeah, no, I don't do that. I don't shit talk my
*  partner. And you don't shit talk my partner to me. And that to me is, because I think we're just so
*  criticized by the world. The world is so full of criticism. We criticize ourselves so harshly
*  that having a partner who no matter what is like, you've got this, I'm with you. Like you,
*  okay, yeah, you screwed up. I see it. Look, I'm not going to lie to you about your blind spots.
*  You screwed up, but you know what? People screw up sometimes. You got a right to screw up. A lot
*  of people screw up. Come on, get up. Let's go. I know you have it in you. If you have that person,
*  like that, I feel like that's a superpower.
*  The following is a conversation with James Sexton, divorce attorney and author of How to Stay in
*  Love, a Divorce Lawyer's Guide to Staying Together. As a trial lawyer, James, for over two decades,
*  has negotiated and litigated a huge number of high conflict divorces. This has given him a deep
*  understanding of how relationships fail and how they can succeed. And bigger than that, the role
*  of love and pain in this whole messy roller coaster ride we call life. This is the Lex Friedman
*  podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,
*  here's James Sexton. What is the most common reason that marriages fail?
*  That's a great question, but it's a question that everybody wants there to be a simple answer.
*  Like they want me to say cheating or money or, you know, like, you know, like,
*  or money or, you know, the internet. But the reality is, I think it's a lot of little things.
*  It's this disconnection. That would be my answer. The reason marriages fail is disconnection.
*  What causes disconnection? That's the bigger and I think more important question because,
*  like Tom Wolfe said about bankruptcy, it happens very slowly and then all at once.
*  Disconnection happens very slowly and then all at once. So most of the time, what I think people
*  want is an answer like cheating. But cheating is the big all at once thing. How did we get to the
*  place where cheating was even something you were thinking about doing or that you would think about
*  and then cross the line from thought into action? And that's, I think, the big question. So
*  disconnection would be my answer. Do you think it's possible to introspect,
*  like looking backwards for every individual case where the disconnection began and how it evolved?
*  Sure. Yeah. This is such a multivariate equation. It's a dance. It's a chemistry. It's what did you
*  do and what did the other person do? And see that the interesting thing about being a divorce lawyer
*  is I'm weaponizing intimacy in a courtroom. So I'm telling it's full context storytelling,
*  what I do for a living. So what I do is I take my client's story and I have to present it to a judge
*  and make my client the hero in every way and the other side, the villain in every way. Now,
*  I have to be careful not to do that in a manner that loses credibility because even a judge would
*  know. Even a judge is smart enough to know that no one's all good or all bad. But only if you were
*  reverse engineering a relationship and saying, how did this break? You really have to look at both
*  people, the good and the bad, what each of them did that moved the dial in these different
*  directions. And I think that that's very hard for anyone going through a divorce to do about
*  their own relationship. We don't know who discovered water, but it wasn't a fish.
*  Like if you're in it, I don't think you see it clearly. I think as a divorce lawyer,
*  whose job is to really drill down on the facts and figure out what's going on in this story,
*  I have to look at both sides. So I have to think a lot about my own arguments, but I also have to
*  think about what's the other lawyer's argument going to be, especially in custody cases. So I
*  really have been forced to look at both sides for so many years, so deeply in relationships that
*  once you do that, it's very, you realize that the good guy, bad guy thing just doesn't apply.
*  I wonder if it's the little things or a few big things that caused this connection, whether it's,
*  I mean, you've talked about granola and blow jobs, but those seem to be stories that you can tell to
*  yourself. Maybe that story should be explained or maybe not. You don't think granola and blow jobs
*  are self-explanatory? Almost. I think people can construct a good, like if you ask GPT,
*  what do they mean? I think the story that would come up is a pretty good one. But that's a story
*  you tell about when you first knew the disconnection has begun, is when he stopped buying my favorite
*  granola or when she stopped giving blow jobs. I would say when it's reached a critical mass.
*  Because I think it started before that when she said, yeah, I used to give him blow jobs. And
*  when we were in our early relationship, and then one day I just was like, oh, well, we don't have
*  much time. I'll wait until later and we'll have sex and then we both enjoy it. Blow jobs are
*  inefficient. Yeah, exactly correct. So you batch it all together. Yeah. So she said, well, exactly.
*  And they had kids at that point. So I think she really was like, hey, we've gotten a certain
*  window. So let's have something we both enjoy. So I don't think she had any negative intentions
*  there. I think that she was working in good faith towards the betterment of the relationship, but
*  it was having this second order effect. And so I really do think that, yeah, the blow jobs,
*  granola, I mean, there are anyone who's been in a long term relationship.
*  I guess it's just worth asking the question. What does this person do that makes me feel loved?
*  Because I think it's very interesting in my own experience in life. I remember I had a difficult
*  chapter with one of my sons, my younger son when he was in his early twenties, and we were having a
*  heartfelt conversation. And I said to him, do you know I love you? And he said, well, yeah,
*  of course I do. I said, but do you feel my love? Like, do you feel it? Not just do you know it
*  intellectually, do you feel it? And I remember thinking to myself, when do we feel someone's
*  love, right? Like, what is it that they do? And sometimes it's the weirdest, silliest things that
*  they would never know. They are the person who's showing us that they love us and that we're
*  feeling their love. They would never show us. Like, if you said, why does this person love you?
*  They wouldn't say, oh, because I always make sure that when the paper comes, I bring it from the
*  bottom of the driveway to the door so they don't have to go out and get it. Or I always hold the
*  door for them. Or I, you know, oh, I always like, again, I buy the granola that I know this person
*  likes, you know, or I remembered that they don't like it when I put on this particular record so I
*  don't put it on. Like, and those are these, yes, they're small things, but they're not small.
*  They're kind of everything. Do you think it's good to communicate that stuff? Well, 100%.
*  It takes away some of the power of it, right? When you point it out, then the person realizes,
*  oh, okay, he likes this or dislikes this. So yes, there becomes a deliberateness to it,
*  you know, a conscious. So I understand not pointing that out when it's a good thing.
*  I think when it's a negative thing, like I think in the granola situation, if she had said to him,
*  hey, you used to do this and you've stopped, that feels like something to me. Like she said,
*  she didn't say anything about that, just like he probably didn't say anything about the blowjobs.
*  I think if there had been a moment of this is starting, let's talk about it while it's starting,
*  but people wait. From what I can see, people wait until the big thing happens,
*  the financial impropriety, the substance use disorder, the cheating. They wait for that to
*  happen and then they go, where did we go wrong? And the answer is quite a while ago with the granola.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So when you notice something, like you notice that little something,
*  talk about it. Because that little something is probably a kernel of a deeper truth. Of course,
*  there's also moods. We're all like a roller coaster of emotions. So you can not bring a granola one day
*  just because you're in this place where just nothing is just cynicism everywhere, just anger
*  and so on. But it's a temporary feeling, but maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other
*  deeper current that's actually building up. Yeah. And I think a good partner wants to understand
*  the currents of their partner. They want to understand like, hey, are you going through
*  something? Look, if I'm the one you need to take it out on, that's okay. I'm a big boy. I can take
*  it. If you're hormonal, if you're frustrated at work, if you're whatever, we should be able to
*  to have a little bit of that interaction in a relationship. But I do think it's so easy to
*  just say to people, oh, communication is the key. But it really is about fearless kinds of communication.
*  It's about really honestly saying to somebody, this feels like something to me. Am I wrong?
*  This just feels like something to me. And also how that's presented. I mean, one of the things I'm
*  very caught up on or feel very strongly about is that we have been encouraged culturally to criticize
*  people we're in long-term relationships with. Not new relationships. New relationships,
*  you put the person on a pedestal, you're allowed to just, oh, they're wonderful.
*  But every trope out there in every form of popular media is like the wife rolling her eyes at the
*  husband and the husband being like, oh, this loathsome harpy that castrated me. As if people
*  are just passive players in their lives. And I think that is an incredibly toxic message to
*  send to people. That this is how we should be relating to our partner. We should not,
*  you don't take the piss out of your partner in front of people. The successful relationships
*  I've seen are where people are just cheering for their partner. Where they are thick as thieves.
*  Where there is just this feeling of like, man, they like each other. They got each other's back,
*  you wouldn't believe. Man, you could take sides against anybody. But take sides against their
*  partner, you're going down. And that when you see a couple that has that, that's so hard to break.
*  But I think that comes from having a steadfast, yeah, no, I don't do that. I don't shit talk my
*  partner. And you don't shit talk my partner to me. And that to me is, because I think we're just so
*  criticized by the world, the world is so full of criticism. We criticize ourselves so harshly
*  that having a partner who no matter what is like, you've got this, I'm with you. Like you fuck,
*  okay, yeah, you screwed up. I see it. Look, I'm not going to lie to you about your blind spots.
*  You screwed up. But you know what? People screw up sometimes. You got a right to screw up. A lot
*  of people screw up. Come on, get up. Let's go. I know you have it in you. If you have that person,
*  I feel like that's a superpower to have that effect on another person.
*  Yeah, one of the things I love seeing, when you look at a couple and one is talking,
*  like in an interview, answering a question, especially like intellectual questions,
*  like what do you think about the war in Ukraine or something? And then the partner is talking.
*  And then the other person is looking at them as if they're hearing the wisest thing ever.
*  They're still looking at them, not waiting for their turn to speak, not thinking about how's
*  the audience going to take that, but they're looking at them like, God damn, I'm so lucky
*  to be with this smart motherfucker. And they could be saying the dumbest shit ever.
*  There's a scene in the movie, True Romance. I love the movie. Great movie. I mean,
*  Gary Oldman scenes like the greatest scene ever done in film with Christian Slater.
*  But there's a scene in it where she holds up a sign to Christian Slater and it says,
*  you're so cool. And I like, man, like that's it. That's it. I think I say it somewhere in the book
*  that you go to weddings and like when the bride walks in, everybody's looking at the bride. It's
*  her show. Everybody turns around, it's the first glimpse, everybody gets to the bride. And I never
*  look at the bride. I always look at the groom looking at the bride. Because there's this like,
*  to me, that's every, like he has this look like this, because this is the first time he's seeing
*  her in the dress most of the time. And also he's seeing her like, holy shit, she's coming down the
*  aisle, we're getting married. Like, but this is it. And everyone's looking at her. And I always
*  look at him because I always think to myself like, like, like the look on his face is like, that's
*  like this feeling of like, holy, yeah, wow. Okay. Like that's everyone's looking at her and she's
*  mine. And she's coming up here and we're getting married. And I feel like, yeah, like that,
*  that kind of adoration, like I think that's the look we're describing is like adoration,
*  like that the words coming out of their mouth, that they're like, yeah, that's mine. That one's mine.
*  You know, that's such a great thing. Like it's such a great feeling.
*  Seeing the good stuff, like with, with true romance. I mean, you could make fun of the guys
*  totally cringe wearing Elvis, like essentially being a fake Elvis with shades and like, what,
*  what is he doing? Like watching these kung fu movies. But from her perspective and from any
*  perspective you could take on him is this is the baddest motherfucker who's ever lived. Like he's
*  willing to do those things for me, but not like it's almost like an epic heroic figure. And we're
*  living in this epic hero story. And what does that do to him though? I mean, that's what, see that,
*  that's the point. Like if there was a point to this, to this whole thing, this whole couple thing,
*  isn't that it? Like I don't, I don't understand this idea of, you know, we had a successful
*  marriage. We were married for 50 something years. We were miserable for 47 of them, but we hung in
*  there. Like it, this is an endurance event. Like the primary relationship of your life,
*  you've decided you're going to turn into the, the like a 50 mile trail race. Like why,
*  why would you do that? Like, congratulations, you, you took the concept of monogamy and made it
*  something that two people are absolutely not going to enjoy, but you hung in there. Like
*  congratulations. And I understand there's religious perspectives that say, well, it's a sacred
*  covenant, but I, I have a real chicken or the egg problem with that because I think it was like,
*  well, how do we sell this incredibly stupid concept that isn't working to people? I know
*  we'll tell them God says you have to, and we'll sign on for that. I don't buy it. I don't buy it
*  anymore. I really, cause when you see a successful marriage or you see to be even without a marriage,
*  you see a pair bond, you see a couple that really love each other and cheer for each other in that
*  way and like hang on each other's words that way and like, or just in each other's corner that way.
*  You see the fake shit instantly. Like you, you see the difference right away. It's like, if you,
*  you know, the first time I've, this is the first time I've come to Austin. I've, I thought I'd
*  eaten a lot of barbecue in my life. I've never had Texas barbecue. I landed, I went and had barbecue.
*  I was like, okay, I've never had barbecue before. Apparently this is, this is a whole different
*  thing. I think it's the same thing. I think it's like, once you see real love, like real love,
*  and I mean, romantic love, like real love like that real bond, real, you go, oh yeah, this other
*  thing's not going to do it. Do you think that's a daily deliberate choice that, that a couple like
*  that makes? Cause it feels like a very easy to do deliberate step. Like choose to see the brilliant
*  in it, the beautiful in it. And almost immediately everything shifts and it becomes this momentum
*  or all you see is the beautiful and all you see is the brilliant.
*  That is a conscious choice. I think approaching life that way is a conscious choice. Approaching
*  any relationship that way is a conscious choice. I mean, looking at someone who hurts you or does
*  something hurtful to you and thinking about what's going on in their life that they're doing that or
*  what's happening with them. Yeah, that's a very conscious choice. And I think a better one,
*  a better one than seething and animosity and letting that eat you alive. But, but I,
*  I don't know that it's, I don't think it should be so difficult. Like with our children, with our pets,
*  we don't have this problem. Like you never have someone look at their dog who they've had for
*  eight years and go, I gotta get a new dog. Like I've had this one for eight years. Like I gotta get,
*  like puppies are so cute. What am I doing with this old dog? Like it's the total opposite.
*  They're like, oh my God, this is like my dog. This is my dog. Like the smell of the dog is like,
*  this is my dog's smell. The bad habits of the dog. You're like, that's my stupid dog that does stupid
*  things. And it's not like that has to be a conscious, like they wake up every day and go,
*  I should be grateful for the dog. Like it's just visceral. It's in them, you know? And so,
*  and your children, like people's children, you know, it's why people are like not aware
*  of how annoying their children are because they're not annoying to them. Like I get it. Like to you,
*  the sound of your kids shrieking is like, oh, my kid's having a good time. And you don't get,
*  and see when I try to, when I hear that, I try to hear it with those ears. Like, oh, that, like I'm
*  a parent. I get it. My kids are adults now, but like, I get it. Like, so when I hear a kid shrieking,
*  I just am like, oh, like to that parent, that's the sound of that kid having a great time and
*  good. Like, it's so nice that that's in the world. But it, so for me, it has to be conscious. For
*  that parent, I don't think it has to be conscious. So I think it would be great if it didn't have to
*  be a conscious practice, but I wonder if like anything in meditation or mindfulness,
*  it's a matter of exercising that way of seeing. And then once you've come to that,
*  it becomes itself, right? Like it really does. Like you're, I think it's, it initially has to
*  be a conscious practice. And by the way, it's easier to make it a conscious practice before
*  it started to fade, right? Like the, I mean, that's what's so amazing about marriage is
*  there's like almost 8 billion people in the world and you're picking this one.
*  So when you marry in theory, like the stock's at its highest, like you're as crazy about each other
*  as you could possibly be. So that's the time to get into this mindfulness, to get into this practice,
*  not once it's like the wheels are starting to come off. It's much harder. It's like gaining a bunch
*  of weight and then saying, okay, how am I going to lose the weight now? Well, I think that even
*  before marriage, like right away, just see everything is beautiful. Let me quote Bojack
*  Horseman on this. When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look
*  like flags. There's a certain sense where if you, from the very beginning, of course you could end
*  up in toxic relationships that way, but you know, life is short. You're going to die eventually.
*  Might as well really go all in on relationships. There's a line in Drugstore Cowboy, a great film
*  where he says, we played a game you couldn't win to the utmost.
*  And I think everything, I think life is a game you can't win. And so you play it to the utmost.
*  Like to love anything is insane because you are accepting that you're going to lose it.
*  Like I'm a dog person and you get a dog and you've just resigned yourself to unbelievable pain
*  because this thing's going to die in like 10 years, maybe 15 if you're lucky.
*  And why would you open your heart to that? Why would you let, because the joy is just so
*  wonderful of it, of the ride up until it. Same thing with us. I mean, every marriage,
*  every relationship, every love is going to end. It's going to end in death or divorce.
*  So why not like just go in, like go in, like go in and just get weird, you know? Like don't define
*  it the way that's, I mean, look at, you know, again, we keep going back to true romance, but
*  just get weird. Like, yeah, I love this Elvis pretending to be weirdo. I love this like, you
*  know, like former sex worker who's like, you know, like whatever, like just go in, like love this
*  person, have them love you. Don't worry about what everybody else is doing in their relationship.
*  Like we're in such, I mean, it's not to me surprising that as the performative aspects of
*  life on social media increases, people's satisfaction with their relationships and the
*  divorce rate, you know, is following the same trend because I think everyone's going, well,
*  what's everybody else doing? You know, well, how much sex is everyone else having?
*  The only two people that should worry about how much sex you're having with two people,
*  if the two people are happy in the relationship, great. Then what does it matter? What does it
*  matter what everybody else is doing? Yeah. There should be an element to great relationships and
*  great friendships of like, fuck the world. It's us versus the us. It's us. And that's what I mean
*  when I say that that thick is thieves. Like when they're, when they're like a unit like that,
*  cause it's look at, it's just us. It's just what we want, what we like. And that's why I said like,
*  you know, even when it comes to sex or things like that, like if you can't be candid with your
*  partner about whatever weird shit you're into or what fantasy you had in any particular, well then
*  how can you be candid with? I mean, because you're going to either go without or go elsewhere.
*  And neither of those is a particularly healthy option or helpful option. It's, it's the start
*  of that decline. So why, why open yourself to that decline, which invariably is just the path
*  to the chair in front of me in my office. Yeah. You have a full section in your book on,
*  on foot fetishes. I do, I do. Yeah. Which is funny because I don't know anything about foot
*  fetishes. Yeah. Like I can't, I'm not King shaming anybody, but like there's nothing sexual about
*  feet to me at all. Like I just don't get it. I don't, but I mean, listen to people like things.
*  It's good, you know, but yeah, I, I, I have had clients that have odd fetishes or sexual proclivities
*  or things they want to do and they don't share it with their partner at all. And then they find an
*  outlet for it because they try to go without it and that doesn't work. So they try to find some
*  other outlet for it. And then that's interpreted as a betrayal and it creates distance and people
*  split up. And of course everybody likes to have like a, you know, a bad guy to blame it on. So
*  when you say, well, why'd you guys get divorced? Oh, cause he secretly had a foot fetish and he
*  was on these message boards like me and people, but well, it gives you an easy answer as to why
*  the two of you split up. But I don't think, you know, most divorces have such simple answers as
*  it was a foot thing. But I also think too, like, listen, if you got a partner, I mean, we all do
*  stuff that we're not super into because we're in a relationship and that's what part of it is.
*  Like, do you really want to go see that chick flick? Do you really want to eat at this restaurant?
*  Do you really want to go to her cousin's wedding? No, but you know, part of being in a relationship
*  is okay, if you're into this, I'm going to pretend this song's a good song, you know, even though
*  it's not my favorite song. And, and I think, I just don't know, we've turned sex. I mean, sex has been
*  so politicized in recent years. Maybe it always was, but I think we've made it into something where
*  we can't just, I don't know, I'm not into feet, but if the woman I love was like, you know,
*  I'm really in the feet, like I really want to do stuff with your feet. I'd be like, all right,
*  I can pretend that I'm into that. Like for, it's not going to kill me. Yeah. No, I'm not going to
*  be able to make it a centerpiece of our coupling, but you know, like, yeah, I can pretend I'm into
*  feet if you want. I don't personally have any fetishes that are outside of the, um, the normal
*  discourse. As a divorce lawyer, I get to experience the whole spectrum. But if I, like,
*  if I was into like furries, for example, I don't know how I would initiate the conversation with
*  my partner about that. But, but frame the question the other direction. If you were into furries,
*  yeah. How do you prevent your partner from knowing anything about that? That feels like a real,
*  you'd have to make a conscious choice to not let your partner know. Sure. Sure. So, so I, I,
*  I don't think either of those is a particularly palatable or easy proposition, but a lot of people
*  live life hiding some part of themselves. Yeah. Quite unsuccessfully. Like the, the, the second
*  order effects of that are very rarely positive. Sure. I don't, I don't think I've ever met someone
*  who went, yeah, I really hid this huge part of myself for an extended period of time. And that's
*  the best thing that happened. It's I'm really glad. I'm really glad I stayed in the closet as long as
*  I did, you know, it really worked out like it rarely does. It's a question of how long can you
*  hold it off? Yeah. Like I know gay men who stayed in the closet for 40 years, 50 years of their lives.
*  And then they had a successful second chapter as a gay man. I've had clients like that.
*  Do they regret that they were in the closet? No, because they were married. They had kids,
*  like they had experiences. They're glad they had. But would their advice to a young person in their
*  twenties and thirties who's gay be stay in the closet? Cause then you can have a wife and some
*  kids and then you can come out when you're 50 or 60 and have a second chapter. No, they would say,
*  you know, be who you are. Don't be afraid. You know, as you were talking, I'm trying to think
*  of, cause I, I'm publicly and privately in the exact same person or try to be the exact same
*  person. So I usually try to make sure there's nothing to hide, but I, I was trying to come up
*  with a counter example for you for if there's good things to hide. Well, I mean, there could be like
*  past relationships. Like if I slept with thousands of women or something like this,
*  maybe you want to put that to the side. Well, you don't want to be in, there's a difference between
*  being honest about something and being indelicate about it. Right. You know, like I, I,
*  I think we all do this with lovers. Like any of us who've been in more than one relationship,
*  you would not, you know, at the end of sex be like, that was the third best sex I've ever had.
*  You know, like you, that's, it's just indelicate. It's rude, you know? So, so I don't think it's a
*  matter of like total candor at all times, but I think if you were, we're using the furry example,
*  and I'm not picking on furries. I just think if, if that is a proclivity, that is anything other
*  than a passing thought, like it's something that you just keep coming back to, then you're making
*  a conscious decision to withhold it from your partner. And what is that out of? I mean, I would
*  say it's probably out of fear. I'm not a psychologist, but probably out of fear, fear that they would
*  reject you. Okay, well now, see, I genuinely believe that, that
*  this, you know, I, I'm, I'm very conflicted in my religious faith, but I,
*  I don't know that I believe in the devil. But if there was a devil, I think his principal
*  function would be to convince us that we are so bestial that God couldn't love us.
*  It would be to convince us that we're awful and that we should just lean into the awfulness.
*  And I know the greatest low points of my life came whenever I just went, you know what, I'm just,
*  I'm just awful. I might as well just behave awfully. And I, I really believe that
*  when you don't, when you push down parts of yourself, like your sexuality, like your
*  insecurities, your true feelings from your romantic partner, the person who's supposed to be your,
*  you know, your number one, you are making sure you will never feel their love
*  because they don't love you. They love the you you've presented to them, which you know,
*  in your heart is not the authentic, honest, real you. And so if you know you're super into furries
*  and you don't tell your partner about that and your partner says, I love you so much.
*  And you know what I love? One of the things I love about us is we have such great sexual chemistry.
*  You will never feel that love because you know, yeah, that's not true though. She doesn't know.
*  She doesn't know that actually I'm not really satisfied. And there is this thing that I want
*  that I know I can't even tell her because I'm so ashamed. Like that doesn't feel like a good
*  option to me. Yeah. Yeah. So that kind of vulnerability is essential to intimacy.
*  You know, I'm, I'm prone to jujitsu metaphors and this is one of the first conversations where I
*  can actually use them because the person I'm talking to is a jujitsu person, but.
*  And people should know that you are a quote unquote jujitsu person. You have been afflicted
*  with the. I am a brown belt under Marcella Garcia and I am like a seven year brown belt now.
*  So which is the right way to be a brown belt. Well, and also I am, I am, you know, late middle
*  aged middle weight and moderately talented. So I'm, I'm, and training at, at that academy
*  with so many incredibly talented people and training in New York city where there's so many
*  unbelievably talented people, you're, you're constantly humble and feeling like you should
*  just be wearing a blue belt all the time. But, but a lot of, I think as you know, and as most,
*  most people who practice jujitsu know, you start to sort of see jujitsu and everything.
*  I genuinely believe that in love, you have to give something to get something. You have to,
*  everything you do creates a vulnerability. You know, every, every move you make in jujitsu
*  creates opportunity and creates vulnerability. And so you have to be willing to create
*  vulnerabilities in order to get any leverage, in order to get any progress and any way to move
*  the position. You know, you don't want a marriage that's just two people both in 50 50, you know,
*  like you're just sitting in that guard doing nothing. You know, you, you, you wanna,
*  you want it to actually move along. Yeah. I mean, that's the way I see love and relationships is
*  should take that leap of vulnerability, give the other person the option to destroy you.
*  Well, you have to expose and that's the, that's the part that I think is, is, um,
*  hard for everyone, you know, is, is to expose yourself in that way. But that's what I mean,
*  even when I said about getting a dog or having a child, like love, loving anything
*  is tremendously courageous because it's terrifying. And it's only brave if you're scared.
*  If you're not scared, you know, it's not brave. It's just stupidity. It's just, you know, it's,
*  it's, it's bravery when you're afraid and you do the thing anyway. And so love is like, yeah,
*  it's scary. Like I don't care who you are. Like I, you know, being, you know, in the Jiu Jitsu
*  community, like I'm around, you know, as you are like incredibly tough people, like physically
*  tough people, mentally tough people. But you know, I've seen some of those people taken down
*  by 120 pound woman, you know, not, not, not from a grappling perspective, but they are taken apart
*  by a woman in their life and vice versa. I've seen men, you know, who like, it really is shocking
*  how much leverage we give to our romantic partners and how little discussion we really,
*  genuine discussion we really have about it, how much we really are ever trained to think about it.
*  You know, there's nothing in school that teaches us about it. So much of literature and art is an
*  idealized version of it. So little of it is real. And no matter how it evolves, even when it ends in
*  tragedy or drama, I feel like what people don't do enough is appreciate the good times, like
*  appreciate how beautiful it is to having taken the risk and to having experienced that kind of
*  love. I mean, when you look at people that are divorcing each other,
*  there's Edgar Allen Poe quote, the years of love have been forgot in the hatred of a minute.
*  I always kind of am saddened, like deeply saddened how people seem to forget how many beautiful
*  moments have been shared when some reason, some drama, some breakup leads them to part ways.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting that you came to that not being a divorce lawyer,
*  because I felt that way for a long time. And I really try to say to my clients,
*  like in the courtroom at the negotiating table, I have a role to play where I have to be sort of
*  like a pit bull or, you know, some kind of a, like a courtroom sociopath, but behind closed doors,
*  I'm very candid with people. I'm trying to be much more emotionally attuned with them.
*  So you're an empath in the sheets and sociopath in the streets.
*  Exactly. Correct. That's well said. I get a new tattoo idea. That's good. I like that.
*  But I do believe when I'm behind closed doors with people, I say to them, how you end things
*  is going to be how you're going to remember the whole thing. And that's unfortunate because,
*  you know, you watch like a two hour movie and if the last 15 minutes of it sucked, you go, well,
*  that movie sucked. Like, well, the first hour and 45 was great, you know, but you walk out with this
*  bad taste in your mouth. I'm genuinely in awe of how easily people forget that they loved each other.
*  And I'm amazed because by the time I meet them and by the time they hire me to be a weapon against
*  the person they were in love with, there's nothing but animosity there. And so I have to try to
*  imagine what these two people looked like when they were in love with each other and how that
*  even existed. But I have to tell you, like, I, you know, I don't function that way. Like I,
*  every woman I ever had a relationship with, like I, when I think of them, I don't think of the ending
*  necessarily. I think of, I try to think about the greatest hits. I try to think about the moments
*  that were wonderful where I loved them and they loved me and like there was joy and there was
*  connection. And I don't know why you choose not to, you know, it's there's that old axiom, I don't
*  know who said it, that if you don't learn to find joy in the snow, you'll have, you'll have less joy
*  in your life and precisely the same amount of snow. And I, and I genuinely believe like,
*  okay, the relationship ends. This is where it ends. We're done now. I am making a choice as to how I
*  will remember you. And we do it in relationships. Like I always tell people, you know, if you ever
*  want to see a couple light up, if they're ever like the couple at the table, it's, you know,
*  it seems like they got in a fight or something, ask them how they met. And most people, when they
*  talk about how they met, like the face softens, they both in the other person looking at them,
*  telling the story gets that look you were talking about before. And cause they remember that thing
*  and how they felt at that moment. And when, when this person was a choice, not a default,
*  not their automatic plus one, but the person they asked to the wedding, not the, of course,
*  you're bringing her, it's your wife. You bring your fucking wife places. Like it was still,
*  Hey, there's like, you know, three and a half billion women and I'm picking you, you know,
*  like that, that feeling. And, and I don't know why, when a relationship ends, you can't do that.
*  A lesson I learned when my mother passed away of, of a very, she had a two year
*  terrible battle with cancer and was on hospice and was very, very sick. And it was a very slow
*  and awful end. And I remember one of my worst fears was that this is how I would remember my
*  mother for the rest of my life, that I would never be able to think of her, that I didn't think
*  of what she had become in the last months where she was withered away to nothing in this bed,
*  you know? And I learned over time that memory is very kind, that like that faded somehow.
*  And that now, like when I remember her, I remember her healthy and vibrant. I remember her laughter.
*  I remember positive things. Some of that is I like to look at photos of that or, but some of it is
*  just how I think memory works. And I, I don't know why we don't apply that to relationships.
*  And I think part of it is because we have this binary view of relationships, that it's either
*  success, which means you live happily ever after for the rest of your lives and die together.
*  Or like in short succession, or it was wrong. It was awful. And I don't understand why that would
*  have to be how we do it. I think we could look at relationships like what they are, which is chapters
*  in a book. And that book is our life. And those chapters all have significance. And none of them
*  would have the later chapters, none of them would happen without the prior ones. So there's this
*  beauty to me of that. And it's, I don't know if that it's a choice or if that is how it is.
*  And the rest is just narrative that we've put on top of it culturally for some reason.
*  Well, I think to, to push back a little bit, I think memory can also, I think it is a deliberate
*  choice because I think memory can basically, that's how trauma works. It can surface the
*  negative stuff and the negative stuff completely drowns out all the positives. So it's, I think
*  it's a deliberate choice to make your memory probably work that way.
*  In relationships, betrayal can do that, right? Sort of cheating and fidelity,
*  like one event can almost erase the entirety of your understanding of the past and all the
*  memories are sort of shrouded in this darkness of, okay, what I believed was true is totally
*  untrue. And sort of to overcome that and still appreciate the beautiful moments.
*  I'm continually astounded by how long the hurt and anger of betrayal can reverberate.
*  Right. I have clients who were four years, five years past when the divorce ended,
*  the cheating was discovered and they're as angry as they were the day they found out.
*  And I don't know what that's about. Because I also have clients that they like look back on it and
*  they go, you know, we screwed up. Like we were, you know, we didn't do the best, but we did the
*  best we could do at the time. And, you know, we like, there should be stars for wars like ours,
*  you know, there should be champagne for the survivors. Like we made it through, you know,
*  like we survived it and we were fools and we were fools for love. And there are worse things in the
*  world to be fools for. But I also do think that most relationships where there was infidelity,
*  and it's not a, it's not a popular thing to say, and I'll get, I'll get pilloried for it, but,
*  Great. You know, I just don't know, and I don't want to blame the victim of infidelity,
*  but was the relationship really where it needed to be? Like had, were you truly the most just
*  dutiful spouse who was seeing this person's needs be met? Again, we've established in the granola
*  story that people can sometimes with good intentions not be meeting their partner's needs or
*  perceiving their partner's needs or their partner isn't communicating them the right way or all of
*  the above. But I've rarely seen very happy, content couples that cheat on each other.
*  And so I understand there's a shame in saying this person cheated on me or I cheated on this
*  person. Cause I represent, you know, I represent, I represent the cheater and I represent the cheated.
*  I represent the victim of domestic violence. I represent perpetrator of domestic violence.
*  I represent the person with the substance use disorder, the person married to the person. So I
*  don't get to choose the white or the black hat. Like I have my client and that's my client.
*  And it's forces me to put myself into their story from their point of view. And I think that kind of
*  radical empathy that you need to engage in on a daily basis to represent people in those kinds of
*  proceedings. It just, I don't know, it's, it just doesn't seem like there's good guys and bad guys,
*  you know, it just seems like it's complicated and people's intentions and where they actually end up
*  are different. Yeah, I think there's some sense in still remembering the betrayal as it being a
*  symptom of taking life a little too seriously, too seriously where you don't, life shouldn't be taken
*  that seriously. You should be able to laugh at it all. I like the story you say, you know,
*  being able to appreciate the battle that should give stars for those kinds of wars that we fought
*  and just kind of be able to laugh at it all. Especially with love. Like that's just so absurd.
*  Yeah. Like it's so crazy. It's so crazy. I mean, like I, you know, I think it's funny. I think,
*  this is real candor, but you know, as a man, like there's nothing funnier than when you finish
*  masturbating, you know, there's no more humbling moment. And I like to think about the fact that
*  like the richest, famous, most powerful person in the world, they jerk off, you know, the most
*  powerful man in the world jerks off, I'm sure, you know, all of them do. I mean, you probably know
*  them, so you could ask, but in that moment where you just, you come and you go, what am I doing?
*  Like, what the, now I got to wipe that like, oh, good Lord. And there's this feeling of, but a
*  second ago, this seemed like a great idea. And it was, by the way, it was a great idea.
*  But, but there's this moment, this satori, you know, where you just go, oh, like, what, this is
*  so silly. Well, like that's love, that's sex. Like it's great. Like when you read other people's
*  infidelity, the text messages, the emails, because I have to do that all the time. And I'll tell you
*  how we make the sausage in a divorce lawyer's office. This is some of the most entertaining
*  moments is dramatic readings aloud of people's infidelity exchanges with their lovers.
*  The sex.
*  Yeah, the sex and the like, you know, like, it's just so ridiculous. Cause people have to go through
*  all kinds of gymnastics to be able to meet and have sex in weird places. And, you know,
*  and you're reading this and you're reading these texts and you kind of go like, oh my God.
*  And by the way, like I've represented some very powerful people
*  and you read their texts with their lover or even their spouse, like even their spouse, you know,
*  and they're just pathetic. I mean, they're just like, so not powerful. They're so like, hey, babe.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I have a, I have a, we'll remain totally nameless. I have a very powerful, wealthy, famous
*  former client where there's a whole series of texts about is my dick weird, which by the way,
*  which by the way, I think the answer is, is if you have to ask, if you have a weird dick,
*  the answer is probably yes. Cause I've, I've owned one and I've never thought it's this weird,
*  but, but I, the fact that you're having this discussion, like it's absurd. It's hilarious.
*  Like love is hilarious. It's bizarre. It's such a weird vulnerability. It's such a,
*  a basic visceral human need, you know, it, it, it really is something that we just,
*  you know, it's mysterious. It, it, it, but it, but it, it doesn't have to be that complicated.
*  I don't think that even betrayal, like I said, it doesn't have to be that complicated. I think
*  we can frame it differently. Yeah. You can laugh at the whole thing. I mean, I, I think what we
*  don't often do with ourselves is look back at texts or look back at emails or look back at
*  Google search. I did that recently, just looking at what I searched for, like 10 years ago, 15,
*  it's like, forget last week, just look at your Google searches last week and you're like,
*  wait a minute, what, why did you just search for this 50 times? Like, why did, why did the
*  karate kid three pop in your head? Why, and like you're like, where's Ralph macho now?
*  And where did he dating? Yeah. And then mother, and then, and then you're like a restaurant
*  nearby. Like, how did I go from this to that? But, but it made sense at the time. So, so when
*  you ask someone, how did our relationship fall apart? It's like looking at the Google search
*  history of yourself from 10 years, you don't even know why you were thinking about those things.
*  And now you want to understand why you did what you did, felt what you felt. She felt what she
*  did, what she did and why the two of you, how you impacted each other and interacted with each
*  other. Really? You think that's doable? But you've, so you've in the courtroom, does that come up like
*  text messages with that resulted in, uh, with whoever you're cheating with? So you have to-
*  I mean, you know, cheating doesn't come up as much because most states are no fault states now. So why
*  someone's getting divorced, whether it's infidelity or, you know, it doesn't matter. There's no good
*  spouse bonus or bad spouse penalty. Oh, there isn't. I mean, can you elaborate on that? Like,
*  that's- Well, you can have, we've had times where we have to prove infidelity because we want to
*  prove what's called wasteful dissipation of marital assets, which means that you were spending money
*  that was marital money on a paramour. That's what the legal name for a ex, you know, for a boyfriend
*  or girlfriend in the marriage. And usually the person calls it, you know, that whore or that
*  piece of shit, but we call it the paramour. Yeah, the paramour. And the, the, the, you know,
*  sometimes we have to prove inclination and opportunity. We have to prove that this person
*  had the inclination to cheat and that they had the opportunity to cheat. And then we want to show
*  that, okay, so when they went away, that should be considered dissipation of marital assets. So if you
*  go out to dinner with your brother, you didn't dissipate the marital estate. But if you bought
*  your paramour, a Tiffany bracelet, that would be a dissipation of marital assets. And the person's
*  entitled to a credit back for that from what was taken out of the marital estate. So we do sometimes
*  have to authenticate text messages on the witness stand or in depositions, you know. And what's
*  interesting about that is the way people approach it. Like people sometimes try to pretend, oh no,
*  this is just my good friend, you know, and which is just like, you kill your credibility, you know,
*  if you, oh no, she's just my very good friend. She's not, she's not that that makes no sense
*  whatsoever. Or no, we were just friends at that point. And then several months later is when we,
*  once this marriage was over, that's when we got together as partners. That's ridiculous.
*  But sometimes people just own it, just own it. Like I did a deposition of an executive once and,
*  you know, opposing counsel, I thought they were going to really hit them. They were like,
*  and looking at this credit card receipt, what was this charge for, for this hotel? He was like,
*  oh, that was for a hotel room that I got with my girlfriend. And you were married. Yes, yes.
*  Where did you stay at the hotel? It was, we didn't even stay. We actually just did like an
*  afternoon delight rolled around in bed for the day. Yeah. And it was like, well now, you know,
*  we took all the thunder out of that. What's the downside of doing that? It seems like there wasn't.
*  It actually, I think helped his credibility. It was my client. So I thought it was the right move.
*  We hadn't really discussed it in advance, but he, he, he was naturally intelligent enough to go,
*  yeah, my credibility, like I'm not going to lie under oath. I'll admit what it was, but I'll do
*  it in such an, you know, we did it like at the end, like Eminem at the end of Eight Mile.
*  Like it was very like, yeah, I cheated on her with this person. Now tell these people something they
*  don't know about me, you know? And, and, and that's kind of how I try to, as a trial lawyer,
*  we actually in my firm refer to it as the Eight Mile strategy, which is like, we will, if I know
*  there was a text message sent, you know, you piece of shit, I hope you die.
*  My client sent that text message to his co-parent. I, I, on my examination of my client,
*  I will say, I'd like to have this marked for identification, shown to the witness. What is
*  that? It's a text message. Who's it to? Plaintiff. You sent it? Yeah. Read it out loud for the court.
*  Mm-hmm. Do I have to? I think you should. You're a piece of S. Does it say S? No.
*  What does it say? Well, it's a profanity. Say it, say,
*  you piece of shit, I hope that you die. Yeah. You sent that to her? Yes. Why? I was really mad.
*  Do you think that was good? No. Do you think it was helpful for your co-parenting relationship
*  with her? No. Why did you send it then? You know, she sent me like 50 texts exactly like that,
*  and I never responded, and I pushed it down every time, and then finally I just blew up at her. If
*  you had it to do over again, would you do it differently? You know, I wish I could say I would,
*  but the truth is I'm human and I was at my limits, and I'm watching opposing counsel cross out entire
*  sheets of their cross-examination because it's gone now. They thought that they had their like
*  Perry Mason moment. They had their like, did you order the code red moment, and it's gone now.
*  Because if you just own and accept your fault or your issues in the relationship,
*  you can take a lot of the power out of that. I wish we wouldn't take texts seriously.
*  I don't think we should have substantive discussions via text. I think text was designed
*  for are you here? Yes. 15 minutes away, or I got here safely. Love you. Like that substantive
*  discussions. People love having arguments via text, and I have to say when you read other people's
*  text messages, as I am often forced to do, it is amazing because just like that Google history you
*  were talking about, I don't know how the hell you got from one thing to another. Like I was just
*  reading on actually on the way here in the car. I was reading through a text exchange between two
*  co-parents in the middle of a custody thing that I'm involved in. And it's like you piece of shit.
*  You never cared about anything, and I'm going to take you have no right to take the kids from it.
*  And then the next day, nothing in between. The next day, Maddie got a good great honor science
*  thing. Oh, that's great. She's doing so well. It makes me so happy. Yeah. Her teacher said she's
*  doing really well. Yeah. That's really great to see. I'll be there about 15 minutes late. No problem.
*  Wait, like it was a day ago. Was there some, I want to know, was there a phone conversation in
*  between where one of you went, Hey, man, listen, I'm really sorry about that. Oh, no, look, we were
*  both pissed, whatever. Or is it just like you did that and then we're supposed to pretend that
*  didn't happen. And now we're just going to talk about what Maddie got on her test. Yeah. Well,
*  sometimes a good nap or a good night's sleep can solve a lot of emotional issues. I totally get it.
*  But is there some, if you're looking just at the texts, like it begs the question,
*  wouldn't you take the nap and then go, Hey, listen, I just woke up from the nap. It turns
*  out I was really tired. Like, does that not happen by text? Oh, no, that's, uh,
*  because sometimes it's hard to probably apologize for being an asshole. Right? So I think we use
*  just texts. We humans use all kinds of forms of communication to kind of vent. I think it's the
*  wrong thing to do, but people do do that. Text as a permanence though. It's writing. I mean,
*  it's writing. You think like a lawyer. I like it. You think like a lawyer, but lawyers think,
*  lawyers think like detail, you know, and, and why would you write that down? Like, you know,
*  writing it down, like, would you write it down and would you put it on a billboard in Times Square?
*  Cause like that's explained. Everything you say on Facebook or Instagram cannon will be used
*  against you in a court of law. Like every photo you post, I mean, that's going on with a, a,
*  what's his name? Jake Paul or whatever Paul and Dylan Danis right now that that guy's girlfriend,
*  every picture has ever been put on the internet of her by her is being weaponized right now.
*  To reference an earlier part of our discussion. That's love. You take a big risks,
*  big risk putting it out there, putting out there on texts, putting out there on social media.
*  But is the reward of doing it via text worthwhile? I'm listen, the reward of love,
*  I think is worth the risks of love, but the benefit of communicating by text, does it merit
*  that, that risk of that being in writing that the person can reflect on and review and scroll back
*  and get heated up again about, I don't know, we just take risks and we're vulnerable with each other.
*  There may be something about text that for whatever reasons inspires a kind of candor
*  because I think it is a new way to communicate, right? Yeah. In the scheme of things. And so
*  sometimes, you know, we don't know the thing until it's really come into existence. So
*  I don't know. I think it started as something that we just communicated in a very extemporaneous,
*  unplanned way, like texts were meant to be. I'm here, I'm outside, whatever it might be.
*  And so what happens when you start to talk about more emotional, deeper, bigger things or visceral
*  things or more emphatic, passionate things using a technology that was originally just being used
*  for that purpose? I don't know the answer to that. What I do know is yeah, as a lawyer,
*  A, from an evidentiary perspective and B, I just know what it looks like on the outside.
*  Like I know when I read it, what it looks like. And that's not always accurate. Like to just see
*  it's like when you watch a video of someone at just their worst moment, you know,
*  and the person tries to say, but wait, that's not me. Like that was just me in that moment.
*  That was me at this incredible low point. And I think as a lawyer, my job is to weaponize that
*  and to try to say, okay, this low point is indicative of who they actually are. Yeah.
*  And when I'm defending someone, I'm not supposed to say, you know, well, this is their low point.
*  And we've all been to a low point. And this is just a moment in this person. And to judge them
*  by that moment, would you want to be judged by your worst moment? So I have to be able to look
*  at that both directions. Yeah. I mean, I don't think anyone looks great on text. I mean, there's
*  so much of our communication that is missing. You know, your expression, like my sense of humor does
*  not do well via text. Like I, because I have like sometimes a sarcastic sense of humor or I have a
*  dry sense of humor and it does not always translate well to text. The nuance of things is lost
*  sometimes, you know. Yeah. But that's what makes the risk of it hilarious. I mean, the emojis,
*  the memes, all that, taking a risk, the dry, the, there's a risk with a text. If you do some like
*  dark, dry statement, right. That's a joke. And then the pause and then there's no response for a
*  couple of hours. I mean, that's beautiful. I don't know. That's a, that's like a, it's this, you know,
*  it's the gap between the two trapezes, you know, like once you've hit send and you're like, well,
*  see where this goes. Like this is coming back now, you know, and you're waiting and waiting. It's
*  like that moment of just hang is, yeah, that's a rush. I mean, that's a rush. That's a beautiful
*  thing. Well, I have my friend, Michael Malice living close by and if, if the courtroom were
*  ever to see the text between us, I would, we would be both in jail for many, many years. It's a peanut.
*  Yeah. When this finally comes out, when I have my Johnny Depp Amber Heard moment,
*  we'll get Michael Malice. Well, but that was one of, you know, the Johnny Depp Amber Heard
*  thing was a great example of in a gunfight between those two, everyone was cheering for the bullets.
*  I mean, no one was, I don't think anybody looked like a hero. They both looked like what they are,
*  which is humans, really flawed humans who had, you know, it really is like that, that people
*  magazine thing stars, they're just like us, you know, like we watched that and went like,
*  oh yeah, they're just like us. Like they cannot keep it together. They cannot have like, they just
*  have these ridiculous toxic moments where both of them looked awful in that trial.
*  Well, what do you take away from that trial? Just, just given, given all the work you've done. I mean,
*  for me, I don't know if you can speak to that is probably the first time I've seen that kind of
*  a complicated relationship, even just to say a relationship laid out in this raw form,
*  like the fights of a relationship. Yeah. My feeling about that trial is there is no amount
*  of money that would be worth laying that kind of stuff bare publicly. For you, if you were Johnny
*  Depp, there's no amount of money. Because they both look awful. They both look awful. And I don't
*  think, I don't think I'm qualified to say if one or both of them are awful, but they both had moments
*  in that courtroom where their behavior and words looked awful. And, and I just don't know that,
*  that exposing that to the world, like the, I just don't know. I mean, I understand the point of view
*  that, that by bringing that suit, Johnny Depp was saying, look, I, yeah, I have to show these awful
*  things to the world about myself, but it's, it's not as bad as what she's claimed I've done. So I
*  get it. I'm not saying that's incorrect. And for Amber Heard, I think her response is, well, for
*  him to say I'm lying, you know, I have to prove my, but my God, like what an awful thing to watch.
*  I, it was all it really is, is just another, it's just another couple. Like there's, you know,
*  how banal that is, you know, many of those. That's kind of stuff happening.
*  A lot. It's the norm. It's not, it's not the exception. They just happen to have like a grand
*  scale because they have, you know, lots of people around them and lots of money, but yeah, it's all
*  this, that kind of dysfunction, that kind of chaos, that kind of he said, she said to people with
*  completely differing histories of what happened in the marriage, false allegations of domestic
*  violence or true allegations of domestic violence that are completely denied by the person. And you
*  have witnesses that'll say, oh my God, they never engaged in any kind of, because again, no one
*  engages in domestic violence with company over, you know, you don't like invite friends. Like
*  people always say, Oh no, I saw them. They seem so happy. Like people always do this to me as a
*  divorce lawyer. They come in and they go, well, here's photos of the kids, you know, smiling with
*  me. So that's proof that like I'm a good dad. I'm like, there's photos of Jeffrey Dahmer smiling
*  with people he ate later. And you're, you're, you think these photos prove something? Like I don't,
*  the lack of, I'm in the middle of a very complex domestic violence trial and the entire defense on
*  the other side is, well, we have photos of them on vacation where they look very happy and she never
*  called the cops. That's no defense at all. Like most victims of intimate partner abuse don't call
*  the cops. They don't identify, self-identify as victims of domestic violence. And they probably
*  have many stretches of time of intense happiness or happiness. Of course. And by the way, perpetrators
*  of domestic violence are charismatic. How else would they get victims? You know, it's not like
*  if they were ogreish, no one would sign on for that relationship. It's that when they're good,
*  they're so good that when they're bad, you go, but wait, no, that's not him. The really good person
*  is him or her. You know, we saw that in the public testimony of that, you know, depth heard thing is
*  they, there were moments where you look at her and go, Oh my God, like I want one just like that.
*  And there are moments where you listen to the testimony and go, Oh my God, she's awful. Like
*  what? That's just evil. And the same for him. So I really, this should teach us something about
*  how not only are there two sides to every story, like that there's just so much complexity and
*  nuance to these. But I think everyone was asking the question, whether you were team depth, team
*  heard, or team, I could care less about either of these people. Everybody's looking at it going,
*  why? Like why 8 billion people in the world? Why did you stay together? Just break up. You're
*  miserable. It's obvious. It's obvious. You're not, this can't be worth it. I've actually become
*  friendly with Camille Vasquez, who's the lawyer on the depth side. She's an incredible woman,
*  great lawyer, and just a great human being. Just how passionate she's about her work. I mean,
*  you, you radiate this kind of same passion. Like she's just truly happy doing what she does.
*  And, and, but also where the stress of a case, it is like takes like, it is becomes her. She's,
*  you can't sleep, all this kind of stuff, which is fascinating.
*  That's it. I think that's a function of our professions. We, we, we, um, even after 20 plus
*  years of doing this, like the night before a trial, I can hardly sleep. And I, excitement, fear.
*  Yes. Yes. Okay. All of that, all of that. And, and I even have moments as I, I, I pull up to the
*  courthouse and I listen, I wear certain cufflinks that are like my lucky cufflinks or something.
*  And, and I pull up to the courthouse, I walk into the courtroom and I have this feeling in the pit
*  of my stomach. And then it starts. And the moment it starts, something in me goes, oh yeah, I know
*  how to do this. And it's instantly like, I just, I own it. I love it. And it's, yeah, it's the,
*  the people that love this job, you know, being a trial lawyer, being a, a particularly a divorce
*  trial lawyer, family law trial lawyer. It's, I love it. I love, I, I love it more than I loved
*  it when I started doing it. I still, you know, I, I can't imagine spending five days a week looking
*  forward to two, you know, I, I love what I do. I, I don't know that I'll ever love anyone or
*  anything more than I love the work. So I saw you on a talk with Steve Harvey a bunch of times and
*  it was, I always loved it. One thing just sticks in my head from something he said as a device
*  that if you and your partner, your spouse are, you know, if there's a fight, there's a difficult
*  thing you have to deal with. Keep that to yourself. Don't talk to anyone else. Like that's a little,
*  like a, what does he say? Like a two arm circle or something, whatever the expression is,
*  but basically resolve it all internally. Don't like when you face the world, you have a front
*  of like, don't take sides against the family. Yeah. Yes. Like it all boils down to Godfather.
*  Everything boils down to Godfather references. It really does. And true romance. Yeah. You
*  don't take sides against the family. You don't, you don't, you don't show that weakness to the
*  world. I mean, again, I don't know that, I don't know that Steve in candor would say you shouldn't
*  discuss it with your own therapist, you know, but I, but I think what he's saying is don't project
*  it out to the world. Don't share that because I think, you know, it will, it can change the way
*  people view your relationship, which then will change the way you view your relationship,
*  you know? And so I think don't run reckless when it comes to your, that primary relationship.
*  Don't run your mouth recklessly. Yeah. It's one of the things I mentioned to you offline that,
*  you know, my now close friend, Joe Rogan, I've never heard him ever speak negatively of his
*  wife. It's always like super positive, how awesome a person she is. And that to me has always been an
*  inspiration to do the same for everybody in my life, to always speak positively about them.
*  That has a probably a virtuous spiral effect. I'm sure. Like I, that's, that's probably because
*  he has a great wife and he has a great wife in part because of that. Like I think it's clear
*  that he's in her corner and cheering for her. It's clear she's cheering for him. Like they,
*  it's not like Joe Rogan's not a man who has opportunity. I mean, he's surrounded by UFC
*  Ring Girls for God's sakes. Like this is a guy who has all the opportunity in the world. He seems to
*  be quite a fan of his wife. And that is, you know, that's the superpower. Like that's the real thing.
*  Now the question is, is, you know, he doesn't seem to talk about it like, oh, I've got to really work
*  at that. You know, and that's not a man who's afraid to talk about what he works at. You know,
*  he's pretty honest about, man, yeah, I got to work really hard to stay in show. We got to work
*  really hard to be able to do this. Like, yeah, I'm not good at memorizing that. It takes time.
*  But I've never heard him say like, oh, marriage is a lot of work. Like, and I think that stays
*  credit because it seems like they're enjoying that. It's also not incredibly public. Like it's not
*  something most people couldn't pick her out of a lineup. He kept it private for many years. And
*  just because it's a private joy, it's a private, like deep, meaningful, intimate partnership.
*  That's interesting. That's also an inspiration. It doesn't, not everything about your life has
*  to be this like, like, look at me, I'm happy. Like, I'm in a happy relationship. Everything is
*  wonderful. Especially that. I think there is something about the womb-like, cocoon-like
*  joy, you know, of like love, you know, when you're just talked in, snuggled in, like just pressed
*  against each other with that. Like that's such a, you know, like a, it's just the two of you.
*  Yeah. And that's lovely, you know, and that's such a good thing. And I, like, we were just
*  dying for connection, you know, and that connection is so big. It's so everything, you know, one of my
*  earliest psychedelic experiences, probably when I was a teenager, but a theme that's been persistent
*  in every psychedelic experience I've ever had is this idea of like, everything is connection.
*  Everything is being pressed to someone and with them, you know, like the warmth of human connection.
*  Like I, one of the reasons I enjoy listening to your work and your perspective has always been
*  that I think at the core, you see connection and love. And I think for me, from my earliest
*  experiences with psychedelics at, you know, 16, 17, I was very attuned to that. I was very much,
*  that was put on my radar by psychedelics and just stayed part of my consciousness forever.
*  And I think I had a 30 something year break from psychedelics, but it was like, when I came back
*  to it, I went, oh yeah, it's still there. That's still the core of everything is connection.
*  I mean, it's fascinating how deeply you value connection, how empathic you are
*  that you would be doing what you're doing, which is, or is it not?
*  No, I think it's actually why I'm well suited for what I do. I think what I do is I have to learn the
*  story of my client and know it and feel it very deeply. And I have to feel it in a very human way
*  that's very compassionate to this person. And then I have to feel it and understand it in a way
*  that's incredibly antagonistic to it so I can shore up defenses. So I have to feel this person's
*  story and feelings from every possible angle, because every one of them is a vulnerability
*  and every one of them is a potential strength and a potential defense. And so I actually think it's
*  my number one, other than extemporaneous speaking ability, it is my number one job tool is the
*  ability to radically empathize and to put myself in the emotional state of someone in its best
*  possible light and its worst possible light so that I can see again the defense and I can
*  see the vulnerability. But I mean, so that's beautifully put, but also just to bear witness
*  to this connection broken in the most dramatic way over and over and over and over. That part is hard,
*  but I was a hospice volunteer for many, many years when I first got out of college. And it
*  really showed me a lot about what is sadness, what is tragic, and what is just inevitable decay,
*  what is pain and decay. We all die. We play a game you can't win to the utmost. And so if we know the
*  answer to all of this is you're going to die, then what do we do with the rest of that time? If all
*  your stuff is just stuff, it's just going to go to the, you know, the money's going to go, like
*  everything's your looks is going to go, your everything's going to go, love's going to end one
*  way or the other, then what are we doing? You know, and again, I think it's love and connection, but
*  what I'm doing for a living is helping, and I don't look at it as what I'm doing is helping people beat
*  the crap out of each other. I look at it as I'm trying to help a client build their post-divorce
*  life, to sort of rise from the ashes of that which has fallen apart and move on to the next chapter,
*  and refocus and have the things they need financially, emotionally, whatever it might be,
*  interpersonally in terms of with their kids. And so for me, it's actually a job that is very
*  consistent with my desire to build connection and to be empathetic. And witnessing the ashes doesn't
*  make you cynical about the whole thing of love. No, because again, you know, 56% of marriage is
*  ending divorce, but 84% are remarried within five years. Like we keep doing it over and over again.
*  And that's a good thing. I think it is a good thing.
*  The mess of it, the absurdity of it, the hypocrisy of it, that's something beautiful about that.
*  Well, it's just the return is so great on the investment, you know? Like, listen, man,
*  I've had more than one dog. Like when my dog died, the first dog I had died, I remember when I'm
*  never going to love again. I'm done. I'm done with this. I will never expose myself to this kind of
*  pain again. I'll never have to take the dog bed and put it in the closet and like, oh.
*  And then some friend called me and said, we have an adoption event. Can you just watch this dog
*  for 24 hours and then we'll take him. You know, we just need, you know, and I went, yeah, all right,
*  I'll watch a dog for the night, you know, and this dog come in and say, oh, he has mange. He's not
*  fucking, fuck, I got another dog. He walked in and my heart went, yeah, I got a dog. And now that dog
*  is 13 years old and his eyes are cloudy and he doesn't go up the stairs real well and he's going
*  to break my heart. And I wouldn't change that for the world. I'm still there. I'm still struggling
*  for the second one. I've lost a dog and it broke my heart. Yeah. But I think. And you'll never,
*  you'll never lose that pain, but I promise you, your heart has an infinite capacity for the kind
*  of love you felt with that dog and you'll never feel a love that replaces the whole.
*  Like there will never be another buster for me, but there was Kaba and like, you know what,
*  like, you know what, like, and when he's gone, there will never be another one of him.
*  But you know what, like when, when that stupid puppy that was five months old, stumbled in,
*  I went, I guess I'm going to do this again. And you know what? I'm so glad. I'm so glad. And I
*  know, by the way, I know now because, and that's where I I've said, like, you know, it's that
*  Joseph Brodsky poem, you know, a song, like, I wish I knew no astronomy when stars appear.
*  Like, I wish I didn't know the pain, but you know what, like, I don't care. I don't care. And I
*  believe we don't care. I think, and I think there's something to that. If something hurts so badly
*  and you go, I'm going to do it again. I'm going to do it. That it must be of value. It must be of
*  real value. There's also a different perspective on it, that pain. So there's that from Louie,
*  the show of this interaction with an old man with Lucy Kane. He says that, because Louie is
*  mourning the loss of, got split up, he got dumped or whatever. And he's mourning the loss of that
*  partner of love. And the old man says that that is the best part. Like missing the love is still
*  love. The real bad part is when you forget it, when the pain fades, it's all gone. But the pain is
*  actually a kind of celebration of the love you have. Well, the opposite of love isn't hate. The
*  opposite of love is indifference. There's no question about that. I mean, hate is a passionate
*  emotion. Love is a passionate emotion. And there is a school of thought that says that only
*  unfulfilled love can be truly romantic. But I believe that it's what I think I learned from
*  hospice is that I think for me, knowing the impermanence is the thing. It's the key.
*  Yeah, it's finite. Eventually it's going to be over. And so like that intensifies the feeling
*  that that's when you can have pure love without the drama. Dogs are for me a great example.
*  And again, I don't know what it all means, right? Existentially. But I just feel like they have that
*  that kind of love has to be here to teach us something. And I feel like the fact that they're
*  so amazing and just so loving and so wonderful and the bond we feel is so amazing and deep and
*  doesn't require a lot of maintenance. And yet it's so finite. Like it's just this short little
*  lifespan. And I feel like there's just such a lesson there. You know, there's so much there
*  to unpack about the nature of connection and loss. And, you know, that your heart
*  has this infinite capacity. Like when you're I'm telling you, when my dog died, when Buster died,
*  I remember thinking with certainty, I will never do this again, because I'll never love that way
*  again. I'll never love a dog the way I love this dog. And it's just not true. That's just not true.
*  Like you have this infinite capacity. And that makes it scary, actually, because like right now,
*  there's so many people you could love. There's so many dogs you could love. Like there's so much
*  out there. And it requires a certain bravery and tremendous amount of risk to do it, you know.
*  And a commitment. Because I think to really experience love is you just dive in. Because
*  there is a huge number of people. But to really like, I mean, you have to like really
*  dive into the full complexity, the full range of another human being.
*  Yeah, which is hard. Because we don't even I don't know that we even feel comfortable diving into the
*  full range of ourselves. You know, there's pieces of ourselves we try to push away or not think
*  about. Okay, so speaking of the whole sociopath slash empath that is all embodied in one human
*  being that is you, let's go back to some cases perhaps that you've worked on, just something
*  that stands out to you. What's maybe the craziest, most complicated thing you've worked on? Is there
*  something that pops to mind? Craziest would be different than most complicated. Let's go craziest.
*  Yeah, so craziest? Ah, gosh, that's a great question. So from a chaos standpoint, I mean,
*  I see so many bizarre fact patterns and so many variations of people cheating with people,
*  people sleeping with the nanny, people sleeping with someone's relative of their spouse,
*  people having same sex or polyamorous relationships and the other person doesn't even know they're
*  not monogamous. So much craziness that you could fill 15 books. In terms of complexity,
*  you know, I mean, emotionally complex is any custody case is emotionally complex,
*  because you're dealing with parenting issues. And what makes a good parent, I think, is a very
*  tricky question, because, you know, I'm trying to convince a judge who's a better parent.
*  And that is so loaded with subjective, you know, value judgments.
*  Is there, just to linger on the maternal presumption, is that a thing you come face to
*  face with often? Well, there was, I mean, it was real. It was the law. There was something in the
*  law called the maternal presumption. It was also known as the tender years doctrine, which meant
*  that a child under the age of seven was presumed to be in the custody of the mother, unless you
*  could show she was an unfit mother. So that's where the idea of like, someone has to be proven an
*  unfit mother came from. Now, in the 80s, 1980s, that was changed. But, you know, under my skin is
*  under my sovereignty. I mean, you can't suggest that there isn't in the world a suggestion that
*  a mother who births a child and feeds a child with her body doesn't have a particular bond with a
*  child that's different than a father's bond with a child. So where do we put that? How much importance
*  do we put on it? Now that there's better and more research in the mental health field about
*  attachment theory and infants, there's also a lot of, you know, a lot of research on how is attachment
*  formed? How should parenting schedules be put together based on attachment theory? But, you know,
*  there's conflicting perspectives on that. And so it's judge to judge. You see, like, is there a lot
*  of variation? Yeah, there is because there's lots of kinds of judges. Like, there's judges that are
*  thoughtful, enlightened, interested in mental health research. And there's judges that just want,
*  were unsuccessful lawyers that were good politically and got elected. And they just want to,
*  you know, they just want a job where like they show up at nine o'clock, they have a lunch break
*  from 12 until two o'clock and that they leave at 430 and they get a certain number of weeks vacation
*  and a pension after 20 years. So what is in general the process of these custody battles?
*  Like what, what are the, what's the landscape? Well, most, the overwhelming majority of custody
*  cases don't end up in my office. They, they, they, they are a negotiation between two people that
*  love their children more than they dislike their soon to be ex. So the overwhelming majority of
*  cases are just two people going, okay, how are we going to make decisions together? Because there
*  are decisions that have to be made about kids. Will they go to public or private school? Can they
*  go on medication if they need it or not? Should we change pediatricians? You know, all those kinds of
*  things. How do we make decisions and when will we each spend time with the kids? And so most custody
*  cases are just that. Most custody cases are just a discussion, a negotiation between counsel
*  about those issues. And they're not ugly and they're not anything. They're just people, again,
*  sometimes people have differing perspectives, you know, but sometimes people haven't thought
*  through their perspective. So as a divorce lawyer, a lot of what I'm doing is counseling a person
*  because they come in and say, well, I've been the person who handles, you know, all of the homework
*  and all of the everything, so he should only see the kids on weekends. And there's a logic to that.
*  Like I've always done the homework with the kids, so I'm the parent who's in charge of the homework
*  and he's obviously not done that before. But there's also a logic that you can then say, right,
*  but then you're doing all the heavy lifting of parenting and he's doing none of that.
*  And you were a married couple and living together, so he was trusting you to do that because you're
*  good at it and you seem to like it. So maybe now we want him to have to do some of the heavy lifting
*  of parenting because we don't want the child when they're 13 to say, I love dad, we have nothing
*  but a good time together, whereas you make me do my homework and eat my broccoli. Dad's the grass on
*  the other side of the fence that's greener. So sometimes it's about educating a client to like
*  change their frame, you know, to look at this differently. Yeah, okay, we always go to my
*  mother's for Thanksgiving, so I need every Thanksgiving. Okay, well, you were married,
*  so you went to, now you're going to have new traditions. Things are changing for your children,
*  things are changing for your family. You're both going to have new traditions. So a lot of times
*  it's just educating people on looking at things in a different way, looking at their parenting in a
*  different way. We're not going to live in the same house anymore, but we're still going to parent
*  these child, you know, this child or these children together. What's much more interesting,
*  because like, you know, I don't get invited to a lot of parties, but when I get invited to parties,
*  if somebody says, what do you do for a living? And I say, I'm a divorce lawyer and they go, oh my God,
*  you must have stories. That's the way everybody's, oh my God, you must have so many stories.
*  And if I said, yeah, there was this couple and they, you know, slowly grew apart and then they
*  decided that it would be good for them to end their relationship as a married couple, but they
*  wanted to continue to have an amicable co-parenting relationship. So they divided their assets and
*  then they figured out a good parenting access schedule that made sure that they both had
*  both leisure time and responsibilities with the children. People would be like,
*  that's the worst fucking story. Yeah, that's so boring. Yeah. So what they really want is
*  he was sleeping with the nanny and then she caught him. So, you know, the truth is like,
*  people want to hear about those flame outs. And by the way, those are super interesting as a lawyer.
*  Like it's super interesting. It's usually going to be what, infidelity? You do have a chapter called
*  everybody fucks the nanny. Everybody's fucking the nanny. Yeah. There's a nanny fascination out there.
*  I try to explain it in the book, but yeah, I mean, I've had some great nanny stories. I mean,
*  people run off with the nanny, people end up getting married to the nanny.
*  I had one where the, he convinced her that they should have a threesome with the nanny. They got
*  the nanny drunk. They had a bunch of threesomes with the nanny and then the nanny and the wife
*  paired up and left him. Oh, nice. And they're still quite happy. It seems like a happy ending.
*  For everyone but him, but it was his idea. Well, he's really going to have a nanny fascination.
*  Now he's, yeah. Well, now he's got to see the nanny who's now the like step-parent to the kids.
*  And it was his bright idea of let's have a threesome with the nanny. Yeah. I mean,
*  the nanny thing I think is a function of in many circumstances is the characteristics of the wife
*  that he remembers fondly and that have been extinguished by the presence of children.
*  So my words of wisdom is not don't get a nanny or make sure you get an ugly nanny.
*  My thought on it is that a woman should remember even when she's a mother that she's also a woman
*  who a man, you know, they fell in love with each other and she should take time to be in touch with
*  the part of herself that is an independent woman that's interesting and interested. And, you know,
*  and, you know, like there's a lot to be learned from divorced couples because like divorced
*  couples, if you do it right, it's awesome. Like I had a wonderful experience parenting and being
*  divorced because I divorced when my kids were quite young. My co-parent, you know, my ex-wife
*  is awesome. She's a great mom, nice person. We're good friends. And it was great. I had half the
*  time I had my kids and I could focus on them. And the other half of the time they were with the other
*  person who loves them as much as I do. And I didn't have any of the responsibilities of kids.
*  And I could just have, you know, all of the wonderful fun that you can have when you don't
*  have, you know, the responsibilities that come with full-time caring for children.
*  So what would you say now on the flip positive side? We've been talking about
*  the collapse of things. What about success? What's the secret to a successful romantic relationship?
*  My mom used to say that it's hard to define intelligence, but you could spot stupid a mile
*  away. So I'm much better at pointing out where people fall apart because I spend a lot of time
*  with people who have fallen apart in their relationship. So it's easy to then say,
*  well, just don't do what they do. But I don't know that that's not an oversimplification.
*  So again, I think the answer is connection. I think the answer is
*  affection, presence, you know, mindfulness and presence. I do think
*  in my personal and professional experience that most people want you fully more than they just
*  want you in a disconnected way. So if you were to say to your romantic partner, you can have me for
*  two hours where I'm giving you my undivided attention and I'm really joyful to be with you,
*  or you can have me for eight hours where I'm sort of half paying attention and I kind of want to be
*  someplace else for part of the time. There's just no choice there. It's so obvious. So I think
*  presence is a big piece. And I think that the you, the me and the we, I think is important
*  because I think in relationships, there's you and there's me and we meet and something magical
*  happens, you know, and we become we. And now there's you and there's me and there's we.
*  And then the we gets bigger and bigger and bigger. And isn't it great? Because it's such a nice warm
*  place. It gets so big, but it gets so big that you get small and me gets small because we. And if any
*  of us dares to ask, well, what about you? What about me? No, no, the we. What, you don't like the we?
*  You don't want to be with the we? Like, well, no, it's not that. But the we only exists because there
*  was you and there was me and I really like you and you really liked me. And so we picked each other
*  out of lots of choices. And now this we is so fucking big, like it threatens to just consume
*  all of it, you know? And I really think that there's something there we have to look at more honestly.
*  So the we should not consume everything, but at the same time, not be small.
*  Well, the we is the you and the me. And if you mix it so much that you and me loses its
*  components, that all that's left is we, like, I don't think that that's the way to do it.
*  The world pulls us in that direction. Like we get told culturally that, well, why aren't you going
*  with this person to that? Why would you do that by yourself? And why? Why? Like anyone knows that
*  there's joy in being away from each other and there's joy being reunited together. So why don't
*  we speak very honestly about that? And I think some of that's our own insecurity. Well, why don't
*  you want to be with me 24 hours a day? Aren't I wonderful? Aren't I delightful? It's like, well,
*  what? Well, but also probably people are either afraid or lazy in developing their individual
*  selves. I mean, it's still, it's lonely going out there in the world by yourself and it's comforting
*  in that little cocoon of we. I mean, it can also be incredibly adventurous going out into the world
*  by yourself and then coming back to the we with a full report. Yeah. You know, coming back and
*  saying like, Oh my God, guess what I saw? Guess what I did? Oh my God, we have to go there together
*  now. Cause all I could think about was you. Yeah. You know, while I was there, I was like,
*  Oh my God, she would love this. You know, like that's magical. That's amazing. Like,
*  like I look what I brought you back. You know, I went into this and then I got you this
*  present from there. Like there's something, you know, and we know this, you know, I always
*  thought it was, you know, like when you watch the old Westerns, you know, or like the,
*  you know, the heroes leaving, you know, and he's walking away from the cabin cause he's going to
*  go fight the gunfight and she runs up and she goes, please don't go, don't go stay here with me.
*  And he like kisses her and then he goes, you know, if he goes like, yeah, you're right. I'll just
*  stay here. It's cool. You know, like this is, I didn't want to deal with that anyway. Like he's
*  not the hero anymore. That yeah. Yeah. That's deep truth to that. Uh, and probably like you mentioned
*  sex, sex is probably a big part of it. Friendship. That seems to me like a really important one.
*  Depends on how you define friend. Like I, you know, if, if being a friend means we have some
*  connection to each other and we have each other's cell phone numbers. Okay. Then we're friends.
*  But if it's a bigger definition than that, if it's like you've picked me up at the airport,
*  you know, or like, you know, you're someone I could call that it's like, dude, I gotta hide a body.
*  Like you get shovel in a lime. I like how you escalated from airport pick up to murder.
*  Yeah. I try to go to the street. Well, I have to tell you, I define, you know, the Ben Affleck
*  movie, the town, you know, that scene that's friendship to me. I mean, to me, the ideal male
*  friendship is the scene where he says, I need you to come with me. We're going to hurt some people
*  and you never have to ask me about it again. And he says, whose car are we taking? Yeah. And that's
*  sort of like, to me, that's friendship. So it's, it's a high bar, you know, to be like a friend.
*  So when you say like friendship, I think that's the kind of friendship you should ideally have
*  with your romantic partner. If you're getting married, it should be the like, whose car are
*  we taking? Like it should be that it's you and me. To be fair, that bar's reached with me with,
*  with a lot of people. Like if you call me tomorrow, there's a body, but you're a big open,
*  your big open heart. But it's true. Like, I wonder how many people out there are like that
*  in terms of hiding the body. I mean, my theory on this,
*  because I think I'm like you in that way. I think, I think I, I'm very sensitive.
*  I feel things really deeply, you know, and I think it's, it's, that's a terrif, the world is
*  terrifying when you feel things very deeply because there's so much pain, there's so much
*  betrayal, there's so many opportunities to be hurt, you know? And I think when you are that
*  kind of person, you go through like stages and one of them is that I don't care. I don't feel
*  anything. It doesn't matter. I don't feel anything. I don't feel anything. I won't feel anything.
*  Well, you try to convince yourself, I don't feel anything. It's fine. I don't feel anything.
*  And then at some point, like, you know, you, you do feel all of it. And then it's like, oh my God,
*  the weight of this is, I mean, I think it's the whole arc of Pink Floyd, the wall. It's literally
*  the entire arc of Pink Floyd, the wall, you know, and the song stop, you know, I want to go home,
*  take off this uniform and leave the show. Like you just, when you feel all of it, the army of
*  hammers coming at you, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, you know, a thousand natural
*  shocks, the flesh is there too. When you feel all of that deeply, you know, it's very hard, but,
*  but it can also be a superpower because I think when you can bring that to a relationship, when
*  you can bring that to a profession, like you've done and I've done, then you, there's something
*  very magical about that. The ability to, to, to bring it out in someone, to feel it in yourself,
*  to understand it, you know, is, is a gift. It's a wonderful, wonderful guy. I'm humbled by
*  what it brought me professionally. And I'd like to think that you and I have both found
*  professions that enable us to use that sensitivity, that empathy in a, in a productive and good way,
*  and in a fulfilling, a personally fulfilling way, and ideally in a way that does, does good for other
*  people. You yourself are incredibly successful and high performer. You've dealt with a lot of
*  CEOs and just high performers in all walks of life. What can you say about
*  successful relationships with those kinds of folks?
*  That's a good question. I think, is it all the same stuff or there's something special when they're
*  busier? Well, you know, I think when you represent high net worth individuals,
*  but also high performing, I would make a distinction between high net worth and high
*  performing. So I, I've done high net worth divorces where the person's like a trust fund kid,
*  even though they're an adult, you know, but they're like, they're, what they did to achieve their high
*  net worth status is their great grandfather died. You know, so that is different than someone who is
*  self-made, who through discipline, focus, entrepreneurship, you know, whatever it might be,
*  um, that, that, that they have found success. And there's also a difference between financial success
*  and fame because I've represented famous people that actually did not have that much money in the
*  scheme of things or much liquidity. Um, and I've represented people that, that were not in any way
*  famous and were very high performing in their field. Like in New York, we have a lot of finance
*  people. So, and what I find is, um, their divorces are challenging
*  one on a technical level because figuring out what they have and how to divide it is tricky.
*  Sure. Yeah. Because when something's moving that quickly, like when your,
*  when your portfolio's movement, you know, affects a market, you know, that's, that's challenging,
*  you know, Jeff Bezos divorce for a time when it was in its early stages
*  could affect Amazon stock. It did, you know, so that's a, that's a real thing. You know,
*  there are, there are businesses that are affected by a divorce, but in terms of, of being in a
*  relationship with someone who, um, who is a high performing person, you know, most of the high
*  performing people I know are creatures of discipline and routine, you know, from, from a
*  Joe Rogan, you know, we've talked about, you know, any of these people, like they have a routine,
*  they have a discipline, they have a focus, they have a way they like to do things. They have a
*  type of coffee they like to drink. They have a way that they like to do. And, and divorce is a
*  tremendous disruption. I mean, divorce is fundamental things in your life are shifted out of your
*  control. Like your spouse may be the one who has decided you are no longer going to live in that
*  house. You will no longer see your children on these days. So to take that control away from
*  someone is very, very hard. I mean, when someone is a high performing, high net worth person,
*  they are used to being told, yes, they are used to being able to buy their way out of a problem,
*  but just like illness, you know, I, you can get, you can hire the best doctor,
*  but you can't cure cancer because you have a lot of money. Like you can hire the best lawyer,
*  but you can't cure a custody case, you know, and that's, I mean, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's
*  seemingly endless custody disputes that have been going on for years now with the best lawyers in
*  California working on them is proof of the fact that you can't just buy a resolution to those
*  things, you know, that you have to go through it just like everyone else. So that lets me ask the
*  question of how much does a divorce usually cost? It's a great question. Average divorce. I mean,
*  it's sort of like a, what I always tell clients in the first consultation is I tell them that
*  the most reasonable question a person could ask me sitting in that chair across from me is two,
*  how long is this going to take and how much is it going to cost? And those are the two questions I
*  can't answer. And then the next thing they say is give me a range, which is a bit like calling your
*  doctor and saying, I have a headache. What is it? Well, I can't tell you. I'd have to do tests.
*  Give me a range. Okay. It's a reaction to the barometric pressure and it'll be gone in 15
*  minutes or it's a brain aneurysm and you'll be dead in five minutes. There's your range.
*  And so it didn't really help, right? So I have the least expensive divorce I've ever seen
*  is two people who, who, one of whom comes into my office and says, we've written down on a yellow
*  pad what we figured out at the kitchen table. She's going to keep the house. I'm going to keep the
*  401k. We have a bank account at this bank. We're going to split that 50 50. I'm going to pay her
*  this much in child support each month and we're going to agree from time to time on what we're
*  going to do in terms of the schedule with the kids, but they're primarily going to live with her.
*  Can you write this up and make it legally binding? Yes. 3,500 bucks. Just as a side note, I have a
*  friend who went through a divorce and handled it just masterfully by giving more than he's supposed
*  to and having nothing but love in his heart and happiness with the kids and just like,
*  I don't know that to me is just an inspiration. Like not like his whole view was like, who cares
*  about money? Like, and also like he refused like with every ounce of his being to have anything but
*  complete love for the other person. Yeah. I've had clients who with a straight face will say to me,
*  like, well, I'm not going to quibble over a few million dollars. And they mean it because to them
*  it's numbers on a page. So I'll personalize this a bit. So I have a friendly relationship with my
*  ex-wife who's the mother of my sons who are adults and we have maintained a very good relationship.
*  And so now it's many years divorced later, 17, 18 years later. And we were able to sort of post
*  game that relationship, even our co-parenting relationship, you know, we kind of post game it
*  when we chat with each other. And I remember once saying to her, you know, yeah, you never,
*  you know, you never like screwed around with me when it came to the kids. Like you were always
*  so like cool, you know, like, like if I called you, like if I was having a really bad day at work,
*  and I were like seeing just an ugly custody case and like, it just felt like I would call her and
*  say like, Hey, can I just pick the boys up and like take them out for ice cream or something
*  tonight? I know it's not my night, but would you mind if I just like took them out for a couple
*  hours? She'd be like, yeah, sure. Come on by. You know, she was always flexible like that.
*  And I said to her, like, what was that just goodwill? Like you're just a good person?
*  Or like, what was that about? And she was like, yeah, it was partly that but she was like, it was
*  partly that like you never screwed around with me when it came to money. Like if the kids needed
*  something or if I needed something as the mother of the kids, like you were always like, yeah,
*  sure. Of course. Like her air conditioning kicked out and she needed to replace it. She didn't have
*  like liquidity. I mean, I didn't have a lot of money at the time because it was a long time ago.
*  And I was like, all right, no, no, no, because I don't want you hot and upset and I don't want
*  the boys, you know, to be in like, of course. And so I think, yeah, when you, when you approach
*  a conflict with like, it's very hard to argue with someone who won't argue with you. If the person
*  approaches the argument from the point of view of like, I'm not going to argue with you, like,
*  I'm going to absorb your aggression. I'm going to, I'm going to just not meet it with that. I'm
*  going to meet it with love. I'm going to meet it with positive. It doesn't always work because I'm
*  just, people are so angry that they just are, they're relentless. But I have to tell you like
*  the louder you get, the quieter I get, the more you seem irrational, you know? And that's what I
*  always try to bring that to court proceedings. Like I always try to bring to court. Like if I
*  know my adversary is coming in hard, I'll come in quiet and slow and deliberate because I want the
*  volume to be turned up way too high over there. And then it looks like, what's the, your honor,
*  what's their problem over there? You know? And I think that I say this to clients,
*  they got a four year old, they're getting divorced, let's say. There's going to be a wedding
*  in like 20 something years. There's going to be a wedding. And it's either going to be the wedding
*  where they got to put these people on opposite sides of the room. Cause if they pass each other
*  by the shrimp boat, they're going to kill each other. Or it's the wedding where like you stand
*  there, you take some pictures, you kind of go like, yeah, we fucked up this whole marriage thing,
*  but man, we did a good job with this kid, didn't we? You know? And the decisions you make right now,
*  there's a straight line to that wedding. And so even if you don't like this person, even if you're
*  mad at them, even if you're mad at yourself for the choices you made in choosing them as a co-parent,
*  every single mother's day for 27 years, I have told my now long time ex-wife, happy mother's day.
*  I'm so glad that we had kids together. I'm so glad you're the mother of my kids,
*  because they wouldn't be who they are if it wasn't that they were part me and part you.
*  And I'm so grateful for you. And you know, I'm always cheering for you. Like, how hard is that?
*  How hard is that?
*  Oh, it's really hard for some people.
*  But I don't understand why it's so hard for some people. I'll tell you, I do find that hard.
*  There's not a lot of things that I kind of don't understand, but that's one that I kind of don't
*  understand. Like I put in one of the weird things I did as a divorce lawyer that caused like a little
*  stir among my colleagues for a few years was some years ago. Like we all steal from each other's
*  work, divorce lawyers. We're like the matrimonial mafia. We all know each other. We all deal with
*  each other over and over again. But we all have the same job. And so we're the only people that
*  really know the unique stresses of that job. So even though we try to kill each other all day,
*  it's like boxers, like professional fighters. Yeah, your job is to take each other's head off,
*  but nobody knows what the two of you went through, like the two of you. That's why I always get,
*  I go all kinds of rubbery when I see after the fight, the two people hug each other.
*  Cause I'm always like, yeah, cause you know what? They relate to each other better than anybody.
*  They suffered, they bled, the competitors, they bled. So I really think divorce lawyers,
*  we have that same kind of relationship. Like we went through this stress on opposite sides,
*  trying to take each other apart. And I find that we all steal from each other's material when it
*  comes to separation agreements, provisions that we use for agreements. Like all the agreements are
*  like these Frankenstein monsters of, oh, I like his estate planning provisions. Oh, I like her
*  provisions related to maintaining a life insurance policy to secure the alimony award.
*  And I wrote this paragraph for this selection, this section, because what occurred to me is that
*  when you have a child with someone and let's say they're three or four or five, they're old
*  enough to know what Christmas is, but they're not old enough to go buy a Christmas present.
*  But they're old enough to know that you get presents on Christmas and you give presents
*  on Christmas, but they're not old enough to buy one for the parent. So someone has to do that for
*  them. So I thought, I'm going to put in a provision that says that as long as the children are so young
*  that they can't independently purchase a mother's day or a birthday present for the co-parent,
*  that you'll take the children either to buy a small gift or to make a card, something like that.
*  This struck me as a no-brainer. Who could disagree with this? Like, it's not for the person. It's for
*  the kid. It's so the kid, happy birthday, mom. I don't have a present for you. I don't have a
*  card for you because I'm fucking five. Like I'm five. Like, you can't go do that. So wouldn't you
*  want your child, not your co-parent, who cares? Maybe you want them to have the worst birthday ever.
*  Fine, but you don't want your child to be embarrassed. And I even put in the provision,
*  the parties acknowledge that it is the intention of this provision to ensure that the child is not
*  embarrassed and feels that they were able to say, I cannot tell you how many people refuse
*  to sign that. How many lawyers said to me, we're taking that out. And I went, wait, why?
*  Why does my client have to buy a present for your client? I said, they're not buying a present for
*  my client. They're buying a present for the child to give to my client. It could be one of those
*  little $3 boxes of chocolates they sell at the drug store. Like it's a kid. They don't know. They
*  don't know what anything is. And people, nope. And I have to tell you of the conundrums of the
*  puzzles that I can't figure out in existence. That's one I can't figure out. I do not understand
*  why that's so hard. That's basically just an illustration of their complete inability to do
*  anything nice for the other person. The level of hatred, the level of vitriol that they,
*  maybe this is me. If you apologize, there's not a lot I won't forgive. I'm not saying I'll forget
*  it. I'm not saying, oh, we're totally good like it never happened. I understand that. But if someone
*  says what I call a non-bullshit apology, right? A bullshit apology is, oh, I'm sorry you got so upset
*  when I did that. That's a bullshit apology. I'm sorry that you were offended. That's a bullshit
*  apology. Or I'm sorry for what I did. Because what are we talking about? We might not be talking
*  about the same thing. Or you might be saying, I'm sorry that you found out about that, not that you
*  did it. So a real apology is, I lied to you. And I realized that that hurt you. And I'm really sorry.
*  I shouldn't have done that. I regret that I did that. And I know that it hurt you. And I'm really
*  sorry. That's a real apology. So if someone's willing to give you that, and you still want to
*  walk around with the level of vitriol that you will harm your child rather than do something nice
*  for them, I don't have a solution. And I can tell you, I see that all the time. Parental alienation
*  is a thing. It is a thing. Children can be weaponized. I always tell people, if you want
*  to get married, get married. Get a prenup ideally. But if you don't have a prenup, okay,
*  you're just risking money. Don't worry. You're just risking money. Money and hassle of paperwork
*  and of time and of going through an ugly financial divorce. But you have a kid with somebody,
*  that is a missile. That person has a power over you for a long time, if not forever.
*  The child could be used as part of a manipulation.
*  Routinely. People weaponize children all the time. And they do it with the permission of their own
*  conscience because they genuinely believe, I'm going to protect this child from this person,
*  who by the way, is a bad spouse. But that doesn't mean they were a bad father or bad mother. You can
*  be bad at being a spouse, but the skill set of a spouse and of a parent, it's not necessarily the
*  same. And I've seen people alienate children from a parent in such subtle ways, but they're so
*  powerful. And as a lawyer, it doesn't matter what I know, it matters what I can prove.
*  And it's very hard to prove alienation because it's usually a very subtle process. And the example
*  I always give to people is, it's a rare kind of crazy person that will say to a seven-year-old,
*  your dad is a bad person. But this, hello, here's your dad. You just said your dad's a bad person.
*  You just did it with your eyes. You did it with the expression on your face when you handed the
*  phone to the kid. You told that kid your dad's a bad person. You didn't have to say it out loud.
*  And that is something people are guilty of all the time. When the kid comes home and says,
*  there's a divorced couple, kid comes home and says, oh, I met mom's new boyfriend.
*  And you go, oh yeah, that's nice. Remember, he's not your dad. Whoa. You just told that kid a whole
*  bunch of information about how he's supposed to feel about this person. Whereas if you go,
*  that's nice. Is he a nice guy? Oh, that's great. I heard nice things. Yeah, I heard he's really,
*  he likes bicycles. That's cool. That's really neat. You just told this kid, okay, it's okay.
*  You can like this person. It's okay to like this person. It's okay that your mom is with this
*  person. And again, whatever you feel about your ex, your co-parent, usually you love your kid
*  more than you hate your ex. Ideally. Also, I wish people would even without an apology, forgive
*  each other. Cause I, it goes back to the earlier discussion we had, like I usually forgive people
*  if there's something in them, especially if we shared something, but even just if there's
*  something about them that's beautiful, like it's great that they exist in the world. So I'm just
*  grateful for that. And I use that as the, the fuel of forgiveness. I don't know. To me, like
*  forgiveness is very often it's for me, you know, like when I let go of anger, I feel lighter,
*  you know, I, I, I think my heart enjoys peace. I mean, partly it's cause I fight for a living,
*  you know, I, I work in the world of conflict. Like I, I jokingly used to say to my sons when
*  they were teenagers, you know, like I can only argue if you've paid, like it's not fair to the
*  paying customers. If I argue with you for free, that's not fair. You know,
*  but I think we're talking about the, the incredibly wide range that a divorce can cost.
*  Yeah. So, so the cheap, and you were saying the cheapest one was a yellow.
*  Yeah. Yellow pad, two people came to an agreement, write it up, make it legally binding, five grand,
*  maybe, you know, tops, but usually 3,500, five grand, that kind of vibe, most expensive millions,
*  millions of in council fees. And that's because of the duration and the complexity of the
*  duration, the complexity of issues. Like I have clients who've paid two, three million in council
*  fees to me. So it's like, as a new custody or like what, what's the complex? It can be complex
*  custody that requires a hearing that requires expert testimony, dueling mental health professionals,
*  opining on the parenting. It can be a situation where emergency circumstances occur, like where
*  an individual tries to abscond to another country with the children and you have to bring them back
*  under the Hague convention on international child abduction. Oh, wow. Yeah. We've done some Hague
*  cases. You know, there are cases where people have very different facts. Like before I came here today,
*  a client of mine's soon to be ex-husband who she's in the middle of a door, he tested positive for
*  cocaine on a hair follicle test where it was said he was definitely not going to test positive
*  and he tested positive. So it was like we were scurrying now with, okay, we got to get a motion
*  filed. We got to suspend access. We got to protect the kids. We got to get in front of a judge. We
*  got to think about what are the implications of this because he was about to transition to an
*  unsupervised parenting. Like this is the kind of stuff that can amp up the amount of work the
*  lawyer has to do, which then translates to money. I mean, I get paid for my time, you know, and the
*  time of my team. You know, I have attorneys and paralegals who work for me. So when you have a
*  team of lawyers working on a case, you can burn tens of thousands of dollars a day if it's a big
*  enough case. There are also very complex financial cases. You know, people move and hide money.
*  The high net worth space is a different world. Like if an average person owns a home, they own a home
*  in their name or their name with their spouse. A high net worth person owns an LLC that owns that
*  home. That LLC is owned by a trust. They are a beneficial interested party in that trust. Like
*  this is how some of my clients who make tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars a year,
*  pay less in taxes than a cop or a firefighter because they have structures. And the structures
*  that were designed for tax planning purposes then in a divorce become very tricky to unwind
*  and to figure out, wait, no, what is mine and what is not, you know?
*  Well, then that takes us to the question of prenups. What's your view on prenups?
*  Prenuptial agreements.
*  It's not popular to quote Kanye West, but if you ain't no chump,
*  how low we want prenup. We want prenup. I mean, that's what he had to say.
*  Meaning, so prenup is a good idea.
*  Prenup is an excellent idea. Prenup is a contract between two people that binds their respective
*  rights and obligations in the event of a divorce when it comes to financial issues. That's all it
*  is. And there's a lot of reasons to have them. And there really aren't any reasons not to have
*  them other than the fact that it requires an uncomfortable conversation.
*  So, I mean, there's a few questions here. First, do they work legally in general?
*  Yes. If they are crafted correctly, which is not that hard to do for a lawyer to do. I'm saying for
*  a lawyer to do because with the internet, everybody thinks, why would I spend $1,000? I can just Google
*  prenuptial agreement and I can get one and then it'll be, that is a bad idea. It is like a will.
*  If you're going to have a document that binds your rights at that level, it's worth, the most
*  expensive prenup I've ever done was like three grand. That's ridiculous. That's not a lot of
*  money. So, there's no reason you wouldn't do it, but people will still. I've had clients that have
*  hundreds of thousands of dollars and they did their prenup downloading something from the internet
*  and because of some imperfection, it doesn't have the right, what's called acknowledgement,
*  which is the section where the notary signs and it has to say that it was duly sworn before this
*  person on this date. If it doesn't have that, it's invalid. It's not binding. There are weird
*  technicalities, but prenups are binding. As long as there's been some minimal asset disclosure,
*  which is easily done in a prenup, and as long as there's not a language deficiency, meaning that
*  the person who is reading it understands English to the level that they understand what they're
*  signing. If they don't, that at least they've acknowledged in their native language that there
*  is some opportunity for this to be translated for them. Yeah, they're binding. They're
*  presumptively binding. We live thankfully in a culture where people are allowed to
*  enter into contracts about money. What are some prenups that you've seen that can be
*  effective or that people converge towards in terms of what does that agreement look like?
*  The popular conception is when there's no prenup, both sides get half.
*  And that's generally true, that both sides get half. Equitable distribution, which is what the
*  law is called, it's the law of equitable distribution. It's not called the law of equal distribution
*  for a reason, because it's equitable, not equal. Equitable is presumed to be equal,
*  but there are exceptions to that presumption. And that's where lawyers can get into fun and
*  or trouble, depending on how you view it. It's where we make our money. We make our money arguing
*  that the fair result will not be just a 50-50 split. And so there's the very generic standard
*  prenup, which is easy. And I call that yours, mine, and ours. If it's in your name, it's yours.
*  Whether it's an asset or reliability. My name, it's mine. Joint names, we split it 50-50. Simple,
*  clean. And you go in to the marriage now knowing what the rules are. So if you get a bonus at work
*  and you put it in your sole name, then it's your separate property in the event you divorce.
*  You go out and buy a boat and she doesn't support you buying the boat, but the boat, you got a big
*  loan on this boat. You're responsible for that loan. So I like that because I like people having
*  some control. And I also like people having to have discussions. Well, why are we putting that
*  bonus just in your bank account? Why wouldn't we put it in the joint bank account? We should have
*  that discussion while we're married, not when we're in a divorce lawyer's office 10 years later,
*  because we should be able to talk about those kinds of things. So, you know, what's interesting
*  about prenups is that somehow people think there's something like it takes away from the
*  romance of a marriage. But I've said it before and I'll say it again, all marriages end. They end
*  in death or divorce. So having life insurance or having a will, it doesn't mean you can't wait to
*  die. It doesn't mean you're looking forward to death. It doesn't mean that you're predicting
*  your demise sometime imminently. It just means that you're being realistic and honest. So when
*  you marry, and I don't mean spiritually marrying, having a marriage ceremony, I mean, legally
*  marrying, you're making changes to your rights and obligations under law. That's what you're doing.
*  Like marriage from a legal standpoint, what we mean when we say I got married is a state agency.
*  It's been created by the state. Like this is a legal status that most people who are in it
*  know nothing about. They just did the most legally significant thing they're ever going to do other
*  than dying. And they have no idea what rights and obligations it created in them. And the first time
*  they're going to get an education about it is in my office. That's crazy.
*  When they get divorced.
*  That's crazy.
*  And so prenup is an opportunity to learn something about it at the start.
*  So first of all, whenever someone approaches me about prenups, and that's like four or five
*  times a week probably, depending on the season. Right before wedding season, we get a lot.
*  When's wedding season?
*  Well, it used to just be the summer. They say when you marry and you're a bride all your life,
*  that's from some Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. Now the fall is very big too. People
*  love fall content, fall weddings, pretty pictures and things.
*  Fall content.
*  Yeah, fall content.
*  It's good on the gram.
*  Hashtag fall content.
*  All right.
*  That's a hashtag.
*  Weddings is for the gram. I have to tell you, weddings is performative, man. See,
*  the problem is though, it's curated. So here's us picking the cake. It's not here's us doing
*  the prenup. You know how many people I've done prenups for that I've watched on their social
*  media or them being interviewed by Andy Cohen on Bravo and saying, well, no, we don't have a prenup.
*  Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. You do. It's in my office. It's in a folder.
*  Yeah.
*  They have prenup.
*  No, that's beautiful.
*  But prenups are not published any place. They're not filed with a court. They're
*  maintained by the two people that signed it and their lawyers. That's it. So nobody has to admit
*  that they have a prenup.
*  Beautiful.
*  Yes, but there's a certain problem with that in so far as a lot of people have prenups and we need
*  to normalize prenups. There's no reason not to normalize prenups. There's no reason not for,
*  until some famous people say, yeah, we have a prenup. We're crazy about each other. It's
*  why we're getting married. But yeah, look, we're getting, I don't want to get a car accident,
*  but I got a seatbelt. You have it just in case.
*  And I mean, what do you do if you're running a company? What does that have to do with a prenup?
*  You're running a hundred billion dollar or trillion dollar company, Jeff Bezos.
*  I suppose his marriage was before Amazon.
*  Yeah, his was before it was anything.
*  But how does that work in a prenup?
*  Well, no, actually it's the same. I mean, what you're doing with a prenup is you're identifying
*  how things will be classified in advance. So you're creating a set of rules and then you both can
*  function under those rules during the marriage. So for a brief time, I taught a family law drafting
*  class at a law school. And when we would do separation agreements and we would do pleadings,
*  it was lots of fun. When we would do prenups, I would say to the students, what's the main thing
*  you need when you're doing a prenup? And they would say, well, you need asset disclosure.
*  And I'd say, well, that's not the main thing. And they'd say, well, you need technical language.
*  I said, no, main thing you need is a crystal ball. And the main thing you need is the ability to see
*  what's going to happen in the future. Who's going to have money? Who's not? Who's going to be
*  successful? Who isn't? What people will inherit? Problem is we don't have that. We don't have that.
*  So what can we do? We can create tranches. We can create structures. We can create systems.
*  And then people can live with those in mind. You enter the game knowing the rules, right?
*  So you know if this is going to be a submission only event. You know if this is going to be no
*  time limit. You know if we're after a certain number of minutes, we're going into points now.
*  So I can work with that rule set. And I'm going to amend my game based on that rule set. Same thing.
*  Same thing. You're just going to say, look, what's the rule set? Let's agree on the rule set.
*  And then let's conduct ourselves with the rule set in mind. Let's plan the rule set in mind.
*  And I think that, by the way, and if you're going to cheat, you cheat with the rule set in mind.
*  You know you're cheating. You know you're trying to get around the rule set.
*  So prenups are, when I do a consult for a prenup, the first thing I do is here's what's going to
*  happen legally if you marry without a prenup. Here's what happens to your rights and obligations.
*  Then what we can change with that, there's almost no limit. You can amend anything you want to.
*  The example I always give is there was a case that went up to the appellate court where a high net
*  worth guy married a very beautiful woman. And there was a provision in the prenuptial agreement
*  that said for every 10 pounds she gained during the marriage, she would lose $10,000 a month in
*  alimony if they divorced. And here's her baseline weight as of the time of execution of this
*  agreement. And I wondered if she did what a wrestler does. Did she bulk up right before and
*  then cut when she eventually got divorced? Is she in their sauna with the suit on?
*  But the appellate court essentially said, I don't know why you married this person
*  having had them make you sign this, but it's binding. But it's binding.
*  I wish somebody would do a contract like that. Like the rent for this place would be
*  more expensive if I was fatter and cheaper if I was skinnier. And that way I would have to weigh in.
*  Well, we could put some motivation on you.
*  Yeah, exactly. That kind of prenup is motivating.
*  I think Tim Ferriss says that about how he said you should make bets with people.
*  It's like if you gain this much, I got to give you this amount of money.
*  He says that in one of his early books. And trying to make it binding somehow,
*  which is tough. Yeah. I think when we create
*  incentives of that kind, that's why there was the no nut November, no shave November, sober,
*  it was a competition. When people make a competition of something, they gamify something.
*  It makes it something that people are more likely to stick with. I guess a prenup would be
*  interesting. The problem is there's also people put in prenups what's called fidelity clauses.
*  Fidelity clauses, people still do these. I discourage people from doing them. The two
*  things that people put in prenups that I discourage people from putting in prenups, but very often
*  people still put in prenups, even with my caveat, is fidelity clauses and sunset clauses.
*  Fidelity clauses is I'm waving alimony, I'm waving this and waving that, but if you cheat,
*  I get a million bucks or I get this much alimony or I get this amount.
*  I know the intention is to disincentivize the person from cheating. It's a deterrent
*  to have them cheat, but all it really does is just creates an interesting legal battle for
*  lawyers. How did you prove that they cheated or not? All right, because what constitutes cheating
*  also. Right. Is it an emotional affair an affair? Is oral sex cheating? By the way, how do you prove
*  it? Well, I was in a hotel with her, but how do you prove that I had sex with her? You're opening a
*  can of worms with that kind of a thing, but people sometimes still put them in. Sunset clauses.
*  Sunset clauses is if we're married X period of time, this goes away as if it never existed.
*  Why is that a bad idea? The same reason the community property law in California is a bad
*  idea. The community property law is after a certain number of years, I think it's seven,
*  everything, including your premarital property, all becomes marital property.
*  Mm hmm. And the idea of that was supposed to be that if you've been married that number of years,
*  like you're in enough of a serious relationship now that everything is one unit, you're one person.
*  What it actually does is creates a very uncomfortable thought experiment that people
*  have to have at the six year mark. Because you have to now the honeymoon's kind of over,
*  you might have a kid or two and you go, okay, wait a minute. Am I so happy in this relationship
*  that I'm willing to take all of my premarital assets and throw them in the pot right now?
*  Because if not, I got six months to get divorced. Yeah.
*  So if you say to someone, if you got married tomorrow and then you found a company that's
*  worth a hundred million dollars and under your prenup, that's your separate property.
*  But there's a sunset clause that says that your prenup goes out the window in 15 years. Man,
*  at year 14 and six months, you got to ask yourself some serious questions about where's this
*  relationship going to be in five, 10 years. That's brilliant. And that's why kids,
*  you pay for a lawyer. That's it. We get paid to see around corners, you know, I get paid to be
*  paranoid. I tell people that all the time. Okay. So you mentioned infidelity. You write in the book,
*  which everybody should get. It's a great book. It's a great read. It's a window into your soul.
*  You, in this book, write that there's five kinds of infidelity. Do you remember? Can you explain?
*  Yeah. I mean, what I wanted to say is that all infidelity is not the same,
*  that there's different kinds. And some of them are more obvious than others. Like there's the
*  soulmate, you know, that's the one I think I see most often, which is a person meets another person
*  or rekindles on social media or elsewhere, a reconnection with another person in their life.
*  And they go, oh my God, this is the person I'm supposed to be with. I'm in love. The heart wants
*  what the heart wants. Like I'm leaving you for this person because I have found my true love.
*  That's one type. And it's an incredibly common type. And there are plenty of cautionary tales
*  associated with that where people thought that they found their someone. And then it turns out
*  it was, you know, no, it was just unfair. And a man who leaves his wife for his mistress just
*  leaves a new job opportunity open. And we should also mention that you talk about Facebook and
*  Instagram. Oh yes. If we were going to invent an infidelity generating machine, it would be
*  called Facebook, which by the way is a function of the fact the book was written in 2019. I would
*  now change it to Instagram. Oh, because you said just Facebook. Yes. But now if I had to rewrite
*  it, it would be if we were going to invent an infidelity generating machine, it would be called
*  Metta. That would be what would happen. There you go. Yeah. Very tech forward. It was a function of
*  what Facebook and I think Instagram also are, which is it is a communication tool that has
*  people looking into windows that I think are antagonistic to marriage. You're looking into
*  the lives of other people. You're looking into the social lives of people that you meet casually.
*  So there was a time where you would be at your son's soccer practice and see the attractive mom
*  across the way and you wouldn't really talk to her, interact with her. If you did, it would just
*  be at practice. But now we add on social media those people because for legitimate reasons,
*  we need to maybe communicate about when practice is, or we want to message the person. But now it's
*  sort of an invitation to a connection. And then it's, you know, there's a picture of her on
*  vacation in a bikini. That's very intriguing. And then you have a benign, oh, I saw you guys
*  on a vacation. Where did you stay? You know, oh, was it good? Did you like that? Oh, that's nice.
*  And now we're talking and now we're having an interaction. And now this is how the spark of
*  affairs begins. It's usually people don't usually meet and go, would you like to potentially wreck
*  your marriage? Yes. Would you? Oh my God, let's do this. Like it's much more, you know, it's slowly
*  happened. So when I talk about types of infidelity, the soulmate, the unexpected soulmate, you know,
*  this connection that you didn't expect. I didn't expect to fall in love with this person, but I did
*  and the heart wants what the heart wants and I'm sorry. That one's tough. That one's tough because
*  you know, it's an interesting distinction between men and women to some degree that when a man
*  finds out his wife was cheating, the question is, did you fuck him? And when a woman finds out that
*  a man cheated, the question is, do you love her? You know, and those are different things, you know.
*  I feel like there could be many and have been many books written on that.
*  Yeah, there have been by much smarter people than me. But I think that
*  the soulmate thing is very, very painful for a lot of my female clients. When a man says,
*  listen, I found the one, I found the one and it's not you. That is really, really hard to get past.
*  Even when it turned out to be true. I mean, I've seen some people that, you know,
*  it was an affair that turned into 20 plus year marriages, you know. So an unhappy marriage
*  and then a happy affair that turned into a very happy marriage. Like I've not seen, there's not
*  a formula, you know, like I've been doing it long enough now that I've seen permutations I never would
*  have expected. So that's one type of infidelity. The other is what I call the push out of the closet,
*  which is, and that I think happened more often earlier in my career. There have been tremendous
*  strides, I think, in the lesbian and gay community where, including marriage equality, obviously,
*  where there's a lot of change as to people accepting people as being gay or lesbian.
*  And I think that there was a time where, you know, people were having, being in the closet
*  was much more important. You were subject to professional scorn and, you know, all kinds of
*  things if you were gay or lesbian. So people were sneaking around and having affairs with their same
*  sex partners and then they get caught and then, you know, it really was a function of the fact that
*  they were closeted. And again, that's another kind of complicated dynamic because, you know,
*  I haven't had that happen to me where a woman left me for a woman, but I'd like to think it would be
*  easier for me because if you left me for a man, you're saying I want one like you but better than you.
*  Whereas if you leave me for a woman, well, that's a whole different set of equipment. I don't have
*  that. So like, I can't like, okay, like, it's not me, it's you. It's something you want that I can't
*  offer. It's I don't, we don't serve that at this restaurant. So, you know, it's okay. Like, yeah,
*  I get it. I mean, there's a betrayal, there's a sadness, whatever, but, you know, this is a different
*  thing. The saddest type of infidelity, in my opinion, is the mistake, which is someone just
*  makes a mistake. They just, people do dumb shit when it comes to sex. Like, people just, in a moment,
*  you know, they follow temptation, their impulse control is poor, you know, and they do something
*  that they, that doesn't reflect their morality or doesn't reflect the depth of their feelings.
*  Like, have you spent enough time in a room with people who've cheated
*  in a relationship and are speaking candidly to you about it because you're their lawyer?
*  They'll say to you very openly, like, no, I really love my wife. I really love my wife. Like, I just,
*  I don't know, I was just an idiot. Like, I just, you know, I saw this bright shiny object and I
*  went for it. I really wanted to sleep with that woman. Like, I wanted to fuck her. I love my wife.
*  I make love to my wife. I love my wife, but I just want to sleep with this one, you know? And we
*  created a culture where one of those eradicates the other. I don't, that's a whole nother discussion,
*  is, you know, or is there ethical non-monogamy? Like, should we, is marriage about who I have sex
*  with or is marriage a different kind of a partnership? Is it a pair bond that's about
*  building a life together? You know, and where does monogamy fit into that? And people like
*  Esther Perel and those are people who are making very intelligent discussions about that, you know?
*  Yeah, that's a complicated one. Just to actually just linger on that,
*  a view, how often have people with open marriages have been in your office?
*  Well, let's see, and this is one of those like, from a research perspective, this would be flawed
*  because I see the, they're in my office because their marriage is falling apart.
*  So there may be lots of people having open relationships that don't end up in a divorce
*  lawyer's office, so I'd never meet them. But I meet a lot of people that that was the Hail Mary pass.
*  Sure.
*  Like, I meet a lot of people that they tried that, but it, in retrospect, it was a Hail Mary pass.
*  It was like, look, we've just figured, let's try this. You're like, maybe it's, maybe this will,
*  this will keep the glue together on this thing, you know? And, and, and I've also seen open,
*  open relationships go wrong, you know, where we agree we're just going to have sexual connections
*  with other people, or we're going to bring other people into the bedroom. But together,
*  like we're going to be together with other people or with another person. And then that connection
*  of those two people, like, do you think it's a soulmate all of a sudden now? And it goes in this
*  other, because, and again, is that novelty? Is that like, it's the reason why I don't understand why
*  people have threesomes. It's kind of like, you know, when someone sings to you, I don't know where to
*  look. Like, I don't know where to look. Like if someone's singing to me, I don't know where to
*  look. Like it feels weird, right? Like this is a conundrum I have. No, this, I'll say this to you,
*  this will never, but I, it's the reason I can't go to strip clubs. I don't know where to look.
*  Like if I go to a strip club, you know, like you go to strip club and there's, you know, the part
*  where they, the woman's on the stage and she walks past each person who does a little thing,
*  and the next person, and then there's the little thing. So when she's right in front of you,
*  I like a woman's face and I like a woman's body. I like both of them. So I'm looking at the woman's
*  face and she's very beautiful, but she's naked. And I think, oh, she's naked. I should be looking
*  at her naked body because obviously that's like, it's almost rude not to because she's naked in
*  front of me. Well, of course. So then I'm looking at her naked body, which is lovely to look at.
*  But then I find myself going, oh my God, you're just still, like you should look at her face for
*  God's sake. And then I look at her face and find myself having this whole thing in my head where
*  I'm going like, oh my God, where am I supposed to look? So I think a threesome with two women
*  you don't hardly know or you're not, that's different. But a threesome with a long-term
*  partner who you're in a relationship with and a new person seems to me a very dangerous ground
*  because you're going to want to enjoy the novelty of this new person, but you're going to have to
*  spend time with this person after. So how much attention do you spend to the new novel, exciting
*  thing without creating the impression that you don't, you're not interested in this because you
*  want, you're my favorite person, but this is fun. So I want to just try this for a few. But then also
*  I don't want to forget about that. Like it, it just seems tricky. That analogy, by the way,
*  is brilliant. And also I guess it's tricky because the consequences of mistakes are quite high
*  because you're going to have to talk about it. Right. And there's an easy way to misinterpret
*  the data, right? Like, so if I'm, if I really liked sleeping with my partner, but I get one
*  chance to sleep with this other person, like, well, of course I should indulge in that because I can
*  do this anytime. Like, why didn't you know? But this person, my partner might interpret that as,
*  oh, so you're more interested in her than me because that voice in my partner that would be,
*  you know, insecure might hear that, you know? So I just, why would you even,
*  why would you open yourself up to that level of chaos? You seem to love chess in the courtroom.
*  So it's the kind of intimate human chess of sorts. Yeah, no, that's, that's too high risk.
*  How do we get on threesomes? Oh, open, open marriages. Well, we got, we get on threesomes.
*  I don't know. I was wondering how people get on threesomes. I figure they like, if one is fun,
*  two must be better. If two is better, three must be better. Yeah, I think we, the way that, that
*  this becomes an issue is why would you have a non-monogamous relationship? What is it about
*  your sex life with this person that's not satisfying? And I think that that is the question
*  that's harder to ask yourself and to try to answer with your partner. I mean, you've said that this
*  idea of soulmates is great for your business, but so like a human being
*  in a partnership can't be everything. Is that true? I think it's unrealistic. It's a true romance,
*  right? The, the document of, that we keep referencing here. I think it's wonderful that
*  we do because sometimes now people don't get that reference anymore. Like I, I talk to people in,
*  when I try to teach negotiation to young lawyers who come work for me, I tell them to watch the
*  Gary Oldman scene where he offers them the Chinese food. Yeah. Why is that scene the one that really?
*  Because it's the best negotiating lesson I've ever heard in my life. Where, where, where he comes in,
*  he, you'll recall- Just for the record.
*  Yeah. Gary Oldman plays a pimp. Yes.
*  And he owns his girl is Patricia Arquette, right? And Christian Slater's character,
*  the protagonist is coming in to tell Gary Oldman that he no longer owns this girl, Alabama.
*  Alabama.
*  Alabama is going to be with him now. And Gary Oldman is a, a amazing performance. And he's
*  sitting in a living room with a shotgun next to him with armed guys around him,
*  watching television and eating Chinese food. And he's got Chinese food laid out in front of him.
*  And Christian Slater comes in and he says, I need to talk to you about Alabama. And Chris,
*  and Gary Oldman says, do you want some Chinese food? And Christian Slater sort of taken aback
*  by the question. He says, no, I came to talk about Alabama. She's with me now. She's there.
*  And he proceeds to tell him what his offer essentially is. And Gary Oldman says, you know,
*  you fucked up, right? In some, in substance, he says, you know, if you'd sat down and started
*  eating my Chinese food, I would have thought, who's this guy? He didn't have a care in the world.
*  Just sitting down, eating my egg foo young. But instead you tried to be hard. And now I know you're
*  full of shit. And so I think that scene summarizes how in negotiation, the more you enter into it
*  with that, like anytime I deal with another lawyer and they're like, well, we'll see you in court.
*  Okay. See in court, like empty barrels make the most noise. Like you and I, as people who've been
*  in the jujitsu community have been, I know some dangerous people. I know FBI SWAT people. I know,
*  I know people that are, they know how to do things to people. And they're the calmest guys you ever
*  meet in your life. You scuff their sneaker. They're like, oh, yeah, don't worry about it. It's okay.
*  Like they're quick to apology. Like they're just chill. What were we talking about? We were talking
*  about, oh, wait, true romance. Oh, the soulmate. Yeah. Yeah. What you're saying that this idea,
*  like that film underlying, there's this current of like they were made for each other. Yeah.
*  I think there's a distinction between the feeling that someone is your missing puzzle piece that
*  you're made for this person. I think what that just means is there's a lot of overlapping,
*  beautiful connections. I love them intellectually. I love them sexually. I love them. Interpersonally,
*  we have some shared history. We have some shared commonalities. We were raised in the same culture,
*  raised in the same religion. Like we view, we have politically similar ideas. Like these are all,
*  or we have totally opposite ones, but they're complimentary. Like I've always joked that like
*  finding someone with complimentary pathologies, you know, like I'm obsessively disciplined.
*  So having a partner who's like flexible and like spontaneous is really good for me. And also me
*  being like, no, no, no, come on, come back. We're going to do this now. No, no, it's time to actually
*  do this now. Like we're good for each other. It's barefoot in the park. You know, it's this idea of
*  like, you know, the yin and the yang. So what I have an issue with is that the definition of soulmate
*  that I think is sold to so many people now is this idea that if your partner is disappointing to you
*  in any way, meaning they're not the perfect travel companion, they're not the perfect vocabulary
*  companion, they're not the perfect roommate, they're not the perfect lover, they're not the,
*  like the odds of someone being all of those seems crazy to me. Like it's infinitesimally small
*  and they don't have to be everything. Like if I go to a restaurant and eat 10 courses
*  and one of them is kind of subpar and the other nine are the most amazing culinary experience
*  I've ever had, how dare I say, well, that wasn't, that wasn't the right restaurant.
*  What do you mean? Like that's a great restaurant. What are you talking about? Like of course there's
*  one little thing. So I think it's impossible to have someone never disappoint you. It's impossible
*  to have someone who never lets you down or doesn't say and do the exact right thing at the exact
*  right time. And to create the idea or expectation in anyone that your partner should never let you
*  down, never disappoint you, never not know what to say is I think crazy. I mean, I find for myself
*  when someone, for example, loses someone, when someone loses a family member or a pet,
*  I often say the same thing to the person. I'll either talk to them or send them a text or call
*  them and I'll say, I wish I knew the perfect thing to say because I would say it right now.
*  Like, but, but I know there isn't like, I know that, you know, I don't say that part, but like,
*  I know there isn't like, I, there isn't a perfect thing to say. Like, but if there was a perfect
*  thing to say, I would say it right now. Like love to me is not that you never let this person down.
*  It's that you never want to let this person down. You know, it's love is a verb, you know, like it's
*  this feeling of, I never want to disappoint you. I will disappoint you, but I never want to disappoint
*  you. I, I will hurt you, but I never want to hurt you. When I hurt you, it will be my insecurity,
*  my stupidity, my humanity that causes me to hurt you, but I will never intentionally hurt you.
*  You know, I will betray your trust. I'll never intentionally betray your trust. Like I will,
*  by my stupidity, say the wrong thing or, or, or loose-lipped say something to someone that
*  you didn't want me to, but it won't be intentional. I will always try to be on your team.
*  That feels to me like a realistic thing.
*  Yeah. The intention leads the way, but there's some aspect of,
*  like, you know, just like the 10 course meal that over time, there's a kind of convergence
*  towards perfection. And along the way, there's the rose-colored glasses where you see the beauty
*  and everything. So it just, it feels, it's probably destructive just to really internalize the idea of
*  soulmate because then any imperfections can, can make you doubt, can make you step away,
*  can make you lose the connection, but it just feels like, I don't know.
*  It's too heavy. It just feels, I, I feel like when you see a couple that's 90 years old,
*  and they've been together for 60 years, 70 years, there is of course, a temptation to think about
*  all the beauty that they've seen on that journey together, the children, the grandchildren, maybe
*  the great grandchildren, all the joy that they've seen, all the pain they've endured and struggled
*  together, you know? But they've also disappointed each other a whole bunch of times, probably let
*  each other down. They probably lie to each other a bunch. And yet, and to me, that is a beautiful
*  thing. Like that's what, that is not, it's great in spite of that. It's great because of that.
*  They still love each other, even though they've been so flawed and imperfect and, and they're
*  human and they still love each other. They still rode that thing together because the reasons
*  to do so were greater than the reasons to not. We've mentioned some of this, but I'd love to get
*  your opinion on having seen things gone wrong. How much, and having mentioned Emma Heard and
*  Johnny Depp, how much fighting do you think is okay in a relationship and how to resolve the fights
*  such that they don't escalate to that disconnection? Is there some wisdom you have for that? I imagine
*  you've seen some epic fights. Yeah, I, you know, it's very, I've seen some crazy fights. I have,
*  even on my phone, I have some recordings because now there's, you know, cameras everywhere. It's
*  like Nest cams and, you know, ring cams. And so a lot of this gets recorded and, and people,
*  you know, have phones so readily available that they can record the other person and know it.
*  And I listened to the way people speak to their, first of all, I listen to the way people speak
*  to each other and I'm shocked. I listen to the way people speak to their romantic partner,
*  to their spouse, and I'm, I'm blown away. I'm blown away. Disrespect or what? Just
*  disrespect, insults, profanity, just degradation, just brutality, just, just, and then like to then
*  kind of go on like the next day you kind of go on like nothing happened. I don't, I, I'm shocked by
*  it. I mean, I, I listened to it and I think like, I, if someone ever spoke to me that way, I don't
*  know that I could ever really feel deep connection to them. Like freely, I would feel so betrayed,
*  like that they just so brutal. Like I can't imagine speaking to someone that way. Like it's
*  saying you, you just, such vicious insults to someone, you know, like I, but I, I understand
*  that's how some people communicate perhaps. I guess the question of how much fighting
*  is too much fighting in the relationship is for me a bit like the question, how much sex is enough
*  sex in the relationship? It depends on the two people and their individual tastes. But what's
*  problematic is when there is a disconnect between the two people. Like, so if, you know, there's a,
*  I think it's Annie Hall, it's one of the Woody Allen films where Diane Keaton and Woody Allen
*  are both talking to their respective therapists about the relationship,
*  you know, but it's like a split screen. And she says, I mean, we have sex all the time. We have
*  sex like once a week. And he goes, we never have sex. We have sex like once a week. And, you know,
*  it's funny because it's true. It really is this, you know, they both know the same data, but they're
*  interpreting that data set completely differently. And I think, you know, the question you have to
*  start asking is like, what is, you know, Steve Harvey actually once said something funny to me,
*  he said that success is not where you are. Success is where you are in relation to where you started.
*  Yeah. He says, cause if success is where you are, Oprah's got us all beat. Yeah. Or maybe
*  Yalan's got us all beat. I don't know. But if it's where you are versus where you started,
*  cause there's a lot of people that started on second and, you know, start on third act,
*  like they hit a double, you know, like, well, I was given 10 million, but then I turned it into
*  a hundred million. Well, the first million is the hardest. So, you know, come on. But I think the
*  question of like, how much sex were we having at the beginning of the relationship, that might be
*  the wrong gauge. Cause that's like, we couldn't keep our hands off each other and we just, it's
*  novelty. But you know, like how far, how much sex we're having post-children versus before the
*  children that might be worth looking at, you know, like how do we compare it? You know, like,
*  am I overweight compared to what? When I was 20 and running marathons or most 50 year old men?
*  I don't know. I got to, I got to like, what do you compare it to? So I think fighting,
*  there are some people that I think they enjoy fighting. Like they enjoy argument. You know,
*  I know people that enjoy political debate. I don't particularly enjoy political debate. Not that I'm
*  not very interested in political concepts, economic concepts. I just, I argue for a living.
*  So in my free time, I don't find argument that enjoyable when it's intense. I find discussion
*  more interesting. That's so interesting that you, you just keep the battle to that particular,
*  to your main profession and everywhere else you want peace. Well, did you ever, you know, Bob,
*  Bob Goldthwait, Bobcat Goldthwait, the comedian, very, very funny. And he had all second chapters,
*  like a director and a writer, but he has this, you know, I saw an interview with him once where
*  he said, you know, yeah, he says like, I'm a comedian. I've been a comedian a long time.
*  People always come up to me and they're like, oh, you're a comedian. Do you want to hear a joke?
*  He's like, and all I can think is, oh yeah, that'd be a real fucking treat. Like I haven't
*  heard jokes all day, all night for years. That would be a real special occasion. Yes. Like I,
*  I get it. You know? Yeah. And I mean, a sadder story. I've been reading quite a bit about Robin
*  Williams and his wife would talk about how quiet and introspective and thoughtful and
*  intellectual he was and not really that humorous in his private life. But that may be a function of,
*  you know, that it is enjoyable to be the other thing. Yeah. You know, one of the things I've
*  always thought was very funny in relationships, my own relationships, is most women I know
*  who have a husband who doesn't wear a suit every day for a living.
*  When their husband gets dressed up, like they're going to a wedding or something,
*  they get like, oh my God, look at like, look at him, you know? And I wear a suit every day,
*  you know, on the weekends I know when I wear like jeans and a black t-shirt, but the rest of the
*  time I wear a suit. And I remember, I think this has been true in every relationship I've been in
*  since I was a lawyer, including Mike's wife. It was always like, if I had on jeans and I wasn't
*  shaven, it was like, look at you. Are you kidding me? Like, really? Like, whereas the suit,
*  they wouldn't even notice. Yeah. Sometimes the other thing.
*  Well, that's what it is. It's the novelty of the other thing. So I think that if you're Robin
*  Williams and you're like being shot out of a cannon in terms of your performative style and
*  your energy and explosive. Yeah. Being quiet must be very refreshing. Like I imagine, you know,
*  incredibly intelligent people must love just watching stupid humor or having a dumb,
*  it's why some of the smartest people I know like really dumb shit, you know? It's why like Rick and
*  Morty, I think is brilliant because it's both smart and dumb. Yeah. It's a perfect combination.
*  Really is. Yeah. I think it's possibly the perfect show.
*  Is there advice you can give to somebody like me on how to interview? Well, how to do conversations?
*  Well, is there, do you think there's something transferable from the courtroom
*  to this setting with complicated people? Yeah, I think so. I think what can be learned
*  about interviewing is the distillation, like what is most important? When I hear a story that I have
*  to present to a judge, the totality of someone's parenting, the good of their parenting, the bad
*  of their parenting, the good of the other parent, the bad of the other parent, I have to sort of
*  boil down what are the best examples because I can't lay it all out. And then what greater
*  principle do they speak to? You know, the best jiu-jitsu teacher that I think I've had is Paul
*  Schreiner. And Paul doesn't teach, just teach you techniques. He's teaching you ways of thinking
*  about concepts in jiu-jitsu. And then here are some techniques that illustrate that. John Donoher,
*  from what I can see, does a lot of that as well. I think they're like soulmates in the jiu-jitsu world.
*  Yeah. And then there's that element that you spoke to, which is maybe considering the other side.
*  Always.
*  Devil's advocate kind of thing.
*  Yeah, I mean, straw man, steel man stuff, you do a lot of that and I think all the best interviewers
*  do. But yeah, I think it's really, really important to think about, I have to know the other side's
*  case much better than my own. You know, I have to know what are their defenses, what are their
*  strengths. I have to map out a strategy that keeps those in mind. And that's hard because
*  early in my career, I would attribute to the other side an intelligence and strategy that
*  sometimes wasn't applicable. Like I've learned like, you know, there's like the simplest
*  explanation is the accurate one, you know, the Occam's razor. I think like sextons, you know,
*  would be never attribute to strategy that which could be attributed to stupidity or laziness.
*  Because I have lots of adversaries that like they'll not file a motion I thought they were
*  going to file and I'll go, wait, why didn't they file that? Like tactically, what are they thinking
*  I'm going to do? And what is that about? You know, and I would go, well, if I didn't file it,
*  why wouldn't I file it? And the answer is like, they just didn't think to file it or like they
*  were too lazy to draft it or they went on vacation last week. So that's why they didn't.
*  And I'm, you know, driving myself crazy going there's some tactical reason must be. So I think
*  you have to look honestly and don't attribute to the other side your constitution. You know,
*  if I said that, I'd be saying it sarcastically. If you said it, maybe you weren't saying it
*  sarcastically. Like you have to think about the fact that we're unique human beings who express
*  themselves differently. And for you, the audience is usually the judge.
*  Yeah, it's the jury. No, we don't do jury trials. That's the interesting thing about family law
*  attorneys. Family law attorneys don't do jury trials. We do bench trials. We just persuade
*  there's a person in a black robe. That's the only person I have to convince. Does the person in the
*  black robe, do they have emotions? Are they human or are they very- They are human. They are all too
*  human. Do they impose that humanity on you? Like, do you feel it? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh no, they,
*  do you feel it? Like they're human. They're working their shit out. Okay. They're parents.
*  Yeah. They're husbands and wives. Yeah. And you're talking about stuff they deal with.
*  Yeah. I had a woman on the stand, an expert witness on the stand, who was talking about
*  the emotional and physical abuse that was perpetrated on a seven-year-old.
*  And I, this person had written a bunch of reports that were in evidence in this trial. We're on like
*  day six or seven in the trial. And there's all of this information in the record about this
*  verbal abuse and mental abuse and like gas lighting and like really intense stuff that this woman was
*  doing to this seven-year-old. And the judge is like vaguely paying attention for most of the time.
*  And at some point the person says, well, when a parent is abusing a child and the judge just
*  interrupts, she goes, well, look, you know, do you think like if a person spanks a child, that's
*  abuse? She's like, well, like a person in general, like, and by the way, if my adversary asks that
*  question, I can object, but I can't object when the judge asks the question. They get to rule on
*  that objection. So I'm like, where's this going? She's like, well, no, I mean, I mean, spanking can
*  be a form of abuse. She's like, right. But like, you know, are you saying like everybody who spanks
*  children, I'm sitting here going, what is going on in your house? What went on with your parents?
*  Like, cause you're bringing some stuff here. That's not, this is not what you're supposed to be.
*  This is not your role, you know, but there are good judges and bad judges. And that's a big,
*  big deal. Well, I've noticed that I don't have kids. So I have a certain perspective on the world.
*  I really want to have a family and have kids, but I've noticed when I talk to people that have kids
*  and gender matters also, like fathers are like with, uh, with daughters and so on,
*  like it changes the landscape of the conversation. Sure does. It's like, you're no longer this
*  intellectual that's like, wow, there's this and there's this. It's, it's more like, like go
*  fuck yourself. Anything that fucks with, uh, kids can, can like burn it to the ground. I don't care.
*  I don't care what the nuance is of the little intellectual thing. Oh, you want to learn about
*  this represent someone is accused of child sexual abuse. I've had about a dozen of those cases where
*  I've represented someone who's alleged to have perpetrated sexual abuse of a child. You are guilty
*  until proven innocent. And let me tell you, as a lawyer, that is the toughest cases because you put
*  sex and kids together and everyone loses their goddamn mind immediately. There's a rush to
*  judgment. There is a disregard for procedure. There is a confirmation bias. There's a desire
*  to be a protector. And again, all motivated and informed by really good things. The desire to
*  protect the innocent, the desire to protect the vulnerable, but, but gang, no, like we have these,
*  I like living in a world that has due process. I like these rules. I like the rules of evidence.
*  I like innocent until proven guilty. I like that. I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's such a,
*  I'm so torn on it because I also like living in a world where people are so emotionally invested
*  in, um, in connection to other like, that's those two things aren't mutually exclusive.
*  I shouldn't be. I know, but if you dedicate yourself fully to the law, you might lose some
*  of the humanity. I don't think you have to. I have to tell you, I once actually went off on a,
*  on a DA, on a district attorney who was very vehemently prosecuting a child sex abuse case
*  that I was involved in. And I remember I, I, it was, I came in, thankfully I came in very early
*  in the case. So the accusation was made and I came in right away because very often you get this case.
*  There've been 15 interviews. This person's been interviewed by police, by child protective services,
*  and it's like they've already, they're already so far down a hole. They didn't even know they'd
*  dug themselves into it, you know? So I got in very early on and I just kept saying, she's like,
*  well, we're going to do this. We're going to do this. I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
*  don't, we should both want this to be fair, done properly. Like there's an expert, a well-respected
*  expert who's a clinical psychologist who their job is, they're a validation expert. So their job is
*  to interview a child. They record the interviews with a hidden camera so that everyone can see
*  they didn't have suggestive questioning. There are very stringent standards that they follow
*  to prevent like suggestive questioning or any of those kinds of things. And I was saying, listen,
*  no, no one should be interviewing this child other than this person who's a neutral, qualified person.
*  And I kept saying to the other side, like, wait, you know, you're, see, this is the problem. Like
*  you want to win. You're a lawyer. You want to win. I want to win too. Right. But we want to win
*  fair. Like that's like saying, you know, I'm going into a boxing match. I want to win. So if the
*  referee is looking to the side, I'm going to kick the guy in the nuts. Like, okay, then you might have
*  won, but you didn't win boxing. You won some other thing. You know, like I want to win a fair fight.
*  Like I want to go in with the rules set, the law, the rules of evidence. I don't want a judge who
*  doesn't understand evidence. I don't want an adversary who plays it fast and loose with the
*  rules. I want to go in and win a fair fight. And that's where when it comes, our passion to protect
*  the innocent, to emotionally connect, to feel deeply about children and protecting them.
*  I don't think that that's antagonistic to, like we always treat dandruff with decapitation in
*  this culture and I don't understand it. And that's what I like about the law. The law,
*  there's rules and there's rules about procedure. And so that's our job is to bring out the truth
*  using the rules and the procedure. And I love that job. But still there's a human being and the judge,
*  right? That's the problem. It seems like a really hard job. Because you have to be paying attention
*  to the whole thing. You have to pay attention to the whole thing. And everyone is trying to persuade
*  you and lie to you. And everyone can keep their shit together in a court appearance most of the
*  time. It takes a rare kind of crazy to blow up in a courtroom. So most of the time everybody looks
*  really put together and like, yeah, you got to have an amazing bullshit detector. I'm not saying
*  they don't have a really hard job. They have a really hard job. They have way harder job than I
*  have. What's their source of ground truth? How do they sharpen the radar for bullshit?
*  I think that they're assessing credibility, which is what you call it in the law,
*  is something that I think you're supposed to develop it on the job.
*  Do you have the data of who was lying in the end or not?
*  No, not really. Not really. I mean, you can try to demonstrate a lot. What I always tell clients,
*  and this is the art of advocacy, right? Is I want to use examples of misrepresentations to show that
*  this person's a liar. I'm trying to extrapolate from the small, the large. I'm trying to say,
*  here's three times he lied, therefore he's a liar. When in fact, we know human beings don't really
*  work that way. But I've seen people submarine their kid, just torpedo their entire case because they
*  lied about some dumb shit, some dumb little thing. And I said, and why would you lie? Why did you lie
*  about that? Like I had a case where a person was accused of child sexual abuse. And on cross
*  examination, they were asked, did you have an affair with this babysitter? And they're like,
*  no, no, no, no, no. And then it was shown through text messages and things. They clearly had an
*  affair with the babysitter. And I said, why did you lie? And they said, well, I didn't want that
*  to come out. And I said, right, but now you're a liar. Like, did you molest your child? Because
*  if the answer to that is no, and now you destroyed your credibility because you didn't want to admit
*  that you slept with an adult woman. By the way, it would have been good for your case.
*  Would have been good for your case for you to say, yeah, I slept with her because I like sleeping
*  with adult women. That's how I am. I don't sleep with children, much less my own, you know? So why
*  would you lie? And so that concept is incredibly important. And judges, theoretically, they have to
*  make very tough calls. I feel like it's the most impotent place to just sit there and dispassionately
*  sort of listen and rule on objections. Like I just would be so frustrated because I'd want to get up.
*  You know, I had to do jury duty once. And it was like a horrific experience for me because I'm
*  sitting there and I'm- You have no power. Yeah, I'm just watching these two lives. I'm like,
*  why did you ask that question that way? I would never have asked it that way. Why would you object
*  like that? When you object, you bring more attention to what are you doing? Like I'm watching both of
*  them. It's like watching like a jujitsu. But probably what it'd feel like for like John Donahue
*  to watch two white belts spar. Like, why are you doing- Wow, my God, what are you doing? Why would
*  you grab that? What are you thinking? Like, and you know, it's frustrating. It's frustrating to
*  watch. And as a judge, it must just be unbelievable. So divorce lawyers sometimes get a bad rap. Is there
*  a reason for this? I mean, no one's ever happy to be spending time with a divorce lawyer.
*  Like if you have a criminal lawyer, they're defending you against the maelstrom of injustice
*  and false allegations. They're protecting your freedom. And maybe you're acquitted and then
*  you're like, oh, that person saved me. You know, you buy a house, you know, that lawyer helps you
*  get the house. You know, you're happy about that. Sign the paperwork. You do a will. Like you help
*  them make you feel secure. Like at best, I'm a representative of a chapter in someone's life
*  that was very unpleasant. I have a friend who's a Juilliard trained classical pianist. And he was
*  having a humidification system installed in his home because his piano required a certain level
*  of humidity. And it was very expensive to install this humidification system. And we went out to
*  dinner and then we came back to his place and he said, man, this is the most depressing
*  $15,000 I've ever spent. And I said, why? And he said, cause there's nothing different.
*  Like I spent $15,000 and I feel absolutely nothing different. My piano does, but I don't. Like I
*  don't have anything to show for it. Like you finished getting divorced, you don't really have
*  anything to show for it. Yeah. You know, like best. Yeah. Best it's the same. It's one of the things
*  I think that's interesting about divorce is in our increasingly performative society,
*  you can't pretend you meant to get divorced. You can't like everything everybody does. Like,
*  well, I wrote that album for me. I didn't, it didn't matter that it was not going to be popular. No,
*  you wanted that album to be popular. Like, come on, like you're lying and that's fine, but you're
*  lying. Oh, I think my haircut came out great. I wanted it to look this fucked up. No, you didn't.
*  You didn't. You're lying. And that's fine because we live in a society now where everybody's just,
*  oh yes, I meant to do that. Okay. Divorce? Nope. You got married. You wouldn't, you wouldn't,
*  you break up in a relationship, not a marriage. Okay. Well, we were only going to be together for
*  a little while. It was never serious. We were just like, you know, we're having fun. That's all it
*  was. It wasn't, we were, we were never going to be happily ever after. No, you got married,
*  you got married guys. You got up there and you said forever. And it didn't go forever. So you can't
*  bullshit anybody anymore. Like you know, it didn't go the way you thought it was going to go. It
*  didn't go the way you signed on for. So now that that's undeniable, like what can we make it? What
*  can we make it into? Like it can be beautiful. You know, the barn's burned down. Now I can see the
*  moon, you know, like let's make it something. And so for me, I think people look at a divorce lawyer
*  and they just go, yeah, like this is this horrible chapter and I associate you with it. Also too,
*  listen, some of the things we do, it's difficult to simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.
*  The things you do to protect your clients sometimes look like acts of aggression,
*  but really they're just trying to shore up a defense. And so I get paid to be paranoid and
*  I have to say to clients sometimes like, well, are you sure that they're not doing this? And then
*  they go, well, I don't know. And I go, well, let me inquire. Did she accuse me of that? No, no,
*  I'm not accusing you. I'm just trying, like we get a reputation divorce lawyers as amping up
*  conflict because we get paid for the conflict, right? It's like, if you get paid by the bullet,
*  you're going to start a lot of gunfights, right? It doesn't really work that way with most good
*  divorce lawyers. Like there are plenty of people that are bad lawyers and they stoke up conflict
*  because it jacks up fees. They usually don't do well. They don't build a successful career
*  because you live and die by your reputation. Yes, reputation is everything. But good lawyers,
*  good experienced divorce lawyers, we do the whole, hey, listen, you're going to say this,
*  I'm going to say this, you're going to do this, I'm going to do this. Let's skip it. We're going
*  to end up here. We got Judge Bluff of law and you know what he's going to do. He's going to go right
*  here. So why don't we just agree right now to X, Y, Z? Sounds good. We're done. We're good.
*  So you want to minimize the number of bullets. It's like the two, it's like a more or less
*  mashashi. It's like the two swordsmen who see each other and they just stand there at the edge
*  and they see the whole fight in their minds and they know who won and who lost and they walk away.
*  We do a lot of that. We do a lot of, okay. It's like when you watch high level chess
*  and someone resigns and you go, wait, what happened? He didn't win. And you go, no, no,
*  the other guy won. It's 15 moves from now, but he won and the other guy sees it. So now we're done.
*  Can you speak to some recent high profile divorces? Like the most recent I saw is Kevin
*  Kosner. Yeah. Kevin Kosner is a great, I mean, I don't know him. I'm not involved in the case.
*  By the way, Yellowstone is just so great. Oh, it's so good. And I hope Matthew McConnor,
*  who I've gotten to know, I hope he does one of these shows. Is Yellowstone or anything else? He's
*  just born for the role, frankly. But anyway. He'd be amazing in that. Your conversation with him
*  was great. The Kevin Kosner divorce is interesting because Kevin Kosner had one of the most expensive
*  from a distributive award perspective. He gave a huge payout to his first wife.
*  And then this time he had a prenup. So it's actually, it's a very public showing of the
*  fact that once bitten, twice shy. He had a very public divorce that cost him a lot of assets in
*  terms of the division of assets. And now it appears by all acknowledged reports that he had
*  a prenuptial agreement that was well-crafted and enforceable. And the argument now is over
*  what is child support, what is spousal support, what's covered in the prenup and what isn't.
*  So it seems like the prenup worked actually. The prenup worked. And Kevin Kosner's career,
*  which has always been a steady career. I don't know that in the Hollywood stock market,
*  that people would have bet on Yellowstone. I think you would have said, hey, the best years of that
*  guy's career are behind him. How do you get better than dances with wolves and Robin Hood and all
*  these big, big, the bodyguard and then Yellowstone. And it's like, holy cow, did he knock that out of
*  the park? And he's central to it. I mean, he knocked the skin off the ball. So I think that's
*  why prenups are important. You don't know what your career is going to do. You don't know where
*  it's going to go. And so he saved himself a lot of money. He also has a great lawyer. He has Laura
*  Wasser. Laura Wasser is LA, just a top professional, brilliant lawyer, even tempered, but intense in
*  the courtroom and just a smart, smart human being. The thing I liked just, you know, I haven't been
*  following it, but I saw a few comments he's made and he refused to comment negatively about his
*  spouse. But the way he said it, it wasn't lawyer advice. It's good lawyer advice probably. But he
*  said it from the heart, which I always like seeing that. Where he refuses even the drama
*  even the public nature of it to throwing jazz. Well, Laura, his lawyer is actually notorious for
*  not speaking to the press about cases in an extended way. And that's smart move. I don't
*  speak about pending cases I'm involved in publicly and I discourage my clients from doing so. I can't
*  always stop them, but I discourage them from doing so. I don't think there's any good to come of it.
*  There are lawyers who try to try things in the court of public opinion.
*  I think there is a, to take it to the broader principle you just brought up, I think there is
*  a lot of value in talking about your ex in a favorable way. I have to say, when I first got
*  divorced many years ago, I went on a date with a young woman. It's one of my first dates as a
*  divorced man. And she was a divorced woman. She's a beautiful woman. And we were having dinner and
*  it was going quite well. And it was one of those things where I was like, Oh, I definitely want to
*  see this girl again. And I said something about, Oh, you know, there's going to be this thing at
*  this museum. We should go. And she's like, Oh yeah, that'd be a lot of fun. And I'm like, yeah,
*  we should definitely, you know, maybe that will be the next thing we do together. And she was like,
*  yeah, we should go next weekend. Like the kids are with the asshole so we can go. And I just,
*  it was like, you could hear that record scratch. You know, I just went, Oh yeah, no, this isn't
*  good. Like I'm not, you're referring to the father of your kids as the asshole. Like we're already,
*  I'm walking into something here that I don't know that I want to be involved in. Matthew McConaughey,
*  before he was married, you know, if you look at his history, he dated some of the most beautiful
*  women in Hollywood in their prime. And none of them ever talked bad about him in the press.
*  They all were like, Oh my God, he's such a great guy. He's such a great guy. And I always wondered
*  like, how do you, he got out of all of those relationships without a scratch on him. And
*  when you'd watch an interview with him, they would say like, so you, you know, you dated Penelope
*  Cruz and he go Penelope, that's just, that's just a special lady. That's just a, what a,
*  what a special lady. She just a wonderful, what a wonderful woman. I was just so blessed to have
*  the time with her. What a beautiful, wonderful woman. And I would think to myself, I'm like,
*  you're a genius. Like he's a genius because like it, he never came off as petty, spiteful, bitter,
*  any of that. He just came off as like, just dignified, strong, smart, self-assured.
*  And like it left, you know, it left like, it left the viewer with the impression that like,
*  when he was looking off and specifically, he's probably like just thinking about some wonderful
*  time he had with her. And you think to yourself like, God, that guy, like he just became cooler
*  and cooler. Whereas if he got into like the whole, you know, oh yeah, that was ugly. And then,
*  you know, this happened and that like, nobody wants to hear it. It's awful.
*  The funny thing about him just having interacted with him a bunch. I don't think he's in the,
*  he's in the Rogan school of thought. I think that I don't see him ever having a fight.
*  Now his parents were, as he, as he's spoken about a bunch, nonstop fighting. They got divorced and
*  remarried and just insane. And they were volatile. Yeah, very. He seems maybe you kind of, it's a
*  pendulum swinging the other way. He just seems cool as a cucumber, like always just lets it
*  roll off. But you know, even if it's internally, not rolling off, there is value in just rising
*  above it in your discourse. That's true. Yes. Like, like you lie to your children.
*  Like people say this to me all the time, clients, they're like, you know, why did you tell your
*  child that dad had an affair? Well, I'm not going to lie to my kids.
*  Fuck you. Yes, you are. You lie to your kids all the time. Yeah. Mommy, are you going to die
*  someday? Yes, babe. I'm going to die and daddy's going to die. And then someday the earth's going
*  to hurl into the sun and we're all going to die. Sweet dreams. Like that's not, you lie to your
*  kids all the time. You know, what's wrong with me? We don't know what's wrong with you. We're
*  going to take you to the doctor and hopefully it's nothing serious. You won't die. Like you lie to
*  your kids all the time. You tell them that Santa Claus exists when he does whatever. So, so to say
*  I'm not going to lie to my kids. Like you lie to your kids all the time. You don't like your
*  husband. That's okay. You don't like your ex-husband, but it's their father. So just grin,
*  you know, Oh, daddy took me to meet his new girlfriend, Kiki. Oh, that's nice. You guys
*  have a good time. Good. Oh, that's yeah. And she helped me do my hair and she did my makeup.
*  Listen, I'm sure that's burning you inside, but you go, Oh, that's great. Cause why you love your
*  kids. Well, that's what I mean. Again, McConaughey has a, as a way bottom with that. He's like,
*  he basically says never lie, but a little bullshit is okay. Sure. Sure. Yeah. I mean, I'm very,
*  Tom Waits has that song, lie to me. You got to lie to me, baby. I, you know, honesty is a funny
*  thing. But Tom Waits also believes that God's a way on business. So I think his words, man,
*  and who do we, who are the ones that we left in charge, killers, thieves, and lawyers.
*  That's a Tom Waits quote. Well, it must be true then. Yeah. I don't know how many,
*  I don't know how many limbs I have, but I will give all of them to talk to Tom. And he's a very
*  private person. I feel like he's the musical equivalent of Cormac McCarthy. Yeah. Even if
*  you get the interview, you're not, I don't think going to get in there. No, I don't think you want
*  like, uh, honestly, I don't think you want to. I think I've seen his public interviews over the
*  years with Letterman and I think he just, he is the poetry. I would put Tom Waits, um,
*  Cormac McCarthy, Maynard James Keenan. Like these, these are artists that like, I think they want
*  the art to speak for itself. They would like to be lessened. They don't want you to, you know,
*  I remember early, early days of Tool that he, like this, he could not have been less interested in
*  the spotlight to the point where I think it was almost to the detriment of the band early on,
*  you know, and that's, there's no surprise that those are three artists that I think are
*  unbelievable and in a category of their own and that you hear their performance.
*  Like you can give me a page of a Cormac McCarthy novel and I'll know it's a Cormac McCarthy novel.
*  You can, a few notes of Maynard James Keenan or Tom Waits voice, you know, that that's them.
*  Yeah. It's genius, genius highs from the spotlight, but you know, doesn't stop me from feeling sad
*  about it. But anyway, yeah, that does. I would like to hear that. She's the girl that got away.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I'm just standing outside of that girl's house with the, with the sign. Yeah.
*  Just playing in your eyes with Peter Gabriel. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, uh, was it lied to me? This,
*  this whole idea of honesty in relationships is interesting. I mean, clerks with the blowjobs.
*  I, I don't know how to phrase it eloquently, but like there's stuff you should be honest about
*  and there's stuff maybe you don't need to be honest about.
*  So in the law, it is illegal to commit fraud. Fraud is a material misrepresentation of fact,
*  but the law specifically says you're permitted to engage in quote, mere puffery. Nice. Puffery.
*  So, and that's the, that's the term that was used for it. Puffery and puffery is when you are
*  inflating something, you're being like hyperbolic, but, but people wouldn't necessarily think you're
*  telling the truth. You know, like that it, it's not, you know, like if I say to you, this bottle of
*  water, you know, was held by Elvis and that's why you should pay me $50 for it. That's fraud.
*  But if I say, this is the water that has been, it's, this water is drank by the finest people.
*  Presidents drink this water. This is a, now this is puffery, you know? And so I, I, I,
*  advertising marketing is based on puffery. It's not fraud. When it's fraud, it crosses the line. So
*  I think there's a difference between honesty and candor, right? So, so in relationships,
*  being honest is good. Being totally candid is probably not a great idea. Like it's
*  indelicate to be totally candid about some things. If a woman you're in a romantic relationship with
*  says to you, do I look good in this dress? And they don't. You, or do I look fat in this? That's
*  a, that's a better way. Any heterosexual man who's ever been in a relationship has had that question
*  asked of him. Do I look fat in this? Does this make my butt look big or does it, whatever? Does
*  this, do I look fat in this? If you go, yes, that's indelicate. It's honest, but it's indelicate and
*  it's almost mean, right? But there's, and if you say no, but it's true. She doesn't look good in
*  that. Like the concern she sees is a legitimate concern. Do you lie and go, no, no, you look
*  great in that. That's great. That's not a good thing either. So what do you say? You know,
*  that blue dress you have really compliments your body. Like in a way that one doesn't, you know,
*  that the cut of that dress is such that it doesn't flatter you. I see what you're saying. Now,
*  now it's the dress. It's not you, babe, you know, but I'm telling you the truth. Like I'm addressing
*  your concern. Like this is what, this is the distinction. Like don't, don't material
*  misrepresent the facts. Like don't steer people down roads that they're, you know, you know,
*  that that's not how it's going to go. Right. But, you know, so it's like if the woman says,
*  I love you and you don't love her, don't say, I love you back. You know, you do the like, oh,
*  you know, I have very strong feelings for you as well. Or, you know, like there has to be
*  some middle ground. You don't just pretend you didn't hear them. Yeah. I mean, the, I guess
*  all of it requires skill, just like you described. And I think just being honest in quotes is not
*  enough. Well, it's not a specific enough instruction. I mean, that's the problem.
*  Is he, when you write a relationship book, which I never intended to do,
*  people come to you and say, you know, like, what are some, you know, what are the things I should
*  do to help my relationship or what is the cause of divorce? And you go, well, disconnection,
*  but like, what do you mean by that? Or like, how do I improve my relationship? Pay more attention.
*  Make small gestures. Okay. What does that even mean? Like, what do you mean? Like acts of love,
*  you should show your partner that you love them more often. What do you mean? Like what I say,
*  what I do, we should have more sex. Like, what are you at? What are you saying? Like people want
*  measurable, specific things. So that's why I tried in my book to be like very specific about like,
*  things you can do things you shouldn't do, you know, and, and they're practical suggestions.
*  Like, like, like leaving a note. I talk a lot about leaving a note. Like if you're dating someone,
*  or you're living with them, or you're in a serious relationship, send a text, leave a note,
*  just little every day, just some little thing that just tells them how much you like them.
*  Like, this is a low cost, high value move, doesn't take much. And it's a practical thing. But, but,
*  but we speak in these sort of like broader axioms, these broader concepts that people
*  just don't have any idea how to practically apply. I can't wait to listen to the audio book
*  where you talk about managing marital finances is like anal sex, which your, your, your mastery of
*  the metaphor touches one's heart and soul. You're Shakespeare 21st century. Really?
*  I don't know that Shakespeare would have brought anal up in that context, but I appreciate it. Yeah.
*  Yeah. My thesis there, or my point there was, you know, proceed carefully and have discussion
*  in advance. Yes. And don't just spring it on someone. Sure. And realize that this, if this
*  goes wrong, it will go catastrophically wrong. So good communication is important. And, you know,
*  yeah, I don't think it's something you should just dive into unless you're prepared for that
*  to have potentially a very negative impact. And, you know, finances is one of the sources
*  of a huge amount of stress in relationships, which is tremendous. Because it's, it's about value.
*  I think, I mean, it's aside from having painful conversations about what you tried to do and
*  were able to do, or what your impulse control was in terms of what you spent money on. Like there's,
*  you know, there's the conversation and then there's what's underneath the conversation.
*  You know, there's gender stuff about men feeling the need to be a provider. There's gender stuff of
*  men or women thinking material goods will fill the void and buying things and then creating
*  stress on their partner. There's the very human desire to make things seem effortless so your
*  spouse doesn't feel any stress when in fact it's causing tremendous financial stress. And then when
*  the dam breaks, it breaks hard. So yeah, there's a lot. Finance is tricky stuff and you could
*  probably be wonderful, romantic and sexual partners and have very different styles of
*  how you handle your finances. And how you handle your finances is informed by, you know,
*  not only your individual psychology, but also how you were raised and, you know, how your family
*  taught you about finance and how you should conduct your finances. So-
*  And there's interesting power dynamics in play.
*  Tremendously, yeah. And those are very tricky because the standard of living of a couple
*  becomes important in a divorce. But sometimes the toxic standard of living that created toxic
*  levels of stress is one of the causes of the divorce. And so they're asking the court to
*  maintain a financial obligation on you that is the reason why the marriage fell apart.
*  And that feels like a particularly insulting form of indignity.
*  Well, you're a fascinating human being on many levels, but you're also exceptionally productive
*  and you've talked to me about waking up early. For you, we've met today at 11 a.m. and for you,
*  that's what late afternoon, I suppose. We had to negotiate and come to an agreement because I
*  went to bed at 4 a.m. And I was up at, I get up at four every day. So now I'm here. Well, I woke,
*  it's three o'clock local time. So I woke up at three local time. Yeah, I wake up at four naturally,
*  then my body just wakes up. Oh, wow. That's fascinating.
*  Full on this speed. Wow. Like my most productive writing and speaking is from 4 a.m. until
*  noon or one. So can you take me through a productive, like a perfectly productive day?
*  I wake up at 4 a.m. very naturally. I wish I didn't, but I do check my phone first thing
*  because I want to see if any emergencies came in from a client overnight. So work emergencies.
*  Yeah, work related emergencies. And as a divorce lawyer,
*  our definition of emergency can be very serious. It's people absconding with a child. It's a
*  police being involved in a domestic violence. And so they can be like time sensitive things.
*  And when someone is hiring a divorce lawyer, I think they're hiring, they want someone
*  responsive. My clients have my cell phone number and I go to bed early because I get up early.
*  And so I go to sleep by 8 p.m. latest. I don't think I've seen 9 p.m. even on New Year's Eve.
*  So I wake up at four. I check my phone, check my email. Usually, even if there's something that's
*  time sensitive, it's usually not so time sensitive that it needs to be responded to at 4 a.m. because
*  most other normal people are asleep. I have espresso, black espresso, which I enjoy very much.
*  And then I work out. And that someday is going to be weights. A lot of days it's just going to be
*  cardio. I've changed my habits now that I'm in my early 50s. It used to be much more intensive
*  weight training and deadlifts and stuff like that. And then I herniated my L5S1. So 485 was my max
*  deadlift and now I don't hardly do deadlifts. Well, you can still relive the past glory.
*  I do. I still have some pictures of videos. You have pictures? I have videos. I have videos
*  of me putting 485 for three. But you can, in stories, when you talk about it, you can
*  exaggerate how much you've actually lifted. That's true. But then you can't pack it up. See,
*  I'm very evidence-based. So if I don't have a photo or video of it, it's just puffing.
*  Mere puffery at that point. But I work out. And then I try to work out for like a good hour.
*  And I do that partly because of stress. I think when I don't work out, it's difficult. I had a
*  group of guys that I would do jiu-jitsu with at 5 a.m. They were mostly law enforcement. They were
*  cops who would either be starting a shift or coming off of a night shift. And we would train
*  together, just do like an open mat. And it was at 5 a.m. till 6. And that was heaven. I love training
*  jiu-jitsu first thing in the morning if I can. And then I always do either a sauna or steam for 20
*  minutes, half an hour. And then I do a cold plunge or if I don't have access to a cold plunge,
*  a cold shower. And then I have breakfast. And it's usually a very uncontroversial, simple breakfast.
*  I like to eat, you know, I eat like slow carb, Tim Ferriss type style. And then I get right to work.
*  I try to do my drafting early in the day, prenups, motions, things like that, from, you know, let's
*  say six or seven until nine, nine thirty, which is when court begins.
*  So drafting is like writing up different documents?
*  Right. Writing prenups, writing separation agreements, writing settlement proposals,
*  writing motions for the court, pretrial memos, which is like research that I want to present
*  to a judge that supports my arguments. I do drafting. I review documents that the attorneys
*  who work for me have drafted and refine them. And then court is usually from nine o'clock until noon.
*  And if we're on trial, then it's a whole different pace because trials, the lunch break isn't really
*  a lunch break. You're preparing the afternoon's witnesses and you're trying to do damage control
*  on what happened in the morning. But if it's just court conferences, like most cases,
*  there's conferences. Conferences is you go in, you make oral argument, but you don't have witnesses
*  on the stand. You're not taking testimony. It's like everybody's just shouting allegations back
*  and forth and making temporary arguments pretrial. It's kind of the foreplay of the trial.
*  Is that exhausting by the way?
*  It's exhausting when you're done with it. Like while you're doing it, it's exhilarating.
*  I always say that I never sleep as poorly as the night before a trial and I never sleep as well as
*  the night I finished a trial. Because when I am on trial, I am speaking, listening,
*  watching the judge closely to see what they're reacting to and when they're paying attention
*  or not paying attention. Watching opposing counsel and the opposing party, like when is
*  the opposing party writing a little note to their lawyer to show it to them? What is the opposing
*  counsel objecting to? My client is trying to pass me notes half the time while I'm speaking and
*  making my arguments. I'm trying to adjust what I'm doing strategically based on the objections that
*  the judge is ruling on. So I'm so hyper stimulated on trial that when you finish, you can't even talk.
*  You're gone. Your brain is jello. Conferences is harder because at least with a trial,
*  there's a singularity of focus. Like with a trial, it's just one case and they have all my attention.
*  The problem is then on the lunch break, all the other cases that I've been ignoring for the last
*  several hours while I was on trial, they all have stuff going on. So it's like, hey, where's that
*  settlement proposal on this? Hey, she just did this. We need to file a motion. So now it's like,
*  I have an hour to eat and to answer all of this in some preliminary way to delegate some
*  responsibilities. And then I got to go back in and put a hundred percent of my focus on this other
*  case again. So you find yourself in a place, that's why I'm very disciplined, is you find yourself in
*  a place where I live my whole life in six minute increments, tenths of an hour, because we bill in
*  tenths of an hour. So everything I do, it's like 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and I'm logging time throughout the
*  day. And you find yourself at the end of the day, my son is a lawyer, my older son. He's a district
*  attorney and I'm very proud of him. He gets to put bad guys in jail and he's very smart. He's doing
*  a great job. He just, about a year ago. And when he graduated from law school, we were very close
*  and we were talking and he said, we were just talking about like the career and the law that
*  he was about to embark on. And I said to him, you know, the feeling at the end of the day,
*  when like all your homework or all your work is done and you just go, okay, it's all done now
*  and I'm going to go home. You'll never have that feeling ever again, ever. You're just going to,
*  every day go, all right, it's enough. It's enough. I got to get out of here. Because you could,
*  with every one of these cases, you could stay up 24 hours focusing just on it. So you have to
*  have the discipline to go, yeah, no, that's it. Like I'm done for now. I've done what I could do
*  today and now I'm going to sit and read for a half an hour. I'm going to watch this show for a half
*  an hour. I'm going to have this meal because it's never done. So that's challenging. That's a hard
*  part of this job. But I think my discipline helps with that. And then like I said, I finish my day
*  around 5.30, six o'clock and I have something to eat and I try to wind down a little and I'm usually
*  in bed by 7.30 and sleep by eight. You mentioned Jiu-Jitsu. You're a brown belt. What role has
*  Jiu-Jitsu played in your life? I love Jiu-Jitsu. I trained martial arts from the time I was a little
*  kid. I think I was seven or eight. I took up Okinawan Goju karate and I did Judo and it was
*  always part of my life. And then I got to college and grad school and I didn't have time for it and
*  I didn't do it so much. And then I got divorced. I was quite young still when I got divorced and I
*  had two young kids. And I thought, well, I can grow a goatee and buy a convertible and do the
*  thing you're supposed to do when you're a dude with kids close to middle age. Or I can try to
*  do something more productive. And so I said, well, maybe I'll go back to martial arts. So I took up
*  Muay Thai kickboxing and they had a Jiu-Jitsu class at the same school after the Muay Thai class.
*  And I had been around the orbit of Jiu-Jitsu having been, my kids took karate and there was
*  Jiu-Jitsu there. It was a Gracie Academy. And I stayed for a Jiu-Jitsu class and I had a 120 pound
*  girl rag doll me like, cause I just knew nothing about grappling. And I remember just going, well,
*  I got to learn what this is. And that was it. I just dove into it. My first professor was
*  Lou Ventolaro in New Jersey, a Hoyler Gracie black belt, great teacher, taught me amazing
*  fundamentals, took me all the way up to purple belt. And then right after I got my purple belt,
*  I moved to the city. I moved to Manhattan. I actually chose my apartment based on its proximity
*  to Marcello Garcia. And I moved to West Chelsea because it was a short walk to Marcello's academy.
*  My core Jiu-Jitsu was up to purple belt. It was Lou Ventolaro and then it's been Marcello.
*  And Marcello Paul Schreiner, who's really phenomenal at his academy and all of the people
*  at his academy are all phenomenal. I mean, Bernardo Fajardo was there for a period of time that I was
*  there and before he went to Boston. Marcos Tanaka was like his lasso guard stuff. He was at Marcello's
*  for a long time and what a teacher. I mean, my lack of skill at Jiu-Jitsu is not based on a lack
*  of quality instruction. It's based on an inability to retain the information for very long.
*  For me, that's one of the most reliable places I can go to humble myself.
*  I love Jiu-Jitsu. I love the progressive humility that it drives home constantly.
*  I love the impossibility of perfecting it, although Gordon Ryan's probably come close
*  and Marcello's probably come close to perfecting it.
*  Let me ask you, since you mentioned Gordon Ryan, so apparently some close with Gordon,
*  I'm sure you know in Austin, just the Jiu-Jitsu scene.
*  It's like the Jiu-Jitsu Mecca. I'm actually seeing John Donahue this evening.
*  I mean, yeah, this is like a truly special place. But anyway, apparently long ago,
*  you mentioned Jersey. There's a bit of a conflict between you and Gordon and you mentioned to me
*  offline that you love him and just how much respect you have for him as an athlete and so on.
*  But can you explain why is this? Yeah, I'm actually glad I have that.
*  It's funny that you bring it up. We're talking about all these heavy topics and this is probably
*  the one that I find the most actually emotional. But Gordon's a very young man still. He's probably
*  in his 20s or early 30s. It's hard to imagine that because he's accomplished so much as an athlete
*  and as a business person. But there was a time not that long ago, I think it was eight or nine
*  years ago, where he was just a young guy on his way up. He's only, I think, a couple of years older
*  than my oldest son. And I, through a series of circumstances, Jiu-Jitsu wasn't, you know,
*  it's really exploded in the last 10 years, but there were not as many people sponsoring
*  quote unquote superfights. There really weren't like Jiu-Jitsu superfights being sponsored,
*  Jersey and New York in particular. And I got involved in sponsoring some Jiu-Jitsu superfights.
*  And I also got involved in sponsoring some Jiu-Jitsu athletes. And Gordon was a young
*  part of the Don and Her Death Squad. I was friends with Eddie Cummings. I'm still friends with Eddie.
*  I was friends with John. I'm still friends with John. But I didn't really know Gordon.
*  I actually don't know that I've still ever met. I don't think I've ever met Gordon.
*  I've been in the same room as him. But there was a fight that I had sponsored some other fights with
*  this particular promoter. And they asked me to sponsor one. And it didn't involve anyone
*  from Marcellos. But it involved Gordon. He was one of the people. And I liked John very much.
*  And I liked everybody in the Don and Her Death Squad. I like watching them compete. I thought,
*  you know, I think John's just brilliant. I mean, everyone at Marcellos has such respect for John
*  and for everyone. And the stuff they were doing, like when they were the early days of that Don
*  and Her Death Squad, like Eddie Cummings, like his leg locks, like he just blew the whole game up.
*  Just as a whole other thing, you know, it was like insane what they did, such innovation.
*  And Gordon at the time was, he was online. And I'm much older than that, you know. I'm in my
*  early 50s. And that's not, I guess, chronologically that much older, but generationally, I think it's
*  quite a bit different. And Gordon was smack talking with a guy who I, about a guy who I was
*  sponsor of, who I knew and who I knew was a very good athlete and had been through difficult things
*  in his life. And Gordon just, you know, said some like nasty things about him, you know, some,
*  it's very, it falls into the category of totally appropriate smack talking looking at it now and
*  looking at what Gordon became, you know, which is he's someone who talks trash, you know. It's like
*  part of his brand is to talk trash. And I see now that that's like a Muhammad Ali thing. At the time,
*  I just didn't see it as what it was. And although it doesn't excuse it, my mother was dying.
*  I was not at my best. I was having a hard time. And Gordon had spoken ill of this person. And I,
*  I got upset and I reached out to John and to Tom DeBlas. And I said to them, hey, like,
*  can you tell this guy to knock it off? Like, don't talk about this person who I sponsor if I'm
*  sponsoring his fight. I don't even know this Gordon Ryan kid and I'm sponsoring his fight. And like,
*  he should say thank you. Don't talk bad about a person who I financially sponsor. Like, that's not
*  cool. And I think on Facebook, he like wrote some comments and then I wrote some comments back and I
*  was incredibly obnoxious. And very soon after, I felt really gross because I was an adult.
*  And I was talking to a young person this way, who's on their way up, who's like a little older than
*  one of my kids. And I just said these obnoxious things to him. And I felt really like, that's
*  gross. And I never really thought much about it again. I watched his star rise and I was very,
*  I mean, who is not impressed by Gordon Ryan? And everyone at our academy was always very
*  thrilled to see him rise. And I've stayed friends with John and every time Gordon would have a big
*  victory, I would always text John and be like, because Gordon's victories are John's victories
*  too. They have such a great bond. All the people in his orbit are all people that I respect and
*  like. And I just would say, hey, listen, congratulations and please pass on my
*  congratulations to Gordon. But we don't know each other. I don't have his number. I have no way to
*  contact him to apologize to him. But if Gordon hears this, I am profoundly sorry.
*  I don't say that because I'm trying to get in your good graces. I don't know that we'll ever meet
*  each other. But that was an unbelievably wrong, stupid thing to say to a young person.
*  Well, thank you for saying that. This warms my heart in general.
*  See, you talk to a divorce lawyer and it warms your heart. Look at that.
*  Well, speaking of which, so what, you're a romantic actually. What role, you've seen love,
*  you've seen love break down completely. What role does love play in the human condition?
*  I mean, I think it's kind of everything, right? Like it's love is,
*  romantic love, wars are fought for romantic love. Empires fall because of romantic love. Like,
*  it takes down kings. It takes down, you know, like it's, we're all just struggling for it.
*  We're all just chasing it. Like we're all chasing the dragon, you know, it's like the rush we all
*  are. So it's huge. You know, it's huge. I mean, sex and love, which I like to believe are in some
*  way connected. And love and romance, which again, I like to believe are in some way connected.
*  I think it's huge. I think it's a, look, I've always thought most of what men do, including me,
*  we do to get laid. Like on some level, like you, you want to be successful. Why? So you can have
*  money. Why? So you can have nice things so that you can attract attractive members of the opposite
*  sex, you know, like a lot of things come down to that. And even for like men, you know, like red
*  pill, you know, men who are like, yeah, I don't care about women. Well, you talk about them an awful
*  lot. Like for someone that's not interested in women, you sure are like in the orbit of women
*  who you're telling how much you don't care about women, which kind of feels like you're doing that
*  to attract a certain kind of woman, which I get, you know, like more power to you. But like that
*  a person who worships an idol and a person who destroys an idol are both idolaters.
*  Yes. So you're, you're, if all you're talking about is how you don't need women, you're talking
*  about women an awful lot. So it's just such a splinter in people's mind, you know, relationships,
*  breakups, and like, it's such a great equalizer. I mean, you're spending some time in the rarefied
*  air now of like big celebrity people. And I remember when I started out as a lawyer, just
*  doing like the regular, like the cop and the teacher with a 401k and they didn't have any assets.
*  I remember thinking like, well, someday if I represent celebrities or wealthy CEOs, like it'll
*  be different. They'll be like smarter. They'll be like different. It's just the same weird petty
*  shit, the same infidelity, the same, the same kind of insecurities, the same kind of jealousy,
*  the same kind of fights at all. It's all the same, but it is, it's like, and it's all the same
*  insecurity, sadness. It's the same like desire to be validated, like mommy issues, daddy issues,
*  like intimacy issues, you know, and it's all the same stuff. And just because you're really good
*  at other things, like I've represented professional athletes who are phenomenal, world-class,
*  world-class, you know, doctors, business people, and they suck at relationships no better than like
*  anybody else. Like there's no, you know, there's no connection between the skills that made you a
*  good entrepreneur and the skills that made you a good, you know, spouse or partner. I'm sure
*  there's some overlap, like patience is good and thinking strategically is probably good, but I'm
*  I'm just humbled by how we're called to it still. Like it's so, and even when we lose and even when
*  like our greatest pains were caused by our desire to love and be loved in a romantic sense,
*  we just keep putting the money on the table and playing, like we won't just quit, we just keep
*  going, you know, and- The whole mess of it is worth it. I mean, I guess, I guess so, like it's calling us.
*  I don't know if it's worth it or not. That's a value judgment, right? But I, we don't stop.
*  I don't know a lot of people that, they played the hand, they lost and they went, well, no more of
*  that game for me. Like I'm not a good poker player. I'm not playing poker anymore. Like I know people
*  who've done that. I know people that are like, listen, I don't drink, like, you know, I'm allergic.
*  I break out in handcuffs and hospital bills. Like I'm not drinking anymore, but I don't know people
*  that are like, man, that relationship, I screwed that up or I got screwed on that one. I'm not
*  doing that anymore. You can say that. Everybody says that I'm through with love, you know, I'm done.
*  They're not, they keep going. They'll, they'll, they'll go up again.
*  Never going to fall in love again. And then a few weeks later,
*  I got job security, man. I got job security. People are not going to stop walking down that aisle.
*  They are not going to stop having kids with people that they probably should have thought through,
*  whether they would have kids with that person or not. But I'm glad they are. I'm glad they're
*  taking that leap. I'm glad they're taking that risk. It's this whole beautiful mess that we're
*  all a part of. It's like taking that risk, taking that leap of vulnerabilities of what this whole
*  thing is about. And what a danger if we didn't, you know, like, like every, you know, you, you,
*  you hear about people like Alexander Hamilton, or you hear about, you know, people who like,
*  they were born of circumstances that like, these two people should never have had a kid.
*  And then they did. And that kid changes the world, you know, and like, moves the dial forward. What
*  a like, what a great mistake. Like, what a great, it's that you can't ever say it's a mistake. Like,
*  what an amazing thing that happened. And, and I think that that's one of the things I like about
*  divorce as a practice and as almost looking at it like a spiritual practice. I think you just don't
*  know what is a blessing, right? In the world, like, you just don't know. Like I, my father,
*  I've spoken about this before publicly, and he does frequently. My father is an alcoholic. My
*  father's been in recovery now for seven years, I think. Yeah. But he was a bad alcoholic,
*  Vietnam veteran my whole life, and only got sober, you know, when I was in my 40s.
*  And a lot of the personality characteristics I have are consistent with those of adult children
*  of alcoholics, you know, desire for control and control issues. You know, a lot, a lot of those
*  things. And I love my life. Like I'm having a great time. If I died tomorrow, man, I did more,
*  learned more, earned more, loved more than I ever dreamed. And so I'm so glad my dad was an alcoholic.
*  And if you said to me, how do you raise kids? Like, I wouldn't say like, well, you definitely
*  want to be an alcoholic because like your kids getting a lot of really good discipline lessons
*  from that experience. Like, no, like I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't want that for, but, but,
*  but it's born, like all these wonderful things were born of this awful situation. So I think
*  divorce is the same thing. Like I, we make these mistakes, right? But they're not really, you know,
*  I often have to say to my clients when they're like, oh, I wish I'd never married this person.
*  I'm like, you love your kids, right? Like your kids are half that person. They would not be the
*  organism they are without that person's DNA. So you can't regret being with that person if you love
*  your kids. Like if you love your kids, those kids don't exist without that person. And I don't know
*  how we refocus on that. You know, I don't know, maybe we give anyone going through it. I've
*  actually had a theory, which I've not said out loud, but I'll say it to you because it's just us
*  talking. I think if we could figure out a way to take a divorcing couple
*  that is interested in potentially mediating and put them in a setting where we could give them both
*  psilocybin, like a good dose, like two and a half, three grams, and have them do individual sessions
*  with, you know, controlled setting with a guide, right? And have them sort of do that inner work
*  and then have them do some kind of a session together after they've had that experience,
*  that psychedelic experience. I actually think you could do transformative divorce work
*  because I have found myself and certainly the many people that I've talked to who've had
*  psilocybin experiences and in particular, but any psychedelic experience, many of the empathogens,
*  or even like MDMA, you know, like MDMA, which is, you know, is an empathogen.
*  If we brought that space and the divorce and conflict resolution space together,
*  that sort of psychopharmacological intervention on empathy, one's empathy receptors or one's
*  connectivity, I think that could be radically transforming. It would be logistically an absolute
*  nightmare. It would never get done from a legal standpoint, but man, like I think sometimes,
*  like that if, because I think the more that you can bring people to the awareness of connection
*  that comes from many people's psychedelic experiences, I think they could then extrapolate
*  that into their understanding of the conflict and disconnect they're having with their partner.
*  So really lean into the, like use this brink of divorce as a kind of catalyst
*  for doing a lot of soul searching, a lot of growth together.
*  That was what appealed to me about it. I mean, before I started doing it is it was this idea
*  that this is a opportunity for radical reinvention. Like it was an opportunity for people to say,
*  okay, now what? Like I didn't expect that, now what? And it was to be part of the architecture
*  of that. Like I didn't look at it like I'm helping demolish the building. It was like I'm tearing
*  down the building so we can build the new one, which I hope is filled with joy and abundance
*  and peace and love and real love, real satisfaction. Like my ex-wife is married for over a decade now
*  to a phenomenal guy who is perfect for her. And he's nothing like me, by the way. Like if you met
*  him and you met both of us, you'd go, well, no one could love both of these guys. Because like,
*  if you like this flavor, you wouldn't like this flavor. Like I am impatient, fast talking, like
*  skip to the end, we got to land this plane, come on. And he's like, he's therapist, he's chill,
*  he's sort of like patient and they're perfect together. And I can say that as someone who loves
*  her and loved her, you know, and knows her or knew her. Like, and I think if we can, you know,
*  if we can radically view honestly, like without jealousy, without, you know, without the sense of
*  like, look at it and just go, yeah, yeah, okay. Like this, like this is the love this person needed.
*  Like that doesn't mean my love sucks. It just means it wasn't the right one for this person.
*  You know, like there's someone and there's a lid for every pot, you know, like she found her lid.
*  I wanted to find her lid. That's good. You know, and there's billions of pots out there. We just
*  need to match them with the proper lid. Yeah. Not hit each other over the head with them all day long.
*  Yeah, man. This is such a romantic few hours we've got to spend together.
*  And there's even a candle burning over there. Oh, that's lovely.
*  All right, brother. Thanks so much. Thanks for having me.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with James Sexton. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Rumi.
*  Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself
*  that you have built against it. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
