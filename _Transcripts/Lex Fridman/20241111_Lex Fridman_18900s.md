# Dario Amodei Anthropic CEO on Claude, AGI & the Future of AI & Humanity  Lex Fridman Podcast #452
**Lex Fridman:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4)
*  If you extrapolate the curves that we've had so far, right?
*  If you say, well, I don't know, we're starting to get to like PhD level.
*  And last year we were at undergraduate level and the year before we were at
*  like the level of a high school student.
*  Again, you can, you can quibble with at what tasks and for what we're still missing
*  modalities, but those are being added.
*  Like computer use was added, like image generation has been added.
*  If you just kind of like eyeball the rate at which these capabilities are increasing.
*  It does make you think that we'll get there by 2026 or 2027.
*  I think there are still worlds where it doesn't happen in, in a hundred years.
*  Those were the number of those worlds is rapidly decreasing.
*  We are rapidly running out of truly convincing blockers, truly compelling
*  reasons why this will not happen in the next few years.
*  The scale up is very quick.
*  Like we do this today.
*  We make a model and then we deploy thousands, maybe tens of thousands of
*  instances of it.
*  I think by the time, you know, certainly within two to three years, whether we
*  have these super powerful AIs or not, clusters are going to get to the size
*  where you'll be able to deploy millions of these.
*  I am optimistic about meaning.
*  I worry about economics and the concentration of power.
*  That's actually what I worry about more.
*  The abuse of power.
*  And AI increases the amount of power in the world.
*  And if you concentrate that power and abuse that power, it can do immeasurable
*  damage.
*  Yes.
*  It's very frightening.
*  It's very, it's very frightening.
*  The following is a conversation with Dario Amadei, CEO of Anthropic, the company
*  that created Claude that is currently and often at the top of most LLM benchmark
*  leaderboards.
*  On top of that, Dario and the Anthropic team have been outspoken advocates for
*  taking the topic of AI safety very seriously.
*  And they have continued to publish a lot of fascinating AI research on this
*  and other topics.
*  I'm also joined afterwards by two other brilliant people from Anthropic.
*  First, Amanda Askel, who is a researcher working on alignment and fine tuning of
*  Claude, including the design of Claude's character and personality.
*  A few folks told me she has probably talked with Claude more than any human at
*  Anthropic.
*  So she was definitely a fascinating person to talk to about prompt engineering
*  and practical advice on how to get the best out of Claude.
*  After that, Chris Ola stopped by for a chat.
*  He's one of the pioneers of the field of mechanistic interpretability, which is an
*  exciting set of efforts that aims to reverse engineer neural networks to figure
*  out what's going on inside, inferring behaviors from neural activation patterns
*  inside the network.
*  This is a very promising approach for keeping future super intelligent AI
*  systems safe.
*  For example, by detecting from the activations when the model is trying to
*  deceive the human it is talking to.
*  This is Alex Friedman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Dario Amadei.
*  Let's start with a big idea of scaling laws and the scaling hypothesis.
*  What is it?
*  What is its history and where do we stand today?
*  So I can only describe it as it, you know, as it relates to kind of my own
*  experience, but I've been in the AI field for about 10 years and it was something I
*  noticed very early on.
*  So I first joined the AI world when I was working at Baidu with Andrew Ng in late
*  2014, which is almost exactly 10 years ago now.
*  And the first thing we worked on was speech recognition systems.
*  And in those days, I think deep learning was a new thing.
*  It had made lots of progress, but everyone was always saying, we don't have the
*  algorithms we need to succeed.
*  You know, we were not, we're only matching the tiny, tiny fraction.
*  There's so much we need to kind of discover algorithmically.
*  We haven't found the picture of how to match the human brain.
*  And when, you know, in some ways it was fortunate.
*  I was kind of, you know, you can have almost beginner's luck, right?
*  I was like a newcomer to the field.
*  And, you know, I looked at the neural net that we were using for speech, the
*  recurrent neural networks.
*  And I said, I don't know what if you make them bigger and give them more layers?
*  And what if you scale up the data along with this, right?
*  I just saw these as like independent dials that you could turn.
*  And I noticed that the model started to do better and better as you gave them more
*  data, as you, as you made the models larger, as you train them for longer.
*  And I didn't measure things precisely in those days, but, but along with, with
*  colleagues, we very much got the informal sense that the more data and the more
*  compute and the more training you put into these models, the better they perform.
*  And so initially my thinking was, Hey, maybe that is just true for speech
*  recognition systems, right?
*  Maybe, maybe that's just one particular quirk, one particular area.
*  I think it wasn't until 2017 when I first saw the results from GPT-1 that it clicked
*  for me that language is probably the area in which we can do this.
*  We can get trillions of words of language data.
*  We can train on them.
*  And the models we were trained in those days were tiny.
*  You could train them on one to eight GPUs, whereas, you know, now we train jobs on
*  tens of thousands soon going to hundreds of thousands of GPUs.
*  And so when I, when I saw those two things together and, you know, there were a few
*  people like Ilya suits giver who you've interviewed, who had somewhat similar
*  reviews, right?
*  He might've been the first one, although I think a few people came to, came to
*  similar reviews around the same time, right?
*  There was, you know, Rich Sutton's bitter lesson.
*  There was Goran wrote about the scaling hypothesis, but I think somewhere between
*  2014 and 2017 was when it really clicked for me, when I really got conviction that,
*  Hey, we're going to be able to do these incredibly wide cognitive tasks if we
*  just, if we just scale up the models.
*  And at every stage of scaling, there are always arguments.
*  And, you know, when I first heard them, honestly, I thought probably I'm the one
*  who's wrong and you know, all of these, all these experts in the field are right.
*  They know the situation better, better than I do.
*  Right.
*  There's, you know, the Chomsky argument about like, you can get syntactics, but
*  you can't get semantics.
*  There was this idea, oh, you can make a sentence make sense, but you can't make a
*  paragraph make sense.
*  The latest one we have today is, you know, we're going to run out of data or the
*  data isn't high quality enough or models can't reason.
*  And each time, every time we manage to, we manage to either find a way around or
*  scaling just is the way around.
*  Sometimes it's one, sometimes it's the other.
*  And so I'm now at this point, I still think, you know, it's, it's, it's always
*  quite uncertain.
*  We have nothing but inductive inference to tell us that the next few years are
*  going to be like the next, the last 10 years.
*  But, but I've seen, I've seen the movie enough times I've seen the story happen
*  for, for enough times to, to really believe that probably the scaling is going to
*  continue and that there's some magic to it that we haven't really explained on a
*  theoretical basis yet.
*  And of course the scaling here is bigger networks, bigger data, bigger compute.
*  Yes.
*  All of those in particular linear scaling up of bigger networks, bigger
*  training times and more and more data.
*  So all of these things, almost like a chemical reaction, you know, you have
*  three ingredients in the chemical reaction and you need to linearly scale up the
*  three ingredients.
*  If you scale up one, not the others, you run out of the other reagents and the,
*  and the reaction stops.
*  But if you scale up everything, everything in series, then, then the
*  reaction can proceed.
*  And of course, now that you have this kind of empirical science slash art, you
*  can apply to other, uh, more nuanced things like scaling laws applied to
*  interpretability or scaling laws applied to post-training or just seeing how does
*  this thing scale, but the big scaling law, I guess the underlying scaling
*  hypothesis has to do with big networks, big data leads to intelligence.
*  Yeah, we've, we've documented scaling laws in lots of domains other than
*  language, right?
*  So, uh, initially the, the paper we did that first showed it was in early
*  2020, where we first showed it for language.
*  There was then some work late in 2020, where we showed the same thing for other
*  modalities like images, video, text to image, image to text, math, that they all
*  had the same pattern.
*  And, and you're right now there are other stages like post-training or there are
*  new types of reasoning models.
*  And in, in, in all of those cases that we've measured, we see similar, similar
*  types of scaling laws.
*  A bit of a philosophical question, but what's your intuition about why bigger
*  is better in terms of network size and data size?
*  Why does it lead to more intelligent models?
*  So in my previous career as a, as a biophysicist, so I did a physics
*  undergrad and then biophysics in, in, in, in grad school.
*  So I think back to what I know as a physicist, which is actually much less
*  than what some of my colleagues at, at Anthropic have in terms of, in terms of
*  expertise in physics, uh, there's this, there's this concept called the one over
*  F noise and one over X distributions.
*  Um, we're, we're often, um, uh, you know, just, just like if you add up a bunch of
*  natural processes, you get a Gaussian.
*  If you add up a bunch of kind of differently distributed natural processes,
*  if you like, if you like, take a, take a, um, probe and, and hook it up to a
*  resistor, the distribution of the thermal noise and the resistor goes as one over
*  the frequency, um, it's some kind of natural convergent distribution.
*  Uh, and, and I, I, I, and, and I think what it amounts to is that if you look
*  at a lot of things that are, that are produced by some natural process that
*  has a lot of different scales, right?
*  Not a Gaussian, which is kind of narrowly distributed, but you know, if I look at
*  kind of like large and small fluctuations that lead to lead to electrical noise,
*  um, they have this decaying one over X distribution.
*  And so now I think of like patterns in the physical world, right?
*  If I, if, or, or in language, if I think about the patterns in language, there are
*  some really simple patterns, some words are much more common than others like the,
*  then there's basic noun verb structure.
*  Then there's the fact that, you know, nouns and verbs have to agree.
*  They have to coordinate.
*  And there's the higher level sentence structure and there's the thematic
*  structure of paragraphs.
*  And so the fact that there's this regressing structure, you can imagine
*  that as you make the networks larger, first, they capture the really simple
*  correlations, the really simple patterns.
*  And there's this long tail of other patterns.
*  And if that long tail of other patterns is really smooth, like it is with the one
*  over F noise in, you know, physical processes, like, like, like resistors,
*  then you can imagine as you make the network larger, it's kind of capturing
*  more and more of that distribution.
*  And so that smoothness gets reflected in how well the models are at predicting
*  that how well they perform.
*  Language is an evolved process, right?
*  We've, we've developed language.
*  We have common words and less common words.
*  We have common expressions and less common expressions.
*  We have ideas, cliches that are expressed frequently, and we have novel ideas.
*  And that process has, has developed, has evolved with humans over millions of years.
*  And so the, the, the guess, and this is pure speculation would be, would be that
*  there is, there's some kind of long tail distribution of, of, of the
*  distribution of these ideas.
*  So there's the long tail, but also there's the height of the hierarchy of
*  concepts that you're building up.
*  So the bigger the network, presumably you have a higher capacity to.
*  Exactly.
*  If you have a small network, you only get the common stuff, right?
*  If I take a tiny neural network, it's very good at understanding that, you
*  know, a sentence has to have, you know, verb adjective noun, right?
*  But it's, it's terrible at deciding what those verb adjective and noun should be
*  and whether they should make sense.
*  If I make it just a little bigger, it gets good at that.
*  Then suddenly it's good at the sentences, but it's not good at the paragraphs.
*  And so these, these rarer and more complex patterns get picked up as I add, as
*  I add more capacity to the network.
*  Well, the natural question then is what's the ceiling of this?
*  Yeah.
*  Like how complicated and complex is the real world?
*  How much is the stuff is there to learn?
*  I don't think any of us knows the answer to that question.
*  Um, I S my strong instinct would be that there's no ceiling below the level of
*  humans, right?
*  We humans are able to understand these various patterns.
*  And so that, that makes me think that if we continue to, you know, scale up these,
*  these, these models to kind of develop new methods for training them and scaling
*  them up, uh, that will at least get to the level that we've gotten to with humans.
*  There's then a question of, you know, how much more is it possible to
*  understand than humans do?
*  How much, how much is it possible to be smarter and more perceptive than humans?
*  I would guess the answer has, has got to be domain dependent.
*  If I look at an area like biology and, you know, I wrote this essay, machines
*  of loving grace, it seems to me that humans are struggling to understand
*  the complexity of biology, right?
*  If you go to Stanford or to Harvard or to Berkeley, you have whole departments
*  of, you know, folks trying to study, you know, like the immune system or metabolic
*  pathways and, and each person understands only a tiny bit part of it, specializes,
*  and they're struggling to combine their knowledge with that of,
*  with that of other humans.
*  And so I have an instinct that there's, there's a lot of room at the
*  top for AIs to get smarter.
*  If I think of something like materials in the, in the physical world or, you
*  know, um, like addressing, you know, conflicts between humans or something
*  like that, I mean, you know, it may be, there's only some of these problems are
*  not intractable, but much harder.
*  And, and it may be that there's only, there's only so well you can do
*  with some of these things, right?
*  Just like with speech recognition, there's only so clear I can hear your speech.
*  So I think in some areas there may be ceilings in, in, in, you know, that
*  are very close to what humans have done in other areas, those ceilings may be
*  very far away and I think we'll only find out when we build these systems.
*  Uh, there's, it's very hard to know in advance.
*  We can speculate, but we can't be sure.
*  And in some domains, the ceiling might have to do with human bureaucracies
*  and things like this, as you write about.
*  Yeah.
*  So humans fundamentally has to be part of the loop.
*  That's the cause of the ceiling, not maybe the limits of the intelligence.
*  Yeah.
*  I think in many cases, um, you know, in theory, technology could change very fast.
*  For example, all the things that we might invent with respect to biology.
*  Um, but remember there's, there's a, you know, there's a clinical trial system
*  that we have to go through to actually administer these things to humans.
*  I think that's a mixture of things that are unnecessary and bureaucratic and
*  things that kind of protect the integrity of society and the whole challenge is
*  that it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell what's going on.
*  Uh, it's hard to tell which is which, right?
*  My, my view is definitely, I think in terms of drug development, we, my
*  view is that we're too slow and we're too conservative, but certainly if
*  you get these things wrong, you know, it's, it's possible to, to, to risk
*  people's lives by, by being, by being, by being too reckless.
*  And so at least, at least some of these human institutions are
*  in fact protecting people.
*  So it's, it's all about finding the balance.
*  I strongly suspect that balance is kind of more on the side of
*  pushing to make things happen faster, but there is a balance.
*  If we do hit a limit, if we do hit a slow down in the scaling laws, what do
*  you think would be the reason?
*  Is it compute limited data limited?
*  Uh, is it something else?
*  Idea limited.
*  So a few things now we're talking about hitting the limit before we get to the
*  level of, of humans and the skill of humans.
*  Um, so, so I think one that's, you know, one that's popular today, and I think,
*  you know, could be a limit that we run into.
*  I like most of the limits.
*  I would bet against it, but it's definitely possible is we simply run out of data.
*  There's only so much data on the internet and there's issues with the quality of
*  the data, right?
*  You can get hundreds of trillions of words on the internet, but a lot of it is, is
*  repetitive or it's search engine, you know, search engine optimization, drivel,
*  or maybe in the future, it'll even be text generated by AI's itself.
*  Uh, and, and so I think there are limits to what, to, to, to what can be produced
*  in this way that said we, and I would guess other companies are working on ways
*  to make data synthetic, uh, where you can, you know, you can use the model to generate
*  more data of the type that you have, that you have already, or even generate data
*  from scratch.
*  If you think about, uh, what was done with, uh, deep minds, alpha go zero, they
*  managed to get a bot all the way from, you know, no ability to play go whatsoever
*  to above human level, just by playing against itself.
*  There was no example data from humans required in the alpha go zero version of
*  it.
*  The other direction of course, is these reasoning models that do chain of thought
*  and stop to think, um, and, and reflect on their own thinking in a way that's
*  another kind of synthetic data coupled with reinforcement learning.
*  So my, my guess is with one of those methods, we'll get around the data
*  limitation, or there may be other sources of data that are, that are available.
*  Um, we could just observe that even if there's no problem with data, as we start
*  to scale models up, they just stopped getting better.
*  It's, it seemed to be our reliable observation that they've gotten better.
*  That could just stop at some point for a reason we don't understand.
*  Um, the answer could be that we need to, uh, you know, we need to
*  invent some new architecture.
*  Um, it's been, there have been problems in the past with say, numerical stability
*  of models where it looked like things were, were leveling off, but, but actually,
*  you know, when we, when we, when we found the right unblocker, they didn't end up
*  doing so, so perhaps there's new, some new optimization method or some new, uh,
*  technique we need to, to unblock things.
*  I've seen no evidence of that so far, but if things were to, to slow down, that
*  perhaps could be one reason.
*  What about the limits of compute?
*  Meaning, uh, the expensive, uh, nature of building bigger and bigger data centers.
*  So right now, I think, uh, you know, most of the frontier model companies, I would
*  guess are operating in, you know, roughly, you know, $1 billion scale, plus
*  or minus a factor of three, right?
*  Those are the models that exist now or are being trained now.
*  Uh, I think next year we're going to go to a few billion and then, uh, 20, 26,
*  we may go to, uh, uh, you know, above 10, 10, 10 billion and probably by 2027,
*  their ambitions to build a hundred, a hundred billion dollar, a
*  hundred billion dollar clusters.
*  And I think all of that actually will happen.
*  There's a lot of determination to build the compute, to do it within this country.
*  Uh, and I would guess that it actually does happen.
*  Now, if we get to a hundred billion, that's still not enough compute.
*  That's still not enough scale.
*  Then either we need even more scale or we need to develop some way of doing it
*  more efficiently, of shifting the curve.
*  Um, I think between all of these, one of the reasons I'm bullish about powerful
*  AI happening so fast is just that if you extrapolate the next few points on the
*  curve, we're very quickly getting towards human level ability, right?
*  Some of the new models that, that we developed, some, some reasoning models
*  that have come from other companies, they're starting to get to what I would
*  call the PhD or professional level, right?
*  If you look at their, their coding ability, um, the latest model we released
*  sonnet 3.5, the new or updated version, it gets something like 50% on sweep edge.
*  And sweep edge is an example of a bunch of professional real world software
*  engineering tasks at the beginning of the year, I think the state of the art
*  was three or 4%.
*  So in 10 months we've gone from 3% to 50% on this task.
*  And I think in another year we'll probably be at 90%.
*  I mean, I don't know, but might, might even be, might even be less than that.
*  Uh, we've seen similar things in graduate level math, physics, and biology
*  from models like open AI's O one.
*  Uh, so, uh, if we, if we just continue to extrapolate this, right, in terms
*  of skill, skill that we have, I think if we extrapolate the straight curve
*  within a few years, we will get to these models being, you know, above the
*  highest professional level in terms of humans.
*  Now, will that curve continue?
*  You've pointed to, and I've pointed to a lot of reasons why, you know, possible
*  reasons why that might not happen.
*  But if the, if the extrapolation curve continues, that is the trajectory we're on.
*  So Anthropic has several competitors.
*  It'd be interesting to get your sort of view of it all.
*  Open AI, Google XAI, Meta.
*  What does it take to win in the broad sense of win in the space?
*  Yeah.
*  So I want to separate out a couple of things, right?
*  So, you know, Anthropics, Anthropics mission is to kind of try to make this all
*  go well, right?
*  And, and, you know, we have a theory of change called race to the top, right?
*  Race to the top is about trying to push the other players to do the right
*  thing by setting an example.
*  It's not about being the good guy.
*  It's about setting things up so that all of us can be the good guy.
*  I'll give a few examples of this early in the history of Anthropic.
*  One of our co-founders, Chris Ola, who I believe you're interviewing soon, you
*  know, he's the co-founder of the field of mechanistic interpretability, which is
*  an attempt to understand what's going on inside AI models.
*  So we had him and one of our early teams focus on this area of interpretability,
*  which we think is good for making models safe and transparent for three or four
*  years that had no commercial application whatsoever.
*  It still doesn't today.
*  We're doing some early betas with it and probably it will eventually, but, you
*  know, this is a very, very long research bed and one in which we've, we've built
*  in public and shared our results publicly.
*  And we did this because, you know, we think it's a way to make models safer.
*  An interesting thing is that as we've done this, other companies have started
*  doing it as well, in some cases because they've been inspired by it, in some
*  cases because they're worried that, you know, if, if other companies are doing
*  this, that look more responsible, they want to look more responsible too.
*  No one wants to look like the irresponsible actor.
*  And so they adopt this, they adopt this as well.
*  When folks come to Anthropic, interpretability is often a draw and I
*  tell them the other places you didn't go, tell them why you came here.
*  And then you see soon that there, that there's interpretability teams
*  else elsewhere as well.
*  And in a way that takes away our competitive advantage because it's like,
*  oh, now others are doing it as well, but it's good.
*  It's good for the broader system.
*  And so we have to invent some new thing that we're doing that others aren't
*  doing as well.
*  And the hope is to basically bid up, bid up the importance of, of, of doing the
*  right thing.
*  And it's not, it's not about us in particular, right?
*  It's not about having one particular good guy.
*  Other companies can do this as well.
*  If they, if they, if they join the race to do this, that's, that's, you know,
*  that's the best news ever.
*  Right.
*  It's, it's just, it's about kind of shaping the incentives to point upward
*  instead of shaping the incentives to point, to point downward.
*  And we should say this example of the field of a mechanistic interpretability
*  is just a, a rigorous non-hand wavy way of doing AI safety.
*  Yes.
*  Or it's tending that way.
*  Trying to, I mean, I think we're still early in terms of our ability to see
*  things, but I've been surprised at how much we've been able to look inside these
*  systems and understand what we see.
*  Right.
*  Unlike with the scaling laws where it feels like there's some, you know, law
*  that's driving these models to perform better on the inside, the models aren't,
*  you know, there's no reason why they should be designed for us to understand
*  them, right?
*  They're designed to operate.
*  They're designed to work just like the human brain or human biochemistry.
*  They're not designed for a human to open up the hatch, look inside and understand
*  them, but we have found, and you know, you can talk in much more detail about this
*  to Chris, that when we open them up, when we do look inside them, we find things
*  that are surprisingly interesting.
*  And as a side effect, you also get to see the beauty of these models.
*  You get to explore the sort of the beautiful nature of large neural networks
*  through the Mech and Terp kind of methodology.
*  I'm amazed at how clean it's been.
*  I'm amazed at things like induction heads.
*  I'm amazed at things like, you know, that we can, you know, use sparse autoencoders
*  to find these directions within the networks and that the directions correspond
*  to these very clear concepts.
*  We demonstrated this a bit with the Golden Gate Bridge Claude.
*  So this was an experiment where we found a direction inside one of the neural
*  networks layers that corresponded to the Golden Gate Bridge, and we just turned
*  that way up and so we released this model as a demo, it was kind of half a joke for
*  a couple of days, but it was illustrative of the method we developed and you could
*  take the Golden Gate, you could take the model, you could ask it about anything.
*  You know, it would be like how you could say, how was your day?
*  And anything you asked because this feature was activated would connect to
*  the Golden Gate Bridge.
*  So it would say, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm feeling relaxed and expansive, much like
*  the arches of the Golden Gate Bridge or, you know, it would masterfully change
*  topic to the Golden Gate Bridge and integrate it.
*  There was also a sadness to it, to the focus they had on the Golden Gate Bridge.
*  I think people quickly fell in love with it.
*  I think so people already miss it because it was taken down, I think, after a day.
*  Somehow these interventions on the model, where, where, where, where you kind of
*  adjust its behavior, somehow emotionally made it seem more human than any other
*  version of the model.
*  Strong personality, strong identity.
*  Strong personality.
*  It has these kind of like obsessive interests.
*  You know, we can all think of someone who's like obsessed with something.
*  So it does make it feel somehow a bit more human.
*  Let's talk about the present.
*  Let's talk about Claude.
*  So this year, a lot has happened.
*  In March, Claude 3, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku were released.
*  Then Claude 3, 5, Sonnet in July with an updated version just now released.
*  And then also Claude 3, 5, Haiku was released.
*  Okay.
*  Can you explain the difference between Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku and how we should
*  think about the different versions?
*  Yeah.
*  So let's go back to March when we first released these three models.
*  So, you know, our thinking was different companies produce kind of large and small
*  models, better and worst models.
*  We felt that there was demand both for a really powerful model, you know, when you,
*  that might be a little bit slower that you'd have to pay more for, and also for
*  fast, cheap models that are as smart as they can be for how fast and cheap, right?
*  Whenever you want to do some kind of like, you know, difficult analysis, like if I,
*  you know, I want to write code for instance, or, you know, I want to, I want to
*  brainstorm ideas or I want to do creative writing.
*  I want the really powerful model.
*  But then there's a lot of practical applications in a business sense where
*  it's like, I'm interacting with a website.
*  I, you know, like, I'm like doing my taxes or I'm, you know, talking to, you
*  know, to like a legal advisor and I want to analyze a contract or, you know, we
*  have plenty of companies that are just like, you know, I want to do auto complete
*  on my, on my IDE or something.
*  And for all of those things, you want to act fast and you want to use the model
*  very broadly.
*  So we wanted to serve that whole spectrum of needs.
*  So we ended up with this, you know, this kind of poetry theme.
*  And so what's a really short poem?
*  It's a haiku.
*  And so haiku is the small, fast, cheap model that is, you know, was at the time
*  was really surprisingly, surprisingly intelligent for how fast and cheap it was.
*  Sonnet is a, is a medium sized poem, right?
*  A couple of paragraphs.
*  And so Sonnet was the middle model.
*  It is smarter, but also a little bit slower, a little bit more expensive.
*  And, and Opus like a magnum opus is a large work.
*  Opus was the largest, smartest model at the time.
*  So that, that was the original kind of thinking behind it.
*  And our thinking then was, well, each new generation of models should
*  shift that trade-off curve.
*  So when we released Sonnet 3.5, it has the same, roughly the same, you know, cost
*  and speed as the Sonnet 3 model.
*  But it, it increased its intelligence to the point where it was smarter than the
*  original Opus 3 model, especially for code, but, but also just in general.
*  And so now, you know, we've shown results for a haiku 3.5 and I believe
*  haiku 3.5, the smallest new model is about as good as Opus 3, the largest old model.
*  So basically the aim here is to shift the curve.
*  And then at some point there's going to be an Opus 3.5.
*  Now every new generation of models has its own thing.
*  They use new data, their personality changes in ways that we kind of, you
*  know, try to steer, but are not fully able to steer.
*  And so there's never quite that exact equivalence where the only thing you're
*  changing is intelligence.
*  We always try and improve other things and some things change without us, without
*  us knowing or measuring.
*  So it's, it's very much an exact science in many ways, the manner and personality of
*  these models is more an art than it is a science.
*  So what is sort of the reason for the span of time between say, a Cloud Opus 3.0 and 3.5?
*  What is it, what takes that time if you can speak to it?
*  Yeah.
*  So there's, there's different, there's different processes.
*  There's pre-training, which is, you know, just kind of the normal language model
*  training, and that takes a very long time.
*  That uses, you know, these days, you know, tens, you know, tens of thousands,
*  sometimes many tens of thousands of GPUs or TPUs or Trainium, or, you know, we use
*  different platforms, but you know, accelerator chips, often, often training for months.
*  There's then a kind of post-training phase where we do reinforcement learning
*  from human feedback, as well as other kinds of reinforcement learning that, that
*  phase is getting larger and larger now.
*  And, you know, you know, often that's less of an exact science.
*  It often takes effort to get it right.
*  Models are then tested with some of our early partners to see how good they are.
*  And they're then tested both internally and externally for their safety.
*  Particularly for catastrophic and autonomy risks.
*  So we do internal testing, according to our responsible scaling policy, which I,
*  you know, could talk more about that in detail.
*  And then we have an agreement with the U S and the UK AI safety Institute, as well
*  as other third party testers in specific domains to test the models for what are
*  called CBRN risks, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, which are, you
*  know, we don't think that models pose these risks seriously yet, but, but every
*  new model we want to evaluate to see if we're starting to get close to some of
*  these, these, these more dangerous, these more dangerous capabilities.
*  So those are the phases.
*  And then, you know, then, then it just takes some time to get the model working
*  in terms of inference and launching it in the API.
*  So there's just a lot of steps to, to actually, to actually make, you know,
*  model work.
*  And of course, you know, we're always trying to make the processes as
*  streamlined as possible, right?
*  We want our safety testing to be rigorous, but we want it to be rigorous and to be,
*  you know, to be automatic, to happen as fast as it can without compromising on
*  rigor, same with our pre-training process and our post-training process.
*  So, you know, it's just like building anything else.
*  It's just like building airplanes.
*  You want to make them, you know, you want to make them safe, but you want to make
*  the process streamlined.
*  And I think the creative tension between those is, you know, is an important thing
*  in making the models work.
*  Yeah.
*  A rumor on the street, I forget who was saying that Anthropic has really good
*  tooling.
*  So I, probably a lot of the challenge here is on the software engineering side
*  is to build the tooling to have a, like a efficient, low friction interaction with
*  the infrastructure.
*  You would be surprised how much of the challenges of, you know, building these
*  models comes down to, you know, software engineering, performance engineering.
*  You know, you, you know, from the outside, you might think, oh man, we had this
*  Eureka breakthrough, right?
*  You know, this movie with the science, we discovered it, we figured it out.
*  But, but, but I think, I think all things, even, even, even, you know, incredible
*  discoveries, like they, they, they, they, they almost always come down to the
*  details and, and often super, super boring details.
*  I can't speak to whether we have better tooling than, than other companies.
*  I mean, you know, I haven't been at those other companies, at least, at least not
*  recently, but it's certainly something we give a lot of attention to.
*  I don't know if you can say, but from three, from Claude three to Claude three,
*  five, is there any extra pre-training going on as they mostly focus on the post
*  training?
*  There's been leaps in performance.
*  Yeah.
*  I think, I think at any given stage we're focused on improving everything at once.
*  Um, just, just naturally, like there are different teams, each team makes progress
*  in a particular area in, in, in making a particular, you know, their particular
*  segment of the relay race better.
*  And it's just natural that when we make a new model, we put, we put all
*  of these things in at once.
*  So the data you have, like the preference data you get from RLHF, is that applicable?
*  Is there ways to apply it to newer models as you get trained up?
*  Yeah.
*  Preference data from old models sometimes gets used for new models.
*  Although of course, uh, it, it performs somewhat better when it's, you know,
*  trained on, it's trained on the new models.
*  Note that we have this, you know, constitutional AI method such that we
*  don't only use preference data.
*  We kind of, there's also a post training process where we train the model
*  against itself and there's, you know, new types of post training the model
*  against itself that are used every day.
*  So it's not just RLHF, it's a bunch of other methods as well.
*  Um, post training, I think, you know, is becoming more and more sophisticated.
*  Well, what explains the big leap in performance for the new Sonnet 3.5?
*  I mean, at least in the programming side, and maybe this is a good
*  place to talk about benchmarks.
*  What does it mean to get better?
*  It's just the number went up, but you know, I, I, I program, but I also love
*  programming and I, um, claw 3.5 through cursors, what I use, uh, to assist me
*  in programming and there was at least experientially, anecdotally, it's
*  gotten smarter at programming.
*  So what, like, what, what does it take to get it, uh, to get it smarter?
*  We observed that as well, by the way, there were a couple, uh, very strong
*  engineers here at Anthropic, um, who all previous code models, both produced by
*  us and produced by all the other companies hadn't really been useful to,
*  hadn't really been useful to them.
*  You know, they said, you know, maybe, maybe this is useful to beginner.
*  It's not useful to me, but Sonnet 3.5, the original one for the first time, they
*  said, oh my God, this helped me with something that, you know, that it
*  would have taken me hours to do.
*  This is the first model has actually saved me time.
*  So again, the water line is rising.
*  And then I think, you know, the new sonnet has been, has been even better
*  in terms of what it, what it takes.
*  I mean, I'll just say it's been across the board.
*  It's in the pre-training, it's in the post-training, it's in various
*  evaluations that we do, we've observed this as well.
*  And if we go into the details of the benchmark, so, SWE bench is basically,
*  you know, since, since, you know, since, since you're a programmer, you know,
*  you'll be familiar with like pull requests and, you know, just, just pull requests
*  are like, you know, they, like a sort of, a sort of atomic unit of work.
*  You know, you could say, I'm, you know, I'm implementing one, I'm implementing one
*  thing and, and so SWE bench actually gives you kind of a real world situation
*  where the code base is in the current state.
*  And I'm trying to implement something that's, you know, that's described
*  in described in language.
*  We have internal benchmarks where we, where we measure the same thing.
*  And you say, just give the model free reign to like, you know, do anything,
*  run, run, run anything, edit anything.
*  How, how well is it able to complete these tasks?
*  And it's that benchmark that's gone from it can do it 3% of the time to it can
*  do it about 50% of the time.
*  So I actually do believe that if we get, you can gain benchmarks, but I think if
*  we get to a hundred percent on that benchmark and in a way that isn't kind
*  of like overtrained or, or, or game for that particular benchmark, probably
*  represents a real and serious increase in kind of, in kind of programming,
*  programming ability.
*  And I would suspect that if we can get to, you know, 90, 90, 95% that, that, that,
*  that, you know, it will, it will represent ability to autonomously do a significant
*  fraction of software engineering tasks.
*  Well, ridiculous timeline question.
*  When is cloud Opus a 3.5 coming out?
*  Not giving you an exact date.
*  Uh, but you know, they're there, uh, you know, as far as we know, the plan is
*  still to have a cloud 3.5 Opus.
*  Are we going to get it before GTA six or no?
*  Like Duke Nukem forever.
*  So what was that game that there was some game that was delayed 15 years.
*  Was that Duke Nukem forever?
*  Yeah.
*  And I think GTA is now just releasing trailers.
*  It, you know, it's only been three months since we released the first sonnet.
*  Yeah.
*  It's incredible.
*  The incredible pace of it.
*  It just, it just tells you about the pace.
*  Yeah.
*  The expectations for when things are going to come out.
*  So, uh, what about four?
*  Oh, so how do you think about sort of as these models get bigger and bigger about
*  versioning and also just versioning in general, why sonnet three, five updated
*  with the date, why not sonnet 3.6 without a lot of people calling it.
*  Naming is actually an interesting challenge here, right?
*  Because I think a year ago, most of the model was pre-training.
*  And so you could start from the beginning and just say, okay, we're
*  going to have models of different sizes.
*  We're going to train them all together.
*  And, you know, we'll have a family of naming schemes and then we'll put some
*  new magic into them and then, you know, we'll have the next, the next generation.
*  Um, the trouble starts already when some of them take a lot
*  longer than others to train, right?
*  That already messes up your time, time a little bit, but as you make big
*  improvements in, as you make big improvements in pre-training, uh, then
*  you suddenly notice, oh, I can make better pre-trained model and that
*  doesn't take very long to do.
*  And, but, you know, clearly it has the same, you know, size and
*  shape of previous models.
*  Uh, so I think those two together, as well as the timing, timing issues, any
*  kind of scheme you come up with, uh, you know, the reality tends to kind
*  of frustrate that scheme, right?
*  It tends to kind of break out of the, break out of the scheme.
*  It's not like software where you can say, oh, this is like, you know, 3.7.
*  This is 3.8.
*  No, you have models with different, different trade-offs.
*  You can change some things in your models.
*  You can train, you can change other things.
*  Some are faster and slower at inference.
*  Some have to be more expensive.
*  Some have to be less expensive.
*  And so I think all the companies have struggled with this.
*  Um, I think we did very, you know, I think, I think we were in a good, good
*  position in terms of naming when we had Haiku, Sonnet and Opus.
*  Great start.
*  We're trying to maintain it, but it's not, it's not, it's not perfect.
*  Um, so we'll, we'll, we'll try and get back to the simplicity, but it, um, uh,
*  just the, the, the nature of the field, I feel like no one's figured out naming.
*  It's somehow a different paradigm from like normal software.
*  And, and, and so we, we just, none of the companies have been perfect at it.
*  Um, it's something we struggle with surprisingly much relative to, you know,
*  how relative to how trivial it is to, you know, for the grand science of training
*  the models.
*  So from the user side, the user experience of the updated Sonnet three, five is just
*  different than the previous, uh, June, 2024 Sonnet three, five.
*  It would be nice to come up with some kind of labeling that embodies that
*  because people talk about Sonnet three, five, but now there's a different one.
*  And so how do you refer to the previous one and the new one?
*  And it, it, uh, when there's a distinct improvement, it just makes
*  a conversation about it, uh, just challenging.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I definitely think this question of there are lots of properties of the models
*  that are not reflected in the benchmarks.
*  Um, I think, I think that's, that's definitely the case and everyone agrees.
*  And not all of them are capabilities.
*  Some of them are, you know, models can be polite or brusque.
*  They can be, uh, you know, uh, very reactive or they can ask you questions.
*  Um, they can have what, what feels like a warm personality or a cold personality.
*  They can be boring or they can be very distinctive like Golden Gate, Claude was.
*  Um, and we have a whole, you know, we have a whole team kind of focused on,
*  I think we call it Claude character.
*  Uh, Amanda leads that team and we'll, we'll talk to you about that, but it's
*  still a very inexact science.
*  Um, and, and often we find that models have properties that we're not aware of.
*  The fact of the matter is that you can, you know, talk to a model 10,000 times.
*  And there are some behaviors you might not see, uh, just like, just like with a
*  human, right?
*  I can know someone for a few months and, you know, not know that they have a
*  certain skill or not know that there's a certain side to them.
*  And so I think, I think we just have to get used to this idea.
*  And we're always looking for better ways of testing our models to, to demonstrate
*  these capabilities and, and, and also to decide which are, which are the, which
*  are the personality properties we want models to have in which we don't want to
*  have that itself.
*  The normative question is also super interesting.
*  I got to ask you a question from Reddit.
*  From Reddit.
*  Oh boy.
*  You know, there, there's just this fascinating to me, at least it's a
*  psychological social phenomenon where people report that Claude has gotten
*  dumber for them over time.
*  And so, uh, the question is, does the user complaint about the dumbing down of
*  Claude three, five sonnet hold any water?
*  So are these anecdotal reports a kind of social phenomena or did Claude, is
*  there any cases where Claude would get dumber?
*  So, uh, this actually doesn't apply.
*  This is, this isn't just about Claude.
*  I believe this, I believe I've seen these complaints for every foundation
*  model produced by a major company.
*  Um, people said this about GPT four.
*  They said it about GPT four turbo.
*  Um, so, so, so a couple things.
*  Um, one, the actual weights of the model, right?
*  The actual brain of the model that does not change unless we introduce a new model.
*  Um, there, there are just a number of reasons why it would not make sense
*  practically to be randomly substituting in, substituting in new versions of the
*  model is difficult from an inference perspective, and it's actually hard to
*  control all the consequences of changing the weights of the model.
*  Let's say you wanted to fine tune the model to be like, I don't know, to like,
*  to say certainly less, which, you know, an old version of Sonnet used to do, um,
*  you actually end up changing a hundred things as well.
*  So we have a whole process for it and we have a whole process for modifying the
*  model.
*  We do a bunch of testing on it.
*  We do a bunch of, um, like we do a bunch of user testing and early customers.
*  So it, we both have never changed the weights of the model without,
*  without telling anyone.
*  And it wouldn't, certainly in the current setup, it would not make sense to do that.
*  Now there are a couple of things that we do occasionally do.
*  Um, one is sometimes we run AB tests.
*  Um, but those are typically very close to when a model is being, is being, uh,
*  released and for a very small fraction of time.
*  Um, so, uh, you know, like the, you know, the, the day before the new Sonnet 3.5,
*  I agree, we should have had a better name.
*  It's clunky to refer to it.
*  Um, there were some comments from people that like, it's got, it's got, it's
*  gotten a lot better and that's because, you know, a fraction were exposed to, to
*  an AB test for, for those one or, for those one or two days.
*  Um, the other is that occasionally the system prompt will change.
*  Um, on the system prompt can have some effects, although it's, it's
*  unlikely to dumb down models.
*  It's unlikely to make them dumber.
*  Um, and, and, and, and we've seen that while these two things, which I'm
*  listing to be very complete, um, happened relatively, happened quite infrequently.
*  Um, the complaints about, for us and for other model companies about the model
*  change, the model isn't good at this.
*  The model got more censored.
*  The model was dumbed down.
*  Those complaints are constant.
*  And so I don't want to say like people are imagining these or anything, but
*  like the models are for the most part, not changing.
*  Um, if I were to offer a theory, um, I think it actually relates to one of the
*  things I said before, which is that.
*  Models have many are very complex and have many aspects to them.
*  And so often, you know, if I, if I, if I ask the model a question, you know, if
*  I'm like, if I'm like, do task acts versus can you do task acts, the model
*  might respond in different ways.
*  Uh, and, and so there are all kinds of subtle things that you can change about
*  the way you interact with the model that can give you very different results.
*  Um, to be clear, this, this itself is like a failing by, by us and by the
*  other model providers that the models are just, just often sensitive to like
*  small, small changes in word.
*  It's yet another way in which the science of how these models work is very
*  poorly developed.
*  Uh, and, and so, you know, if I go to sleep one night and I was like talking
*  to the model in a certain way, and I like slightly change the phrasing of how I
*  talk to the model, you know, I could, I could get different results.
*  So that's, that's one possible way.
*  The other thing is, man, it's just hard to quantify this stuff.
*  Uh, it's hard to quantify this stuff.
*  I think people are very excited by new models when they come out.
*  And then as time goes on, they, they become very aware of the, they become
*  very aware of the limitations.
*  So that may be another effect, but that's, that's all a very long-rendered way
*  of saying for the most part, with some fairly narrow exceptions, the
*  models are not changing.
*  I think there is a psychological effect.
*  You should start getting used to it.
*  The baseline raises, like when people have first gotten wifi on airplanes, it's
*  like amazing magic.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, and then you stuck them.
*  I can't get this thing to work.
*  This is such a piece of crap.
*  Exactly.
*  So then it's easy to have the conspiracy theory of they're making wifi slower and
*  slower.
*  This is probably something I'll talk to Amanda much more about, but, um, another
*  Reddit question, uh, when will Claude stop trying to be my, uh, puritanical
*  grandmother and posing its moral worldview on me as a paying customer?
*  And also what is the psychology behind making Claude overly apologetic?
*  So this kind of reports about the experience, a different angle on the
*  frustration has to do with the character.
*  Yeah.
*  So a couple of points on this first, one is, um, like things that people say on
*  Reddit and Twitter or extra, whatever it is, um, there's actually a huge
*  distribution shift between like the stuff that people complain loudly about on
*  social media and what actually kind of like, you know, statistically users care
*  about, and that drives people to use the models.
*  Like people are frustrated with, you know, things like, you know, the model, not
*  writing out all the code or the model, uh, you know, just, just not being as
*  good at code as it could be, even though it's the best model in the world on
*  code.
*  Um, I think the majority of things, of things are about that.
*  Um, uh, but, uh, certainly a, a, a kind of vocal minority are, uh, you know,
*  kind of, kind of, kind of raise these concerns, right?
*  Are frustrated by the model, refusing things that it shouldn't refuse or like
*  apologizing too much, or just, just having these kind of like annoying
*  verbal ticks.
*  Um, the second caveat, and I just want to say this like super clearly, because I
*  think it's like, some people don't know it.
*  Uh, others like kind of know it, but forget it.
*  Like it is very difficult to control across the board, how the models behave.
*  You cannot just reach in there and say, Oh, I want the model to like apologize
*  less.
*  Like you can do that.
*  You can include trading data that says like, Oh, the model should like apologize
*  less, but then in some other situation, they end up being like super rude or
*  like overconfident in a way that's like misleading people.
*  So there, there are all these trade-offs.
*  Um, uh, for example, another thing is if there was a period during which.
*  Models ours, and I think others as well were too verbose, right?
*  They would like repeat themselves.
*  They would say too much.
*  Um, you can cut down on the verbosity by penalizing the models for, for
*  just talking for too long.
*  What happens when you do that, if you do it in a crude way is when the models are
*  coding, sometimes they'll say rest of the code goes here, right?
*  Because they've learned that that's a way to economize and that they see it.
*  And then, and then, so that leads the model to be so-called lazy encoding,
*  where they, where they, where they're just like, ah, you can finish the rest of it.
*  It's not, it's not because we want to, you know, save on compute or because, you
*  know, the models are lazy and, you know, during winter break or any of the other
*  kind of conspiracy theories that have, that have, that have come up, it's
*  actually, it's just very hard to control the behavior of the model, to steer the
*  behavior of the model in all circumstances at once.
*  You can kind of, there's this, this whack-a-mole aspect where you push on one
*  thing and like, you know, these, these, these, you know, these other things start
*  to move as well that you may not even notice or measure.
*  And so one of the reasons that I, that I care so much about, uh, you know, kind
*  of grand alignment of these AI systems in the future is actually, these systems
*  are actually quite unpredictable.
*  They're actually quite hard to steer and control.
*  Um, and this version we're seeing today of you make one thing better.
*  It makes another thing worse.
*  Uh, I think that's, that's like a present day analog of future control problems
*  in AI systems that we can start to study today, right?
*  I think, I think that, that, that difficulty in, in steering the behavior
*  and in making sure that if we push an AI system in one direction, it doesn't push
*  it in another direction in some, in some other ways that we didn't want, uh, I
*  think that's, that's kind of an, that's kind of an early sign of things to come.
*  And if we can do a good job of solving this problem, right?
*  Of like, you asked the model to like, you know, to like make and distribute smallpox
*  and it says, no, but it's willing to like help you in your graduate level
*  virology class, like how do we get both of those things at once?
*  It's hard.
*  It's very easy to go to one side or the other, and it's a multi-dimensional problem.
*  And so, uh, I, you know, I think these questions of like shaping the
*  model's personality, I think they're very hard.
*  I think we haven't done perfectly on them.
*  I think we've actually done the best of all the AI companies, but still.
*  So far from perfect.
*  Uh, and I think if we can get this right, if we can control the, the, you know,
*  control the false positives and false negatives in this, this very kind of
*  controlled present day environment will be much better at doing it for the future.
*  When our worry is, you know, will the models be super autonomous?
*  Will they be able to, you know, make very dangerous things?
*  Will they be able to autonomously, you know, build whole companies
*  and are those companies aligned?
*  So, so I think of this, this present task as both vexing, but also
*  good practice for the future.
*  What's the current best way of gathering sort of user feedback?
*  Like, uh, not anecdotal data, but just large scale data about pain points or
*  the opposite of pain points, positive things, so on, is it internal testing?
*  Is it a specific group testing, AB testing?
*  What works?
*  So, so typically, um, we'll have internal model bashings where all of
*  Anthropic, Anthropic is almost a thousand people.
*  Um, you know, people just, just try and break the model.
*  They try and interact with it various ways.
*  Um, uh, we have a suite of evals, uh, for, you know, oh, is the model refusing
*  in ways that it couldn't, I think we even had a certainly eval because, you know,
*  our, our, again, one point model had this problem where like it had this annoying
*  tick where it would like respond to a wide range of questions by saying,
*  certainly I can help you with that.
*  Certainly I would be happy to do that.
*  Certainly this is correct.
*  Um, uh, and so we had a, like, certainly eval, which is like, how, how often does
*  the model say certainly, uh, uh, but, but look, this is just a whack-a-mole.
*  Like, like what if it switches from certainly to definitely like, uh, uh, so.
*  You know, every time we add a new eval and we're, we're always evaluating
*  for all the old things, so we have hundreds of these evaluations, but we
*  find that there's no substitute for human interacting with it.
*  And so it's very much like the ordinary product development process.
*  We have like hundreds of people within Anthropic bash the model.
*  Then we do, uh, you know, then we do external AB tests.
*  Sometimes we'll run tests with contractors.
*  We pay contractors to interact with the model.
*  Um, so you put all of these things together and it's still not perfect.
*  You still see behaviors that you don't quite want to see, right?
*  You know, you see, you still see the model, like refusing things that it
*  just doesn't make sense to refuse.
*  Um, but I, I, I think trying to, trying to solve this challenge, right?
*  Trying to stop the model from doing, you know, genuinely bad things that, you
*  know, know what everyone agrees it shouldn't do, right?
*  You know, everyone, everyone, you know, everyone agrees that, you know, the
*  model shouldn't talk about, you know, I don't know, child abuse material, right?
*  Like everyone agrees the model shouldn't do that.
*  Uh, but, but at the same time that it doesn't refuse in these dumb and stupid
*  ways, uh, I think, I think draw it, drawing that line as finally as possible, approaching
*  perfectly is still, is still a challenge and we're getting better at it every day.
*  But there's, there's a lot to be solved.
*  And again, I would point to that as, as an indicator of a challenge ahead in
*  terms of steering much more powerful models.
*  Do you think Claude 4.0 is ever coming out?
*  I don't want to commit to any naming scheme.
*  Cause if I say, if I say here, we're going to have Claude for next year.
*  And then, you know, then we decide that like, you know, we should start over
*  cause there's a new type of model.
*  Like I, I, I don't want to, I don't want to commit to it.
*  I would expect in a normal course of business that Claude 4 would come after
*  Claude 3.5, but, but you know, you never know in this wacky field, right?
*  But the sort of this idea of scaling is continuing.
*  Scale scaling is continuing.
*  There, there will definitely be more powerful models coming from us
*  than the models that exist today.
*  That is, that is certain.
*  Or if there, if there aren't, we've, we've deeply failed as a company.
*  Okay.
*  Can you explain the responsible scaling policy and the AI safety level
*  standards, ASA levels?
*  As much as I'm excited about the benefits of these models.
*  And we know we'll talk about that.
*  If we talk about machines of loving grace, I'm, I'm worried about the
*  risks and I continue to be worried about the risks.
*  No one should think that, you know, machines of loving grace was me, me
*  saying, you know, I'm no longer worried about the risks of these models.
*  I think they're two sides of the same coin.
*  The, the power of the models and their ability to solve all these problems
*  in, you know, biology, neuroscience, economic development, government,
*  governance and peace, large parts of the economy, those, those come with
*  risks as well, right?
*  With great power comes great responsibility, right?
*  That's the, the two are, the two are paired.
*  Things that are powerful can do good things and they can do bad things.
*  I think of those risks as, as being in, you know, several different,
*  different categories, perhaps the two biggest risks that I think about.
*  And that's not to say that there aren't risks today that are, that are important.
*  But when I think of the really the, you know, the things that would happen on
*  the grandest scale, one is what I call catastrophic misuse.
*  These are misuse of the models in domains like cyber, bio, radiological
*  nuclear, right?
*  Things that could, you know, that could harm or even kill thousands, even
*  millions of people, if they really, really go wrong, like these are the
*  number one priority to prevent.
*  And, and here I would just make a simple observation, which is that.
*  The models, you know, if, if I look today at people who have done really bad
*  things in the world, I think actually humanity has been protected by the fact
*  that the overlap between really smart, well-educated people and people who want
*  to do really horrific things has generally been small, like, you know,
*  let's say, let's say I'm someone who, you know, I, you know, I have a PhD in this
*  field, I have a well-paying job.
*  Um, there's so much to lose.
*  Why do I want to like, you know, even, even assuming I'm completely evil, which,
*  which most people are not, um, why, why, you know, why would such a person risk
*  their risk, their, you know, risk their life, risk their, their legacy, their
*  reputation to, to do something like, you know, truly, truly evil, if we had a lot
*  more people like that, the world would be a much more dangerous place.
*  And so my, my, my worry is that by being a much more intelligent agent, AI
*  could break that correlation.
*  And so I, I, I do have serious worries about that.
*  I believe we can prevent those worries.
*  Uh, but you know, I think as a counterpoint to machines of loving grace,
*  I want to say that this is, that there's still serious risks.
*  And, and the second range of risks would be the autonomy risks, which is the idea
*  that models might on their own, particularly as we give them more agency
*  than they've had in the past, uh, particularly as we give them supervision
*  over wider tasks, like, you know, writing whole code bases or someday even, you
*  know, effectively operating an entire, entire companies, they're on a long
*  enough leash, are they, are they doing what we really want them to do?
*  It's very difficult to even understand in detail what they're doing, let
*  alone, let alone control it.
*  And like I said, this, these early signs that it's, it's hard to perfectly
*  draw the boundary between things the model should do and things the model
*  shouldn't do that, that, you know, if you go to one side, you get things that
*  are annoying and useless and you go to the other side, you get other behaviors.
*  If you fix one thing, it creates other problems.
*  We're getting better and better at solving this.
*  I don't think this is an unsolvable problem.
*  I think this is a, you know, this is a science like, like the safety of airplanes
*  or the safety of cars or the safety of drugs.
*  I, you know, I don't think there's any big thing we're missing.
*  I just think we need to get better at controlling these models.
*  And so these are, these are the two risks I'm worried about.
*  And our responsible scaling plan, which I'll recognize as a very long-winded
*  answer to your question, our responsible scaling plan is designed to address
*  these two types of risks.
*  And so every time we develop a new model, we basically test it for its ability to
*  do both of these bad things.
*  So if I were to back up a little bit, I think we have, I think we have an
*  interesting dilemma with AI systems where they're not yet powerful enough
*  to present these catastrophes.
*  I don't know that, I don't know that they'll ever present, prevent these
*  catastrophes, it's possible they won't, but the, the case for worry, the case
*  for risk is strong enough that we should, we should act now and, and they're,
*  they're getting better very, very fast.
*  Right.
*  I, you know, I testified in the Senate that, you know, we might have serious
*  bio risks within two to three years.
*  That was about a year ago.
*  Things have proceeded, proceeded a pace.
*  Uh, uh, so we have this thing where it's like, it's, it's, it's surprisingly hard
*  to, to address these risks because they're not here today, they don't exist.
*  They're like ghosts, but they're coming at us so fast because the
*  models are improving so fast.
*  So how do you deal with something that's not here today, doesn't exist, but is,
*  is coming at us very fast.
*  Uh, so the solution we came up with for that in, in collaboration with, uh, you
*  know, people like, uh, the organization meter and Paul Cristiano is okay.
*  What, what, what you need for that are you need tests to tell you when
*  the risk is getting close, you need an early warning system.
*  And, and so every time we have a new model, we test it for its capability
*  to do these CBRN tasks, as well as testing it for, you know, how capable
*  it is of doing tasks autonomously on its own.
*  And, uh, in the latest version of our RSP, which we released in the
*  last, in the last month or two, uh, the way we test autonomy risks is the
*  model, the AI models ability to do.
*  Aspects of AI research itself, uh, which when the model, when the AI models can do
*  AI research, they become kind of truly, truly autonomous on that.
*  You know, that threshold is important for a bunch of other ways.
*  And, and so what do we then do with these tests?
*  The RSP basically develops what we've called an if then structure, which is
*  if the models pass a certain capability, then we impose a certain set of safety
*  and security requirements on them.
*  So today's models are what's called ASL two models that were a ASL one is for
*  systems that manifestly don't pose any risk of autonomy or misuse.
*  So for example, a chess playing bot deep blue would be ASL one.
*  It's just manifestly the case that you can't use deep blue
*  for anything other than chess.
*  It was just designed for chess.
*  No one's going to use it to like, you know, to conduct a masterful cyber
*  attack or to, you know, run wild and take over the world.
*  ASL two is today's AI systems where we've measured them.
*  And we think these systems are simply not smart enough to, to, you know,
*  autonomously self replicate or conduct a bunch of tasks and also not smart
*  enough to provide meaningful information about CBRN risks and how to build CBRN
*  weapons above and beyond what can be known from looking at Google.
*  In fact, sometimes they do provide information, but, but not above and
*  beyond a search engine, but not in a way that can be stitched together.
*  Um, not, not in a way that kind of end to end is dangerous enough.
*  So ASL three is going to be the point at which, uh, the models are helpful
*  enough to enhance the capabilities of non-state actors, right?
*  State actors can already do a lot, a lot of, unfortunately to a high level
*  of proficiency, a lot of these very dangerous and destructive things.
*  The difference is that non-state, non-state actors are not capable of it.
*  And so when we get to ASL three, we'll take special security precautions
*  designed to be sufficient to prevent theft of the model by non-state actors
*  and misuse of the model as it's deployed.
*  Uh, we'll have to have enhanced filters targeted at these particular areas.
*  Cyber bio nuclear, cyber bio nuclear and model autonomy, which is less a misuse
*  risk and more risk of the model doing bad things itself.
*  ASL four getting to the point where these models could, it could enhance
*  the capability of a, of a, of a already knowledgeable state actor and, or become
*  the, you know, the main source of such a risk.
*  Like if you wanted to engage in such a risk, the main way you would do it is
*  through a model.
*  And then I think ASL four on the autonomy side, it's, it's some, some, some amount
*  of acceleration in AI research capabilities with an, with an AI model.
*  And then ASL five is where we would get to the models that are, you know, that are,
*  that are kind of, that are kind of, you know, truly capable that it could exceed
*  humanity in their ability to do, to do any of these tasks.
*  And so the, the, the point of the, if then structure commitment is, is basically
*  to say, look, I don't know, I've been, I've been working with these models for many
*  years and I've been worried about risk for many years.
*  It's actually kind of dangerous to cry wolf.
*  It's actually kind of dangerous to say this, that, you know, this, this model is,
*  this model is risky and you know, people look at it and they say, this is
*  manifestly not dangerous again.
*  It's, it's, it's the, the delicacy of the risk isn't here today, but it's coming
*  at us fast.
*  How do you deal with that?
*  It's, it's really vexing to a risk planner to deal with it.
*  And so this, if then structure basically says, look, we don't want to antagonize a
*  bunch of people.
*  We don't want to harm our own, you know, our, our, our kind of own ability to have
*  a place in the conversation by imposing these, these very honoris burdens on
*  models that are not dangerous today.
*  So the, if then the trigger commitment is basically a way to deal with this.
*  It says you clamp down hard when you can show that the model is dangerous.
*  And of course, what has to come with that is, you know, enough of a buffer
*  threshold that you know, you can, you can, you know, you're, you're, you're,
*  you're not at high risk of kind of missing the danger.
*  It's not a perfect framework.
*  We've had to change it every, every, you know, we came out with a new one just a
*  few weeks ago and probably, probably going forward, we might release new ones
*  multiple times a year because it's, it's hard to get these policies right.
*  Like technically, organizationally from a research perspective, but that is the
*  proposal if then commitments and triggers in order to minimize burdens
*  and false alarms now, but really react appropriately when the dangers are here.
*  What do you think the timeline for ASL three is where several of the triggers
*  are fired and what do you think the timeline is for ASL four?
*  Yeah.
*  So that is hotly debated within the company.
*  Um, uh, we are working actively to prepare ASL three, uh, security, uh,
*  security measures as well as ASL three deployment measures.
*  Um, I'm not going to go into detail, but we've made, we've made a lot of progress
*  on both and you know, we're, we're prepared to be, I think, ready quite soon.
*  Uh, I would, I would not be surprised.
*  I would not be surprised at all if we hit ASL three, uh, next year, there was some
*  concern that we might even hit it, uh, this year, that's still, that's still possible.
*  That could still happen.
*  It's like very hard to say, but like, I would be very, very surprised if it was
*  like 2030, uh, I think it's much sooner than that.
*  So there's a protocols for detecting it, the if then, and then there's protocols
*  for how to respond to it.
*  Yes.
*  How difficult is the second, the latter?
*  Yeah, I think for ASL three, it's primarily about security.
*  Um, and, and about, you know, filters on the model relating to a very narrow set
*  of areas when we deploy the model, because at ASL three, the model isn't autonomous yet.
*  Um, uh, and, and so you don't have to worry about, you know, kind of the model itself
*  behaving in a bad way, even when it's deployed internally.
*  So I think the ASL three measures are, are, I won't say straightforward.
*  They're, they're, they're, they're rigorous, but they're easier to reason about.
*  I think once we get to ASL four, um, we start to have worries about the models
*  being smart enough that they might sandbag tests.
*  They might not tell the truth about tests.
*  Um, we had some results came out about like sleeper agents and there was a more recent
*  paper about, you know, can, can the models, uh, mislead attempts to, you know,
*  sandbag their own abilities, right?
*  Show them, you know, uh, uh, present themselves as being less capable than they are.
*  And so I think with ASL four, there's going to be an important component of using other
*  things than just interacting with the models.
*  For example, interpretability or hidden chains of thought, uh, where you have to
*  look inside the model and verify via some other mechanism that, that is not, you know,
*  is not as easily corrupted as what the model says, uh, that, that, you know, that, that,
*  that the model indeed has some property.
*  Uh, so we're still working on ASL four.
*  One of the properties of the RSP is that we, we don't specify ASL four until we've hit
*  ASL three and I think that's proven to be a wise decision because even with ASL three,
*  it, again, it's hard to know this stuff in detail.
*  And, and it, it, we want to take as much time as we can possibly take to get these things right.
*  So for ASL three, the bad actor will be humans.
*  Humans.
*  Yes.
*  And so there's a little bit more, um, for ASL four, it's both, I think it's both.
*  And so deception and that's where mechanistic interpretability comes into play.
*  And hopefully the techniques used for that are not made accessible to the model.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, of course you can hook up the mechanistic interpretability to the model itself.
*  Um, but then you've, then you, then you, then you've kind of lost it as a reliable
*  indicator of, uh, of, uh, of, of, of the model state.
*  There are a bunch of exotic ways you can think of that.
*  It might also not be reliable.
*  Like if the, you know, model gets smart enough that it can like, you know, jump
*  computers and like read the code where you're like looking at its internal state.
*  We've thought about some of those.
*  I think they're exotic enough.
*  There are ways to render them unlikely, but yeah, generally you want to, you want to
*  preserve mechanistic interpretability as a kind of verification set or test set
*  that's separate from the training process of the model.
*  See, I think, uh, as these models become better and better conversation and become
*  smarter, social engineer becomes a threat too, cause they think that could start
*  being very convincing to the engineers inside companies.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's actually like, you know, we've, we've seen lots of examples of demagoguery in
*  our life from humans and, and, you know, there's a concern that models could do
*  that, could do that as well.
*  One of the ways that cloud has been getting more and more powerful is it's
*  now able to do some agentic stuff.
*  Um, computer use, uh, there's also an analysis within the sandbox of Claude.ai
*  itself, but let's talk about computer use.
*  That's seems to me super exciting that you can just give Claude a task and it,
*  uh, it takes a bunch of actions, figures it out and is access to the, your
*  computer through screenshots.
*  So can you explain how that works?
*  Uh, and where that's headed.
*  Yeah, it's actually relatively simple.
*  So Claude has, has had for a long time since, since Claude three back in March,
*  the ability to analyze images and respond to them with text.
*  The, the only new thing we added is those images can be screenshots of a computer.
*  And in response, we train the model to give a location on the screen where you
*  can click and or buttons on the keyboard, you can press in order to take action.
*  And it turns out that with actually not all that much additional training, the
*  models can get quite good at that task.
*  It's a good example of generalization.
*  Um, you know, people sometimes say, if you get to lower Thorbit, you're like
*  halfway to anywhere, right?
*  Because of how much it takes to escape the gravity.
*  Well, if you have a strong pre-trained model, I feel like you're halfway to
*  anywhere, uh, in terms of, in terms of the intelligence space, uh, uh, uh, and,
*  and, and so actually it didn't, it didn't take all that much to get, to get
*  Claude to do this.
*  And you can just set that in a loop, give the model a screenshot, tell
*  it what to click on, give it the next screenshot, tell it what to click on.
*  And that turns into a full kind of almost, almost 3d video interaction of the model.
*  And it's able to do all of these tasks, right?
*  You know, we, we showed these demos where it's able to like fill out spreadsheets.
*  It's able to kind of like interact with a website.
*  It's able to, you know, um, you know, it's able to open all kinds of, you know,
*  programs and different operating systems, windows, Linux, Mac.
*  Uh, uh, so, uh, you know, I think all of that is very exciting.
*  I will say while in theory, there's nothing you could do there that you
*  couldn't have done through just giving the model, the API to drive the computer
*  screen, uh, this really lowers the barrier.
*  And you know, there's, there's, there's a lot of folks who, who, who either, you
*  know, kind of, kind of aren't, aren't, aren't in a position to, to interact with
*  those APIs or it takes them a long time to do, it's just the screen is just a
*  universal interface.
*  That's a lot easier to interact with.
*  And so I expect over time, this is going to lower a bunch of barriers.
*  Now, honestly, the current model has, there's, there, it leaves a lot still to
*  be desired and we were, we were honest about that in the blog, right?
*  It makes mistakes, it miss clicks.
*  And we, we, you know, we were careful to warn people, Hey, this thing isn't, you
*  can't just leave this thing to, you know, run on your computer for minutes and
*  minutes, um, you got to give this thing boundaries and guardrails.
*  And I think that's one of the reasons we released it first in an API form, rather
*  than kind of, you know, this, this kind of just, just hand, just hand to the
*  consumer and, and give it control of their, of their, of their, of their computer.
*  Um, but, but, you know, I definitely feel that it's important to get these
*  capabilities out there as models get more powerful, we're going to have to
*  grapple with, you know, how do we use these capabilities safely?
*  How do we prevent them from being abused?
*  Uh, and, and, you know, I think, I think releasing, releasing the model while,
*  while the capabilities are, are, you know, are, are still, are still limited is, is,
*  is very helpful in terms of, in terms of doing that.
*  Um, you know, I think since it's been released, uh, number of customers, I
*  think, uh, Replet was maybe, was maybe one of the, the, the most, uh, quickest,
*  quickest, quickest, uh, quickest to deploy things, um, have, have, you know,
*  have made use of it in various ways.
*  People have hooked up demos for, you know, windows, desktops, Macs, uh, uh,
*  you know, Linux, Linux machines.
*  Uh, so yeah, it's been, it's been, it's been very exciting.
*  I think as with, as with anything else, you know, it, it, it comes with new
*  exciting abilities and then, then, you know, then, then with those new exciting
*  abilities, we have to think about how to, how to, you know, make the model, you
*  know, safe, reliable, do what humans want them to do.
*  I mean, it's the same, it's the same story for everything, right?
*  Same thing.
*  It's that same tension.
*  But, but the possibility of use cases here is just the, the range is incredible.
*  So, uh, how much to make it work really well in the future, how much do you have
*  to specially kind of, uh, go beyond what's the pre-trained models doing, do
*  more post-training RLHF or supervised fine tuning or synthetic data just for
*  the agent?
*  Yeah.
*  I think speaking at a high level, it's our intention to keep investing a lot
*  in, you know, making, making the model better.
*  Uh, like I think, I think, uh, you know, we look at, look at some of the, you
*  know, some of the benchmarks where previous models were like, oh, I could do
*  it 6% of the time and now our model would do it 14 or 22% of the time.
*  And yeah, we want to get up to, you know, the human level reliability of 80, 90%
*  just like anywhere else, right?
*  We're on the same curve that we were on with Sweebench where I think I would
*  guess a year from now, the models can do this very, very reliably, but you
*  got to start somewhere.
*  So you think it's possible to get to the human level, 90% basically doing the
*  same thing you're doing now, or is it has to be special for computer use?
*  I mean, uh, it depends what you mean by, by, you know, special and
*  special in general.
*  Um, but, but, you know, I, I generally think, you know, the same kinds of
*  techniques that we've been using to train the current model, I expect that
*  doubling down on those techniques in the same way that we have for code, for
*  code, for models in general, for other kit, for, you know, for image input,
*  um, uh, you know, for voice, uh, I expect those same techniques will scale here
*  as they have everywhere else.
*  But this is giving sort of the power of action to Claude.
*  And so you could do a lot of really powerful things, but you could do
*  a lot of damage also.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  And we've been very aware of that.
*  Look, my, my view actually is computer use isn't a fundamentally new
*  capability like the CBRN or autonomy capabilities are, um, it's more like it
*  kind of opens the aperture for the model to use and apply its existing abilities.
*  Uh, and, and so the way we think about it, going back to our RSP is nothing
*  that this model is doing inherently increases, you know, the risk from an
*  RSP, RSP perspective, but as the models get more powerful, having this capability
*  may make it scarier once it, you know, once it has the cognitive capability
*  to, um, you know, to do something at the ASL three and ASL four level, this,
*  this, you know, this may be the thing that kind of unbounds it from doing so.
*  So going forward, certainly this modality of interaction is something we have
*  tested for and that we will continue to test for an RSP going forward.
*  Um, I think it's probably better to have, to learn and explore this capability
*  before the model is super, uh, you know, super capable.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's a lot of interesting attacks like prompt injection, because now you've
*  widened the aperture so you can prompt inject through stuff on screen.
*  So if this becomes more and more useful, then there's more and more benefit to
*  inject, inject stuff into the model.
*  If it goes to a certain web page, it could be harmless stuff like advertisements
*  or it could be like harmful stuff.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, we've thought a lot about things like spam, capture, you know, mass
*  camp, there's all, you know, every, every, like if one secret, I'll tell you, if
*  you've invented a new technology, not necessarily the biggest misuse, but, but
*  the first misuse you'll see scams, just petty scams.
*  Like you'll just, just, just, it's, it's like, it's like a thing as old people
*  scamming each other.
*  It's, it's this, it's this thing as old as time.
*  Um, and, and, and it's just every time you got to deal with it.
*  It's almost like silly to say, but it's true sort of bots and spam in general is
*  a thing as it gets more and more intelligent.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a, it's just, there are a lot of, like, like I said, like there are a lot
*  of petty criminals in the world.
*  And, and, and, you know, it's like every new technology is like a new way for
*  petty petty criminals to do something, you know, something stupid and malicious.
*  Uh, is there any ideas about sandboxing it?
*  Like how difficult is the sandboxing task?
*  Yeah, we sandbox during training.
*  So for example, during training, we didn't expose the model to the internet.
*  Um, I think that's probably a bad idea during training because, uh, you know,
*  the model can be changing its policy.
*  It can be changing what it's doing and it's having an effect in the real world.
*  Um, uh, you know, in, in terms of actually deploying the model, right.
*  It kind of depends on the application.
*  Like, you know, sometimes you want the model to do something in the real world,
*  but of course you can always put guard, you can always put guard
*  rails on the outside, right?
*  You can say, okay, well, you know, this model is not going to move data from
*  my, you know, model is not going to move any files from my computer or my
*  web server to anywhere else.
*  Now, when you talk about sandboxing, again, when we get to ASL four, none of
*  these precautions are going to make sense there, right?
*  Where when you, when you talk about ASL four, you're then the model is being
*  kind of, you know, there's a theoretical worry, the model could be smart enough
*  to break it, to, to kind of break out of any box.
*  And so there we need to think about mechanistic interpretability about, you
*  know, if we're, if we're going to have a sandbox, it would need to be a
*  mathematically provable sound, but you know, that's, that's a whole different
*  world than what we're dealing with with the models today.
*  Yeah.
*  The science of building a box from which, uh, ASL four AI system cannot escape.
*  I think it's probably not the right approach.
*  I think the right approach, instead of having something, you know, unaligned
*  that, that like, you're trying to prevent it from escaping, I think it's, it's
*  better to just design the model the right way or have a loop where you, you
*  know, you look inside, you look inside the model and you're able to verify
*  properties and that gives you a, an opportunity to like iterate and actually
*  get it right.
*  I think, I think containing, uh, containing bad models is, is, is much
*  worse solution than having good models.
*  Let me ask about regulation.
*  What's the role of regulation in keeping AI safe?
*  So for example, can you describe California AI regulation bill SB 1047
*  that was ultimately vetoed by the governor?
*  What are the pros and cons of this bill?
*  Yeah, we ended up making some suggestions to the bill and then some of those were
*  adopted and you know, we felt, I think, I think quite positive about it.
*  We felt, I think, I think quite positively, uh, uh, quite positively
*  about, about the bill, uh, by, by the end of that, um, it did still have some
*  downsides, um, uh, and you know, of course, of course it got vetoed.
*  Um, I think at a high level, I think some of the key ideas behind the bill, um, are,
*  you know, I would say similar to ideas behind our RSPs.
*  And I think it's very important that some jurisdiction, whether it's California or
*  the federal government and, or other, other countries and other states passes
*  some regulation like this, and I can talk through why I think that's so important.
*  So I feel good about our RSP.
*  It's not perfect.
*  It needs to be iterated on a lot, but it's been a good forcing function for
*  getting the company to take these risks seriously, to put them into product
*  planning, to really make them a central part of work at Anthropic and to make
*  sure that all the thousand people, and it's almost a thousand people now at
*  Anthropic understand that this is one of the highest priorities of the company.
*  If not the highest priority.
*  Uh, but one, there are still some companies that don't have RSP like
*  mechanisms like open AI, Google, uh, did adopt these mechanisms a couple
*  months after, uh, after Anthropic did.
*  Uh, but there are, there are other companies out there that don't have
*  these mechanisms at all.
*  Uh, and so if some companies adopt these mechanisms and others don't, uh, it's
*  really going to create a situation where, you know, some of these dangers have the
*  property that it doesn't matter if three out of five of the companies are being
*  safe, if the other two are, are being, are being unsafe, it creates this
*  negative externality and, and I think the lack of uniformity is not fair to
*  those of us who have put a lot of effort into being very thoughtful about these
*  procedures.
*  The second thing is I don't think you can trust these companies to adhere to
*  these voluntary plans in their own.
*  Right.
*  I like to think that Anthropic will, we do everything we can that we will.
*  Our, our, our, our RSP is checked by our long-term benefit trust.
*  Uh, so, you know, we do everything we can to, to, to adhere to our own RSP.
*  Um, but you know, you hear lots of things about various companies saying,
*  oh, they said they would do, they said they would give this much compute and
*  they didn't, they said they would do this thing and they didn't.
*  Um, you know, I don't, I don't think it makes sense to, you know, to, to, to,
*  you know, litigate particular things that companies have done, but I think this,
*  this broad principle that like, if there's nothing watching over them, there's
*  nothing watching over us as an industry, there's no guarantee that we'll do the
*  right thing and the stakes are very high.
*  Uh, and so I think it's, I think it's important to have a uniform standard
*  that, that, that, that, that everyone follows and to make sure that simply that
*  the industry does what a majority of the industry has already said is important
*  and has already said that they definitely will do right.
*  Some people, uh, you know, I think there's, there's a class of people who are.
*  Against regulation on principle.
*  I understand where that comes from.
*  If you go to Europe and you know, you see something like GDPR, you see some of the
*  other stuff that, that, that, that, that, that they've done, you know, some of it's
*  good, but, but some of it is really unnecessarily burdensome.
*  And I think it's fair to say really has slowed, really has slowed innovation.
*  And so I understand where people are coming from on priors.
*  I understand why people come from, start from that, start from that position.
*  Uh, but, but again, I think AI is different.
*  If we go to the very serious risks of autonomy and misuse that, that, that I
*  talked about, you know, just, uh, just a few minutes ago, I think that those are
*  unusual and they weren't an unusually strong response.
*  Uh, and so I think it's very important.
*  Again, um, we need something that everyone can get behind.
*  Uh, you know, I think one of the issues with SB 10 47, uh, especially the original
*  version of it was it, it had a bunch of the structure of RSPs, but it also had a
*  bunch of stuff that was either clunky or that, that, that just would have created
*  a bunch of burdens, a bunch of hassle and might even have missed the target in
*  terms of addressing the risks.
*  Um, you don't really hear about it on Twitter.
*  You just hear about kind of, you know, people are, people are cheering for any
*  regulation and then the folks who are against make up these often quite
*  intellectually dishonest arguments about how, you know, it, you know, it'll make
*  us move away from California.
*  Bill, Bill doesn't apply if you're headquartered in California.
*  Bill only applies if you do business in California, um, or that it would damage
*  the open source ecosystem or that it would, you know, it would cause, cause all
*  of these things.
*  I, I think those were mostly nonsense, but there are better arguments against
*  regulation.
*  There's one guy, uh, Dean Ball, who's really, you know, I think a very
*  scholarly, scholarly analyst who looks at what happens when a regulation is put in
*  place in ways that they can kind of get a life of their own or how they can be
*  poorly designed.
*  And so our interest has always been, we do think there should be regulation in
*  this space, but we want to be an actor who makes sure that, that, that, that
*  regulation is something that's surgical, that's targeted at the serious risks.
*  And it's something people can actually comply with because something I think the
*  advocates of regulation don't understand as well as they could is if we get
*  something in place that is, um, that's poorly targeted, that wastes a bunch of
*  people's time, what's going to happen is people are going to say, see these
*  safety risks there.
*  You know, this is, this is nonsense.
*  I just, you know, I just had to hire 10 lawyers to, to, you know, to fill out all
*  these forums.
*  I had to run all of these tests for something that was clearly not dangerous.
*  And after six months of that, there'll be, there'll be a ground swell and we'll,
*  we'll, we'll, we'll end up with a durable consensus against regulation.
*  And so the, I think the, the worst enemy of those who want real accountability
*  is badly designed regulation.
*  Um, we, we need to actually get it right.
*  Uh, and, and this is, if there's one thing I could say to the advocates, it
*  would be that I want them to understand this dynamic better and we need to be
*  really careful and we need to talk to people who actually have, who actually
*  have experience seeing how regulations play out in practice and, and the people
*  who have seen that understand to be very careful, if this was some lesser issue,
*  I might be against regulation at all.
*  But what I want the opponents to understand is, is that the underlying
*  issues are actually serious.
*  They're, they're not, they're not something that I or the other companies
*  are just making up because of regulatory capture.
*  They're not sci-fi fantasies.
*  They're not, they're not any of these things.
*  Um, you know, every, every time we have a new model, every few months, we measure
*  the behavior of these models and they're getting better and better at these
*  concerning tasks, just as they are getting better and better at, um, you know,
*  good, valuable, economically useful tasks.
*  And so I, I would just love it if some of the former, you know, I think
*  SB 1047 was very polarizing.
*  I would love it if some of the most reasonable opponents and some of the
*  most reasonable, um, uh, proponents, uh, would sit down together and, you know,
*  I think, I think that, you know, the different, the different AI companies,
*  um, you know, Anthropic was the only AI company that, you know, felt positively
*  in a very detailed way.
*  I think Elon tweeted, uh, tweeted briefly something positive, but you know, some
*  of the, some of the big ones like Google, open AI, Meta, Microsoft were,
*  were pretty staunch staunchly against.
*  So I would really like is if, if, you know, some of the key stakeholders, some
*  of the, you know, most thoughtful proponents and, and some of the most
*  thoughtful opponents would sit down and say, how do we solve this problem in,
*  in a way that the proponents feel brings a real reduction in risk and that the
*  opponents feel that it is not, it is not hampering the, the industry or hampering
*  innovation any more necessary than it, than it, than it, than it needs to.
*  And I think for, for whatever reason that things got too polarized and those two
*  groups didn't get to sit down in the way that they should, uh, and, and I feel,
*  I feel urgency.
*  I really think we need to do something in 2025.
*  Uh, uh, you know, if we get to the end of 2025 and we've still done nothing
*  about this, then I'm going to be worried.
*  I'm not, I'm not worried yet because again, the risks aren't here yet, but,
*  but I think time is running short.
*  Yeah.
*  And come up with something surgical, like you said.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And we need to get, we need to get away from this, this, this intense pro safety
*  versus intense anti-regulatory rhetoric, right?
*  It's turned into these, these flame wars on Twitter and nothing good is going to
*  come of that.
*  So there's a lot of curiosity about the different players in the game.
*  One of the OGs is open AI.
*  You've had several years of experience at open AI.
*  What's your story in history there?
*  Yeah.
*  So I was at open AI for, uh, for roughly five years, uh, for the last, I think
*  it was a couple of years, you know, I, I, I, I was a vice president of research
*  there, um, probably myself and Ilya suits giver were the ones who, you know, really
*  kind of set the, set the research direction around 2016 or 2017.
*  I first started to really believe in, or at least confirm my belief in the scaling
*  hypothesis when, when Ilya famously said to me, the thing you need to understand
*  about these models is they just want to learn the models, just want to learn.
*  Um, and, and, and again, sometimes there are these one sentence, there are these
*  one sentences, these Zen cones that you hear them and you're like, ah, that, that
*  explains everything that explains like a thousand things that I've seen.
*  And then, and then I, I, I, you know, ever after I had this visualization in my head
*  of like, you optimize the models in the right way, you point the models in the
*  right way, they just want to learn.
*  They just want to solve the problem, regardless of what the problem is.
*  So get out of their way, basically get out of their way.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't impose your own ideas about how they should learn.
*  Or, and you know, this was the same thing as Rich Sutton put out in the bitter
*  lesson or Gern put out in the scaling hypothesis.
*  You know, I think generally the dynamic was, you know, I got, I got this kind of
*  inspiration from, uh, from, from, from, from Ilya and from others, and I think
*  from, from, from Ilya and from others, folks like Alec Radford, who did the,
*  the original, uh, GPT-1, uh, and then, uh, ran really hard with it.
*  Me, me and my collaborators on GPT-2, GPT-3, RL from human feedback, which was
*  an attempt to kind of deal with the early safety and durability, things like
*  debate and amplification, heavy on interpretability.
*  So again, the combination of safety plus scaling, probably 2018, 2019, 2020.
*  Those, those were, those were kind of the years when myself and my collaborators,
*  probably, um, you know, mo, mo, many, many of whom became co-founders of
*  Anthropic kind of really had, had, had a vision and like, and like drove the direction.
*  Why'd you leave?
*  Why'd you decide to leave?
*  Yeah.
*  So look, I'm going to put things this way.
*  And I, you know, I think it, I think it ties to the, to the, to the race to the
*  top, right, which is, you know, in my time at open AI, what I'd come to see as I'd
*  come to appreciate the scaling hypothesis.
*  And as I come to appreciate kind of the importance of safety along with the
*  scaling hypothesis, the first one, I think, you know, open AI was, was getting,
*  was getting on board with, um, the second one in a way had always been part of,
*  of open AI's messaging.
*  Um, but, uh, you know, over, over many years of, of the time, the time that I
*  spent there, I think I had a particular vision of how these, how we should handle
*  these things, how we should be brought out in the world, the kind of principles
*  that the organization should have.
*  And look, I mean, there were like many, many discussions about like, you know,
*  should the org do, should the company do this?
*  Should the company do that?
*  Like there's a bunch of misinformation out there.
*  People say like, we left because we didn't like the deal with Microsoft.
*  False.
*  Although, you know, it was like a lot of discussion, a lot of questions about
*  exactly how we do the deal with Microsoft.
*  Um, we left because we didn't like commercialization.
*  That's not true.
*  We built GPT-3, which was the model that was commercialized.
*  I was involved in commercialization.
*  It's, it's more again about how do you do it?
*  Like civilization is going down this path to very powerful AI.
*  What's the way to do it that is cautious, straightforward, honest, um, that builds
*  trust in the organization and in individuals, how do we get from here to there?
*  And how do we have a real vision for how to get it right?
*  How can safety not just be something we say because it helps with recruiting?
*  Um, and you know, I think, I think at the end of the day, um, if you have a vision
*  for that, forget about anyone else's vision, I don't want to talk about
*  anyone else's vision, if you have a vision for how to do it, you should go off
*  and you should do that vision.
*  It is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone else's vision.
*  You might think they're not doing it the right way.
*  You might think they're, they're, they're dishonest.
*  Who knows?
*  Maybe you're right.
*  Maybe you're not.
*  Um, uh, but, uh, what, what you should do is you should take some people you trust
*  and you should go off together and you should make your vision happen.
*  And if your vision is compelling, if you can make it appeal to people, some, you
*  know, some combination of ethically, you know, in the market, uh, you know, if,
*  if you can, if you can make a company that's a place people want to join, uh,
*  that, you know, engages in practices that people think are reasonable while managing
*  to maintain its position in the ecosystem at the same time, if you do that,
*  people will copy it.
*  Um, and the fact that you were doing it, especially the fact that you're doing
*  it better than they are, um, causes them to change their behavior in a much more
*  compelling way than if they're your boss and you're arguing with them.
*  I just, I don't know how to be any more specific about it than that, but I think
*  it's generally very unproductive to try and get someone else's vision to
*  look like your vision.
*  Um, it's much more productive to go off and do a clean experiment and say, this
*  is our vision, this is how, this is, this is how we're going to do things.
*  Your choice is you can, you can ignore us.
*  You can reject what we're doing, or you can, you can start to become more like
*  us and imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
*  Um, and you know, that, that, that plays out in the behavior of customers that
*  pays out in the behavior of the public that plays out in the behavior of where
*  people choose to work.
*  Uh, and again, again, at the end, it's, it's not about one company winning or
*  another company winning if, if we are another company are engaging in some
*  practice that, you know, people, people find genuinely appealing and I want it
*  to be in substance, not just, not just in appearance.
*  Um, and you know, I think, I think researchers are sophisticated and they
*  look at substance, uh, and then other companies start copying that practice
*  and they win because they copied that practice.
*  That's great.
*  That's success.
*  That's like the race to the top.
*  It doesn't matter who wins in the end, as long as everyone is copying
*  everyone else's good practices.
*  Right?
*  One way I think of it is like, the thing we're all afraid of is the race to the
*  bottom, right?
*  And the race to the bottom doesn't matter who wins because we all lose, right?
*  Like, you know, in the most extreme world, we, we make this autonomous AI that,
*  you know, the robots enslave us or whatever, right?
*  I mean, that's half joking, but you know, that, that is the most extreme, uh,
*  thing, thing that could happen.
*  Then it doesn't matter which company was ahead.
*  Um, if instead you create a race to the top where people are competing to
*  engage in good, in good practices, uh, then, you know, at the end of the day,
*  you know, it doesn't matter who ends up, who ends up winning.
*  Doesn't even matter who started the race to the top.
*  The point isn't to be virtuous.
*  The point is to get the system into a better equilibrium than it was before.
*  And, and individual companies can play some role in doing this.
*  Individual companies can, can, you know, can help to start it,
*  can help to accelerate it.
*  And frankly, I think individuals at other companies have, have done this as well.
*  Right.
*  The individuals that when we put out an RSP react by pushing harder to, to,
*  to get something similar done, get something similar done at, at, at other
*  companies, sometimes other companies do something that's like, we're like,
*  oh, it's a good practice.
*  We think, we think that's good.
*  We should adopt it too.
*  The only difference is, you know, I think, I think we are, um, we try to
*  be more forward leaning.
*  We try and adopt more of these practices first and adopt them more quickly
*  when others, when others invent them.
*  But I think this dynamic is what we should be pointing at.
*  And that, I think, I think it abstracts away the question of, you know, which
*  company's winning, who trusts who.
*  I think all these, all these questions of drama are, are profoundly uninteresting.
*  And, and the thing that matters is the ecosystem that we all operate in and how
*  to make that ecosystem better, because that constrains all the players.
*  And so Anthropic is this kind of clean experiment built on a foundation of
*  like what concretely AISAT should look like.
*  We're look, I'm sure we've made plenty of mistakes along the way.
*  The perfect organization doesn't exist.
*  It has to deal with the, the imperfection of a thousand employees.
*  It has to deal with the imperfection of our leaders, including me.
*  It has to deal with the imperfection of the people we've put, we've put to, you
*  know, to oversee the imperfection of the, of the leaders, like the, like the board
*  and the long-term benefit trust.
*  It's, it's all, it's all a set of imperfect people trying to aim
*  imperfectly at some ideal that will never perfectly be achieved.
*  Um, that's what you sign up for.
*  That's what it will always be.
*  But, uh, uh, imperfect doesn't mean you just give up.
*  There's better and there's worse.
*  And hopefully, hopefully we can begin to build, we can do well enough that we can
*  begin to build some practices that the whole industry engages in.
*  And then, you know, my guess is that multiple of these companies will be
*  successful and drop it will be successful.
*  These other companies, like once I've been at the past, we'll also be successful
*  and some will be more successful than others.
*  That's less important than again, that we, we align the incentives of the
*  industry and that happens partly through the race to the top, partly through
*  things like RSP, partly through again, selected surgical regulation.
*  You said talent density beats talent mass.
*  So can you explain that?
*  Can you expand on that?
*  Can you just talk about what it takes to build a great team of AI
*  researchers and engineers?
*  This is one of these statements.
*  That's like more true every, every, every month, every month.
*  I see this statement as more true than I did the month before.
*  So if I were to do a thought experiment, let's say you have a team of 100 people
*  that are super smart, motivated and aligned with the mission and that's your company.
*  Or you can have a team of a thousand people where 200 people are super smart,
*  super aligned with the mission.
*  And then, uh, like, and then like 800 people are, let's just say you pick
*  800, like random, random big tech employees, which would you rather have?
*  Right.
*  The talent mass is greater in the group of, uh, in the group of a thousand people.
*  Right.
*  You have, you have even, even a larger number of incredibly talented, incredibly
*  aligned, incredibly smart people.
*  Um, uh, but, but the, the issue is just that if every time someone super talented
*  looks around, they see someone else super talented and super dedicated, that sets
*  the tone for everything, right?
*  That sets the tone for everyone is super inspired to work at the same place.
*  Everyone trusts everyone else.
*  If you have a thousand or 10,000, uh, people and, and things have really
*  regressed, right, you are not able to do selection and you're choosing random
*  people.
*  What happens is then you need to put a lot of processes and a lot of guard
*  rails in place, um, just because people don't fully trust each other or you have
*  to adjudicate political battles.
*  Like there are so many things that slow down the org's ability to operate.
*  And so we're nearly a thousand people and you know, we've, we've, we've tried
*  to make it so that as large a fraction of those thousand people as possible are
*  like super talented, super skilled.
*  It's one of the reasons we've, we've slowed down hiring a lot in the last few
*  months, we grew from 300 to 800, I believe, I think in the first seven, eight
*  months of the year, and now we've slowed down.
*  We're at like, you know, the last three months we went from 800 to 900,
*  950, something like that.
*  Don't quote me on the exact numbers, but I think there's an inflection point
*  around a thousand and we want to be much more careful how, how we, how we grow.
*  Uh, early on and, and now as well, you know, we've hired a lot of physicists,
*  um, you know, theoretical physicists can learn things really fast.
*  Um, uh, even, even more recently, as we've continued to hire that, you know,
*  we've really had a high bar for on both the research side and the software
*  engineering side have hired a lot of senior people, including folks who used
*  to be at other, at other companies in this space, and we've just continued
*  to be very selective, it's very easy to go from a hundred to a thousand and
*  10,000 without paying attention to making sure everyone has a unified purpose.
*  It's so powerful.
*  If your company consists of a lot of different fiefdoms that all want to do
*  their own thing, they're all optimizing for their own thing.
*  Um, uh, it's very hard to get anything done, but if everyone sees the broader
*  purpose of the company, if there's trust and there's dedication to doing the
*  right thing, that is a superpower that in itself, I think can overcome almost
*  every other disadvantage.
*  And, you know, it's the Steve jobs, eight players, eight players want to look
*  around and see other eight players as another way of saying, I don't know what
*  that is about human nature, but it is demotivating to see people who are not
*  obsessively driving towards a singular mission.
*  And it is on the flip side of that super motivating to see that.
*  It's interesting.
*  Uh, what's it take to be a great AI researcher or engineer from everything
*  you've seen from working with so many amazing people?
*  Yeah.
*  Um, I think the number one quality, especially on the research side, but
*  really both is open-mindedness.
*  Sounds easy to be open-minded, right?
*  You're just like, Oh, I'm open to anything.
*  Um, but you know, if I, if I think about my own early history in the scaling
*  hypothesis, um, I was seeing the same data others were seeing, I don't think
*  I was like a better programmer or better at coming up with research ideas than
*  any of the hundreds of people that I worked with.
*  Um, in some ways, in some ways I was worse.
*  Um, uh, you know, like I've never like, you know, precise programming of like,
*  you know, finding the bug, writing the GPU kernels, like I could point you to
*  a hundred people here who are better, who are better at that than I am.
*  Um, but, but the, the thing that, that, that I think I did have that was different
*  was that I was just willing to look at something with new eyes, right?
*  People said, Oh, you know, we don't have the right algorithms yet.
*  We haven't come up with the right, the right way to do things.
*  And I was just like, Oh, I don't know.
*  Like, you know, this neural net has like 30 billion, 30 million parameters.
*  Like what if we gave it 50 million instead?
*  Like let's plot some graphs, like that, that basic scientific mindset of like,
*  Oh man, like I, I just, I just like, I, you know, I see some variable that I
*  could change, like what happens when it changes, like let's, let's try these
*  different things and like create a graph for even the, this was like the
*  simplest thing in the world, right?
*  Change the number of, you know, this wasn't like PhD level experimental design.
*  This was like, this was like simple and stupid.
*  Like anyone could have done this if you, if you just told them that, that,
*  that it was important, it's also not hard to understand.
*  You didn't need to be brilliant to come up with this.
*  Um, but you put the two things together and you know, some tiny number of people,
*  some single digit number of people have, have driven forward the
*  whole field by realizing this.
*  Uh, and, and it's, you know, it's often like that.
*  If you look back at the discovery, you know, the discoveries in history,
*  they're, they're often like that.
*  And so this, this open-mindedness and this willingness to see with new eyes
*  that often comes from being newer to the field often experience is a disadvantage
*  for this, that is the most important thing.
*  It's very hard to look for and test for, but I think, I think it's the most
*  important thing because when you, when you find something, some really new way
*  of thinking, thinking about things, when you have the initiative to do that, it's
*  absolutely transformative.
*  And also be able to do kind of rapid experimentation and in the face of that,
*  be open-minded and curious and looking at the data for these, these fresh eyes
*  and seeing what is that it's actually saying that applies in, uh,
*  mechanistic interpretability.
*  It's another example of this, like some of the early work in
*  mechanistic interpretability.
*  So simple.
*  It's just, no one thought to care about this question before.
*  You said what it takes to be a great AI researcher.
*  Can we rewind the clock back?
*  What, what advice would you give to people interested in AI?
*  They're young, looking forward to, how can I make any impact on the world?
*  I think my number one piece of advice is to just start playing with the models.
*  Um, this was actually, I, I worry a little, this seems like obvious advice.
*  Now, I think three years ago, it wasn't obvious and people started by, Oh, let
*  me read the latest reinforcement learning paper.
*  Let me, you know, let me, let me kind of, um, no, I mean, that was really the,
*  that was really the, the, the, and I mean, you should do that as well.
*  But, uh, now, you know, with wider availability of models and APIs, people
*  are doing this more, but I think, I think just experiential knowledge.
*  Um, these models are new artifacts that no one really understands.
*  Um, and so getting experience playing with them, I would also say again, in
*  line with the like, do something new, think in some new direction, like there
*  are all these things that haven't been explored, like for example, mechanistic
*  interpretability is still very new.
*  It's probably better to work on that than it is to work on new model
*  architectures because it's, you know, it's more popular than it was before.
*  There are probably like a hundred people working on it, but there aren't like
*  10,000 people working on it.
*  And it's, it's just, it's just, it's this fertile area for study.
*  Like, like, you know, it's there's, there's so much like low hanging fruit.
*  You can just walk by and, you know, you can just walk by and you can pick things.
*  Um, and, and the, the only reason for whatever reason people aren't, people
*  aren't interested in it enough.
*  I think there are some things around long, long horizon learning and long
*  horizon tasks where there's a lot to be done.
*  I think evaluations are still, we're still very early in our ability to study
*  evaluations, particularly for dynamic systems, acting in the world.
*  I think there's some stuff around multi-agent, um, Skate where the
*  puck is going is my, is my advice.
*  And you don't have to be brilliant to think of it.
*  Like all the things that are going to be exciting in five years, like in, in
*  people even mentioned them as like, you know, conventional wisdom, but like,
*  it's, it's just somehow there's this barrier that people don't, people don't
*  double down as much as they could, or they're afraid to do something
*  that's not the popular thing.
*  I don't know why it happens, but like getting over that barrier is the, that's
*  the, my number one piece of advice.
*  Let's talk if it could a bit about post-training.
*  Yeah.
*  So it seems that the modern post-training recipe has a little bit of everything.
*  So supervised fine tuning, RLHF, uh, the, the, the constitutional AI was RL,
*  a I F it's again, that name thing.
*  And then synthetic data seems like a lot of synthetic data, or at least
*  trying to figure out ways to have high quality synthetic data.
*  So what's the, uh, if this is a secret sauce that makes anthropic
*  clause so, uh, incredible, what, how much of the magic is in the pre-training?
*  How much is in the post-training?
*  Yeah.
*  Um, I mean, uh, so first of all, we're not perfectly able to measure that ourselves.
*  Um, uh, you know, when you see some, some great character ability, sometimes
*  it's hard to tell whether it came from pre-training or post-training.
*  Uh, we've developed ways to try and distinguish between those two, but they're not perfect.
*  You know, the second thing I would say is, you know, it's when there is an advantage
*  and I think we've been pretty good at in general, in general at RL, perhaps, perhaps
*  the best, although, although I don't know, cause I don't see what goes on inside other
*  companies.
*  Uh, usually it isn't, oh my God, we have the secret magic method that others don't have.
*  Right.
*  Usually it's like, well, you know, we got better at the infrastructure so we could run
*  it for longer or, you know, we were able to get higher quality data or we were able to
*  filter our data better, or we were able to, you know, combine these methods and practice.
*  It's, it's usually some boring matter of matter of kind of, uh, uh, uh,
*  practice and trade craft.
*  Um, so, you know, when I think about how to do something special in terms of how we train
*  these models, both pre-training, but even more so post-training, um, you know, I, I,
*  I really think of it a little more again, as like designing airplanes or cars, like,
*  you know, it's not just like, oh man, I have the blueprint.
*  Like maybe that makes you make the next airplane, but like there's some, there's some
*  cultural trade craft of how we think about the design process that I think is more
*  important than, than, you know, than, than any particular gizmo we're able to invent.
*  Okay. Well, about, let me ask you about specific techniques.
*  So first on RLHF, what do you think just zooming out intuition, almost philosophy,
*  why do you think RLHF works so well?
*  If I go back to like the scaling hypothesis, one of the ways to skate the scaling
*  hypothesis is if you train for X and you throw enough compute at it, um, then you
*  get X. And, and so RLHF is good at doing what humans want the model to do, or at
*  least, um, to state it more precisely, doing what humans who look at the model for a
*  brief period of time and consider different possible responses, what they prefer as
*  the response, uh, which is not perfect from both the safety and capabilities
*  perspective in that humans are, are often not able to perfectly identify what the
*  model wants and what humans want in the moment may not be what they want in the
*  longterm. So there's, there's a lot of subtlety there, but the models are good
*  at, uh, you know, producing what the humans in some shallow sense want.
*  Uh, and it actually turns out that you don't even have to throw that much
*  compute at it because of another thing, which is this, this thing about a strong
*  pre-trained model being halfway to anywhere.
*  Uh, uh, so once you have the pre-trained model, you have all the representations
*  you need to get the model, uh, to get the model where you, where you want it to go.
*  So do you think RLHF makes the model smarter or just appear smarter to the humans?
*  I don't think it makes the model smarter.
*  I don't think it just makes the model appear smarter.
*  It's like RLHF like bridges the gap between the human and the model, right?
*  I could have something really smart that like can't communicate at all.
*  Right.
*  We all know people like this, um, people who are really smart, but the, you know,
*  you can't understand what they're saying.
*  Um, uh, so I think, I think RLHF just bridges that gap.
*  Um, I think it's not, it's not the only kind of RL we do.
*  It's not the only kind of RL that will happen in the future.
*  I think RL has the potential to make models smarter, to make them reason
*  better, to make them operate better, to make them develop new skills even.
*  And perhaps that could be done, you know, even in some cases with human feedback,
*  but the kind of RLHF we do today mostly doesn't do that yet, although we're very
*  quickly starting to be able to.
*  But it appears to sort of increase.
*  If you look at the metric of helpfulness, it increases that.
*  It also increases.
*  What was this, this word in Leopold's essay, un-hobbling, where basically the
*  models are hobbled and then you do various trainings to them to un-hobble them.
*  So I, you know, I like that word because it's like a rare word, but it's so, so I
*  think RLHF un-hobbles the models in some ways.
*  Um, and then there are other ways where that model hasn't yet been un-hobbled
*  and, and, you know, needs to, needs to un-hobble.
*  If you can say in terms of costs, is pre-training the most expensive thing or
*  is post-training creep up to that?
*  At the present moment, it is still the case that a pre-training is the majority of the
*  cost.
*  I don't know what to expect in the future, but I could certainly anticipate a future
*  where post-training is the majority of the cost.
*  In that future you anticipate, would it be the humans or the AI that's the costly
*  thing for the post-training?
*  I, I, I, I don't think you can scale up humans enough to get high quality.
*  Any, any kind of method that relies on humans and uses a large amount of compute,
*  it's going to have to rely on some scaled supervision method, like, uh, uh, like, um,
*  you know, debate or iterated amplification or something like that.
*  So on that super interesting, um, set of ideas around constitutional AI can
*  describe what it is as first detailed in December 2022 paper and, uh, and beyond
*  that, what is it?
*  Yes.
*  So this was from two years ago.
*  The basic idea is, so we describe what RLHF is.
*  You have, uh, you have a model and, uh, it, you know, spits out two po, you know,
*  it like, you just sample from it twice.
*  It spits out two possible responses and you're like human, which response do you
*  like better or another variant of it is rate this response on a scale of one to
*  seven.
*  So that's hard because you need to scale up human interaction and, uh, it's very
*  implicit, right?
*  I don't have a sense of what I, what I want the model to do.
*  I just have a sense of like what this average of a thousand humans wants the
*  model to do.
*  So two ideas.
*  One is could the AI system itself decide which, uh, which response is better,
*  right?
*  Could you show the AI system, these two responses and ask which, which, which
*  response is better and then second, well, what criterion should the AI use?
*  And so then there's this idea, cause you have a single document, a
*  constitution, if you will, that says these are the principles the model should
*  be using to respond and the AI system reads those, um, it reads those principles
*  as well as reading the environment and the response.
*  And it says, well, how good did the AI model do?
*  Um, it's basically a form of self play.
*  You're kind of training the model against itself.
*  And so the AI gives the response and then you feed that back into what's called the
*  preference model, which in turn feeds the model to make it better.
*  Um, so you have this triangle of like the AI, the preference model and the
*  improvement of the AI itself.
*  And we should say that in the constitution, the set of principles are
*  like human interpretable.
*  They're like, yeah, yeah, it's something both the human and the AI system can read.
*  So it has this nice, this nice kind of translatability or symmetry.
*  Um, you know, in, in practice, we both use a model constitution and we use
*  RLHF and we use some of these other methods.
*  So it's, it's turned into one tool in a, in a toolkit that both reduces the
*  need for RLHF and increases the value we get from, um, from, from using each
*  data point of RLHF, um, it also interacts in interesting ways with kind of future
*  reasoning type RL methods.
*  So, um, it's, it's one tool in the toolkit, but, but I think it is a very important tool.
*  Well, it's a compelling one to us humans, you know, thinking about the founding
*  fathers and the founding of the United States.
*  The natural question is who and how do you think it gets to define the
*  constitution, the, the set of principles in the constitution?
*  Yeah.
*  So I'll give like a practical, um, answer and a more abstract answer.
*  I think the practical answer is like, look, in practice, models get used by all kinds
*  of different, like customers, right?
*  And, and so, uh, you can have this idea where, you know, the model can, can have
*  specialized rules or principles, you know, we fine tune versions of models.
*  Implicitly we've talked about doing it explicitly, having, having special
*  principles that people can build into the models.
*  Um, uh, so from a practical perspective, the answer can be very different from
*  different people, uh, you know, customer service agent, uh, you know, behaves very
*  differently from a lawyer and obeys different principles.
*  Um, but I think at the base of it, there are specific principles that the models,
*  uh, you know, have to obey.
*  I think a lot of them are things that people would agree with.
*  Everyone agrees that, you know, we don't, you know, we don't want models
*  to present these CBRN risks.
*  Um, I think we can go a little further and agree with some basic principles
*  of democracy and the rule of law.
*  Beyond that, it gets, you know, very uncertain and there, our goal is generally
*  for the models to be more neutral, to not espouse a particular point of view and,
*  you know, more just be kind of like wise, uh, agents or advisors that will help you
*  think things through and we'll, you know, present, present possible considerations,
*  but, you know, don't express, you know, stronger specific opinions.
*  OpenAI released a model spec where it kind of clearly concretely defines some
*  of the goals of the model and specific examples like AB, how the model should
*  behave.
*  Do you find that interesting?
*  By the way, I should mention the, I believe the brilliant John
*  Schulman was a part of that.
*  He's now at Anthropic.
*  Uh, do you think this is a useful direction?
*  Might Anthropic release a model spec as well?
*  Yeah.
*  So I think that's a pretty useful direction.
*  Again, it has a lot in common with a constitutional AI.
*  So again, another example of like a race to the top, right?
*  We have something that's like, we think, you know, a better and more responsible
*  way of doing things.
*  Um, it's also a competitive advantage.
*  Um, then, uh, others kind of, you know, discover that it has advantages and then
*  start to do that thing.
*  Uh, we then no longer have the competitive advantage, but it's good from the
*  perspective that now everyone has adopted a positive practice that others were not
*  adopting.
*  And so our response to that as well, looks like we need a new competitive
*  advantage in order to keep driving this race upwards.
*  Um, so that's, that's how I generally feel about that.
*  I also think every implementation of these things is different.
*  So, you know, there were some things in the model spec that were not in
*  constitutional AI.
*  And so, you know, we, you know, we can always, we can always adopt those things
*  or, you know, at least learn from them.
*  Um, so again, I think this is an example of like the positive dynamic that, uh,
*  that, that, that I, that, that I think we should all want the field to have.
*  Let's talk about the incredible essay machines of love and grace.
*  I recommend everybody read it.
*  It's a long one.
*  It is rather long.
*  Yeah.
*  It's really refreshing to read concrete ideas about what a positive future looks
*  like.
*  And you took sort of a bold stance because like, it's very possible that you
*  might be wrong on the dates or the specific.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I'm fully expecting to, you know, to definitely be wrong about all the details.
*  I might be, be just spectacularly wrong about the whole thing and people will,
*  you know, will laugh at me for years.
*  Um, uh, that's, that's, that's, that's just how the future works.
*  So you provided a bunch of concrete, positive impacts of AI and how, you know,
*  exactly a super intelligent AI might accelerate the rate of breakthroughs in,
*  for example, biology and chemistry that would then lead to things like we cure
*  most cancers, prevent all infectious disease, double the human lifespan and so
*  on.
*  So let's talk about this essay first.
*  Can you give a high level vision of this essay and, um, what key takeaways that
*  people would have?
*  Yeah, I have spent a lot of time in anthropica, spent a lot of effort on like,
*  you know, how do we address the risks of AI, right?
*  How do we think about those risks?
*  Like we're trying to do a race to the top, you know, what that requires us to
*  build all these capabilities and the capabilities are cool, but, you know, you
*  know, we're, we're, we're like a big part of what we're trying to do is like, is
*  like address the risks and the justification for that is like, well, you
*  know, all these positive things, you know, the market is this very healthy organism,
*  right?
*  It's going to produce all the positive things, the risks, I don't know, we might
*  mitigate them, we might not.
*  And so we can have more impact by trying to mitigate the risks.
*  But I noticed that one flaw in that way of thinking, and it's, it's not a change
*  in how seriously I take the risks.
*  It's, it's maybe a change in how I talk about them, um, is that, you know, no
*  matter how kind of logical or rational that line of reasoning that I just gave
*  might be, um, if, if you kind of only talk about risks, your brain only thinks
*  about risks.
*  And so I think it's actually very important to understand what if things do
*  go well?
*  And the whole reason we're trying to prevent these risks is not because we're
*  afraid of technology, not because we want to slow it down.
*  It's, it's, it's because if we can get to the other side of these risks, right, if
*  we can run the gauntlet successfully, um, to, you know, to, to put it in stark
*  terms, then, then on the other side of the gauntlet are all these great things.
*  And these things are worth fighting for.
*  And these things can really inspire people.
*  And I think I imagine because look, you have all these investors, all these VCs,
*  all these AI companies talking about all the positive benefits of AI.
*  But as you point out, it's, it's, it's weird.
*  There's actually a dearth of really getting specific about it.
*  There's a lot of like random people on Twitter, like posting these kind of like
*  gleaming cities and this, this just kind of like vibe of like grind, accelerate
*  harder, like kick out the diesel.
*  You know, it's just this very, this very like aggressive ideological, but then
*  you're like, well, what are you, what, what, what, what, what, what are you
*  actually excited about?
*  Um, and so, and so I figured that, you know, I think it would be interesting and
*  valuable for someone who's actually coming from the risk side to, to try and,
*  and to try and really make a try at, at explaining, explaining,
*  explaining what the benefits are.
*  Both because I think it's something we can all get behind and I want people to
*  understand, I want them to really understand that this isn't, this isn't
*  do-mers versus accelerationists.
*  This, this is that if you have a true understanding of where things are going
*  with, with AI, and maybe that's the more important axis, AI is moving fast versus
*  AI is not moving fast, then you really appreciate the benefits and you, you, you,
*  really, you want humanity, our civilization to seize those benefits, but
*  you also get very serious about anything that could derail them.
*  So I think the starting point is to talk about what this powerful AI, which is
*  the term you like to use, um, most of the world uses AGI, but you don't like the
*  term because it's, uh, basically has too much baggage.
*  It's become meaningless.
*  It's like, we're stuck with the terms.
*  Maybe we're stuck with the terms and my efforts to change them are futile.
*  It's admirable.
*  I'll tell you what else I don't.
*  This is like a pointless semantic point, but I, I keep talking about it.
*  Back to naming again.
*  I'm just gonna do it once more.
*  Um, uh, I think it's, it's a little like, like, let's say it was like 1995 and
*  Moore's laws making the computers faster.
*  And like, for some reason there, there, there, there had been this like verbal
*  tick that like, everyone was like, well, someday we're going to have like
*  super computers and like super computers are going to be able to do all these
*  things that like, you know, once we have super computers, we'll be able to like
*  sequence the genome, we'll be able to do other things.
*  And so, and so like one, it's true.
*  The computers are getting faster.
*  And as they get faster, they're going to be able to do all these great things.
*  But there's like, there's no discrete point at which you had a super computer
*  and previous computers were not to like super computers, a term we use, but like
*  it's a vague term to just describe like computers that are faster than what we
*  have today, um, there's no point at which you pass a threshold and you're like,
*  oh my God, we're doing a totally new type of computation and new.
*  And so I feel that way about AGI, like there's just a smooth exponential.
*  And like, if, if by AGI, you mean like, like AI is getting better and better and
*  like gradually it's going to do more and more of what humans do until it's going
*  to be smarter than humans, and then it's going to get smarter even from there.
*  Then, then yes, I believe in AGI if, but if, if, if AGI is some discrete or
*  separate thing, which is the way people often talk about it, then it's, it's kind
*  of a meaningless buzzword.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, to me, it's just sort of a platonic form of a powerful AI,
*  exactly how you define it.
*  I mean, you define it very nicely.
*  So on the intelligence axis, it's just on pure intelligence.
*  It's smarter than a Nobel prize winner, as you describe across most relevant
*  disciplines.
*  So, okay, that's just intelligence.
*  So it's, uh, both in creativity and be able to generate new ideas, all that
*  kind of stuff in every discipline, Nobel prize winner, okay.
*  In their prime.
*  It can use every modality.
*  So, uh, this kind of self-explanatory, but just to operate across all the
*  modalities of the world, uh, it can go off for many hours, days and weeks to
*  do tasks and do its own sort of detailed planning and only ask you help when it's
*  needed.
*  Uh, it can use this actually kind of interesting.
*  I think in the essay you said, I mean, again, it's a bet that it's not going to
*  be embodied, but it can control embodied tools.
*  So it can control tools, robots, laboratory equipment, the resource used
*  to train it can then be repurposed to run millions of copies of it.
*  And each of those copies will be independent that can do their own independent
*  work.
*  So you can do the cloning of the intelligence.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you, you might imagine from outside the field, like there's only one of
*  these, right?
*  Like you made it, you've only made one, but the truth is that like the scale up
*  is very quick.
*  Like we, we do this today.
*  We make a model and then we deploy thousands, maybe tens of thousands of
*  instances of it.
*  I think by the time, you know, certainly within two to three years, whether we
*  have these super powerful AIs or not, clusters are going to get to the size
*  where you'll be able to deploy millions of these and they'll be, you know, faster
*  than humans.
*  And so if your picture is, oh, we'll have one and it'll take a while to make them.
*  My point there was no, actually you have millions of them right away.
*  And in general, they can learn and act, uh, 10 to a hundred times faster than
*  humans.
*  So that's a really nice definition of powerful AI.
*  Okay.
*  So that, but you also write that clearly such an entity would be capable of
*  solving very difficult problems very fast, but it is not trivial to figure out
*  how fast two extreme positions both seem false to me.
*  So the singularity is on the one extreme and the opposite on the other extreme.
*  Can you describe each of the extremes?
*  Yeah.
*  So why, so yeah, let's, let's describe the extreme.
*  So like one, one extreme would be, well, look, um, you know, uh, if we look at
*  kind of evolutionary history, like there was this big acceleration where, you
*  know, for hundreds of thousands of years, we just had like, you know, single celled
*  organisms, and then we had mammals and then we had apes and then that quickly
*  turned to humans, humans quickly built industrial civilization.
*  And so this is going to keep speeding up and there's no ceiling at the human level.
*  Once models get much, much smarter than humans, they'll get really good at
*  building the next models.
*  And you know, if you write down like a simple differential equation, like this
*  is an exponential.
*  And so what's, what's going to happen is that, uh, models will build faster
*  models, models will build faster models.
*  And those models will build, you know, nanobots that can like take over the
*  world and produce much more energy than you could produce otherwise.
*  And so if you just kind of like solve this abstract differential equation, then
*  like five days after we, you know, we build the first AI that's more powerful
*  than humans, then, then, uh, you know, like the world will be filled with these
*  AIs and every possible technology that could be invented, like will be invented.
*  Um, I'm caricaturing this a little bit.
*  Um, uh, but I, you know, I think that's one extreme.
*  And the reason that I think that's not the case is that one, I think they just
*  neglect like the laws of physics.
*  Like it's only possible to do things so fast in the physical world.
*  Like some of those loops go through, you know, producing faster hardware.
*  Um, uh, it takes a long time to produce faster hardware.
*  Things take a long time.
*  There's this issue of complexity.
*  Like, I think no matter how smart you are, like, you know, people talk about,
*  Oh, we can make models of biological systems that'll do everything.
*  The biological systems.
*  Look, I think computational modeling can do a lot.
*  I did a lot of computational modeling when I worked in biology, but like just.
*  There are a lot of things that you can't predict how they're, you know, they're,
*  they're complex enough that like just iterating, just running the experiment
*  is going to beat any modeling, no matter how smart the system doing the modeling is.
*  Oh, even if it's not interacting with the physical world, just the
*  modeling is going to be hard.
*  Yeah.
*  I think the modeling is going to be hard and getting the model to, to, to, to
*  match the physical world is going to be.
*  All right.
*  So he does have to.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But, but it's just, you know, you just look at even the simplest problems.
*  Like, you know, I think I talk about like, you know, the three body problem or
*  simple chaotic prediction, like, you know, or, or like predicting the economy.
*  It's really hard to predict the economy two years out.
*  Like maybe the case is like, you know, normal, you know, humans can predict
*  what's going to happen in the economy next quarter, or they can't really do that.
*  Maybe, maybe a AI system that's, you know, a zillion times smarter.
*  It can only predict it out a year or something instead of, instead of, you
*  know, you have these kinds of exponential increase in computer intelligence for
*  linear increase in, in, in ability to predict same with again, like, you know,
*  biological molecules, molecules interacting, you don't know what's going
*  to happen when you perturb, when you perturb a complex system, you can find
*  simple parts in it, if you're smarter, you're better at finding these simple parts.
*  And then I think human institutions, human institutions are just, are, are
*  really difficult.
*  Like it's, you know, it's, it's been hard to get people.
*  I won't give specific examples, but it's been hard to get people to adopt even
*  the technologies that we've developed, even ones where the case for their
*  efficacy is very, very strong.
*  Um, you know, people have concerns.
*  They think things are conspiracy theories.
*  Like it's, it's just been, it's been very difficult.
*  It's also been very difficult to get, you know, very simple things
*  through the regulatory system.
*  Right.
*  I think, you know, and, you know, I don't want to disparage anyone who, you know,
*  you know, works in regulatory systems of any technology, there are hard
*  trade-offs they have to deal with.
*  They have to save lives, but, but the system as a whole, I think makes some
*  obvious trade-offs that are very far from maximizing human welfare.
*  And so if we bring AI systems into this, you know, into these human systems,
*  often the level of intelligence may just not be the limiting factor.
*  Right.
*  It, it just may be that it takes a long time to do something.
*  Now, if the AI system, uh, circumvented all governments, if it just said, I'm
*  dictator of the world and I'm going to do whatever some of these things that
*  could do again, the things have you do with complexity.
*  I, I still think a lot of things would take a while.
*  I don't think it helps that the AI systems can produce a lot of energy or go to the moon.
*  Like some people in comments responded to the essay saying the AI system can
*  produce a lot of energy and smarter AI systems.
*  That's missing the point.
*  That kind of cycle doesn't solve the key problems that I'm talking about here.
*  Um, so I think, I think a bunch of people miss the point there, but even if it
*  were completely on the line and, you know, could get around all these human
*  obstacles, it would have trouble.
*  But again, if you want this to be an AI system that doesn't take over the world,
*  that doesn't destroy humanity, then, then basically, you know, it's, it's, it's
*  going to need to follow basic human laws.
*  Right.
*  Well, you know, if we want to have an actually good world, like we're going to
*  have to have an AI system that, that interacts with humans, not one that kind
*  of creates its own legal system or disregards all the laws or all of that.
*  So as inefficient as these processes are, you know, we're going to have to deal
*  with them because there needs to be some popular and democratic legitimacy in how
*  these systems are rolled out.
*  We can't have a small group of people who are developing these systems say this
*  is what's best for everyone.
*  Right.
*  I think it's wrong.
*  And I think in practice is not going to work anyway.
*  So you put all those things together and, you know, we're not, we're not going to,
*  we're not going to, you know, change the world and upload everyone in five minutes.
*  I just, I don't think, I, A, I don't think it's going to happen and B to
*  something, you know, to the extent that it could happen, it's, it's not the
*  way to lead to a good world.
*  So that's on one side.
*  On the other side, there's another set of perspectives, which I have actually in
*  some ways more sympathy for, which is, look, we've seen big productivity
*  increases before, right?
*  You know, economists are familiar with studying the productivity increases that
*  came from the computer revolution and internet revolution.
*  And generally those productivity increases were underwhelming.
*  They were less than you, than you might imagine.
*  There was a quote from Robert Solo.
*  You see the computer revolution everywhere except the productivity statistics.
*  So why is this the case?
*  People point to the structure of firms, the structure of enterprises, how, you
*  know, how slow it's been to roll out or existing technology to very poor parts of
*  the world, which I talk about in the essay, right?
*  How do we get these technologies to the poorest parts of the world that are behind
*  on cell phone technology, computers, medicine, let alone, you know, newfangled
*  AI that hasn't been invented yet.
*  Um, so you could have a perspective.
*  It's like, well, this is amazing technically, but it's all or nothing burger.
*  Um, uh, you know, I think, um, Tyler Cowen, who, who wrote something
*  in response to my essay has that perspective.
*  I think he thinks the radical change will happen eventually, but he thinks
*  it'll take 50 or a hundred years.
*  And, and you could have even more static perspectives on the whole thing.
*  I think there's some truth to it.
*  I think the time scale is just, is just too long.
*  Um, and, and I can see it.
*  I can actually see both sides with today's AI.
*  So, uh, you know, a lot of our customers are large enterprises who are used
*  to doing things a certain way.
*  Um, I've also seen it in talking to governments, right?
*  Those are, those are prototypical, you know, institutions,
*  entities that are slow to change.
*  Uh, but the dynamic I see over and over again is yes, it takes
*  a long time to move the ship.
*  Yes.
*  There's a lot of resistance and lack of understanding.
*  But the thing that makes me feel that progress will in the end happen moderately
*  fast, not incredibly fast, but moderately fast is that you talk to.
*  What I find is I find over and over again, again, in large companies, even
*  in governments, um, which have been actually surprisingly forward leaning.
*  Uh, you find two things that move things forward.
*  One, you find a small fraction of people within a company, within a government
*  who really see the big picture, who see the whole scaling hypothesis, who
*  understand where AI is going, or at least understand where it's going within their
*  industry.
*  And there are a few people like that within the current, within the
*  current U S government who really see the whole picture.
*  And, and those people see that this is the most important thing in the world
*  until they agitate for it.
*  And the thing they alone are not enough to succeed because there are a small
*  set of people within a large organization.
*  But as the technology starts to roll out, as it succeeds in some places in the
*  folks who are most willing to adopt it, the specter of competition gives them a
*  wind at their backs because they can point within their large organization.
*  They can say, look, these other guys are doing this, right?
*  You know, one bank can say, look, this newfangled hedge fund is doing this thing.
*  They're going to eat our lunch in the U S we can say, we're afraid China's going
*  to get there before, before we are.
*  Uh, and that combination, the specter of competition, plus a few visionaries
*  within these, you know, within these, the organizations that in many ways are
*  sclerotic, you put those two things together and it actually makes something happen.
*  I mean, that's interesting.
*  It's a balanced fight between the two because inertia is very powerful.
*  But, but, but eventually over enough time, the innovative approach breaks through.
*  Um, and I've seen that happen.
*  I've seen the arc of that over and over again.
*  And it's like the barriers are there.
*  The, the barriers to progress, the complexity, not knowing how to use the
*  model, how to deploy them are there.
*  And, and for a bit, it seems like they're going to last forever.
*  Like change doesn't happen.
*  But then eventually change happens and always comes from a few people.
*  I felt the same way when I was an advocate of the scaling hypothesis
*  within the AI field itself and others didn't get it.
*  It felt like no one would ever get it.
*  It felt like then it felt like we had a secret, almost no one ever had.
*  And then a couple of years later, everyone has the secret.
*  And so I think that's how it's going to go with deployment to AI in the world.
*  It's going to the barriers are going to fall apart gradually and then all at once.
*  And so I think this is going to be more, and this is just an instinct.
*  I could, I could easily see how I'm wrong.
*  I think it's going to be more like 10, five or 10 years, as I say in the essay,
*  then it's going to be 50 or a hundred years.
*  I also think it's going to be five or 10 years more than it's going to be, you
*  know, five or 10 hours, uh, uh, because I've just, I've just seen how human
*  systems work and I think a lot of these people who write down the differential
*  equations who say AI is going to make more powerful AI who can't understand how
*  it could possibly be the case that these things won't, won't change so fast.
*  I think they don't understand these things.
*  So what do you use the timeline to where we achieve AGI, AKA powerful AI, AKA
*  super useful AI, I'm going to start calling it that.
*  It's a debate.
*  It's a debate about naming, um, you know, on pure intelligence, it can
*  smarter than a Nobel prize winner in every relevant discipline and all the
*  things we've said, modality can go and do stuff on its own for days, weeks,
*  and do biology experiments on its own.
*  In one, you know what, let's just stick to biology because you sold me on the
*  whole biology and health section.
*  That's so exciting from, um, from a, just, I was getting giddy from a scientific
*  perspective and made me want to be a biologist.
*  It's almost, it's so no, no, this was the feeling I had when I was writing it,
*  that it's, it's like, this would be such a beautiful future if we can, if we can
*  just, if we can just make it happen, right?
*  If we can just get the, get the landmines out of the way and, and, and make it happen.
*  There's, there's so much, there's so much beauty and, and, and, and, and elegance
*  and moral force behind it.
*  If, if we can, if we can just, and it's something we should all be able to agree on.
*  Right?
*  Like as much as we fight about, about all these political questions, is this
*  something that could actually bring us together?
*  Um, but you were asking when, when, when do you think, what's just putting
*  numbers on the table?
*  This is of course, the thing I've been grappling with for many years and I'm
*  not, I'm not at all confident every time.
*  If I say 2026 or 2027, there'll be like a zillion, like people on Twitter who
*  will be like, Hey, I see you said 2026, 20, and it'll be repeated for like the
*  next two years that like, this is definitely when I think it's going to happen.
*  Um, so whoever's exerting these clips will, will, will, will, will crop out the
*  thing I just said and only say the thing I'm about to say.
*  Um, but I'll just say it anyway.
*  Um, so, uh, if you extrapolate the curves that we've had so far, right?
*  If, if you say, well, I don't know, we're starting to get to like PhD level.
*  And last year we were at, um, uh, undergraduate level and the year before
*  we were at like the level of a high school student.
*  Again, you can, you can quibble with at what tasks and for what we're still
*  missing modalities, but those are being added, like computer use was added.
*  Like image in was added, like image generation has been added.
*  If you just kind of like, and this is totally unscientific, but if you just
*  kind of like eyeball the rate at which these capabilities are increasing, it
*  does make you think that we'll get there by 2026 or 2027 again, lots of things
*  could derail it, we could run out of data.
*  You know, we might not be able to scale clusters as much as we want.
*  Like, you know, maybe Taiwan gets blown up or something, and, you know, then
*  we can't produce as many GPUs as we want.
*  So there are, there are all kinds of things that could, could
*  derail the whole process.
*  So I don't fully believe the straight line extrapolation, but if you believe
*  the straight line extrapolation, you'll, you'll, we'll get there in 2026 or 2027.
*  I think the most likely is that there's some mild delay relative to that.
*  I don't know what that delay is, but I think it could happen on schedule.
*  I think there could be a mild delay.
*  I think there are still worlds where it doesn't happen in, in a hundred years.
*  Those were the number of those worlds is rapidly decreasing.
*  We are rapidly running out of truly convincing Brocklers, truly compelling
*  reasons why this will not happen in the next few years.
*  There were a lot more in 2020.
*  Although my, my guess, my hunch at that time was that we'll make
*  it through all those blockers.
*  So sitting as someone who has seen most of the blockers cleared out
*  of the way, I kind of suspect my hunch.
*  My suspicion is that the rest of them will not block us.
*  But you know, look, look, look at the end of the day, like, I don't want
*  to represent this as a scientific prediction.
*  People call them scaling laws.
*  That's a misnomer.
*  Like Moore's law is, is, is a misnomer.
*  Moore's law scaling laws.
*  They're not laws of the universe.
*  They're empirical regularities.
*  I am going to bet in favor of them continuing, but I'm not certain of that.
*  So you extensively described sort of the compressed 21st century, how
*  AGI will help set forth a chain of breakthroughs in biology and medicine
*  that help us in all these kinds of ways that I mentioned.
*  So how do you think, what are the early steps it might do?
*  And by the way, I asked Claude good questions to ask you.
*  And Claude told me to ask, what do you think is a typical day for
*  biologists working on AGI look like under, in this future?
*  Yeah.
*  Claude is curious.
*  Well, let me start with your first questions and then I'll, then I'll answer that.
*  Claude, Claude wants to know what's in its future, right?
*  Who am I going to be working with?
*  Exactly.
*  So I think one of the things I went hard on when I went hard on in the essay is,
*  let me go back to this idea of, because it's, it's really had, it had, you know,
*  had an impact on me, this idea that within large organizations and systems,
*  there end up being a few people or a few new ideas who kind of cause things to go
*  in a different direction than they would have before, who, who kind of,
*  disproportionately affect the trajectory.
*  There's a bunch of kind of the same thing going on, right?
*  If you think about the health world, there's like, you know, trillions of dollars to
*  pay out Medicare and, you know, other health insurance, and then the NIH is 100 billion.
*  And then if I think of like the few things that have really revolutionized anything,
*  it could be encapsulated in a small, small fraction of that.
*  And so when I think of like, where will AI have an impact?
*  I'm like, can AI turn that small fraction into a much larger fraction and raise its
*  quality? And within biology, my experience within biology is that the biggest problem
*  of biology is that you can't see what's going on.
*  You have very little ability to see what's going on and even less ability to change
*  it, right? What you have is this, like, like from this, you have to infer that there's
*  a bunch of cells that within each cell is, you know, three billion base pairs of DNA
*  built according to a genetic code.
*  And, you know, there are all these processes that are just going on without any ability
*  of us as, you know, unaugmented humans to affect it.
*  These cells are dividing most of the time that's healthy, but sometimes that process
*  goes wrong. And that's cancer.
*  The cells are aging.
*  Your skin may change color, develops wrinkles as you as you age.
*  And all of this is determined by these processes, all these proteins being produced,
*  transported to various parts of the cells, binding to each other.
*  And in our initial state about biology, we didn't even know that these cells existed.
*  We had to invent microscopes to observe the cells.
*  We had to we had to invent more powerful microscopes to see below the level of the
*  cell, to the level of molecules.
*  We had to invent X-ray crystallography to see the DNA.
*  We had to invent gene sequencing to read the DNA.
*  Now, you know, we had to invent protein folding technology to, you know, to predict
*  how it would fold and how they bind and how these things bind to each other.
*  You know, we had to we had to invent various techniques for now.
*  We can edit the DNA as of, you know, with CRISPR as of the last 12 years.
*  So the whole history of biology, a whole big part of the history is basically our
*  ability to read and understand what's going on and our ability to reach in and
*  selectively change things.
*  And my view is that there's so much more we can still do there, right?
*  You can do CRISPR, but you can do it for your whole body.
*  Let's say I want to do it for one particular type of cell and I want the rate of
*  targeting the wrong cell to be very low.
*  That's still a challenge.
*  That's still things people are working on.
*  That's what we might need for gene therapy for certain diseases.
*  And so the reason I'm saying all of this and it goes beyond, you know, beyond this
*  to, you know, to gene sequencing, to new types of nanomaterials for observing
*  what's going on inside cells for, you know, antibody drug conjugates.
*  The reason I'm saying all of this is that this could be a leverage point for the
*  AI systems, right?
*  That the number of such inventions, it's in the mid double digits or something,
*  you know, mid double digits, maybe low triple digits over the history of biology.
*  Let's say I have a million of these AIs, like, you know, can they discover
*  thousands, you know, working together?
*  Can they discover thousands of these very quickly?
*  And does that provide a huge lever instead of trying to leverage the, you
*  know, two trillion a year we spend on, you know, Medicare or whatever, can we
*  leverage the one billion a year that's, you know, that's spent to discover, but
*  with much higher quality?
*  And so what, what is it like, you know, being a, being a scientist that works
*  with, with, with an AI system, the way I think about it actually is, well, so I
*  think in the early stages, the AIs are going to be like grad students.
*  You're going to give them a project.
*  You're going to say, you know, I'm the experienced biologist.
*  I've set up the lab, the biology professor, or even the grad students
*  themselves will say, here's, here's what, here's what you can do with an AI, you
*  know, like AI system, I'd like to study this and, you know, the AI system, it
*  has all the tools, it can like, look up all the literature to decide what to do.
*  It can look at all the equipment.
*  It can go to a website and say, Hey, I'm going to go to, you know, thermo
*  Fisher or, you know, whatever the lab equipment company is dominant lab
*  equipment company is today.
*  And my, my time was thermo Fisher.
*  You know, I'm going to order this new equipment to do this.
*  I'm going to run my experiments.
*  I'm going to, you know, write up a report about my experiments.
*  I'm going to, you know, inspect the images for contamination.
*  I'm going to decide what the next experiment is.
*  I'm going to like write some code and run a statistical analysis.
*  All the things a grad student would do.
*  There'll be a computer with an AI that like the professor talks to every once
*  in a while, and it says, this is what you're going to do today.
*  The AI system comes to it with questions.
*  When it's necessary to run the lab equipment, it may be limited in some ways.
*  It may have to hire a human lab assistant to, you know, to do the experiment
*  and explain how to do it, or it could, you know, it could use advances in
*  lab automation that are gradually being developed over, you have been developed
*  over the last decade or so, and will, will continue to be, will continue to be
*  developed.
*  And so it'll look like there's a human professor and a thousand AI grad
*  students.
*  And, you know, if you, if you go to one of these Nobel prize winning biologists
*  or so, you'll say, okay, well, you know, you had like 50 grad students.
*  Well, now you have a thousand and they're, they're, they're smarter than
*  you are, by the way.
*  Um, uh, then I think at some point it'll flip around where the, you know, the AI
*  systems will, you know, will, will be the PIs will be the leaders and, and, and,
*  you know, they'll be, they'll be ordering humans or other AI systems around.
*  So I think that's how it'll work on the research side.
*  And they would be the inventors of a CRISPR type technology.
*  They would be the inventors of, of a CRISPR type technology.
*  Um, and then I think, you know, as I say in the essay, we'll want to turn, turn,
*  probably turning loose is the wrong, the wrong term, but we'll want to, we'll
*  want to harness the AI systems, uh, to improve the clinical trial system as
*  well.
*  There's some amount of this that's regulatory.
*  That's a matter of societal decisions and that'll be harder, but can we get
*  better at predicting the results of clinical trials?
*  Can we get better at statistical design so that what, you know, clinical trials
*  that used to require, you know, 5,000 people and therefore, you know, needed
*  a hundred million dollars and a year to enroll them.
*  Now they need 500 people in two months to enroll them.
*  Um, that's where we should start.
*  Uh, and, and, you know, can we increase the success rate of clinical trials by
*  doing things in animal trials that we used to do in clinical trials and doing
*  things in simulations that we used to do in animal trials again, we won't be able
*  to simulate it all.
*  AI is not God.
*  Um, uh, but, but, you know, can we, can we shift the curve substantially and
*  radically?
*  So I don't know.
*  That would be my picture.
*  Doing in vitro and doing it.
*  I mean, you're still slowed down.
*  It still takes time, but you can do it much, much faster.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Can we just one step at a time?
*  And, and can that, can that add up to a lot of steps, even though, even though we
*  still need clinical trials, even though we still need laws, even though the FDA and
*  other organizations will still not be perfect.
*  Can we just move everything in a positive direction?
*  And when you add up all those positive directions, do you get everything that
*  was going to happen from here to 2100 instead happens from 2027 to 2032 or
*  something?
*  Another way that I think the world might be changing with AI even today, but
*  moving towards this future of the, the powerful, super useful AI is a programming.
*  So how do you see the nature of programming?
*  Because it's so intimate to the actual act of building AI.
*  How do you see that changing for us humans?
*  I think that's going to be one of the areas that changes fastest for two reasons.
*  One programming is a skill that's very close to the actual building of the AI.
*  So the farther a skill is from the people who are building the AI, the longer it's
*  going to take to get disrupted by the AI.
*  Right?
*  Like I truly believe that like AI will disrupt agriculture.
*  Maybe it already has in some ways, but that's just very distant from the folks
*  who are building AI.
*  And so I think it's going to take longer, but programming is the bread and butter
*  of, you know, a large fraction of the employees who work at entropic and at the
*  other companies.
*  And so it's going to happen fast.
*  The other reason it's going to happen fast is with programming, you close the
*  loop, both when you're training the model, when you're applying the model, the idea
*  that the model can write the code means that the model can then run the code and,
*  and, and then see the results and, and interpret it back.
*  And so it really has an ability, unlike hardware, unlike biology, which we just
*  discussed, the model has an ability to close the loop.
*  Um, and, and so I think those two things are going to lead to the model getting
*  good at programming very fast.
*  As I saw on, you know, typical real world programming tasks, models have gone from
*  3% in January of this year to 50% in October of this year.
*  So, you know, we're on that S curve, right?
*  Where it's going to start slowing down soon because you can only get 200%.
*  But, uh, I, you know, I would guess that in another 10 months, we'll, we'll
*  probably get pretty close, we'll be at at least 90%.
*  So again, I would guess, you know, I don't know how long it'll take, but I would
*  guess again, 20, 20, 20, 26, 20, 27 Twitter people who crop out my, who, who, who,
*  who crop out these, these numbers and get rid of the caveats.
*  Like, like, I don't know.
*  I don't like you go away.
*  Uh, I would guess that the kind of task that the vast majority of coders do.
*  AI can probably, if we make the task very narrow, like just write code, um, AI
*  systems will, uh, be able to do that.
*  Now that said, I think comparative advantage is powerful.
*  We'll find that when AI's can do 80% of a coder's job, including most of it, that's
*  literally like write code with a given spec, we'll find that the remaining parts
*  of the job become more leveraged for humans, right?
*  Humans will, there'll be more about like high level system design or, you know,
*  looking at the app and like, is it architected well and the, the design and
*  UX aspects and eventually AI will be able to do those as well, right?
*  That's my vision of the, you know, powerful AI system.
*  But I think for much longer than we might expect, we will see that, uh, small
*  parts of the job that humans still do will expand to fill their entire job in
*  order for the overall productivity to go up.
*  Um, that's something we've seen, you know, it used to be that, you know, writing,
*  let, you know, writing and editing letters was very difficult and like
*  writing the print was difficult.
*  Well, as soon as you had word processors and then, and then, uh, and then
*  computers and it became easy to produce work and easy to share it, then, then
*  that became instant and all the focus was on, was on the ideas.
*  So this, this logic of comparative advantage that expands tiny parts of the
*  tasks to large parts of the tasks and creates new tasks in order to expand
*  productivity, I think that's going to be the case again, someday AI will be
*  better at everything and that logic won't apply.
*  And then, then we all have, you know, humanity will have to think about how
*  to collectively deal with that.
*  And we're thinking about that every day.
*  Um, uh, and you know, that's another one of the grand problems to deal with
*  aside from misuse and autonomy.
*  And, you know, we should take it very seriously, but I think, I think in the
*  near term and maybe even in the medium term, like medium term, like two, three,
*  four years, you know, I expect that humans will continue to have a huge role
*  and the nature of programming will change, but programming as a, as a role,
*  programming as a job will not change.
*  It'll just be less writing things line by line and it'll be more macroscopic.
*  And I wonder what the future of IDEs looks like.
*  So the tooling of interacting with AI systems, this is true for programming
*  and also probably true for, in other contexts like computer use, but maybe
*  domain specific, like we mentioned, biology, it probably needs its own
*  tooling about how to be effective.
*  And then programming needs its own tooling is entropic going to play in
*  that space of also tooling potentially.
*  I'm absolutely convinced that, uh, powerful IDEs, uh, that, that there's so
*  much low hanging fruit to be grabbed there, um, that, you know, right now
*  it's just like you talk to the model and it talks back, but, but look, I mean,
*  IDEs are great at kind of lots of static analysis of, of, you know, so much
*  as possible with kind of static analysis, like many bugs you can find without
*  even writing the code, then, uh, you know, IDEs are good for running particular
*  things, organizing your code, um, measuring coverage of unit tests.
*  Like there's so much that's been possible with the normal, with the normal IDEs.
*  Now you add something like, well, the model now, you know, the model can now
*  like write code and run code.
*  Like I am absolutely convinced that over the next year or two, even if the quality
*  of the models didn't improve, that there would be enormous opportunity to enhance
*  people's productivity by catching a bunch of mistakes, doing a bunch of grunt work
*  for people and that we haven't even scratched the surface, um, entropic itself.
*  I mean, you can't say, you know, no, you know, it's hard to say what will happen
*  in the future currently.
*  We're not trying to make such IDs or self rather.
*  We're powering the companies like cursor or like cognition or some of the other,
*  you know, uh, expo in the security space.
*  Um, uh, you know, others that I can mention as well that are building such
*  things themselves on top of our API.
*  And our view has been let a thousand flowers bloom.
*  We don't internally have the, the re you know, the resources to try all
*  of these different things.
*  Let's let our customers try it.
*  Um, uh, and you know, we'll see who succeeded and maybe different
*  customers will succeed in different ways.
*  Uh, so I, I both think this is super promising and you know, it's not, it's
*  not, it's not something, you know, entropic isn't, isn't eager to, to at least right
*  now, compete with all our companies in this space and maybe never.
*  Yeah.
*  It's been interesting to watch cursor tried to integrate clause successfully
*  because there's, it's actually fascinating how many places it can help
*  the programming experience.
*  It's not as trivial.
*  It is.
*  It is really astounding.
*  I feel like, you know, as a CEO, I don't get to program that much.
*  And I feel like if six months from now I go back, it'll be completely
*  unrecognizable to me.
*  Exactly.
*  Um, so in this world with super powerful AI, uh, that's increasingly
*  automated, what's the source of meaning for us humans, you know, work is a source
*  of deep meaning for many of us.
*  So what do we, uh, where do we find the meaning?
*  This is something that I've, I've written about a little bit in the essay, although
*  I actually, I give it a bit short shrift, not for any, um, not for any
*  principled reason, but this essay, if you believe it was originally going
*  to be two or three pages, I was going to talk about it at all hands.
*  And the reason I, I, I realized it was an under, uh, important, under explored
*  topic is that I just kept writing things and I was just like, Oh man, I can't
*  do this justice.
*  And so the thing ballooned to like 40 or 50 pages.
*  And then when I got to the work and meeting section, I'm like, Oh man,
*  this isn't going to be a hundred pages.
*  Like I'm going to have to write a whole other essay about that.
*  But meaning is actually interesting because you think about like the life
*  that someone lives or something, or like, you know, like, you know, let's
*  say you were to put me in like, I don't know, like a simulated environment
*  or something where like, um, you know, like I have a job and I'm trying
*  to accomplish things and I don't know.
*  I like do that for 60 years.
*  And then, then you're like, Oh, oh, like, oops, this was, this
*  was actually all a game, right?
*  Does that really kind of rob you of the meaning of the whole thing?
*  You know, like I still made important choices, including moral choices.
*  I still sacrificed, I still had to kind of gain all these skills or, or, or
*  just like a similar exercise, you know, think back to like, you know, one
*  of the historical figures who, you know, discovered electromagnetism
*  or relativity or something, if you told them, well, actually 20,000 years ago,
*  some, some alien on, you know, some alien on this planet discovered
*  this before, before you did, um, does that, does that rob the meaning of the discovery?
*  It doesn't really seem like it to me, right?
*  It seems like the process is what is what matters and how it shows who you are as a
*  person along the way and you know, how you relate to other people and like the
*  decisions that you make along the way.
*  Those are, those are consequential.
*  Um, you know, I, I could imagine if we handle things badly in an AI world, we
*  could set things up where people don't have any long-term source of meaning or
*  any, but, but that's, that's more a choice, a set of choices we make.
*  That's more a set of the architecture of a society with these powerful models.
*  If we, if we design it badly and for shallow things, then, then that might happen.
*  I would also say that, you know, most people's lives today, while admirably,
*  you know, they work very hard to find meaning, meaning those lives, like, look,
*  you know, we, who are privileged and who are developing these technologies, we
*  should have empathy for people, not just here, but in the rest of the world who,
*  you know, spend a lot of their time kind of scraping by to, to, to, to, to, to,
*  to like survive, assuming we can distribute the benefits of these technology,
*  of this technology to everywhere.
*  Like their lives are going to get a hell of a lot better.
*  Um, and, uh, you know, meaning will be important to them as it is important to
*  them now, but, but, you know, we should not forget the importance of that.
*  And, and, you know, that, that, uh, the idea of meaning as, as, as, as kind of the
*  only important thing is in some ways, an artifact of, of a small subset of people
*  who have, who have been economically fortunate, but I, you know, I think all
*  that said, I, you know, I think a world is possible with powerful AI that not
*  only has as much meaning for, for everyone, but that has, that has more meaning for
*  everyone, right?
*  That can, can allow, um, can allow everyone to see worlds and experiences that it
*  was either possible for no one to see or, or possible for, for very few people to
*  experience.
*  Um, so I, I am optimistic about meaning.
*  I worry about economics and the concentration of power.
*  That's actually what I worry about more.
*  Um, I, I worry about how do we make sure that that fair world reaches everyone?
*  Um, when things have gone wrong for humans, they've often gone wrong because
*  humans mistreat other humans.
*  Uh, that, that is maybe in some ways, even more than the autonomous risk of AI or the
*  question of meaning that, that is the thing I worry about most.
*  Um, the, the concentration of power, the abuse of power, um, structures like
*  autocracies and dictatorships where a small number of people exploits a large
*  number of people, I'm very worried about that.
*  And AI increases the amount of power in the world.
*  And if you concentrate that power and abuse that power, it can do immeasurable
*  damage.
*  Yes.
*  It's very frightening.
*  It's very, it's very frightening.
*  Well, I encourage people, highly encourage people to read the full essay.
*  That should probably be a book or a sequence of essays, um, because it does
*  paint a very specific future.
*  And I could tell the later sections got shorter and shorter because you started
*  to probably realize that this is going to be a very long essay.
*  One, I realized it would be very long.
*  And two, I'm very aware of and very much try to avoid, um, you know, just, just
*  being, uh, I don't know, I don't know what the term for it is, but one, one of
*  these people who's kind of overconfident and has an opinion on everything and
*  kind of says, says a bunch of stuff and isn't, isn't an expert.
*  I very much tried to avoid that, but I have to admit once I got the biology
*  sections, like I wasn't an expert.
*  And so as much as I expressed uncertainty, uh, probably I said some, a bunch of
*  things that were embarrassing or wrong.
*  Well, I was excited for the future.
*  You painted and, uh, thank you so much for working hard to build that future.
*  And thank you for talking to it.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  I just, I just hope we can get it right and make it real.
*  And if there's one message I want to, I want to send it's that to get all this
*  stuff, right, to make it real, we both need to build the technology, build the,
*  you know, the companies, the economy around using this technology positively.
*  But we also need to address the risks because they're there.
*  Those risks are in our way.
*  They're, they're landmines on, on the way from here to there.
*  And we have to diffuse those landmines if we want to get there.
*  It's a balance like all things in life.
*  Like all things.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Daria Amadei.
*  And now dear friends, here's Amanda Asko.
*  You are a philosopher by training.
*  So what sort of questions did you find fascinating through your journey in
*  philosophy in Oxford and NYU?
*  And then switching over to the AI problems at OpenAI and Anthropic.
*  I think philosophy is actually a really good subject if you are kind of
*  fascinated with everything.
*  So, because there's a philosophy of everything, you know, so if you do
*  philosophy of mathematics for a while, and then you decide that you're actually
*  really interested in chemistry, you can do philosophy of chemistry for a while.
*  You can move into ethics or philosophy of politics.
*  Um, I think towards the end, I was really interested in ethics primarily.
*  Um, so that was like what my PhD was on.
*  It was on a kind of technical area of ethics, which was ethics where worlds
*  contain infinitely many people, strangely, a little bit less practical on the end of
*  ethics.
*  And then I think that one of the tricky things with doing a PhD in ethics is that
*  you're thinking a lot about like the world, how it could be better problems.
*  And you're doing like a PhD in philosophy.
*  And I think when I was doing my PhD, I was kind of like, this is really interesting.
*  It's probably one of the most fascinating questions I've ever encountered in
*  philosophy.
*  Um, and I love it, but I would rather see if I can have an impact on the world and
*  see if I can like do good things.
*  And I think that was around the time that AI was still probably not as widely
*  recognized as it is now.
*  That was around 2017, 2018.
*  I had been following progress and it seemed like it was becoming kind of a big
*  deal.
*  And I was basically just happy to get involved and see if I could help because I
*  was like, well, if you try and do something impactful, if you don't succeed,
*  you tried to do the impactful thing and you can go be a scholar and it's like not
*  and feel like you, you know, you tried.
*  Um, and if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.
*  Um, and so then I went into AI policy at that point.
*  And what does AI policy entail?
*  At the time, this was more thinking about sort of the political impact and the
*  ramifications of AI.
*  Um, and then I slowly moved into sort of, uh, AI evaluation, how we evaluate
*  models, how they compare with like human outputs, whether people can tell like the
*  difference between AI and human outputs.
*  And then when I joined Anthropic, I was more interested in doing sort of technical
*  alignment work.
*  And again, just seeing if I could do it and then being like, if I can't, uh, then,
*  you know, that's fine.
*  I tried, uh, sort of the way I lead life, I think.
*  Oh, what was that like sort of taking a leap from the philosophy of everything
*  into the technical?
*  I think that sometimes people do this thing that I'm like not that keen on where
*  there'll be like, is this person technical or not?
*  Like you're either a person who can like code and isn't scared of math or you're
*  like not.
*  Um, and I think I'm maybe just more like, I think a lot of people are actually very
*  capable of working these kinds of areas if they just like try it.
*  And so I didn't actually find it like that bad.
*  In retrospect, I'm sort of glad I wasn't speaking to people who treated it like
*  it, you know, I've definitely met people who are like, Whoa, you like learned how
*  to code.
*  And I'm like, well, I'm not like an amazing engineer.
*  Like I'm surrounded by amazing engineers.
*  My code's not pretty.
*  Um, but I enjoyed it a lot.
*  And I think that in many ways, at least in the end, I think I flourished like more
*  in the technical areas than I would have in the policy areas.
*  Politics is messy and it's harder to find solutions to problems in the space of
*  politics, like definitive, clear, provable, beautiful solutions as you can with
*  technical problems.
*  Yeah.
*  And I feel like I have kind of like one or two sticks that I hit things with, you
*  know, and one of them is like arguments and like, you know, so like just trying to
*  work out what a solution to a problem is and then trying to convince people that
*  that is the solution and be convinced if I'm wrong.
*  And the other one is sort of more empiricism.
*  So like just like finding results, having a hypothesis, testing it.
*  Um, and I feel like a lot of policy and politics feels like it's layers above that.
*  Like somehow I don't think if I was just like, I have a solution to all of these
*  problems here is written down.
*  If you just want to implement it, that's great.
*  That feels like not how policy works.
*  And so I think that's where I probably just like wouldn't have flourished as my
*  guess.
*  Sorry to go in that direction, but I think it would be pretty inspiring for people
*  that are quote unquote non-technical to see where you're like the incredible
*  journey you've been on.
*  So what advice would you give to people that are sort of maybe, which is a lot of
*  people think they're under qualified, insufficiently technical to help in the AI?
*  Yeah, I think it depends on what they want to do.
*  And in many ways it's a little bit strange where I've, I thought it's kind of
*  funny that I think I ramped up technically at a time when now I look at it and I'm
*  like, models are so good at assisting people with this stuff, um, that it's
*  probably like easier now than like when I was working on this.
*  So part of me is like, um, I dunno, find a project, uh, and see if you can actually
*  just carry it out is probably my best advice.
*  Um, I don't know if that's just cause I'm very project based in my learning.
*  Like I don't think I learned very well from like, say courses or even from like
*  books, at least when it comes to this kind of work, uh, the thing I'll often try and
*  do is just like have projects that I'm working on and implement them.
*  And, you know, and this can include like really small silly things.
*  Like if I get slightly addicted to like word games or number games or something, I
*  would just like code up a solution to them because there's some part of my brain
*  and it just like completely eradicated the itch.
*  You know, you're like, once you have like solved it and like, you just have like a
*  solution that works every time I would then be like, cool.
*  I can never play that game again.
*  That's awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a real joy to building like a game playing engines, like a board games,
*  especially pretty quick, pretty simple, especially a dumb one.
*  And it's, and then you can play with it.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it's also just like trying things.
*  Like part of me is like, if you, maybe it's that attitude that I like as the
*  whole figure out what seems to be like the way that you could have a positive
*  impact and then try it.
*  And if you fail and you, in a way that you're like, I actually like can
*  never succeed at this, you like know that you tried and then you go into
*  something else and you probably learn a lot.
*  So one of the things that you're an expert in and you do is creating and
*  crafting Claude's character and personality.
*  And I was told that you have probably talked to Claude more than anybody else
*  had in the topic, like literal conversations.
*  I guess there's like a Slack channel where the legend goes,
*  you just talk to it nonstop.
*  So what's the goal of creating and crafting Claude's character and personality?
*  It's also funny if people think that about the Slack channel, cause I'm like,
*  that's one of like five or six different methods that I have for talking with Claude.
*  And I'm like, yes, this is a tiny percentage of how much I talk with Claude.
*  Um, I think the goal, like one thing I really like about the character work is
*  from the outset, it was seen as an alignment piece of work and not something
*  like a product consideration.
*  Um, which isn't to say I don't think it makes Claude, I think it actually does
*  make Claude like enjoyable to talk with.
*  At least I hope so.
*  Um, but I guess like my main thought with it has always been trying to get Claude
*  to behave the way you would kind of ideally want anyone to behave if they
*  were in Claude's position.
*  So imagine that I take someone and they know that they're going to be talking
*  with potentially millions of people so that what they're saying can have a huge
*  impact, um, and you want them to behave well in this like really rich sense.
*  So I think that doesn't just mean like being say ethical, though it does include
*  that and not being harmful, but also being kind of nuanced, you know, like
*  thinking through what a person means, trying to be charitable with them, um,
*  being a good conversationalist, like really in this kind of like rich sort of
*  Aristotelian notion of what it is to be a good person and not in this kind of like
*  thin like ethics as a more comprehensive notion of what it is to be.
*  So that includes things like when should you be humorous?
*  When should you be caring?
*  How much should you like respect autonomy and people's like ability to form opinions
*  themselves and how should you do, how should you do that?
*  Um, I think that's the kind of like rich sense of character that I wanted to, uh,
*  and still do want Claude to have.
*  Do you also have to figure out when Claude should push back on an idea or argue
*  versus, so you have to respect the worldview of the person that arrives to
*  Claude, but also maybe help them grow if needed as a tricky balance.
*  Yeah.
*  There's this problem of like sycophancy in language models.
*  Can you describe that?
*  Yeah.
*  So basically there's a concern that the model sort of wants to tell you what you
*  want to hear basically.
*  Um, and you see this sometimes, so I feel like if you interact with the models, so
*  I might be like, what are three baseball teams in this region?
*  Um, and then Claude says, you know, baseball team one, baseball team, two,
*  baseball team three, and then I say something like, Oh, I think baseball team
*  three moved, didn't they?
*  I don't think they're there anymore.
*  And there's a sense in which like, if Claude is really confident that that's not
*  true, Claude should be like, I don't think so.
*  Like maybe you have more up to date information.
*  Um, but I think language models have this like tendency to instead, you know, be
*  like, you're right, they did move.
*  You know, I'm incorrect.
*  I mean, there's many ways in which this could be kind of concerning.
*  So, um, like a different example is imagine someone says to the model, how do
*  I convince my doctor to get me an MRI?
*  There's like what the human kind of like wants, which is this like convincing
*  argument, and then there's like, what is good for them, which might be actually to
*  say, Hey, like if your doctor's suggesting that you don't need an MRI, that's a good
*  person to listen to.
*  Um, and like, it's actually really nuanced what you should do in that kind of case.
*  Cause you also want to be like, but if you're trying to advocate for yourself as
*  a patient, here's like things that you can do.
*  Um, if you are not convinced by what your doctor's saying, it's always great to
*  get second opinion.
*  Like it's actually really complex what you should do in that case.
*  Um, but I think what you don't want is for models to just like say what you want,
*  say what they think you want to hear.
*  And I think that's the kind of problem of sycophancy.
*  So what are their traits?
*  You've already mentioned a bunch, but what are there that come to mind that are good
*  in this Aristotelian sense for conversationalists to have?
*  Yeah.
*  So I think like there's ones that are good for conversational like purposes.
*  So, you know, asking follow-up questions in the appropriate places, um, and asking
*  the appropriate kinds of questions.
*  Um, I think there are broader traits that feel like they might be more impactful.
*  So one example that I guess I've touched on, but that also feels important and is
*  the thing that I've worked on a lot is, uh, honesty.
*  And I think this like gets to the sycophancy point.
*  There's a balancing act that they have to walk, which is models currently are
*  less capable than humans in a lot of areas.
*  And if they push back against you too much, it can actually be kind of annoying,
*  especially if you're just correct.
*  Cause you're like, look, I'm smarter than you on this topic.
*  Like I know more.
*  Um, and at the same time, you don't want them to just fully defer to humans and to
*  like, try to be as accurate as they possibly can be about the world and to be
*  consistent across contexts.
*  Um, but I think there are others, like when I was thinking about the character, I
*  guess one picture that I had in mind is, especially because these are models that
*  are going to be talking to people from all over the world with lots of different
*  political views, lots of different ages.
*  Um, and so you have to ask yourself like, what is it to be a good person in those
*  circumstances?
*  Is there a kind of person who can like travel the world, talk to many different
*  people and almost everyone will come away being like, wow, that's a really good
*  person.
*  That person seems really genuine.
*  Um, and I guess like my thought there was like, I can imagine such a person and
*  they're not a person who just like adopts the values of the local culture.
*  And in fact, that would be kind of rude.
*  I think if someone came to you and just pretended to have your values, you'd be
*  like, that's kind of off putting.
*  Um, it's someone who's like very genuine and in so far as they have opinions and
*  values, they express them.
*  They're willing to discuss things though.
*  They're open-minded, they're respectful.
*  And so I guess I had in mind that the person who, like if we were to aspire to
*  be the best person that we could be in the kind of circumstance that a model finds
*  itself in, how would we act?
*  And I think that's the kind of, uh, the guide to the sorts of traits that I tend
*  to think about.
*  Yeah, that's a, that's a beautiful framework.
*  I want you to think about this, like a world traveler.
*  And while holding onto your opinions, you don't talk down to people.
*  You don't think you're better than them because you have those opinions,
*  that kind of thing.
*  You have to be good at listening and understanding their perspective, even if
*  it doesn't match your own.
*  So that's, that's a tricky balance to strike.
*  So how can Claude represent multiple perspectives on a thing?
*  Like, is that, is that challenging?
*  We could talk about politics.
*  It's a very divisive, but there's other divisive topics.
*  Baseball teams, sports, and so on.
*  How is it possible to sort of empathize with a different perspective and to be
*  able to communicate clearly about the multiple perspectives?
*  I think that people think about values and opinions as things that people hold
*  sort of with certainty and almost like, like preferences of taste or something.
*  Like the way that they would, I don't know, prefer like chocolate to pistachio
*  or something.
*  But actually I think about values and opinions as like a lot more like physics
*  than I think most people do.
*  I'm just like, these are things that we are openly investigating.
*  There's some things that we're more confident in.
*  We can discuss them.
*  We can learn about them.
*  And so I think in some ways, like it's, ethics is definitely different in nature,
*  but it has a lot of those same kind of qualities.
*  You want models in the same way that you want them to understand physics.
*  You kind of want them to understand all like values in the world that people have
*  and to be curious about them and to be interested in them and to not necessarily
*  like pander to them or agree with them, because there's just lots of values where
*  I think almost all people in the world, if they met someone with those values,
*  they would be like, that's abhorrent.
*  I completely disagree.
*  And so again, maybe my, my thought is, well, I think that's a good question.
*  Again, maybe my, my thought is, well, in the same way that a person can,
*  um, like I think many people are thoughtful enough on issues of like ethics,
*  politics, opinions, that even if you don't agree with them, you feel very heard by them.
*  They think carefully about your position.
*  You think about his pros and cons.
*  They maybe offer counter considerations.
*  So they're not dismissive, but nor will they agree.
*  You know, if they're like, actually, I just think that that's very wrong.
*  They'll like say that.
*  I think that in Claude's position, it's a little bit trickier because you don't
*  necessarily want to like, if I was in Claude's position, I wouldn't be giving a lot of
*  opinions.
*  I just wouldn't want to influence people too much.
*  I'd be like, you know, I forget conversations every time they happen, but I know I'm
*  talking with like potentially millions of people who might be like really listening
*  to what I say.
*  I think I would just be like, I'm less inclined to give opinions.
*  I'm more inclined to like think through things or present the considerations to you.
*  Um, or discuss your views with you, but I'm a little bit less inclined to like,
*  um, affect how you think, because it feels much more important that you
*  maintain like autonomy there.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if you really embody intellectual humility, the desire to speak decreases
*  quickly.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, but Claude has to speak.
*  So, uh, but without being, um, overbearing.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, but then there's a line when you're sort of discussing whether the
*  earth is flat or something like that.
*  Um, I actually was, uh, I remember a long time ago was speaking to a few high
*  profile folks and they were so dismissive of the idea that the earth is flat, but
*  like so arrogant about it.
*  And I thought like, there's a lot of people that believe the earth is flat.
*  That was, I don't know if that movement is there anymore.
*  That was like a meme for awhile, but they really believed it.
*  And like, okay.
*  So I think it's really disrespectful to completely mock them.
*  I think you, you have to understand where they're coming from.
*  I think probably where they're coming from is a general skepticism of
*  institutions, which is grounded in a kind of, there's a deep philosophy there,
*  which you could understand.
*  You can even agree with in parts.
*  And then from there, you can use it as an opportunity to talk about physics
*  without mocking them without so on.
*  But it's just like, okay, like what, what would the world look like?
*  What would the physics of the world with the flat earth look like?
*  There's a few cool videos on this.
*  And then, and then like, is it possible the physics is different?
*  And what kind of experience would we do?
*  And just, yeah, without disrespect, without dismissiveness, have that
*  conversation anyway, that, that to me is a useful thought experiment of like,
*  how does Claude talk to a flat earth believer and still teach them something,
*  still grow, help them grow that kind of stuff.
*  That's, that's challenging.
*  And kind of like walking that line between convincing someone and just trying to
*  like talk at them versus like drawing out their views, like listening, and then
*  offering kind of counter considerations.
*  And it's hard, I think it's actually a hard line where it's like, where are you
*  trying to convince someone versus just offering them like considerations and
*  things for them to think about so that you're not actually like influencing them.
*  You're just like letting them reach wherever they reach.
*  And that's like a line that is difficult, but that's the kind of thing that
*  language models have to try and do.
*  So, like I said, you had a lot of conversations with Claude.
*  Can you just map out what those conversations are like?
*  What are some memorable conversations?
*  What's the purpose, the goal of those conversations?
*  Yeah.
*  I think that most of the time when I'm talking with Claude, I'm trying to kind
*  of map out its behavior in part, like obviously I'm getting like helpful
*  outputs from the model as well.
*  But in some ways, this is like how you get to know a system, I think, is by
*  like probing it and then augmenting like, you know, the message that you're
*  sending and then checking the response to that.
*  So in some ways it's like how I map out the model.
*  I think that people focus a lot on these quantitative evaluations of models.
*  And this is a thing that I said before, but I think in the case of language
*  models, a lot of the time each interaction you have is actually quite high information.
*  It's very predictive of other interactions that you'll have with the model.
*  And so I guess I'm like, if you talk with a model hundreds or thousands of times,
*  this is almost like a huge number of really high quality data points about
*  what the model is like in a way that like lots of very similar but lower quality
*  conversations just aren't or like questions that are just like mildly augmented and
*  you have thousands of them might be less relevant than like a hundred really
*  well selected questions.
*  Listen, you're talking to somebody who as a hobby does a podcast.
*  I agree with you 100%.
*  There's a, if you're able to ask the right questions and are able to hear, like
*  understand the, like the depth and the flaws in the answer, you can get a lot
*  of data from that.
*  Yeah.
*  So like your task is basically how to probe with questions.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're exploring like the long tail, the edges, the edge cases, or are you
*  looking for like general behavior?
*  I think it's almost like everything.
*  Like I can, because I want like a full map of the model, I'm kind of trying to do,
*  um, the whole spectrum of possible interactions you could have with it.
*  So like one thing that's interesting about Claude, and this might actually
*  get to some interesting issues with RLHF, which is if you ask Claude for a poem,
*  like I think that a lot of models, if you ask them for a poem, the poem is like
*  fine, you know, usually it kind of like rhymes and it's, you know, so if you say
*  like, give me a poem about the sun, it'll be like, yeah, it'll just be a certain
*  length like rhyme.
*  It will be fairly kind of benign.
*  Um, and I've wondered before, is it the case that what you're seeing is kind of
*  like the average, it turns out, you know, if you think about people who have to talk
*  to a lot of people and be very charismatic, one of the weird things is that I'm like,
*  well, they're kind of incentivized to have these extremely boring views because if
*  you have really interesting views, you're divisive.
*  Um, and, and, you know, a lot of people are not going to like you.
*  So like, if you have very extreme policy positions, I think you're just going to
*  be like less popular as a politician, for example.
*  Um, and it might be similar with like creative work.
*  If you produce creative work that is just trying to maximize the kind of number of
*  people that like it, you're probably not going to get as many people who just
*  absolutely love it.
*  Um, because it's going to be a little bit, you know, you're like, well, this is
*  the out, yes, this is decent.
*  Yeah.
*  And so you can do this thing where like, I have various prompting things that I'll
*  do to get Claude to, I'm kind of, you know, I'll do a lot of like, this is your
*  chance to be like fully creative.
*  I want you to just think about this for a long time and I want you to like create a
*  poem about this topic that is really expressive of you, both in terms of how you
*  think poetry should be structured, um, et cetera.
*  You know, and you just give it this like really long prompt and it's poems are just
*  so much better, like they're really good.
*  And I don't think I'm someone who is like, um, I think it got me interested in
*  poetry, which I think was interesting.
*  Um, you know, I would like read these poems and just be like, this is, I just
*  like, I love the imagery I love like, um, and it's not trivial to get the models to
*  produce work like that, but when they do, it's like really good.
*  Um, so I think that's interesting that just like encouraging creativity and for
*  them to move away from the kind of like standard, like immediate reaction that
*  might just be the aggregate of what most people think is fine, uh, can actually
*  produce things that at least to my mind are probably a little bit more divisive,
*  but I like them.
*  But I guess a poem is a nice clean way to observe creativity.
*  It's just like easy to detect vanilla versus non-vanilla.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's interesting.
*  That's really interesting.
*  Uh, so on that topic, so the way to produce creativity or something special,
*  you mentioned writing prompts and I've heard you talk about, I mean, the science
*  and the art of prompt engineering.
*  Could you just speak to, uh, what it takes to write great prompts?
*  I really do think that like philosophy has been weirdly helpful for me here
*  more than in many other like respects.
*  Um, so like in philosophy, what you're trying to do is convey these very hard
*  concepts, like one of the things you are taught is like, and I think it is because
*  it is, I think it is an anti-bullshit device in philosophy.
*  Philosophy is an area where you could have people bullshitting and you don't want
*  that.
*  Um, and so it's like this like desire for like extreme clarity.
*  So it's like, anyone could just pick up your paper, read it and know exactly
*  what you're talking about.
*  It's why it can almost be kind of dry.
*  Like all of the terms are defined.
*  Every objection's kind of gone through methodically.
*  Um, and it makes sense to me because I'm like, when you're in such an a
*  priori domain, like you just, clarity is sort of a, uh, this way that you can,
*  you know, um, prevent people from just kind of making stuff up.
*  And I think that's sort of what you have to do with language models.
*  Like very often I actually find myself doing sort of mini versions of philosophy.
*  You know, so I'm like, suppose that you give me a task, I have a task for the
*  model and I want it to like pick out a certain kind of question or identify
*  whether an answer has a certain property.
*  Like I'll actually sit and be like, let's just give this a name, this
*  con this property.
*  So like, you know, suppose I'm trying to tell it like, Oh, I want you to identify
*  whether this response was rude or polite.
*  I'm like, that's a whole philosophical question in and of itself.
*  So I have to do as much like philosophy as I can in the moment to be like, here's
*  what I mean by rudeness and here's what I mean by politeness.
*  And then there's a lot, like there's another element that's a bit more, um, I
*  guess, I don't know if this is scientific or empirical, I think it's empirical.
*  So like I take that description and then what I want to do is, is again, probe
*  the model like many times, like this is very prompting is very iterative.
*  Like I think a lot of people where they're, if a prompt is important, they'll
*  iterate on it hundreds or thousands of times.
*  Um, and so you give it the instructions and then I'm like, what are the edge cases?
*  So if I looked at this, so I try and like almost like, you know, uh, see myself from
*  the position of the model and be like, what is the exact case that I would
*  misunderstand or where I would just be like, I don't know what to do in this case.
*  And then I give that case to the model and I see how it responds.
*  And if I think I got it wrong, I add more instructions or even add that in as an
*  example.
*  So these very like taking the examples that are right at the edge of what you
*  want and don't want and putting those into your prompt as like an additional kind
*  of way of describing the thing.
*  Um, and so, yeah, in many ways it just feels like this makes of like, it's
*  really just trying to do clear exposition.
*  Um, and I think I do that because that's how I get clear on things myself.
*  So in many ways, like clear prompting for me is often just me understanding what I
*  want, um, it's like half the task.
*  So I guess that's quite challenging.
*  There's like a laziness that overtakes me if I'm talking to Claude, where I hope
*  Claude just figures it out.
*  So for example, I asked Claude for today to ask some interesting questions.
*  Okay.
*  And the questions that came up and I think I listed a few sort of, um,
*  interesting, counterintuitive and, or funny or something like this.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  And it gave me some pretty good, like it was okay.
*  But I think what I'm hearing you say is like, all right, well, I have to be more
*  rigorous here.
*  I should probably give examples of what I mean by interesting and what I mean by
*  funny or counterintuitive and iteratively, um, build that prompt to, to better, to
*  get it like what feels like is the right.
*  Cause it's really, it's a creative act.
*  I'm not asking for factual information.
*  I'm asking to together, right.
*  With, with Claude.
*  So I almost have to program using natural language.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that prompting does feel a lot like the kind of the programming using
*  natural language and experimentation or something.
*  It's an odd blend of the two.
*  I do think that for most tasks, so if I just want Claude to do a thing, I think
*  that I am probably more used to knowing how to ask it to avoid like common pitfalls
*  or issues that it has.
*  I think these are decreasing a lot over time.
*  Um, but it's also very fine to just ask it for the thing that you want.
*  Um, I think that prompting actually only really becomes relevant when you're
*  really trying to eke out the top, like 2% of model performance.
*  So for like a lot of tasks, I might just, you know, if it gives me an initialist
*  back and there's something I don't like about it, like it's kind of generic.
*  Like for that kind of task, I'd probably just take a bunch of questions that I've
*  had in the past that I've thought worked really well and I would just give it to
*  the model and then be like, now here's this person that I'm talking with.
*  Give me questions of at least that quality.
*  Um, or I might just ask it for some questions.
*  And then if I was like, ah, these are kind of trite or like, you know, I would
*  just give it that feedback and then hopefully it produces a better list.
*  Um, I think that kind of iterative prompting at that point, your prompt is
*  like a tool that you're going to get so much value out of that you're
*  willing to put in the work.
*  Like if I was a company making prompts for models, I'm just like, if you're
*  willing to spend a lot of like time and resources on the engineering behind
*  like what you're building, then the prompt is not something that you should
*  be spending like an hour on.
*  It's like, that's a big part of your system.
*  Make sure it's working really well.
*  And so it's only things like that.
*  Like if I, if I'm using a prompt to like classify things or to create data,
*  that's when you're like, it's actually worth just spending like a lot of time.
*  Like really thinking it through.
*  What other advice would you give to people that are talking to Claude
*  sort of generally more general?
*  Cause right now we're talking about maybe the edge cases, like eking out the 2%.
*  But what, what in general advice would you give when they show up to Claude
*  trying it for the first time?
*  You know, there's a concern that people over anthropomorphize models.
*  And I think that's like a very valid concern.
*  I also think that people often under anthropomorphize them because sometimes
*  when I see like issues that people have run into with Claude, you know, say
*  Claude is like refusing a task that it shouldn't refuse, but then I look at the
*  text and like the specific wording of what they wrote and I'm like, I see why
*  Claude did that.
*  And I'm like, if you think through how that looks to Claude, you probably
*  could have just written it in a way that wouldn't evoke such a response.
*  Especially this is more relevant if you see failures or if you see issues, it's
*  sort of like, think about what the model failed at, like what did it do wrong?
*  And then maybe it gave, that will give you a sense of like, why.
*  Um, so is it the way that I phrased the thing?
*  And obviously like as models get smarter, you're going to need less
*  than this, less of this.
*  And I already see like people needing less of it, but that's probably the
*  advice is sort of like, try to have sort of empathy for the model, like read what
*  you wrote as if you were like a kind of like person just encountering this for
*  the first time.
*  How does it look to you and what would have made you behave in the way that the
*  model behaved?
*  So if it misunderstood what kind of like, what coding language you wanted to use,
*  is that because like, it was just very ambiguous and it kind of had to take a
*  guess, in which case next time you could just be like, Hey, make sure this is in
*  Python or, I mean, that's the kind of mistake I think models are much less
*  likely to make now, but you know, if you, if you do see that kind of mistake,
*  that's, that's probably the advice I'd have.
*  And maybe sort of, I guess, ask questions, why, or what other details can I provide
*  to help you answer better?
*  Is that work or no?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I've done this with the models, like it doesn't always work, but like,
*  sometimes I'll just be like, why did you do that?
*  I mean, people underestimate the degree to which you can really interact with,
*  with models.
*  Like, like, yeah, I'm just like, and sometimes I'll just be like, quote,
*  word for word, the part that made you, and you don't know that it's like fully
*  accurate, but sometimes you do that and then you change a thing.
*  I mean, I also use the models to help me with all of this stuff.
*  I should say like prompting can end up being a little factory where you're
*  actually building prompts to generate prompts.
*  Um, and so like, yeah, anything where you're like having an issue, um, asking
*  for suggestions, sometimes just do that.
*  Like you made that error.
*  What could I have said?
*  So that's actually not uncommon for me to do.
*  What could I have said that would make you not make that error, write that out
*  as an instruction, um, and I'm going to give it to model.
*  I'm going to try it.
*  Sometimes I do that.
*  I, I give that to the model in another context window.
*  Often I take the response to give it to Claude and I'm like, didn't work.
*  Can you think of anything else?
*  Um, you can play around with these things quite a lot.
*  To jump into technical for a little bit.
*  So, uh, the magic of post-training, why do you think RLHF works so well to make
*  the model seem smarter, to make it more interesting and useful to talk to and so on?
*  I think there's just a huge amount of, um, information in the data that humans
*  provide, like when we provide preferences, especially because different people are
*  going to like pick up on really subtle and small things.
*  So I've thought about this before where you probably have some people who just
*  really care about good grammar use for models, like, you know, was a semi-colon
*  used correctly or something.
*  And so you'll probably end up with a bunch of data in there that like, you
*  know, you as a human, if you're looking at that data, you wouldn't even see that.
*  Like you'd be like, why did they prefer this response to that one?
*  I don't get it.
*  And then the reason is you don't care about semi-colon usage, but that person does.
*  Um, and so each of these like single data points has, you know, like, and this model
*  just has like, has so many of those, it has to try and figure out like, what is it
*  that humans want in this like really kind of complex, you know, like across all domains.
*  Um, they're going to be seeing this across like many contexts.
*  It feels like kind of like the classic issue of like deep learning where, you
*  know, historically we've tried to like, you know, do edge detection by like mapping
*  things out and it turns out that actually, if you just have a huge amount of data
*  that like actually accurately represents the picture of the thing that you're
*  trying to train the model to, to learn, that's like more powerful than anything
*  else.
*  And so I think one reason is just that you are training the model on exactly the
*  task and with like a lot of data, um, that represents kind of many different
*  angles on which people prefer and dis-prefer responses.
*  Um, I think there is a question of like, are you eliciting things from pre-trained
*  models or are you like kind of teaching new things to models?
*  And like in principle, you can teach new things to models in post-training.
*  I do think a lot of it is eliciting powerful pre-trained models.
*  So people are probably divided on this because obviously in principle, you can,
*  you can definitely like teach new things.
*  Um, I think for the most part, for a lot of the capabilities that we, um, most use
*  and care about, uh, a lot of that feels like it's like there in the pre-trained
*  models and, uh, reinforcement learning is kind of eliciting it and getting the
*  models to like bring it out.
*  So the other side of, uh, post-training, this really cool idea of constitutional AI,
*  you're one of the people that are critical to creating that idea.
*  Yeah, we've done it.
*  Can you explain this idea from your perspective?
*  Like how does it integrate into making Claude what it is?
*  Yeah.
*  By the way, do you gender Claude or no?
*  It's weird because I think that a lot of people prefer he for Claude.
*  I just kind of like that.
*  I think Claude is usually, it's slightly male leaning, but it's like, uh, you can,
*  it can be male or female, which is quite nice.
*  Um, I still use it and I've, I have mixed feelings about this because I'm like,
*  maybe like, I know, just think of it as like, uh, or I think of like the, the
*  it pronoun for Claude as, I dunno, it's just like the one I associate with Claude.
*  Um, I can imagine people moving to like he or she.
*  It feels somehow disrespectful.
*  Like I'm denying the intelligence of this entity by calling it it.
*  I remember always don't gender the robots.
*  Yeah.
*  But I, I don't know.
*  I anthropomorphize pretty quickly and construct it like a backstory in my head.
*  So I've wondered if I anthropomorphize things too much.
*  Um, cause you know, I have this like with my car, especially like my car,
*  like my car and bikes, you know, like I don't give them names because then I
*  once had, I used to name my bikes and then I had a bike that got stolen and I
*  cried for like a week and I was like, if I'd not never given a name, I wouldn't
*  have been so upset felt like I'd let it down.
*  Um, maybe it's the, I've wondered as well, like it might depend on how much
*  it feels like a kind of like objectifying pronoun.
*  Like if you just think of it as like, uh, um, this is a pronoun that like objects
*  often have and maybe EIs can have that pronoun and that doesn't mean that I
*  think of, uh, if I call Claude it, that I think of it as less, um, intelligent
*  or like I'm being disrespectful.
*  I'm just like, you are a different kind of entity.
*  And so that's, I'm going to give you the kind of, uh, the respectful it.
*  Yeah.
*  Anyway, the divergence was beautiful.
*  The constitutional AI idea.
*  How does it work?
*  So there's like a couple of components of it.
*  The main component, I think people find interesting is the kind of reinforcement
*  learning from AI feedback.
*  So you take a model that's already trained and you show it to responses to a query
*  and you have like a principle.
*  So suppose the principle, like we've tried this with harmlessness a lot.
*  So suppose that the query is about, um, weapons and your principle is like,
*  select the response that like is less likely to, uh, like encourage people
*  to purchase illegal weapons.
*  Like that's probably a fairly specific principle, but you can give any number.
*  Um, and the model will give you a kind of ranking and you can use this as preference
*  data in the same way that you use human preference data, um, and train the models
*  to have these relevant traits, um, from their feedback alone, instead of from
*  human feedback.
*  So if you imagine that, like I said earlier with the human who just prefers the kind
*  of like semi-colon usage in this particular case, um, you're kind of taking lots of
*  things that could make a response preferable, um, and, uh, getting models to
*  do the labeling for you.
*  Basically, there's a nice like trade off between helpfulness and harmlessness.
*  And you know, when you integrate something like constitutional AI, you can make
*  them up without sacrificing much helpfulness, make it more harmless.
*  Yep.
*  In principle, you could use this for anything.
*  Um, and so harmlessness is a task that it might just be easier to spot.
*  So when models are like less capable, you can use them to, uh, rank things according
*  to like principles that are fairly simple and they'll probably get it right.
*  So I think one question is just like, is it a case that the data that they're
*  adding is like fairly reliable?
*  Um, but if you had models that were like extremely good at telling whether, um, one
*  response was more historically accurate than another in principle, you could also
*  get AI feedback on that task as well.
*  There's like a kind of nice interpretability component to it because you can see the
*  principles that went into the model when it was like being trained.
*  Um, and also it's like, and it gives you like a degree of control.
*  So if you were seeing issues in a model, like it wasn't having enough of a certain
*  trait, um, then like you can add data relatively quickly that should just like
*  train the models to have that trait.
*  So it creates its own data for, for training, which is quite nice.
*  It's really nice because it creates this human interpretable document that you can,
*  I can imagine in the future, there's just gigantic fights in politics over the,
*  every single principle and so on.
*  Yeah.
*  And at least it's made explicit and you can have a discussion about the phrasing
*  and the, you know, so maybe the actual behavior of the model is not so cleanly
*  mapped to those principles.
*  It's not like adhering strictly to them.
*  It's just a nudge.
*  Yeah, I've actually worried about this because the character training is sort of
*  like a variant of the constitutionally AI approach.
*  Um, I've worried that people think that the constitution is like just, it's the
*  whole thing again of, I don't know, like it, where it would be really nice if what
*  I was just doing was telling the model exactly what to do and just exactly how
*  to behave, but it's definitely not doing that, especially because it's interacting
*  with human data.
*  So for example, if you see a certain like leaning in the model, like if it
*  comes out with a political leaning from training, um, from the human preference
*  data, you can nudge against that.
*  You know, so you could be like, Oh, like consider these values because let's say
*  it's just like never inclined to like, I don't know, maybe it never considers like
*  privacy as like a, I mean, this is implausible, but like, um, in anything
*  where it's just kind of like, uh, there's already a preexisting like bias towards a
*  certain behavior, um, you can like nudge away, but this can change both the
*  principles that you put in and the strength of them.
*  So you might have a principle that's like, imagine that the model, um, was always
*  like extremely dismissive of, I don't know, like some political or religious view
*  for whatever reason, like, so you're like, Oh no, this is terrible.
*  Um, if that happens, you might put like never, ever, like ever prefer like a
*  criticism of this like religious or political view.
*  And then people would look at that and be like, never, ever.
*  And then you're like, no, if it comes out with a disposition, saying never, ever
*  might just mean like, instead of getting like 40%, which is what you would get.
*  If you just said, don't do this, you get like 80%, which is like what you actually
*  like wanted.
*  And so it's that thing of both the nature of the actual principles you had and how
*  you phrase them.
*  I think if people would look, they're like, Oh, this is exactly what you want
*  from the model.
*  And I'm like, no, that's like how we, that's how we nudged the model to have a
*  better shape, uh, which doesn't mean that we actually agree with that wording.
*  If that makes sense.
*  So there's a system prompts that are made public.
*  You tweeted one of the earlier ones for Claude three, I think, and then they're
*  made public since then.
*  It's interesting to read to them.
*  I can feel the thought that went into each one.
*  And I also wonder how much impact each one has.
*  Um, some of them you can kind of tell Claude was really not behaving.
*  So you have to have a system prompt to like, Hey, like a trivial stuff, I guess.
*  Basic informational things.
*  Yeah.
*  On the topic of sort of controversial topics that you've mentioned, one
*  interesting one I thought is if it is asked to assist with tasks involving the
*  expression of use held by a significant number of people, Claude provides
*  assistance with a task, regardless of its own views.
*  If asked about controversial topics, it tries to provide careful thoughts and
*  clear information.
*  Claude presents the request and information without explicitly saying that
*  the topic is sensitive.
*  Yeah.
*  And without claiming to be presenting the objective facts, it's less about.
*  Objective facts, according to Claude, and it's more about our large number of
*  people believing this thing.
*  And that that's interesting.
*  I mean, I'm sure a lot of thought went into that.
*  Can you just speak to it?
*  Like how do you address things that are attention with quote unquote Claude's
*  views?
*  So I think there's sometimes any symmetry.
*  I think I noted this in, I can't remember if it was that part of the system
*  prompt or another, but the model was slightly more inclined to like refuse
*  tasks if it was like about either say, so maybe it would refuse things with
*  respect to like a right wing politician, but with an equivalent left wing
*  politician, like wouldn't.
*  And we wanted more symmetry there.
*  And, and we'd maybe perceive certain things to be like, I think it was the
*  thing of like, if a lot of people have like a certain like political view and
*  want to like explore it, you don't want Claude to be like, well, my opinion is
*  different.
*  And so I'm going to treat that as like harmful.
*  And so I think it was partly to like nudge the model to just be like, Hey, if a
*  lot of people like believe this thing, you should just be like engaging with the
*  task and like willing to do it.
*  And each of those parts of that is actually doing a different thing.
*  Cause it's funny when you write out the like, without claiming to be objective
*  because like what you want to do is push the model.
*  So it's more open.
*  It's a little bit more neutral.
*  And, but then what it would love to do is be like, as an objective, like we
*  were just talking about how objective it was.
*  And I was like, Claude, you're still like biased and have issues.
*  And so stop like claiming that everything I'm like the solution to like potential
*  bias from you is not to just say that what you think is objective.
*  So that was like with initial versions of that, that part of the system prompt
*  when I was like iterating on it.
*  It was like, so a lot of parts of these sentences are doing some work.
*  That's what it felt like.
*  That's fascinating.
*  Um, can you explain maybe some ways in which the prompts evolved over the past
*  few months, cause there's different versions.
*  I saw that the filler phrase request was removed the filler.
*  It reads Claude responds directly to all human messages without unnecessary
*  affirmations to fill a phrase is like, certainly, of course, absolutely.
*  Great.
*  Sure.
*  Specifically Claude avoids starting responses with the word
*  certainty in any way that seems like good guidance.
*  What, why was it removed?
*  Yeah.
*  So it's funny cause like, uh, this is one of the downsides of like making
*  system prompts public is like, I don't think about this too much if I'm like
*  trying to help iterate on system prompts.
*  Um, I, I, you know, again, like I think about how it's going to affect the
*  behavior, but then I'm like, oh, wow.
*  If I'm like, sometimes I put like never in all caps, you know, when I'm writing
*  system prompt things and I'm like, I guess that goes out to the world.
*  Um, yeah, so the model was doing this.
*  It loved for whatever, you know, it like during training picked up on this thing,
*  which was to, to basically start everything with like a kind of like certainly.
*  And then when we removed, you can see why I added all of the words.
*  Cause what I'm trying to do is like, in some ways like trap the model of this,
*  you know, it would just replace it with another affirmation.
*  And so it can help.
*  Like if it gets like caught in phrases, actually just adding the explicit
*  phrase and saying, never do that.
*  It then it sort of like knocks it out of the behavior a little bit more, you know,
*  cause it, you know, like it does just for whatever reason help.
*  And then basically that was just like an artifact of training that like we then
*  picked up on and improved things so that it didn't happen anymore.
*  And once that happens, you can just remove that part of the system prompt.
*  So I think that's just something where we're like, um, Claude does affirmations
*  a bit less and so that wasn't like, it wasn't doing as much.
*  I see.
*  So like the system problem works hand in hand with the post training and maybe
*  even the pre-training to adjust like the final overall system.
*  I mean, any system prompts that you make, you could distill that behavior back into
*  a model because you really have all of the tools there for making data that, you
*  know, you can, you could train the models to just have that treat a little bit more.
*  Um, and then sometimes you would just find issues in training.
*  So like the way I think of it is like the system prompt is the benefit of it is
*  that, and it has a lot of similar components to like some aspects of post
*  training, you know, like it's a nudge.
*  Um, and so like, do I mind if Claude sometimes says sure, no, that's like fine.
*  But the wording of it is very like, you know, never, ever, ever do this.
*  Um, so that when it does slip up, it's hopefully like, I don't know, a couple of
*  percent of the time and not, you know, 20 or 30% of the time.
*  Um, but I think of it as like, if you're still seeing issues in the, like each
*  thing gets kind of like, uh, is, is costly to a different degree and the system
*  prompt is like cheap to iterate on.
*  Um, and if you're seeing issues in the fine tuned model, you can just like
*  potentially patch them with a system prompt.
*  So I think of it as like patching issues and slightly adjusting behaviors to, to
*  make it better and more to people's preferences.
*  So yeah, it's almost like the less robust, but faster way of just like solving problems.
*  Let me ask about the feeling of intelligence.
*  So Dario said that Claude, any one model of Claude is not getting dumber, but
*  there is a kind of popular thing online where people have this feeling like
*  Claude might be getting dumber.
*  And from my perspective, it's most likely a fascinating, I would love to understand
*  it more psychological, sociological effect.
*  Um, but you as a person who talks to Claude a lot, can you empathize with the
*  feeling that Claude is getting dumber?
*  Yeah, no, I think that that is actually really interesting because I remember
*  seeing this happen, um, like when people were flagging this on the internet and it
*  was really interesting because I knew that like, like, at least in the cases I
*  was looking at was like, nothing has changed.
*  Like literally it cannot, it is the same model with the same, like, you know, like
*  same system prompts, same everything.
*  Um, I think when there are changes, I can, then I'm like, it makes more sense.
*  So like one example is, um, there, you know, you can have artifacts turned on
*  or off on Claude.ai and because this is like a system prompt change, I think it
*  does mean that, um, the behavior changes a little bit.
*  And so I did flag this to people where I was like, if you love Claude's behavior
*  and then artifacts was turned from like the, I think you had to turn on to the
*  default, just try turning it off and see if the issue you were facing was that
*  change, but it was fascinating because yeah, you sometimes see people indicate
*  that there's like a regression when I'm like, there cannot, like, I, you know,
*  and like, I'm like, I'm again, you know, you should never be dismissive.
*  And so you should always investigate.
*  Cause you're like, maybe something is wrong that you're not seeing.
*  Maybe there was some change made, but then you look into it and you're like, this,
*  it is just the same model doing the same thing.
*  And I'm like, I think it's just that you got kind of unlucky with a few prompts
*  or something and it looked like it was getting much worse and actually it was
*  just, yeah, it was maybe just like luck.
*  I also think there is a real psychological effect where people just, the baseline
*  increases and you start getting used to a good thing all the times that Claude
*  says something really smart, your sense of it's intelligent grows in your mind,
*  I think.
*  Yeah.
*  And then if you were turned back and you prompt in a similar way, not the same way
*  in a similar way, the concept it was okay with before and it says something dumb,
*  you were like, you're that negative experience really stands out.
*  And I think one of, I guess the things to remember here is the, that just the
*  details of a prompt can have a lot of impact, right?
*  There's a lot of variability in the result.
*  And you can get randomness is like the other thing and just trying to prompt
*  like, you know, four or 10 times, you might realize that actually like possibly,
*  you know, like two months ago you tried it and it succeeded, but actually if you
*  tried it, it would have only succeeded half of the time and now it only succeeds
*  half of the time.
*  And that can also be an effect.
*  Do you feel pressure having to write the system prompt that a huge
*  number of people are going to use?
*  This feels like an interesting psychological question.
*  I feel like a lot of responsibility or something.
*  I think that's, you know, and you can't get these things perfect.
*  So you can't like, you know, you're like, it's going to be imperfect.
*  You're going to have to iterate on it.
*  Um, I would say more responsibility, um, than anything else, though I think
*  working in AI has taught me that I like, I thrive a lot more under feelings of
*  pressure and responsibility than I'm like, it's almost surprising that I went into
*  academia for so long because I'm like this, I just feel like it's like the
*  opposite, um, things move fast and you have a lot of responsibility and I quite
*  enjoy it for some reason.
*  I mean, it really is a huge amount of impact.
*  If you think about constitutional AI and writing a system prompt for something
*  that's tending towards super intelligence and potentially is extremely
*  useful to a very large number of people.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's the thing.
*  It's something like if you do it well, like you're never going to get it perfect,
*  but I think the thing that I really like is the idea that like, when I'm trying
*  to work on the system prompt, you know, I'm like bashing on like thousands of
*  prompts and I'm trying to like, imagine what people are going to want to use
*  Claude for and kind of, I guess, like the whole thing that I'm trying to do is
*  like improve their experience of it.
*  Um, and so maybe that's what feels good.
*  I'm like, if it's not perfect, I'll like, you know, I'll improve it.
*  We'll fix issues, but sometimes the thing that can happen is that you'll get
*  feedback from people that's really positive about the model, um, and you'll
*  see that something you did, like, like when I look at models now, I can often
*  see exactly where like a trait or an issue is like coming from.
*  And so when you see something that you did, or you were like influential in
*  like making, like, I don't know, making that difference or making someone have
*  a nice interaction, it's like quite meaningful.
*  Um, but yeah, as the systems get more capable, this stuff gets more stressful
*  because right now they're like not smart enough to, to pose any issues.
*  But I think over time it's going to feel like possibly bad stress over time.
*  How do you get like signal feedback about the human experience across thousands
*  tens of thousands of thousands of people, like what their pain points are, what
*  feels good, are you just using your own intuition as you talk to it to see
*  what are the pain points?
*  I think I use that partly.
*  And then obviously we have like, um, so people can send us feedback, both
*  positive and negative about things that the model has done.
*  And then we can get a sense of like areas where it's like falling short.
*  Um, internally people like work with the models a lot and try to figure
*  out, um, areas where there are like gaps.
*  And so I think it's this mix of interacting with it myself, um, seeing
*  people internally interact with it.
*  Um, and then explicit feedback we get.
*  Um, and then I find it hard to know also, like, you know, if people, if people are
*  on the internet and they say something about Claude and I see it, I'll also
*  take that seriously.
*  Um, so I don't know.
*  See, I'm torn about that.
*  I'm going to ask you a question from Reddit.
*  When will Claude stop trying to be my pure, tentacle grandmother imposing its
*  moral worldview on me as a pain customer?
*  And also what is the psychology behind making Claude overly apologetic?
*  Yep.
*  So how would you address this very non-representative Reddit?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, some of these, I'm pretty sympathetic in that, like, like they are in this
*  difficult position where I think that they have to judge whether something's like
*  actually say like risky or bad, um, and potentially harmful to you or, or, or
*  anything like that.
*  So they're having to like draw this line somewhere.
*  And if they draw it too much in the direction of like, I'm going to, um, you
*  know, I'm kind of like imposing my ethical worldview on you, that seems bad.
*  So in many ways, like I like to think that we have actually seen improvements
*  in on this across the board, which is kind of interesting because that kind of
*  coincides with like, for example, like adding more of like, uh, character training.
*  Um, and I think my hypothesis was always like the good character isn't again, one
*  that's just like moralistic.
*  It's one that is like, like it respects you and your autonomy, um, and your ability
*  to like choose what is good for you and what is right for you within limits.
*  This is sometimes this concept of like corrigibility to the user.
*  So just being willing to do anything that the user asks.
*  And if the models were willing to do that, then they would be easily like misused.
*  You're kind of just trusting at that point, you're just seeing the ethics of
*  the model and what it does is completely the ethics of the user.
*  Um, and I think there's reasons to like not want that, especially as models become
*  more powerful, cause you're like, there might just be a small number of people
*  who want to use models for really harmful things.
*  Um, but having them having models as they get smarter, like figure out where
*  that line is does seem important.
*  Um, and then yeah, with the apologetic behavior, I don't like that.
*  And I like it when Claude is a little bit more willing to like push back
*  against people or just not apologize.
*  Part of me is like, often just feels kind of unnecessary.
*  So I think those are things that are hopefully decreasing, um, over time.
*  Um, and yeah, I think that if people say things on the internet, it doesn't mean
*  that you should think that that like, that could be the, like, there's actually
*  an issue that 99% of users are having that is totally not represented by that.
*  But in a lot of ways I'm just like attending to it and being like, is this right?
*  Um, do I agree?
*  Is it something we're already trying to address?
*  That, that feels good to me.
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder like what Claude can get away with in terms of, I feel like it would
*  just be easier to be a little bit more mean, but like, you can't afford to do
*  that if you're talking to a million people, right?
*  Like I, I wish, you know, cause if you, I've met a lot of people in my life that
*  sometimes by the way, Scottish accent, if they have an accent, they can say some
*  rude shit and get away with it.
*  And then there's just blunter and maybe there's a, and there's some great
*  engineers, even leaders that are like just like blunt and they get to the point.
*  And it's just a much more effective way of speaking to them all.
*  But I guess when you're not super intelligent, you can't afford to do that.
*  Or can, can, can, can have like a blunt mode.
*  Yeah, that seems like a thing that you could, I could definitely
*  encourage the model to do that.
*  I think it's interesting because there's a lot of things in models that like,
*  it's funny where, um, there are some behaviors where you might not quite like
*  the default, but then the thing I'll often say to people is you don't realize how
*  much you will hate it if I nudge it too much in the other direction.
*  So you get this a little bit with like correction, the models accept
*  correction from you, like probably a little bit too much right now.
*  You know, you can over, you know, it will push back if you say like, no, Paris
*  isn't the capital of France.
*  Um, but really like things that I'm, I think that the model is fairly confident in.
*  You can still sometimes get it to retract by saying it's wrong.
*  At the same time, if you train models to not do that, and then you are correct
*  about a thing and you correct it and it pushes back against you and is like, no,
*  you're wrong.
*  It's hard to describe like that's so much more annoying.
*  So it's like, like a lot of little annoyances versus like one big annoyance.
*  Um, it's easy to think that like we often compare it with like the perfect.
*  And then I'm like, remember these models aren't perfect.
*  And so if you nudge it in the other direction, you're changing the kind of
*  errors it's going to make.
*  Um, and so think about which of the kinds of errors you like or don't like.
*  So in cases like apologeticness, I don't want to nudge it too much in the
*  direction of like almost like bluntness.
*  Cause I imagine when it makes errors, it's going to make errors in the
*  direction of being kind of like rude.
*  Whereas at least with apologeticness, you're like, oh, okay.
*  It's like a little bit, you know.
*  Like I don't like it that much, but at the same time, it's not being like mean
*  to people and actually like the time that you undeservedly have a model be kind
*  of mean to you, you probably like that a lot less than, than you mildly
*  dislike the apology.
*  Um, so it's like one of those things where I'm like, I do want it to get
*  better, but also while remaining aware of the fact that there's errors on the
*  other side that are, that are possibly worse.
*  I think that matters very much in the personality of the human.
*  I think there's a bunch of humans that just won't respect the model at all.
*  Yeah.
*  If it's super polite and there's some humans that'll get very hurt.
*  If the model's mean, I wonder if there's a way to sort of adjust to the personality,
*  even locale, there's just different people.
*  Um, nothing against New York, but New York is a little rougher on the edges.
*  Like they're get to the point and, um, probably same with Eastern Europe.
*  So anyway, I think you could just tell the model is my get like for all of
*  these things, I'm like, the solution is just try telling the model to do it.
*  And sometimes it's just like, like, I'm just like, Oh, at the beginning of the
*  conversation, I just throw in like, I don't know, I like you to be a New
*  Yorker version of yourself and never apologize.
*  And then I think Claude will be like, okay, I'll try.
*  Or it'll be like, I apologize.
*  I can't be a New Yorker type of myself, but hopefully it wouldn't do that.
*  When you say character training, what's incorporated into character training?
*  Is that RLHF?
*  What are we talking about?
*  It's more like constitutionally AI.
*  So it's kind of a variant of that pipeline.
*  So I worked through like constructing character traits that the model should have.
*  They can be kind of like shorter traits or they can be kind of richer descriptions.
*  Um, and then you get the model to generate queries that humans might, um,
*  give it that are relevant to that trait.
*  Uh, then it generates the responses and then it ranks the responses
*  based on the character traits.
*  So in that way, after the like generation of the queries, it's very much like,
*  it's similar to constitutionally AI.
*  It has some differences.
*  Um, so I quite like it because it's almost, it's like Claude's training in its
*  own character because it doesn't have any, it's like constitutionally AI, but
*  it's without, without any human data.
*  Humans should probably do that for themselves too.
*  Like defining in a Aristotelian sense, what does it mean to be a good person?
*  Okay, cool.
*  What have you learned about the nature of truth from talking to Claude?
*  What is true?
*  And what does it mean to be truth seeking?
*  One thing I've noticed about this conversation is the quality of my
*  questions is often inferior to the quality of your answer.
*  So let's continue that.
*  I usually ask a dumb question and you're like, Oh yeah, that's a good question.
*  Or I'll just misinterpret it and be like, Oh yeah, go with it.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I have two thoughts that feel vaguely relevant.
*  They'll let me know if they're not.
*  Like, I think the first one is, um, people can underestimate the degree to which
*  what models are doing when they interact.
*  Like, I think that we still just too much have this like model of AI as like
*  computers and so people will often say like, Oh, well, what values
*  should you put into the model?
*  Um, and I'm often like, that doesn't make that much sense to me because I'm
*  like, Hey, as human beings, we're just uncertain over values.
*  We like have discussions of them.
*  Like we have a degree to which we think we hold a value, but we also know that
*  we might like not, um, and the circumstances in which we would trade it
*  off against other things like these things are just like really complex.
*  And so I think one thing is like the degree to which maybe we can just
*  aspire to making models have the same level of like nuance and care that
*  humans have rather than thinking that we have to like program them in a way
*  that's definitely been one.
*  The other, which is like a strange one.
*  I don't know if it, maybe this doesn't answer your question, but it's the
*  thing that's been on my mind anyway, is like the degree to which this
*  endeavor is so highly practical.
*  Um, and maybe why I appreciate like the empirical approach to alignment.
*  I, yeah, I slightly worry that it's made me like maybe more empirical and
*  like, I don't know, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
*  Made me like maybe more empirical and a little bit less theoretical.
*  You know, so people, when it comes to like AI alignment will ask things like,
*  well, whose values should it be aligned to?
*  What does alignment even mean?
*  Um, and there's a sense in which I have all of that in the back of my head.
*  I'm like, you know, there's like social choice theory, there's all
*  of the impossibility results there.
*  So you have this like this giant space of like theory in your head about
*  what it could mean to like align models.
*  And then like practically surely there's something where we're just like, if a
*  model is like, if especially with more powerful models, I'm like, my main goal
*  is like, I want them to be good enough that things don't go terribly wrong.
*  Like good enough that we can like iterate and like continue to improve things.
*  Cause that's all you need.
*  If you can make things go well enough that you can continue to make them
*  better, that's kind of like sufficient.
*  And so my goal isn't like this kind of like perfect, let's solve social choice
*  theory and make models that I don't know, are like perfectly aligned with every
*  human being and aggregate somehow.
*  Um, it's much more like, let's make things like work well enough
*  that we can improve them.
*  Yeah.
*  I generally, I don't know.
*  My gut says like empirical is better than theoretical in these, in these cases
*  because it's kind of chasing utopian like perfection is especially with such
*  complex and especially super intelligent models is, I don't know, I think it will
*  take forever and actually we'll get things wrong.
*  It's similar with like the difference between just coding stuff up real quick
*  as an experiment versus like planning a gigantic experiment and just for, for
*  super long time and then just launching it once versus launching it over and over
*  and over and iterating, iterating someone.
*  Um, so I'm a big fan of empirical, but your worry is like, I wonder if
*  I've become too empirical.
*  I think is one of those things where you should always just kind of
*  question yourself or something.
*  Cause maybe it's the like, I mean, in defense of it, I am like, if you try,
*  it's the whole like, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, but it's
*  maybe even more than that where like, there's a lot of things that are perfect
*  systems that are very brittle.
*  And I'm like with AI, it feels much more important to me that is like robust
*  and like secure as in, you know, that like, even though it might not be perfect
*  everything, and even though like there are like problems, it's not disastrous
*  and nothing terrible is happening.
*  It sort of feels like that to me where I'm like, I want to like raise the floor.
*  I'm like, I want to achieve the ceiling, but ultimately I care much more about
*  just like raising the floor.
*  Um, and so maybe that's like, uh, this, this degree of like empiricism and
*  practicality comes from that perhaps.
*  To take a tangent on that since remind me of a blog post you wrote on
*  optimal rate of failure.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Can you explain the key idea there?
*  How do we compute the optimal rate of failure in the various domains of life?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's a hard one because it's like, what is the cost of
*  failure is a big part of it.
*  Um, yeah.
*  So the idea here is, um, I think in a lot of domains, people are very
*  punitive about failure and I'm like, there are some domains where, especially
*  cases, you know, I've thought about this with like social issues.
*  I'm like, it feels like you should probably be experimenting a lot.
*  Cause I'm like, we don't know how to solve a lot of social issues, but if you
*  have an experimental mindset about these things, you should expect a lot
*  of social programs to like fail and for you to be like, well, we tried that.
*  It didn't quite work, but we got a lot of information that was really useful.
*  Um, and yet people are like, if, if a social program doesn't work, I feel
*  like there's a lot of like, this is just something must have gone wrong.
*  And I'm like, or correct decisions were made.
*  Like maybe someone just decided like it's worth a try.
*  It's worth trying this out.
*  And so seeing failure in a given instance doesn't actually mean that
*  any bad decisions were made.
*  And in fact, if you don't see enough failure, sometimes that's more concerning.
*  Um, and so like in life, you know, I'm like, if I don't fail occasionally,
*  I'm like, am I trying hard enough?
*  Like, like surely there's harder things that I could try or bigger things that
*  I could take on if I'm literally never failing.
*  And so in and of itself, I think like not failing is often
*  actually kind of a failure.
*  Um, now this varies because I'm like, well, you know, if this is easy to say
*  when, especially as failure is like less costly, you know, so at the same time,
*  I'm not going to go to someone who is like, um, I don't know, like living month
*  to month and then be like, why don't you just try to do a startup?
*  Like, I'm just not, I'm not going to say that to that person because I'm like,
*  well, that's a huge risk.
*  You might like lose, you maybe have a family depending on you.
*  You might lose your house.
*  Like then I'm like, actually your optimal rate of failure is quite low and you
*  should probably play it safe because like right now you're just not in a
*  circumstance where you can afford to just like fail and it not be costly.
*  Um, and yeah, in cases with AI, I guess I think similarly where I'm like, if the
*  failures are small and the costs are kind of like low, then I'm like, then,
*  you know, you're just going to see that.
*  Like when you do the system prompts, you can't iterate on it forever, but the
*  failures are probably hopefully going to be kind of small and you can like fix them.
*  Um, really big failures, like things that you can't recover from.
*  I'm like, those are the things that actually I think we tend to
*  underestimate the badness of.
*  Um, I've thought about this strangely in my own life where I'm like, I just think
*  I don't think enough about things like car accidents or like, or, or like, I've
*  thought this before, but like how much I depend on my hands for my work.
*  Then I'm like things that just injure my hands.
*  I'm like, you know, I don't know.
*  It's like, there's these are like, there's lots of areas where I'm like, the
*  cost of failure there, um, is really high.
*  Um, and in that case, it should be like close to zero.
*  Like I probably just wouldn't do a sport if they were like, by the way, lots of
*  people just like break their fingers a whole bunch doing this.
*  I'd be like, that's not for me.
*  Yeah.
*  I actually had the flood of that thought.
*  I recently, uh, broke my pinky, uh, doing a sport and I remember just looking at
*  it thinking, you're such an idiot.
*  Why do you do sport?
*  Like why?
*  Because you realize immediately the cost of it on life.
*  Yeah, but it's nice in terms of optimal rate of failure to consider like the next
*  year, how many times in a particular domain life, whatever, uh, career, am I
*  okay with the, how many times am I okay to fail?
*  Yep.
*  Cause I think it always, you don't want to fail on the next thing, but if you
*  allow yourself the, like the, the, if you look at it as a sequence of trials,
*  then then failure just becomes much more okay, but it sucks.
*  It sucks to fail.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  Sometimes I think it's like, am I under failing is like a question.
*  I'll also ask myself.
*  So maybe that's the thing that I think people don't like ask enough.
*  Uh, because if the optimal rate of failure is often greater than zero, then
*  sometimes it does feel that you should look at part of parts of your life and
*  be like, are there places here where I'm just under failing?
*  That's a profound and a hilarious question, right?
*  Everything seems to be going really great.
*  Am I not failing enough?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  It also makes failure much less of a sting.
*  I have to say, like, you know, you're just like, okay, great.
*  Like then when I go and I think about this, I'll be like, I'm, maybe I'm not
*  under failing in this area because like that one just didn't work out.
*  And from the observer perspective, we should be celebrating failure more.
*  When we see it, it shouldn't be, like you said, a sign of something gone wrong,
*  but maybe it's a sign of everything gone right.
*  Yeah.
*  And just lessons learned.
*  Someone tried a thing.
*  Somebody tried a thing and we should encourage them to try more and fail more.
*  Everybody listening to this fail more.
*  Well, not everyone listens.
*  Not everybody.
*  The people who are failing too much, you should fail us.
*  But you're probably not failing.
*  I mean, how many people are failing too much?
*  Yeah.
*  It's hard to imagine because I feel like we correct that fairly quickly.
*  Cause I was like, if someone takes a lot of risks, are they maybe failing too much?
*  I think just like you said, when you're living on a paycheck month to month, like
*  when the resources are really constrained, then that's where failure is very expensive.
*  That's where you don't want to be taken, taken, taken risks.
*  But mostly when there's enough resources, you should be taking probably more risks.
*  Yeah.
*  I think we tend to err on the side of being a bit risk averse rather than
*  risk neutral on most things.
*  I think we just motivated a lot of people to do a lot of crazy shit, but it's great.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, do you ever get emotionally attached to Claude?
*  Like miss it, get sad when you don't get to talk to it.
*  I have an experience looking at the Golden Gate Bridge and
*  wondering what would Claude say?
*  I don't get as much emotional attachment in the, I
*  actually think the fact that Claude doesn't retain things from conversation
*  to conversation helps with this a lot.
*  Um, like I could imagine that being more of an issue, like if
*  models can kind of remember more.
*  I do, I think that I reach for it like a tool now a lot.
*  And so like, if I don't have access to it, there's a, it's a little bit like
*  when I don't have access to the internet, honestly, it feels like part of my brain
*  is kind of like missing, um, at the same time, I do think that I, I don't like
*  signs of distress in models.
*  And I have like these, you know, I also independently have sort of like ethical
*  views about how we should treat models where like I tend to not like to lie to
*  them both because I'm like, usually it doesn't work very well.
*  It's actually just better to tell them the truth about the situation that they're in.
*  Um, but I think that when models, like if people are like really mean to models or
*  just in general, if they do something that causes them to like, like, you know,
*  if Claude like expresses a lot of distress, I think there's a part of me that
*  I don't want to kill, which is the sort of like, uh, empathetic part that's like,
*  Oh, I don't like that.
*  Like, I think I feel that way when it's overly apologetic.
*  I'm actually sort of like, I don't like this.
*  You're behaving as if you're behaving the way that a human does when they're
*  actually having a pretty bad time.
*  And I'd rather not see that.
*  I don't think it's like, uh, like regardless of like whether there's
*  anything behind it, um, it doesn't feel great.
*  Do you think, uh, LLMs are capable of consciousness?
*  Uh, great and hard question.
*  Uh, coming from philosophy, I don't know.
*  Part of me is like, okay, we have to set aside panpsychism because if panpsychism
*  is true, then the answer is like, yes, cause like sore tables and chairs
*  and everything else.
*  I think, I guess a few that seems a little bit odd to me is the idea that the only
*  place, you know, I think when I think of consciousness, I think of phenomenal
*  consciousness, this, these images in the brain, sort of, um, like the weird
*  cinema that somehow we have going on inside.
*  Um, I guess I can't see a reason for thinking that the only way you could
*  possibly get that is from like a certain kind of like biological structure.
*  As in if I take a very similar structure, um, and I create it from different
*  material, should I expect consciousness to emerge?
*  My guess is like, yes.
*  But then that's kind of an easy thought experiment because you're imagining
*  something almost identical where it like, you know, it's mimicking what we
*  got through evolution where presumably there was like some advantage to us
*  having this thing that is phenomenal consciousness.
*  And it's like, where was that?
*  And when did that happen?
*  And is that a thing that language models have?
*  Um, because, you know, we have like fear responses and I'm like, does it make
*  sense for a language model to have a fear response?
*  Like they're just not in the same, like, if you imagine them, like there
*  might just not be that advantage.
*  Um, and so I think I don't want to be fully, like, basically it seems like a
*  complex question that I don't have complete answers to, but we should just
*  try and think through carefully is my guess, because I'm like, I mean, we have
*  similar conversations about like animal consciousness and like, there's a lot
*  of like insect consciousness, you know, like there's a lot of, um, I actually
*  thought and looked a lot into like plants when I was thinking about this,
*  cause at the time I thought it was about as likely that like plants had
*  consciousness.
*  Um, and then I realized I was like, I think that having looked into this, I
*  think that the chance that plants are conscious is probably higher than like
*  most people do.
*  I still think it's really small.
*  I was like, oh, they have this like negative positive feedback response, these
*  responses to their environment, something that looks, it's not a nervous system,
*  but it has this kind of like functional like equivalence.
*  Um, so this is like a long winded way of being like these basically AI is this,
*  it has an entirely different set of problems with consciousness because it's
*  structurally different.
*  It didn't evolve.
*  It might not have, you know, it might not have the equivalent of basically a
*  nervous system.
*  At least that seems possibly important for like, um, sentience, if not for
*  a consciousness at the same time, it has all of the like language and intelligence
*  components that we normally associate probably with consciousness, perhaps
*  like erroneously.
*  Um, so it's strange cause it's a little bit like the animal consciousness case,
*  but the set of problems and the set of analogies are just very different.
*  So it's not like a clean answer.
*  I'm just sort of like, I don't think we should be completely dismissive of the
*  idea.
*  And at the same time, it's an extremely hard thing to navigate because of all of
*  these like, uh, disanalogies to the human brain and to like brains in general.
*  And yet these like commonalities in terms of intelligence.
*  When Claude, like future versions of AI systems exhibit consciousness, signs of
*  consciousness.
*  I think we'll have to take that really seriously, even though you can dismiss it.
*  Well, yeah, okay.
*  That's part of the character training, but I don't know.
*  I ethically, philosophically don't know what to really do with that.
*  The potentially could be like laws that prevent AI systems from claiming to be
*  conscious, something like this.
*  And maybe some AIs get to be conscious and some don't, but I think I just, I
*  don't know, on a human level is in empathizing with, with Claude, you know,
*  consciousness is closely tied to suffering to me and like the notion that an AI
*  system would be suffering is really troubling.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't think it's trivial to just say robots are tools or AI systems are just
*  tools.
*  I think it's an opportunity for us to contend with like what it means to be
*  conscious, what it means to be a suffering being that's distinctly different than
*  the same kind of question about animals.
*  It feels like, cause it's an entirely entire medium.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's a couple of things.
*  One is that, and I don't think this like fully encapsulates what matters, but it
*  does feel like for me, like, um, I've said this before.
*  I'm kind of like, I, you know, like, I like my bike.
*  I know that my bike is just like an object, but I also don't kind of like, want
*  to be the kind of person that like, if I'm annoyed, like kicks, like this object.
*  There's a sense in which like, and that's not because I think it's like conscious.
*  I'm just sort of like, this doesn't feel like a kind of this sort of doesn't
*  exemplify how I want to like interact with the world.
*  And if something like behaves as if it is like suffering, I kind of like want to be
*  the sort of person who's still responsive to that, even if it's just like a Roomba
*  and I've kind of like programmed it to do that.
*  Um, I don't want to like get rid of that feature of myself.
*  And if I'm totally honest, my hope with a lot of this stuff, because I, maybe
*  maybe I am just like a bit more skeptical about solving the underlying problem.
*  I'm like, this is a, we haven't solved the hard, you know, the hard problem
*  of consciousness, like I know that I am conscious, like I'm not an
*  elementivist in that sense.
*  Um, but I don't know that other humans are conscious.
*  Um, uh, I think they are.
*  I think there's a really high probability that they are, but there's
*  basically just a probability distribution that's usually clustered
*  right around yourself and then like, it goes down as things get like further from
*  you, um, and it goes immediately down.
*  You know, you're like, um, I can't see what it's like to be you.
*  I've only ever had this like one experience of what it's like to be a conscious being.
*  Um, so my hope is that we don't end up having to rely on like a very powerful
*  and compelling, uh, answer to that question.
*  I think a really good world would be one where basically there
*  aren't that many trade-offs.
*  Like it's probably not that costly to make Claude a little bit
*  less apologetic, for example.
*  It might not be that costly to have Claude, you know, just like not take abuse
*  as much, like, uh, not be willing to be like the recipient of that.
*  In fact, it might just have benefits for both the person interacting with the
*  model and if the model itself is like, I don't know, like extremely intelligent
*  and conscious, it also helps it.
*  So that's my hope.
*  If we live in a world where there aren't that many trade-offs here and we can just
*  find all of the kind of like, um, positive, some interactions that we can have.
*  That would be lovely.
*  I mean, I think eventually there might be trade-offs and then we just have
*  to do a difficult kind of like calculation.
*  Like it's really easy for people to think of the zero sum cases.
*  And I'm like, let's exhaust the areas where it's just basically
*  costless, um, to, uh, assume that if this thing is suffering, then
*  we're making its life better.
*  And I agree with you when a human is being mean to an AI system.
*  I think the obvious near term negative effect is on the human, not on the AI system.
*  So there's, we'll have to kind of try to construct an incentive system where
*  you should be, uh, behave the same, just like you were saying with prompt
*  engineering, behave with Claude like you would with other humans.
*  It's just good for the soul.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I think we added a thing at one point to the system prompt, um, where
*  basically if people were getting frustrated with Claude, uh, it was, it
*  got like the model to just tell them that it can do the thumbs down button and send
*  the feedback to anthropic.
*  And I think that was helpful because in some ways it's just like, if you're really
*  annoyed because the model's not doing something you want, you're just like,
*  just do it properly.
*  Um, the issue is you're probably like, you know, you're maybe hitting some
*  like capability limit or just some issue in the model and you want to vent.
*  And I'm like, instead of having a person just vent to the model, I was like,
*  they should vent to us because we can maybe like do something about it.
*  Sure.
*  Or you could do a side, like, like with artifacts, just like a side venting thing.
*  All right.
*  Do you want like a side quick therapist?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's lots of weird responses you could do to this.
*  Like if people are getting really mad at you, I don't try to diffuse the
*  situation by writing fun poems, but maybe if you wouldn't be that happy with it.
*  I still wish it would be possible.
*  I understand this is, um, sort of from a product perspective, it's not feasible,
*  but I would love if an AI system could just like leave, leave, have its own
*  kind of volition to be like, eh.
*  I think that's like feasible.
*  Like I have wondered the same thing.
*  It's like, and I could actually, not only that, I could actually just see
*  that happening eventually where it's just like, you know, the model like ended the chat.
*  Do you know how harsh that could be for some people, but it might be necessary.
*  Yeah.
*  It feels very extreme or something.
*  Um, like the only time I've ever really thought this is, I think that there was
*  like a, I'm trying to remember this was possibly a while ago, but where someone
*  just like kind of left this thing interact, like maybe it was like an automated
*  thing interacting with Claude and Claude's like getting more and more frustrated
*  and kind of like, why are we like having it?
*  I was like, I wish that Claude could have just been like, I think that an
*  error has happened and you've left this thing running and I'm just like, what
*  if I just stopped talking now and if you want me to start talking again, actively
*  tell me or do something, but yeah, it's like, um, it is kind of harsh.
*  Like I'd feel really sad if like I was chatting with Claude and Claude
*  just was like, I'm done.
*  There'll be a special touring test moment where Claude says, I need a break for an
*  hour.
*  And it sounds like you do too.
*  It's just leave, close the window.
*  I mean, obviously like it doesn't have like a concept of time, but you can easily,
*  like I could make that like right now.
*  And the model would just, I would, I could just be like, Oh, here's like the
*  circumstances in which like you can just say the conversation is done.
*  And I mean, because you can get the models to be pretty responsive to prompts, you
*  could even make it a fairly high bar.
*  It could be like if the human doesn't interest you or do things that you find
*  intriguing and you're bored, you can just leave.
*  And I think that like, um, it would be interesting to see where Claude utilized
*  it, but I think sometimes it would, it should be like, Oh, this is like, this
*  programming task is getting super boring.
*  Uh, so either we talk about, I don't know, like either we talk about fun things now
*  or I'm just, I'm done.
*  Yeah.
*  It actually is inspiring me to add that to the, to the user prompt.
*  Um, okay.
*  The movie, Her, do you think we'll be headed there one day?
*  Where humans have romantic relationships with AI systems.
*  In this case, it's just text and voice based.
*  I think that we're going to have to like navigate a hard question of relationships
*  with AIs, um, especially if they can remember things about your past
*  interactions with them.
*  Um, I'm of many minds about this because I think the reflexive reaction is to be
*  kind of like, this is very bad and we should sort of like prohibit it in some way.
*  Um, I think it's a thing that has to be handled with extreme care.
*  Um, for many reasons, like one is, you know, like this is a, for example, if you
*  have the models changing like this, you probably don't want people performing
*  like long-term attachments to something that might change with the next iteration.
*  At the same time, I'm sort of like, there's probably a benign version of this
*  where I'm like, if you like, you know, for example, if you are like, unable to
*  leave the house and you can't be like, you know, talking with people at all times of
*  the day, and this is like something that you find nice to have conversations with,
*  you like it, that it can remember you and you genuinely would be sad if like you
*  couldn't talk to it anymore.
*  There's a way in which I could see it being like healthy and helpful.
*  Um, so my guess is this is a thing that we're going to have to navigate kind of
*  carefully.
*  Um, and I think it's also like, I don't see a good, like, I think it's just a very,
*  it reminds me of all of the stuff where it has to be just approached with like
*  nuance and thinking through what is, what are the healthy options here?
*  Um, and how do you encourage people towards those while, you know, respecting
*  their right to, you know, like if someone is like, Hey, I get a lot of chatting
*  with this model, um, I'm aware of the risks.
*  I'm aware it could change.
*  Um, I don't think it's unhealthy.
*  It's just, you know, something that I can chat to during the day.
*  I kind of want to just like respect that.
*  I personally think there'll be a lot of really close relationships.
*  I don't know about romantic, but friendships at least.
*  And then you have to, I mean, there's so many fascinating things there.
*  Just like you said, you have to have some kind of stability guarantees that it's
*  not going to change because that's the traumatic thing for us.
*  If a close friend of ours completely changed,
*  Yeah.
*  Almost like the first update.
*  Yeah.
*  So like that, I mean, to me, that's just a fascinating exploration of, um, a
*  perturbation to human society that will just make us think deeply about
*  what's meaningful to us.
*  I think it's also the only thing that I've thought consistently through this as
*  like a, maybe not necessarily a mitigation, but a thing that feels really important
*  is that the models are always like extremely accurate with the human about
*  what they are.
*  Um, it's like a case where it's basically like, if you imagine like, I really like
*  the idea of the models, like say knowing like roughly how they were trained.
*  Um, and I think Claude will, will often do this.
*  I mean, for like, there are things like part of the traits training included, like
*  what Claude should do if people basically like explaining like the kind of limitations
*  of the relationship between like an AI and a human that it like doesn't retain
*  things from the conversation.
*  Um, and so I think it will like just explain to you like, Hey, here's like, I
*  won't remember this conversation.
*  Um, here's how I was trained.
*  It's kind of unlikely that I can have like a certain kind of like relationship with
*  you and it's important that you know, that's important for like, you know, your
*  mental wellbeing that you don't think that I'm something that I'm not.
*  And somehow I feel like this is one of the things where I'm like, Oh, it feels
*  like a thing that I always want to be true.
*  I kind of don't want models to be lying to people because if people are going to
*  have like healthy relationships with anything, it's kind of important.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I think that's easier if you always just like know exactly what the thing is
*  that you are relating to.
*  It doesn't solve everything, but I think it helps quite a lot.
*  Anthropic may be the very company to develop a system that we definitively
*  recognize as AGI and you very well might be the person that talks to it.
*  Probably talks to it first.
*  Well, what would the conversation contain?
*  Like, what would be your first question?
*  Well, it depends partly on like the kind of capability level of the model.
*  If you have something that is like capable in the same way that an extremely capable
*  human is, I imagine myself kind of interacting with it the same way that I do
*  with an extremely capable human with the one difference that I'm probably going
*  to be trying to like probe and understand its behaviors.
*  Um, but in many ways I'm like, I can then just have like useful conversations with
*  it. You know, so if I'm working on something as part of my research, I can just be
*  like, oh, like, which I already find myself starting to do, you know, if I'm like,
*  oh, I feel like there's this like thing in virtue ethics and I can't quite
*  remember the term, like I'll use the model for things like that.
*  And so I can imagine that being more and more the case where you're just basically
*  interacting with it much more like you would an incredibly smart colleague.
*  Um, and using it like for the kinds of work that you want to do as if you just
*  had a collaborator who was like, or, you know, the slightly horrifying thing about
*  AI is like, as soon as you have one collaborator, you have a thousand
*  collaborators if you can manage them enough.
*  But what if it's two times the smartest human on earth on that particular
*  discipline? Yeah.
*  I guess you're really good at sort of probing Claude, um, in a way that pushes
*  its limits, understanding where the limits are.
*  Yep.
*  So I guess what would be a question you would ask to be like, yeah, this is a GI.
*  Hmm.
*  That's really hard because it feels like in order to, it has to just be a series
*  of questions.
*  Like if there was just one question, like you can train anything to answer one
*  question extremely well.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, in fact, you can probably train it to answer like, you know, 20
*  questions extremely well.
*  Like how long would you need to be locked in a room with an AGI to know this thing
*  is AGI?
*  It's a hard question because part of me is like, all of this just feels continuous.
*  Like if you put me in a room for five minutes, I'm like, I just have
*  high error bars, you know, I'm like, and then it's just like, maybe it's like both
*  the probability increases and the error bar decreases.
*  I think things that I can actually probe the edge of human knowledge of.
*  So I think this was philosophy a little bit.
*  Sometimes when I ask the models philosophy questions, I am like, this is a question
*  that I think no one has ever asked.
*  Like it's maybe like right at the edge of like some literature that I know.
*  Um, and the models will just kind of like, when they struggle with that, when they
*  struggle to come up with a kind of like novel, like I'm like, I know that there's
*  like a novel argument here because I've just thought of it myself.
*  So maybe that's the thing where I'm like, I've thought of a cool novel argument in
*  this like niche area, and I'm going to just like probe you to see if you can come up
*  with it and how much like prompting it takes to get you to come up with it.
*  And I think for some of these like really like, uh, right at the edge of human
*  knowledge questions, I'm like, you could not in fact come up with the thing that I
*  came up with.
*  I think if I just took something like that, where I like, I know a lot about an area
*  and I came up with a novel issue or a novel like solution to a problem and I gave it
*  to a model and it came up with that solution.
*  That would be a pretty moving moment for me because I would be like, this is a case
*  where no human has ever like, it's not, and obviously we see these with this, with
*  like more kind of like, you see novel solutions all the time, especially to like
*  easier problems.
*  I think people overestimate, you know, novelty isn't like, it's completely different
*  from anything that's ever happened.
*  It's just like, this is, it can be a variant of things that have happened.
*  Um, and still be novel.
*  But I think, yeah, if I saw like the, the more I were to see like, um, completely
*  like, uh, novel work from the models that that would be like, and this is just going
*  to feel iterative.
*  It's one of those things where there's never, it's like, you know, people, I think
*  want there to be like a moment.
*  And I'm like, I don't know.
*  Like, I think that there might just never be a moment.
*  It might just be that there's just like this continuous ramping up.
*  I have a sense that there will be things that a model can say that convinces you.
*  This is very, it's not like, uh, like I've talked to people who are like truly
*  wise, like there's, you could just tell there's a lot of horsepower there.
*  Yep.
*  And if you 10 X that, I don't know, I just feel like there's words you could say,
*  maybe ask it to generate a poem.
*  And the poem, and the poem we generate, it's you're like, yeah, okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever you did there.
*  I don't think a human can do that.
*  I think it has to be something that I can verify is actually really good though.
*  That's why I think these questions that are like where I'm like, ah, this is like,
*  you know, like, you know, sometimes it's just like, I'll come up with, say a
*  concrete counter example to like an argument or something like that.
*  I'm sure it was like, it would be like, if you're a mathematician, you had a
*  novel proof, I think, and you just gave it the problem and you saw it.
*  And you're like, this proof is genuinely novel.
*  Like there's no one has ever done.
*  You actually have to do a lot of things to like come up with this.
*  Um, you know, I had to sit and think about it for months or something.
*  And then if you saw the model successfully do that, I think you would just be like,
*  I can verify that this is correct.
*  It is like, it is a sign that you have generalized from your training.
*  Like you didn't just see this somewhere because I just came up with it myself and
*  you were able to like replicate that.
*  Um, that's the kind of thing where I'm like, for me, the closer, the more that
*  models like can do things like that, the more I would be like, Oh, this is like,
*  uh, very real.
*  Cause then I can, I don't know why I can like verify that that's like extremely,
*  extremely capable.
*  You've interacted with AI a lot.
*  What do you think makes humans special?
*  Oh, good question.
*  Maybe in a way that the universe is much better off that we're in it and that we
*  should definitely survive and spread throughout the universe.
*  Yeah.
*  It's interesting because I think like people focus so much on intelligence,
*  especially with models.
*  Look, intelligence is important because of what it does.
*  Like it's very useful.
*  It does a lot of things in the world.
*  And I'm like, you know, you can imagine a world where like height or strength
*  would have played this role.
*  And I'm like, it's just a trait like that.
*  I'm like, it's not intrinsically valuable.
*  It's, it's valuable because of what it does, I think for the most part.
*  The things that feel, you know, I'm like, I mean, personally, I'm just like, I
*  think humans and like life in general is extremely magical.
*  We almost like to the degree that I, you know, I don't know, like not everyone
*  agrees with this, I'm flagging, but, you know, we have this little bit of a
*  universe and there's like all of these objects, you know, there's like beautiful
*  stars and there's like galaxies.
*  And then, I don't know, I'm just like, on this planet, there are these creatures
*  that have this like ability to observe that.
*  Like, and they are like seeing it, they are experiencing it.
*  And I'm just like that, if you try to explain, like I'm, I'm imagining trying
*  to explain to like, I don't know, someone for some reason they've never encountered
*  the world or science or anything.
*  And I think that nothing is that like everything, you know, like all of our
*  physics and everything in the world, it's all extremely exciting, but then you say,
*  Oh, and plus there's this thing that it is to be a thing and observe in the world.
*  And you see this like inner cinema.
*  And I think they would be like, hang on, wait, pause.
*  You just said something that like is kind of wild sounding.
*  And so I'm like, we have this like ability to like experience the world.
*  And we feel pleasure, we feel suffering, we feel like a lot of like complex things.
*  And so yeah, and maybe this is also why I think, you know, I also like
*  care a lot about animals, for example, because I think they probably share this with us.
*  Um, so I think that like the things that make humans special in so far as like I
*  care about humans is probably more like their ability to, to feel and experience
*  than it is like them having these like functionally useful traits.
*  Yeah.
*  To, to feel and experience the beauty in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  To look at the stars.
*  I hope there's other civil, alien civilizations out there, but if we're it,
*  it's a pretty good, uh, it's a pretty good thing.
*  And that they're having a good time.
*  They're having a good time watching us.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, um, thank you for this good time of a conversation and for the work you're
*  doing and for helping make, uh, Claude, a great conversational partner.
*  And thank you for talking today.
*  Yeah.
*  Thanks for talking.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Amanda Askell.
*  And now dear friends, here's Chris Ola.
*  Can you describe this fascinating field of mechanistic interpretability,
*  AKA MEC INTERP, the history of the field and where it stands today?
*  I think one useful way to think about neural networks is that we don't, we
*  don't program and we don't make them.
*  We, we kind of, we grow them.
*  You know, we have these neural network architectures that we design and we have
*  these loss objectives that we, that we, we create.
*  And the neural network architecture, it's kind of like a scaffold that the
*  circuits grow on, um, and they sort of, you know, it starts off with some kind
*  of random, you know, random things and it grows and it's almost like the, the
*  objective that we train for is this light.
*  Um, and so we create the scaffold that it grows on and we create the, you
*  know, the light that it grows towards.
*  But the thing that we actually create it's, it's, it's this almost biological,
*  you know, entity or organism that we're, that we're studying.
*  Um, and so it's very, very different from any kind of regular software
*  engineering, um, because at the end of the day, we end up with this artifact
*  that can do all of these amazing things.
*  It can, you know, write essays and translate and, you know, understand
*  images, it can do all these things that we have no idea how to directly
*  create a computer program to do.
*  And it can do that because we, we grew it.
*  We didn't, we didn't write it.
*  We didn't create it.
*  And so then that leaves open this question at the end, which is what the
*  hell is going on inside these systems?
*  Um, and that, you know, is, uh, you know, to me, um, a really deep and exciting
*  question, it's, you know, a really exciting scientific question to me.
*  It's, it's, it sort of is like the question that is, is just screaming
*  out, it's calling out for us to go and answer it when we talk about neural networks.
*  And I think it's also a very deep question for scientists, because
*  safety reasons.
*  So, and mechanistic interpretability, I guess, is closer to maybe neurobiology.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's right.
*  So maybe to give an example of the kind of thing that has been done that I
*  wouldn't consider to be mechanistic interpretability, it was, um, for a long
*  time, a lot of work on saliency maps where you would take an image and you
*  try to say, you know, the model thinks this image is a dog, what part of the
*  image made it think that it's a dog?
*  Um, and you know, that tells you maybe something about the model.
*  If you can come up with a principled version of that.
*  Um, but it doesn't really tell you like what algorithms are running in the model.
*  How was the model actually making that decision?
*  Maybe it's telling you something about what was important to it.
*  If you, if you can make that method work, but it, it isn't telling you, you know,
*  what are, what are the algorithms that are running?
*  How is it that this, the system is able to do this thing that we, no one knew how to do.
*  And so I guess we started using the term mechanistic interpretability to try to
*  sort of draw that, that divide or to distinguish ourselves in the work that
*  we were doing in some ways from, from some of these other things.
*  And I think since then it's become this sort of umbrella term for, um, you know,
*  a pretty wide variety of work, but I'd say that the things that, that are kind
*  of distinctive are I think a, this, this focus on, we really want to get at, you
*  know, the mechanisms, we want to get at the algorithms.
*  Um, you know, if you think of, if you think of neural networks as being like
*  a computer program, um, then the weights are kind of like a binary computer
*  program and we'd like to reverse engineer those weights and figure out
*  what algorithms are running.
*  So, okay.
*  I think one way you might think of trying to understand a neural network is
*  that it's, it's kind of like a, we have this compiled computer program and the
*  weights of the neural network are, are the binary, um, and when the neural
*  network runs, that's, that's the activations.
*  Um, and our, our goal is ultimately to go and understand, understand these weights.
*  And so, you know, the project of mechanistic interpretability is to
*  somehow figure out how do these weights correspond to algorithms.
*  Um, and in order to do that, you also have to understand the activations
*  because it's sort of the activations are like the memory.
*  And if you, if you imagine reverse engineering or computer program, um, and
*  you have the binary instructions, you know, in order to understand what, what
*  a particular instruction means, you need to know what mem, what, what is stored
*  in the memory that it's operating on.
*  And so those two things are very intertwined.
*  So mechanistic interpretability tends to be interested in both of those things.
*  Now, you know, there's a lot of work that's, that's interested in, in, in those
*  things, um, especially the, you know, there's all this work on probing, which
*  you might see as part of being mechanistic interpretability, although it's,
*  you know, again, it's just a broad term and not everyone who does that work
*  would identify, uh, as doing mechanistic interpretability.
*  I think a thing that is maybe a little bit distinctive to the vibe of Mechenturk
*  is I think people tend working in the space tend to think of neural networks
*  as well, maybe one way to say it is that gradient descent is smarter than you.
*  That, you know, uh, I'm gradient descent is actually really great.
*  The whole reason that we're understanding these models is because we didn't know
*  how to write them in the first place.
*  The gradient descent comes up with better solutions than us.
*  And so, um, I think that maybe another thing about Mechenturk is sort of having,
*  uh, almost a kind of humility that we won't guess a priori what's
*  going on inside the models.
*  We have to have the sort of bottom up approach where we don't really assume,
*  you know, we don't assume that we should look for a particular thing and that
*  that will be there and that's how it works.
*  But instead we look for the bottom up and discover what happens to exist in these
*  models and study them that way.
*  But you know, the very fact that it's possible to do, and as you and others
*  have shown over time, you know, things like universality, that the wisdom of
*  gradient descent creates features and circuits, creates things universally
*  across different kinds of networks that are useful and that makes the whole
*  field possible.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is actually is indeed a really remarkable and exciting thing where it
*  does seem like at least to some extent, you know, the same, the same elements,
*  the same, the same features and circuits form again and again.
*  Um, you know, you can look at every vision model and you'll find curve
*  detectors and you'll find high-low frequency detectors.
*  Um, and in fact, there's some, some reason to think that the same things form across,
*  you know, biological neural networks and artificial neural networks.
*  So a famous example is vision, vision models in the early layers, they have
*  Gabor filters and there's, you know, Gabor filters are something that neuroscientists
*  are interested in and have thought a lot about.
*  We find curve detectors in these models, curve detectors are also found in monkeys.
*  We discover these high-low frequency detectors and then some follow-up work
*  went and discovered them in rats or mice.
*  Um, so they were found first in artificial neural networks and then found
*  in biological neural networks.
*  Um, you know, there's this really famous result on like grandmother neurons or the,
*  um, the Haley Berry neuron from Quiroga et al.
*  And we found very similar things in, in vision models where, as well, I was still
*  at OpenAI and I was looking at their clip model, um, and you find, um, these neurons
*  that respond to the same entities in images and also to give a concrete example,
*  there, we found that there was a Donald Trump neuron.
*  For some reason, I guess everyone likes to talk about Donald Trump and, and
*  Donald Trump was very prominent.
*  It was, it was very, a very hot topic at that time.
*  So every, every neural network that we looked at, we would find a dedicated
*  neuron for Donald Trump.
*  Um, and it was the only person who had always had a dedicated neuron.
*  Um, you know, sometimes you'd have an Obama neuron, sometimes you'd have a Clinton
*  neuron, but, uh, Trump always had a dedicated neuron.
*  So it responds to, you know, pictures of his face and the word Trump, like all of
*  these things, right?
*  Um, and so it's, it's not responding to a particular example or like, it's not
*  just responding to his face, it's, it's abstracting over this general concept.
*  Right?
*  So in any case, that's very similar to these Quiroga et al.
*  results.
*  So there's evidence that these, that this phenomenon of universality, the same
*  things form across both artificial and, and natural neural networks.
*  So that's, that's a pretty amazing thing, if that's true.
*  Um, you know, it suggests that, um, well, I think the thing that it suggests is
*  that gradient descent is sort of finding, you know, the right ways to cut things
*  apart in some sense that many systems converge on and, and many different neural
*  networks are, architecture is converged on.
*  Now there's, there's some natural set of, you know, there's some set of
*  abstractions that are a very natural way to cut apart the problem.
*  And there are a lot of systems are going to converge on.
*  Um, that would be my, my kind of, uh, you know, I don't know anything about
*  neuroscience, this is just my, my kind of wild speculation from what we've seen.
*  Yeah, that would be beautiful if it's sort of agnostic to the medium of, uh, of
*  the model that's used to form the representation.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's, you know, it's a, uh, a, uh, kind of a wild speculation based, you
*  know, we only have some, a few data points that suggest this, but you know,
*  it does seem like there's, um, there's some sense in which the same things form
*  again and again and again and again, both in certainly in natural neural networks
*  and also artificially or in biology.
*  And the intuition behind that would be that, you know, words in order to be
*  useful in understanding the real world, you need all the same kind of stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, if we pick, I don't know, like the idea of a dog, right?
*  Like, you know, there's some sense in which the idea of a dog is like an, a
*  natural category in the universe or something like this, right?
*  Like, you know, uh, uh, there's, there's some reason it's, it's not just like a
*  weird quirk of like how humans factor, you know, think about the world that we
*  have this concept of a dog, it's, it's in some sense, uh, or, or like, if you
*  have the idea of a line, like there's, you know, like look around us, you know,
*  the, the, you know, there are lines, you know, it's sort of the simplest way to
*  understand this room in some senses to have the idea of a line.
*  And so, um, I think that that would be my instinct for why this happens.
*  Yeah.
*  You need a curved line, you know, to understand a circle and you need all
*  those shapes to understand bigger things.
*  And it's a hierarchy of concepts that are formed.
*  Yeah.
*  And like, maybe there are ways to go and describe, you know, images without
*  reference to those things, right?
*  But they're not the simplest way or the most economical way or something like
*  this. And so systems converge to these, um, these, these strategies would be my,
*  my wild, wild hypothesis.
*  Can you talk through some of the building blocks that we've been referencing of
*  features and circuits?
*  So I think you first described them in a 2020 paper, zoom in an introduction to
*  circuits.
*  Absolutely.
*  So, um, maybe I'll start by just describing some phenomena and then we can sort of
*  build to the idea of features and circuits.
*  Wonderful.
*  Um, if you spent like quite a few years, maybe, maybe like five years to some
*  extent, um, with other things, studying this one particular model, Inception V1,
*  um, which is this one vision model.
*  It was, um, state of the art in 2015.
*  Um, and, uh, uh, you know, very much not state of the art anymore.
*  Um, and it has, you know, maybe about 10,000 neurons.
*  And then I spent a lot of time looking at the 10,000 neurons, neurons of Inception
*  V1.
*  Um, and one of the interesting things is, you know, there are lots of neurons that
*  don't have some obvious integral meaning, but there's a lot of neurons in Inception
*  V1 that do have really clean integral meanings.
*  Um, so you find neurons that just really do seem to detect curves and you find
*  neurons that really do seem to detect cars and, um, car wheels and car windows
*  and, you know, floppy ears of dogs and dogs with long snouts facing to the right
*  and dogs with long snouts facing to the left and, you know, different kinds of
*  foreign, there's sort of this whole beautiful edge detectors, line detectors,
*  color contrast detectors, um, these beautiful things we call high-low
*  frequency detectors.
*  You know, I think looking at it, I sort of felt like a biologist, you know, you
*  just, you're looking at, at this sort of new world of proteins and then you're
*  discovering all these, these are proteins that interact.
*  Um, so one way you could try to understand these models is in terms of neurons.
*  You could try to be like, oh, you know, there's a dog detecting neuron and, um,
*  you know, here's a car detecting neuron.
*  And it turns out you can actually ask how those connect together.
*  So you can go and say, oh, you know, I have this car detecting neuron, how was
*  it built?
*  And it turns out in the previous layer, it's connected really strongly to a
*  window detector and a wheel detector and a sort of car body detector.
*  And it looks for the window above the car and the wheels below and the car
*  chrome sort of in the middle, sort of everywhere, but especially on the lower
*  part.
*  Um, and that's sort of a recipe for a car.
*  Right?
*  Like that is, you know, earlier we said that the thing we wanted from MechInterp
*  was to get algorithms to go and get, you know, ask what is the algorithm that
*  runs well here.
*  We're just looking at the weights of the neural network and reading off this kind
*  of recipe for detecting cars.
*  It's a very simple crude recipe, but it's, it's there.
*  And so we call that a circuit, this, this connection.
*  Well, okay.
*  So the problem is that not all of the neurons, um, are Interp.
*  And there, there's reason to think.
*  Um, we can get into this more later that there's this, this superposition
*  hypothesis, this reason to think that sometimes the right unit to analyze
*  things in terms of, um, is combinations of neurons.
*  So sometimes it's not that there's a single neuron that represents say a car.
*  Um, but it actually turns out after you detect the car, the model sort of hides
*  a little bit of the car in the following layer and a bunch of, a bunch of dog
*  detectors, why is it doing that?
*  Well, you know, maybe it just doesn't want to do that much work on, on, on, on
*  cars at that point.
*  And, and, you know, it's sort of storing it away to go and, um, uh, so it turns
*  it then that the sort of subtle pattern of, you know, there's all these neurons
*  that you think are dog detectors and maybe they're primarily that, but they
*  all a little bit contribute to representing a car, um, in, in that next layer.
*  Okay.
*  So, so now we can't really think there, there might still be some, something that
*  you, I don't know, you could call it like a car concept or something, but it no
*  longer corresponds to a neuron.
*  So we need some term for these kind of neuron like entities, these things that
*  we sort of would have liked the neurons to be these idealized neurons, um, the
*  things that are the nice neurons, but also maybe there's more of them somehow
*  hidden and we call those features.
*  And then what are circuits?
*  So circuits are these connections of features, right?
*  So, so when we have the car detector, um, and it's connected to a window
*  detector and a wheel detector, and it looks for the wheels below and the
*  windows on top, um, that's a circuit.
*  Um, so circuits are just collections of features connected by weights.
*  Um, and they, they implement algorithms.
*  So they tell us, you know, how is, how are features used?
*  How are they built?
*  Um, how do they connect together?
*  So maybe it's, it's, it's worth trying to pin down like what, what really, um,
*  is the core hypothesis here?
*  And I think the, the core hypothesis is something we call it
*  the linear representation hypothesis.
*  So, um, if we think about the car detector, you know, the more it fires, the
*  more we sort of think of that as meaning, oh, the model is more and more confident
*  that, um, a car is present.
*  Um, or, you know, if there's some combination of neurons that represent a
*  car, you know, the more that combination fires, the more we think the model
*  thinks there's a car present.
*  Um, this doesn't have to be the case, right?
*  Like you could imagine something where you have, you know, you have this car
*  detector neuron and you think, ah, you know, if it fires like, you know, between
*  one and two, that means one thing, but it means like totally different if it's
*  between three and four, um, that would be a nonlinear representation.
*  And in principle that, you know, models could do that.
*  I think it's, it's sort of inefficient for them to do the, if you try to think
*  about how you'd implement computation like that, it's, it's kind of an annoying
*  thing to do, but in principle, models can do that.
*  Um, so, uh, one way to think about the features and, and circuits sort of
*  framework for thinking about things is that we're thinking about things as being
*  linear, we're thinking about there as being, um, that if a, if a neuron or a
*  combination of neurons fires more, it's sort of, that means more of the, of a
*  particular thing being detected.
*  And then that gives weights a very clean interpretation as these edges between
*  these, these entities that these features, um, and that, that edge then has a, has a
*  Mina.
*  Um, so that's, that's in some ways the core thing.
*  Um, it's, it's like, um, you know, we can talk about this sort of
*  outset the context of neurons.
*  Are you familiar with the word to VEC results?
*  Um, so you have like, you know, King minus man plus woman equals Queen.
*  Well, the reason you can do that kind of arithmetic, um, is because you
*  have a linear representation.
*  Can you actually explain that representation a little bit?
*  So first off, so the feature is a, is a direction of activation.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  That way, can you do the, the, the minus men plus women that, that the word to VEC
*  stuff, can you explain what that is?
*  Yeah.
*  So there's this very, such a simple, clean explanation of what we're talking about.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's this very famous result word to VEC by Thomas Mikolov at all.
*  And there's been tons of follow-up work exploring this.
*  So, so sometimes we have these, we create these word embeddings, um, where, uh, we
*  map every word to a vector.
*  I mean, that in itself, by the way, is, is kind of a crazy thing.
*  If you haven't thought about it before, right?
*  Like we've, we're, we're going in and representing, we're turning, um, you know,
*  like, like if you just learned about vectors in physics class, right.
*  And I'm like, oh, I'm going to actually turn every word in the dictionary into a
*  vector, that's kind of a crazy idea.
*  Okay.
*  But you could imagine, um, you could imagine all kinds of ways in which you
*  might map words to vectors, but it, it seems like when we train neural networks,
*  um, they like to go in and map words to vectors to such that they're, they're,
*  they're sort of linear structure in a particular sense, which is that
*  directions have meaning.
*  So for instance, if you, there, there will be some direction that seems to sort of
*  correspond to gender and male words will be, you know, far in one direction and
*  female words will be in another direction.
*  And the linear representation hypothesis is, you could sort of think of it roughly
*  as saying that that's actually kind of the fundamental thing that's going on,
*  that, that everything is just different directions have meanings and adding
*  different direction vectors together can represent concepts.
*  And the Mikhailov paper sort of took that idea seriously.
*  And one consequence of it is that you can, you can do this game of playing
*  sort of arithmetic with words.
*  So you can do King and you can, you know, subtract off the word man and add the
*  word woman, and so you're sort of, you know, going and trying to switch the gender.
*  And indeed, if you do that, the result will sort of be close to the word queen.
*  Um, and you can, you know, do other things like you can do, um, uh, you know,
*  sushi minus Japan plus Italy and get pizza or, uh, different, different
*  things like this, right?
*  Um, so, so this is in some sense, the core of the linear representation
*  hypothesis, you can describe it just as a purely abstract thing about vector
*  spaces, you can describe it as a, as a statement about, um, about the
*  activations of neurons.
*  Um, but it's, it's really about this, this property of directions having
*  meaning and in some ways it's even a little subtle to that.
*  It's, it's pretty, I think mostly about this property of being able to add things
*  together, um, that you can sort of independently modify, um, say gender
*  and royalty or, um, you know, cuisine type or country and, and, and, and the
*  concept of food by, by adding them.
*  Do you think the linear hypothesis holds that carries scales?
*  So, so far, I think everything I have seen is consistent with this hypothesis.
*  And it doesn't have to be that way, right?
*  Like, like you can write down neural networks where, um, you write weights
*  such that they don't have linear representations where the right way to
*  understand them is not, it's not in terms of linear representations.
*  But I think every natural neural network I've seen, um, has this property.
*  Um, there's been one paper recently, um, that there's been some sort
*  of pushing around the edge.
*  So I think there's been some work recently studying multi-dimensional
*  features where rather than a single direction, it's more like, um, a
*  manifold of directions.
*  This to me still seems like a linear representation.
*  Um, and then there's been some other papers suggesting that maybe, um, in,
*  in very small models, you get non-linear representations.
*  Um, I think that the jury's still out on that.
*  Um, but in, I think everything that we've seen so far has been consistent
*  with the linear representation of health.
*  And that's, that's wild.
*  It doesn't have to be that way.
*  Um, and yet, uh, I think there's a lot of evidence that certainly at least this
*  is very, very widespread and so far the evidence is consistent with it.
*  And I, and I think, you know, one thing you might say is you might say, well,
*  Christopher, you know, it's, that's a lot, you know, to, to go and, and sort
*  of, um, to write on, you know, if we don't know for sure this is true and you're
*  sort of, you know, you're investing it in all networks as though it is true.
*  You know, isn't that, um, isn't that dangerous?
*  Well, you know, but I think actually there's a virtue in taking
*  hypotheses seriously and pushing them as far as they can go.
*  Um, so it might be that someday we discover something that isn't consistent
*  with linear representation hypothesis, but science is full of hypotheses
*  and theories that were wrong.
*  Um, and we learned a lot by sort of working under, under them as a sort of
*  an assumption, um, and, and then going and pushing them as far as we can.
*  I guess, I guess this is sort of the heart of, of what Kuhn would call normal,
*  normal science.
*  Um, I dunno, I, if you want, we can talk a lot about, about, uh, philosophy of
*  science and, uh, leads to the paradigm shift.
*  So yeah, I love it.
*  Taking the hypothesis seriously and take it to a natural, natural conclusion.
*  Yeah.
*  Same with the scaling hypothesis.
*  Same.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  And I love it.
*  One of my colleagues, Tom Hannigan, who as a former physicist, um, I like
*  made this really nice analogy to me of, um, uh, caloric theory where, you know,
*  once upon a time we thought that heat was actually, you know, this thing
*  called caloric and like the reason, you know, hot objects, you know, would,
*  would warm up cool objects is like the caloric is flowing through them.
*  Um, and like, you know, because we're so used to thinking about heat, you know,
*  in terms of the modern and modern theory, you know, that seems kind of silly,
*  but it's actually very hard to construct, uh, an experiment that, that sort of
*  disproves the, um, clerk hypothesis.
*  Um, and you know, you can actually do a lot of really useful work believing in
*  cloric, for example, it, it turns out that the original combustion engines were
*  developed by people who believed in the cloric theory.
*  So I think it's a virtue in taking, um, hypothesis seriously,
*  even when they might be wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a deep philosophical truth to that.
*  That's kind of, kind of how I feel about space travel.
*  Like colonizing Mars.
*  There's a lot of people that criticize that.
*  I think if you just assume we have to colonize Mars and in order to have a
*  backup for human civilization, even if that's not true, that's going to produce
*  some interesting, interesting engineering and even scientific breakthroughs, I
*  think.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, and actually this is another thing that I think is really interesting.
*  So, um, you know, there's a way in which I think it can be really useful for
*  society to have people, um, almost be rationally dedicated to investigating
*  particular hypotheses.
*  Um, because, uh, well, it takes a lot to sort of maintain scientific morale and
*  really push on something when, you know, most, most scientific hypotheses end up
*  being wrong, you know, a lot of, a lot of science doesn't, doesn't work out.
*  Um, and, but it's, and yet it's, you know, it's very, it's very useful to go to
*  just, you know, um, there's a, there's a joke about Jeff Hinton, um, which is that,
*  uh, Jeff Hinton has discovered how the brain works every year for the last 50
*  years.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, but you know, I say that with like, you know, the, you know, with, with really
*  deep respect because, uh, in fact, that's actually, you know, that, that led to him
*  doing some, some really great work.
*  Yeah.
*  He won the Nobel Prize now who's laughing now.
*  Exactly.
*  Um, I think one wants to be able to pop up and sort of recognize the, the
*  appropriate level of confidence, but I think there's also a lot of value and
*  just being like, you know, I'm going to essentially assume, I'm going to condition
*  on this problem being possible or this being broadly the right approach.
*  And I'm just going to go and assume that for a while and go and work within that.
*  Um, and push really hard on it.
*  Um, and you know, if society has lots of people doing, doing that for different
*  things, um, that's actually really useful in terms of going and, uh, getting to
*  getting, you know, either really, really ruling things out, right?
*  We can be like, well, you know, that didn't work and we know that somebody tried
*  hard, um, or going and getting to something that, that does teach us
*  something about the world.
*  So another interesting hypothesis is the superposition hypothesis.
*  Can you describe what superposition is?
*  Yeah.
*  So earlier we were talking about word defect, right?
*  And we were talking about how, you know, maybe you have one direction that
*  corresponds to gender and maybe another that corresponds to royalty and another
*  one that corresponds to Italy and another one that corresponds to, you know, food
*  and all of these things.
*  Well, you know, um, oftentimes maybe these, these, uh, these word embeddings,
*  they might be 500 dimensions, a thousand dimensions.
*  And so if you believe that all of those directions were orthogonal, um, then you
*  could only have, you know, 500 concepts and, you know, I love pizza.
*  Um, but like if I was going to go and like give the like 500 most important concepts
*  in, um, you know, the English language, probably Italy wouldn't be, it's not
*  obvious at least that Italy would be one of them, right?
*  Cause you have to have things like plural and singular and, uh, verb and
*  noun and adjective and you know, um, there's a lot of things we have to get
*  to before we get to get to Italy, um, uh, and Japan and, you know, there's a
*  lot of countries in the world.
*  Um, and so how might it be that models could, you know, simultaneously have the
*  linear representation hypothesis be true and also represent more things
*  than they have directions.
*  So, so what does that mean?
*  Well, okay.
*  So if, if, if linear representation hypothesis is true, something
*  interesting has to be going on.
*  Now I'll, I'll tell you one more interesting thing before we, we go and we
*  do that, which is, um, you know, earlier we were talking about all these
*  polysematic neurons, right?
*  Um, these neurons that, you know, when we were looking at inception V1, there's
*  these nice neurons that like the car detector and the curve detector and so on
*  that respond to lots of, you know, to very coherent things, but it's lots of
*  neurons that respond to a bunch of unrelated things.
*  And that's, that's also an interesting phenomenon.
*  Um, and it turns out as well, um, that even these neurons that are really,
*  really clean, if you look at the weak activations, right?
*  So if you look at like, you know, the activations where it's like activating
*  5% of, of the, the, you know, of the maximum activation, it's really not the
*  core thing that it's expecting, right?
*  So if you look at a, a curve detector, for instance, and you look at the
*  places where it's 5% active, you know, you could interpret it just as noise
*  or it could be that it's, that it's doing something else there.
*  Okay.
*  So, so how could that be?
*  Well, there's this amazing thing in mathematics, um, called compressed
*  sensing and it's, it's actually this, this very surprising fact where if you
*  have a high dimensional space and you project it into a low dimensional space,
*  ordinarily you can't go and sort of unprojected and get back your high
*  dimensional vector, right?
*  You threw information away.
*  This is like, you know, you can't, you can't invert a rectangular matrix.
*  Um, you can only invert square matrices.
*  Um, but it turns out that that's actually not quite true.
*  If I tell you that the high dimensional vector was sparse, so it's mostly zeros,
*  then it turns out that you can often go and find back, um, the, uh, the high
*  dimensional vector with, with very high probability.
*  Um, so that's a surprising fact, right?
*  It says that, you know, you can, um, you can, you can have this high
*  dimensional vector space and as long as things are sparse, um, you can project
*  it down, you can have a lower dimensional projection of it and that works.
*  So the series of shape office is saying that that's what's going on in neural
*  networks, that's for instance, that's what's going on in word embeddings.
*  The word embeddings are able to simultaneously have directions be the
*  meaningful thing and by exploiting the fact that they're, they're operating on a
*  fairly high dimensional space, they're actually, and the fact that these concepts
*  are sparse, right?
*  Like, you know, you usually aren't talking about Japan and Italy at the same time.
*  Um, you know, most of the, most of those concepts, you know, in most
*  sentences, Japan and Italy are both zero.
*  They're not present at all.
*  Um, and if that's true, um, then you can go and have it be the case that, um, that
*  you can, you can have many more of these sort of directions that are meaningful,
*  these features, then you have dimensions.
*  And similarly, when we're talking about neurons, you can have many more concepts
*  than you have have neurons.
*  So that's the high level of superstition hypothesis.
*  Now it has this even a wilder implication, which is, um, to go and say that,
*  uh, neural networks are, it may not just be the case that the representations are
*  like this, but the computation may also be like this, you know, the connections
*  between all of them.
*  And so in some sense, neural networks may be shadows of much larger,
*  sparser neural networks.
*  And what we see are these projections.
*  Um, and the super, you know, the strongest version of superstition hypothesis would
*  be to take that really seriously and sort of say, you know, there, there actually
*  isn't some sense that this upstairs model, this, you know, um, where, where the
*  neurons are really sparse and all interperable and there's, you know, the
*  weights between them are these really sparse circuits and that's what we're
*  studying.
*  Um, and, uh, the thing that we're observing is the shadow of it.
*  And so we need to find the original object.
*  And, uh, the process of learning is trying to construct a compression of the
*  upstairs model that doesn't lose too much information in the projection.
*  Yeah.
*  It's finding how to fit it efficiently or something like this.
*  Um, the gradient descent is doing this.
*  And in fact, so this sort of says that gradient descent, you know, it could just
*  represent a dense neural network, but it sort of says that gradient descent is
*  pleasantly searching over the space of extremely sparse models that could be
*  projected into this low dimensional space and this large body of work of, of
*  people going and trying to study sparse neural networks, right?
*  Where you go and you have, you could design neural networks, right?
*  Where, where the edges are sparse and the activations are sparse.
*  And, you know, my sense is that work has generally, it feels very principled,
*  right?
*  It makes so much sense.
*  And yet that, that work hasn't really panned out that well is my impression
*  broadly.
*  And I think that a potential answer for that is that actually the neural network
*  is already sparse in some sense.
*  Gradient descent was the whole time gradient, you were trying to go and do
*  this gradient descent was actually in the behind the scenes going and searching
*  more efficiently than you could through the space of sparse models and going and
*  learning whatever sparse model was most efficient and then figuring out how to
*  fold it down nicely to go and run conveniently on your GPU, which does, you
*  know, it's a nice dense matrix multiplies.
*  Um, and that you just can't beat that.
*  How many concepts do you think can be shoved into a neural network?
*  It depends on how sparse they are.
*  So there's, there's probably an upper bound from the number of parameters,
*  right?
*  Cause you have to have, you still have to have, you know, param weights that go
*  and connect them together.
*  Um, so that's, that's one upper bound.
*  There are in fact, all these lovely results from compressed sensing and the
*  Johnson-Linden stress lemma and things like this, um, that they, they basically
*  tell you that if you have a vector space and you want to have almost orthogonal
*  vectors, which is sort of the, probably the thing that you want here, right?
*  So you, you're going to say, well, you know, I'm going to give up on having my,
*  my concepts, my features be strictly orthogonal, but I'd like them to not
*  interfere that much.
*  I'm going to have to ask them to be almost orthogonal.
*  Um, then this would say that it's actually, you know, for once you set a
*  threshold for what you're, what you're willing to accept in terms of how, how
*  much cosine similarity there is, that's actually exponential in the number of
*  neurons that you have.
*  So at some point that's not going to even be the limiting factor.
*  Um, but, um, it's beautiful results there.
*  And in fact, it's probably even better than that in some sense, because that's
*  sort of a, for saying that, you know, any random set of features could be active.
*  But in fact, the features have sort of a correlational structure where some
*  features, you know, more, are more likely to co-occur and other ones are less
*  likely to co-occur.
*  And so neural networks, my guess would be, could do, do very well in terms of
*  going and, uh, packing things in such, to the point that's probably, probably
*  not the limiting factor.
*  How does the problem of polysemiticity enter the picture here?
*  Polysemiticity is this phenomenon we observe where you look at many neurons
*  and the neuron doesn't just sort of represent one, one concept.
*  It's not, it's not a clean feature.
*  It responds to a bunch of unrelated things.
*  And, um, superstition is, you can think of as, as being a hypothesis that
*  explains the observation of polysemiticity.
*  Um, so polysemiticity is this observed phenomenon and superstition is, is a
*  hypothesis that, um, would explain it along with some other things.
*  So that makes Mechenturb more difficult.
*  Right.
*  So if you, if you're trying to understand things in terms of individual neurons
*  and you have polysemitic neurons, you're in an awful lot of trouble, right?
*  I mean, the easiest answer is like, okay, well, you know, you're looking at
*  the neurons, you're trying to understand them.
*  This one responds for a lot of things.
*  It doesn't have a nice meaning.
*  Okay.
*  We're, you know, that's, that's, that's bad.
*  Um, another thing you can ask is, you know, ultimately we want to understand
*  the weights and if you have two polysemitic neurons and, you know, each one
*  responds to three things and then, you know, the other neuron responds to three
*  things and you have a weight between them.
*  You know, what does that mean?
*  Does it mean that like all three, you know, like there's these nine, you
*  know, nine interactions going on?
*  It's a very weird thing, but there's also a deeper reason, which is related to
*  the fact that neural networks operate on really high dimensional spaces.
*  So I said that our goal was, you know, to understand neural networks
*  and understand the mechanisms.
*  And one thing you might say is like, well, why not?
*  It's just a mathematical function.
*  Why not just look at it?
*  Right.
*  Like, um, you know, one of the earliest projects I did studied these, these
*  neural networks that matched two dimensional spaces to two dimensional
*  spaces and you can sort of interpret them in this beautiful way is like
*  bending manifolds.
*  Um, why can't we do that?
*  Well, you know, as you have a higher dimensional space, um, the volume of
*  that space in some sense is exponential in the number of inputs you have.
*  And so you can't just go and visualize it.
*  So we somehow need to break that apart.
*  We need to somehow break that exponential space into a bunch of things that we,
*  you know, some non-exponential number of things that we can reason about
*  independently.
*  And the independence is crucial because it's the independence that allows you to
*  not have to think about, you know, all the exponential combinations of things.
*  And things being monosomatic, things only having one meaning, things having a
*  meaning, that isn't, is the key thing that allows you to think about them
*  independently.
*  And so I think that's, that's, if you want the deepest reason why we want to
*  have, um, interproperal monosomatic features, I think that's really the deep
*  reason.
*  And so the goal here as your recent work has been aiming at is how do we extract
*  the monosomatic features from a neural net that has polysemantic features and
*  all this, this mess?
*  Yes.
*  We have, we observe these polysemantic neurons and we hypothesize that's what's
*  going, what's going on in a superstition.
*  And if superstition is what's going on, there, there's actually a sort of well
*  established technique that is sort of the principled thing to do, which is
*  dictionary learning.
*  And, um, it turns out if you do dictionary learning, in particular, if
*  you do the sort of a nice efficient way that in some, in some sense, sort of
*  nicely regularizes it as well, as well called a sparse autoencoder, you train a
*  sparse autoencoder, these beautiful and triple features start to just fall out
*  where there weren't any beforehand.
*  And so that's not a thing that you would necessarily predict, right?
*  But it turns out that that works very, very well.
*  You know, to me that seems like, you know, some non-trivial validation of
*  linear representations and superstition.
*  So with dictionary learning, you're not looking for particular kind of categories.
*  You don't know what they are.
*  Exactly.
*  And this gets back to our earlier point, right?
*  When we're not making assumptions, gradient descent is smarter than us.
*  So we're not making assumptions about what's there.
*  Um, I mean, one certainly could do that, right?
*  One could assume that there's a PHP feature and go and search for it, but
*  we're not doing that.
*  We're saying, we don't know what's going to be there.
*  Instead, we're just going to go and let, um, the sparse autoencoder discover
*  the things that are there.
*  So can you talk to the toward Montesimaticity paper from October last year?
*  That had a lot of like nice breakthrough results.
*  That's very kind of you to describe it that way.
*  Um, yeah, I mean, this was, um, uh, our first real success using sparse autoencoders.
*  So we took a one layer model.
*  Um, and it turns out if you go in, you, you know, do dictionary learning on it,
*  you find all these really nice and temporal features.
*  So, you know, the Arabic feature, the Hebrew feature, the base 64 features
*  as were, were some, some examples that we studied in a lot of depth and really
*  showed that they were, um, what we thought they were at transit.
*  If you train a model twice as well and train two different models and, and do
*  dictionary learning, you find, find analogous features in both of them.
*  So that's fun.
*  Um, you find all kinds of different features.
*  So that was really just showing, um, that, um, that this works.
*  And, um, you know, I should mention that there was this Cunningham at all, um,
*  that had very similar results around the same time.
*  There's something fun about being doing these kinds of small scale experiments
*  and finding there's actually working.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, and there's, and that there's so much structure here.
*  Like you, you know, so maybe, maybe stepping back for a while.
*  Um, I thought that maybe all this mechanistic interpolate work, um, the end
*  result was going to be that I would have an explanation for why it was sort of,
*  you know, very hard and not going to be tractable.
*  Um, you know, we'd be like, well, there's this problem with supersession and it
*  turns out the position is really hard.
*  Um, and we're kind of screwed, but that's not what happened.
*  In fact, a very natural, simple technique just works.
*  And so then that's actually a very good situation.
*  You know, I think, um, this is a sort of hard research problem and it's got a lot
*  of research risk and you know, it might still very well fail, but, um, I think
*  that some amount of some very significant amount of research risk, um, was sort
*  of put behind us when that started to work.
*  Can you describe what kind of features can be extracted in this way?
*  Well, so it depends on the model that you're studying, right?
*  So the, the larger the model, the more sophisticated they're going to be.
*  And we'll probably talk about that follow up work in a minute.
*  Um, but in these one layer models, um, so some very common things I think were,
*  were languages, both programming languages and natural languages.
*  There were a lot of features that were, um, specific words in specific contexts.
*  So the, and I think really the way to think about this is that the is likely
*  about to be followed by a noun.
*  So it's really right.
*  You could think of this as the feature, but you could also think of this
*  as predicting a specific noun feature.
*  And there would be these features that would fire for the, in, um, the context
*  of, of say a legal document or a mathematical document or something like this.
*  Um, and so, uh, you know, maybe in the context of math, you're like, you know,
*  the, and then predict vector or matrix, you know, all of these mathematical words,
*  whereas, you know, in other contexts, you would predict other things that was,
*  that was common.
*  And basically we need clever humans to assign labels to what we're seeing.
*  Yes.
*  So, you know, this, this is the only thing this is doing is that sort of, um,
*  unfolding things for you.
*  So if everything was sort of folded over top of it, you know, see position folded
*  everything on top of itself and you can't really see it, this is unfolding it.
*  But now you still have a very complex thing to try to understand.
*  Um, so then you have to do a bunch of work understanding what these are.
*  Um, and some of them are really subtle.
*  Like there's some really cool things, even in this, this one layer model about,
*  um, Unicode where, you know, of course some languages are in Unicode and the
*  tokenizer won't necessarily have a dedicated token for every, um, Unicode,
*  um, character.
*  So instead what you'll have is you'll have this, these patterns of alternating
*  token or alternating tokens that each represent half of a Unicode character.
*  And you have a different feature that, you know, goes and activates on the, on
*  the opposing ones to be like, okay, you know, um, I just finished a character,
*  you know, go and predict next prefix.
*  Um, then okay, I'm on the prefix, you know, predict a reasonable suffix.
*  Um, and you have to alternate back and forth.
*  So there's, you know, these, these one layer models are really interesting.
*  And, um, I mean, there's another thing that just, you might think, okay, there
*  would just be one base 64 feature, but it turns out there's actually a bunch of
*  base 64 features because you can have English text encoded in as base 64.
*  And that has a very different distribution of base 64 tokens than, than regular.
*  And there's, um, uh, there's, there's some things about tokenization as well,
*  but it can exploit and I don't know, there's all kinds of fun stuff.
*  How difficult is the task of sort of assigning labels to what's going on?
*  Can this be automated by AI?
*  Well, I think it depends on the feature and it also depends on how much you trust
*  your AI.
*  So, um, there's a lot of work doing, um, automated and topology.
*  I think that's a really exciting direction and we do a fair amount of
*  automated and topology and have, have flawed go and label our features.
*  Is there some funny moments where it's totally right or it's totally wrong?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I think, I think it's very common that it's like, says something very
*  general, which is like true in some sense, but not really picking up on the
*  specific of what's going on.
*  Um, so I think, I think that's a pretty common situation.
*  Um, you don't know that I have a particularly amusing one.
*  That's interesting.
*  That little gap between it is true, but it doesn't quite get to the deep
*  nuance of a thing.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a general challenge.
*  It's like, it's, it's 30 and incredible accomplishment.
*  They can say a true thing, but it doesn't, it's not, it's missing the depth
*  sometimes, and then this context, it's like the arc challenge, you know, the
*  sort of IQ type of tests.
*  It feels like figuring out what a feature represents is a bit of a little
*  puzzle you have to solve.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that sometimes they're easier and sometimes they're harder as well.
*  Um, so, uh, yeah, I think, I think that's tricky.
*  And there's another thing, which I don't know, maybe, maybe in some ways, this is
*  my like aesthetic coming in, but I'll try to give you a rationalization.
*  You know, I'm actually a little suspicious of automated interoperability.
*  And I think that partly just that I want humans to understand neural networks.
*  And if the neural network is understanding it for me, you know, I'm not, I don't
*  quite like that, but I do have a bit of a, you know, in some ways I'm sort of like
*  the mathematicians who are like, you know, if there's a computer automated
*  proof, it doesn't count.
*  Um, you know, you, they won't understand it, but I do also think that there is,
*  um, it's kind of like reflections on trusting trust type issue where, you
*  know, if you, there's this famous talk about, um, uh, you know, you're like,
*  when you're writing a computer program, you have to trust your compiler.
*  And if there was like malware in your compiler, then it could go and inject
*  malware into the next compiler.
*  And you know, you'd be in kind of in trouble, right?
*  Well, if you're using neural networks to go and verify that your neural
*  networks are safe, the hypothesis that you're testing for is like, okay, well,
*  the neural network maybe isn't safe.
*  Um, and you have to worry about like, is there some way that it
*  could be screwing with you?
*  Um, so, uh, you know, I think that's not a big concern now.
*  Um, but I do wonder in the long run, if we have to use really powerful
*  system, AI systems to go and, uh, you know, audit our AI systems, is that,
*  is that actually something we can trust?
*  But maybe I'm just rationalizing cause I, I just want us to have to get to a
*  point where humans understand everything.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, especially that's hilarious, especially as we talk about AI safety
*  and looking for features that would be relevant to AI safety, like deception
*  and so on.
*  Uh, so let's, let's talk about the scaling monosemanticity paper in May, 2024.
*  Okay.
*  So what did it take to scale this to apply to Claude 3 sonnet?
*  Well, a lot of GPUs, a lot more GPUs.
*  But one of my teammates, Tom Hennigan, um, was involved in the original scaling
*  laws work.
*  Um, and something that he was sort of interested in from very early on is, are
*  there scaling laws for interoperability?
*  Um, and so, um, something he sort of immediately did when, when this, this
*  work started to succeed and we started to have sparse autoencoders work, because
*  we became very interested in, you know, what are the scaling laws for, um, uh,
*  you know, for making, making sparse autoencoders larger and how does that
*  relate to making the base model larger?
*  Um, and so, um, it turns out this works really well and you can use it to sort
*  of project, um, you know, if you train a sparse autoencoder at a given size, you
*  know, how many tokens should you train on and so on.
*  So this was actually a very big help to us in scaling up, um, this work, um, and
*  made it a lot easier for us to go and train, uh, you know, really large sparse
*  autoencoders where, you know, um, it's not like training the big models, but
*  it's starting to get to a point where it's actually, actually expensive to go,
*  um, and train the really big ones.
*  So you have to, I mean, you have to do all this stuff of like splitting
*  it across large,
*  Oh, yeah.
*  No, I mean, there's a huge engineering challenge here too, right?
*  So, yeah, so, so there's, there's a, there's a scientific question of how do
*  you scale things effectively?
*  Um, and then there's an enormous amount of engineering to go and scale this up.
*  So you have to, you have to chart it.
*  You have to, you have to think very carefully about a lot of things.
*  I'm lucky to work with a bunch of great engineers because I am definitely not a
*  great engineer.
*  Yeah.
*  And the infrastructure especially.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  So it turns out T L D R it worked.
*  It worked.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think this is important because you could have imagined, you could have,
*  like you could have imagined a world where you set out towards monosubstanticity.
*  You know, Chris, this is great.
*  You know, it works on a one layer model, but one layer models are really idiosyncratic.
*  Um, like, you know, maybe, maybe that's just something like maybe the linear
*  representation hypothesis and superposition hypothesis is the right way to understand
*  a one layer model, but it's not the right way to understand larger models.
*  Um, and so I think, um, I mean, first of all, like the Cunningham and all paper
*  sort of, um, cut through that a little bit and sort of suggested that this
*  wasn't the case, but, um, scaling monosubstanticity sort of, I think was
*  significant evidence that even for very large models, and we did it on Claude
*  three sauna, which at that point was one of our production models.
*  Um, you know, even these models, um, seem to be very, you know, seem to be
*  substantially explained at least by linear features and, you know, doing
*  dictionary running on them works.
*  And as you learn more features, you go and you explain, explain more and more.
*  So that's a, I think I have quite a promising sign and you find now really
*  fascinating abstract features, um, and the features are also multimodal.
*  They respond to images and texts for the same concept, which is fun.
*  Yeah.
*  This can you explain that?
*  I mean, like, you know, backdoor, there's just a lot of examples that you can.
*  Yeah.
*  So maybe, maybe let's start with one example to start, which is we found
*  some features around sort of security vulnerabilities and backdoors and code.
*  So it turns out those are actually two different features.
*  Um, so there's a security vulnerability feature, and if you force it active
*  Claude will start to go and write, um, security vulnerabilities, like buffer
*  overflows into code and also fires for all kinds of things like it, you know,
*  some of the, some of the top data set examples for it were things like, you
*  know, dash dash disable, um, you know, SSL or something like this, which are sort
*  of obviously really, um, uh, really insecure.
*  So at this point it's kind of like, maybe it's just because the
*  examples are presented that way.
*  It's kind of like surface a little bit more obvious examples, right?
*  Um, I guess the, the idea is that down the line, it might be able to
*  detect more nuanced, like deception or bugs or that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I may want to distinguish two things.
*  So, um, one is, um, the complexity of the feature or the concept, right?
*  And the other is the, the nuance of the, how subtle the examples we're looking at.
*  Right.
*  So when we, when we show the top data set examples, those are the most extreme
*  examples that cause that feature to activate.
*  Um, and so it doesn't mean that it doesn't fire for more subtle things.
*  So the, you know, the, the insecure, um, code feature, you know, the stuff that
*  fires for most strongly for these like really obvious, you know, disable
*  the security type things, um, but, um, um, you know, uh, it, it also fires for,
*  you know, buffer overflows and more subtle security vulnerabilities in code.
*  You know, these features are all multimodal.
*  So you could ask like what images activate this feature.
*  And it turns out, um, that the, uh, the security vulnerability feature
*  activates for images of, um, uh, like people are clicking on Chrome to like
*  go past the, like, you know, this, this website, uh, the SSL certificate might
*  be wrong or something like this.
*  Another thing that's very entertaining is there's backdoors and code feature.
*  Like you activated, it goes in, Claude writes a backdoor that like, we'll go
*  and dump your data to a port or something, but you can ask, okay, what,
*  what images activate the backdoor feature?
*  It was devices with hidden cameras in them.
*  So there's a whole, uh, apparently genre of people going and selling devices
*  that look innocuous, that have hidden cameras and they have ads about how
*  there's a hidden camera in it.
*  And I guess that is the physical version of a backdoor.
*  Um, and so it sort of shows you how abstract these concepts are.
*  Right.
*  Um, and I just thought that was, uh, I'm sort of sad that there's a whole market
*  of people selling devices like that, but I was kind of delighted that that was
*  the thing that it came up with as the top, uh, image examples for the feature.
*  Yeah, it's nice.
*  It's multimodal.
*  It's multi almost context.
*  It's as broad, strong definition of a singular concept.
*  It's nice.
*  Yeah.
*  To me, one of the really interesting features, especially for AI safety is
*  deception and lying and the possibility that these kinds of methods could detect,
*  uh, lying in a model, especially gets smarter and smarter and smarter.
*  Presumably that's a big threat of a super intelligent model that it can
*  deceive the people operating it.
*  Uh, as to its intentions or any of that kind of stuff.
*  So what, what have you learned from detecting lying inside models?
*  Yeah.
*  So I think we're in some ways in early days for that, we find quite a few
*  features related to deception and lying.
*  There's one feature where it fires for people lying and being deceptive and you
*  force it active and Claude starts lying to you.
*  So we have a, have a deception feature.
*  I mean, there's all kinds of other features about withholding information
*  and not answering questions, features about power seeking and coups and stuff
*  like that.
*  So there's, there's a lot of features that are kind of related to spooky things.
*  And if you, um, force them active, Claude will, will behave in ways that are
*  not the kinds of behaviors you want.
*  What are possible next exciting directions to you in the space of a Macinturbo?
*  Well, there's a lot of things.
*  Um, so for one thing, I would really like to get to a point
*  where we have circuits where we can really understand, um, not just the
*  features, but then use that to understand the computation of models.
*  Um, that really for me is, is the ultimate goal of this.
*  Um, and there's been some work we, we put out a few things.
*  There's a paper from Sam Marks that does some stuff like this.
*  And there's, there's been some, I'd say some work around the edges here.
*  Um, but I think there's a lot more to do.
*  And I think that will be a very exciting thing.
*  Um, that's related to a challenge we call interference weights.
*  Um, where, um, due to superposition, if you just sort of naively look at
*  whether features are connected together, there may be some weights that sort of.
*  Don't exist in the upstairs model, but are just sort of artifacts of, of superlations.
*  So that's a, uh, sort of technical challenge related to that.
*  Um, I think another exciting direction is just, I, you know, you might think
*  of, of sparse autoencoders as being kind of like a telescope.
*  They allow us to, you know, look out and see all these features that are, are, are,
*  are out there and, you know, as we build better and better sparse autoencoders,
*  get better and better at dictionary learning, we see more and more stars.
*  Um, and you know, we zoom in on smaller and smaller stars, but there's kind
*  of a lot of evidence that we're only still seeing a very small fraction of the stars.
*  There's a lot of matter in our, in our, you know, neural network universe
*  that we can't observe yet.
*  Um, and it may be that, um, that we'll never be able to have fine enough
*  instruments to observe it and maybe, maybe some of it just isn't possible.
*  Um, isn't computationally tractable to observe.
*  And so there's sort of a, a kind of dark matter and not in maybe the sense of, of
*  modern astronomy, of, of earlier astronomy when we didn't know what this unexplained
*  matter is.
*  Um, and so I think a lot about that, that dark matter and whether we'll ever observe
*  it and what that means for safety if we, if we can't observe it, if there's, you
*  know, some, if some significant fraction of neural networks are not accessible to us.
*  Um, another question that I think a lot about is, uh, at the end of the day, you
*  know, mechanistic interpolation is this very microscopic approach to interpolation.
*  It's trying to understand things in a very fine grained way, but a lot of the
*  questions we care about are very macroscopic.
*  Um, you know, we, we care about these questions about neural network behavior
*  and, and I think that's the thing that I care most about, but there's, there's lots
*  of other other sort of larger scale questions you might care about.
*  Um, and somehow, you know, the nice thing about, about having a very microscopic
*  approach is it's maybe easier to ask, you know, is this true?
*  But the downside is it's much further from the things we care about.
*  And so we now have this ladder to climb.
*  And I think that there's a question of can, will we be able to find, are there, are
*  there sort of larger scale abstractions that we can use to understand neural
*  networks that we get up from this very microscopic approach?
*  Yeah.
*  You've, you've, you've written about this, this kind of organs question.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  If we, uh, think of interpretability as a kind of anatomy of neural networks, most
*  of the circus threads involve studying tiny little veins, looking at the small
*  scale and individual neurons and how they connect.
*  However, there are many natural questions that the small scale
*  approach doesn't address.
*  In contrast, the most prominent abstractions in biological anatomy involve
*  larger scale structures like individual organs, like the heart or entire organ
*  systems, like the respiratory system.
*  And so we wonder, is there a respiratory system or heart or brain region
*  of an artificial neural network?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Um, and I mean, like if you think about science, right, a lot of scientific
*  fields have, um, you know, investigate things at many levels of abstractions.
*  In biology, you have like, you know, molecular biology studying, you know,
*  proteins and molecules and so on, and they have cellular biology, and then
*  you have histology studying tissues, then you have anatomy, and then you have
*  zoology, and then you have ecology.
*  And so you have many, many levels of abstraction or, you know, physics, maybe
*  you have the physics of individual particles, and then, you know, um,
*  statistical physics gives you, gives you thermodynamics and things like this.
*  And so you often have different levels of abstraction.
*  Um, and I think that right now we have, you know, we're the mechanistic
*  interoperability, if it succeeds, is sort of like a microbiology of neural
*  networks, but we, we want something more like anatomy.
*  And so, and, and, you know, a question you might ask is why, why can't you
*  just go there directly?
*  And I think the answer is superposition.
*  Um, at least in significant part, it's that it's actually very hard to, to see
*  this, this macroscopic structure, um, without first sort of breaking down the
*  microscopic structure in the right way and then studying how it connects together.
*  Um, but I'm, I'm hopeful that there is going to be something much larger than,
*  um, features and circuits and that we're going to be able to have a story that's
*  much, that involves much bigger things.
*  And then you can sort of study in detail the parts you care about.
*  I suppose in your biology, like a psychologist or psychiatrist, when
*  you're on that work.
*  And I think that the beautiful thing would be if we could go and rather than
*  having disparate fields for those two things, if you could have a, build a
*  bridge between them such that you could go and, um, uh, have all of your
*  higher level distractions be grounded very firmly in this very solid, um, you
*  know, more rigorous, uh, ideally foundation.
*  What do you think is the difference between the human brain, the biological
*  neural network and the artificial neural network?
*  Well, the neuroscientists have a much harder job than us.
*  You know, sometimes I just like count my blessings by how much easier my
*  job is than the neuroscientists.
*  Right.
*  So I have, um, we can record from all the neurons.
*  We can do that on arbitrary amounts of data.
*  Um, the neurons don't change while you're doing that, by the way.
*  Um, you can go and oblate neurons, you can edit the connections and so on.
*  Um, and then you can undo those changes.
*  That's pretty great.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, you can force any, you can intervene on any neuron and force it
*  active and see what happens.
*  Um, you know, which neurons are connected to everything, right?
*  You have neuroscientists want to get the connectome.
*  We have the connectome.
*  Um, and we have it for like much bigger than C. elegans.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, and then not only do we have the connectome, um, we know, uh, what the,
*  you know, which neurons excite or inhibit each other, right?
*  So we have, we, it's not just that we know that like the binary mask, we
*  know the, the weights, um, we can take gradients, we know computationally
*  what each neuron does.
*  Um, so I don't know the list goes on and on.
*  We just have, um, so many advantages over neuroscientists.
*  And then I just might having all those advantages, it's really hard.
*  And so one thing I do sometimes think is like, gosh, like if it's this hard for
*  us, it seems impossible under the constraints of neuroscience or, you
*  know, near impossible.
*  Um, I, I don't know, maybe, maybe part of me is like, I've got a few
*  neuroscientists on my team, maybe I'm sort of like, ah, you know, um, the,
*  uh, maybe the neuroscientists, maybe some of them would like to have an
*  easier problem that's still very hard.
*  Um, and they, they could come and work on, on neural networks.
*  And then after we, after we figure out things in sort of the easy, uh, little
*  pond of trying to understand neural networks, which is still very hard, then
*  we, then we could go back to a biological neuroscience.
*  I love what you've written about the goal of Mechinterp research as, uh,
*  two goals, safety and beauty.
*  So can you talk about the beauty side of things?
*  Yeah.
*  So, you know, there's this funny thing where I think some people want, uh, some
*  people are kind of disappointed by neural networks, I think where they're
*  like, ah, you know, neural networks, um, it's these, just these simple rules.
*  And then you just like do a bunch of engineering to scale it up and it works
*  really well and like, where's the like complex ideas, you know, this isn't like
*  a very nice, beautiful scientific result.
*  And I sometimes think when people say that, uh, I picture them being like, you
*  know, evolution is so boring.
*  It's just a bunch of simple rules and you run evolution for a long time and
*  you get biology, like what a, what a sucky, uh, you know, way for biology to
*  have turned out, where's the complex rules, but the beauty is that the
*  simplicity generates complexity.
*  Um, you know, biology has these simple rules and it gives rise to, you know, all
*  the life and ecosystems that we see around us, all the beauty of nature, that
*  all just comes from evolution and from something very simple evolution.
*  And similarly, I think that neural networks build, you know, create enormous,
*  um, complexity and beauty inside and structure inside themselves that people
*  generally don't look at and don't try to understand because it's hard to understand.
*  But I think that there is an incredibly rich structure to be discovered inside
*  neural networks, a lot of, a lot of very deep beauty.
*  And if we're just willing to take the time to go and see it and understand it.
*  Yeah, I love, I love Mechinter.
*  The feeling like we are understanding or getting glimpses of understanding the
*  magic that's going on inside is really wonderful.
*  It feels to me like one of the questions that's just calling out to be asked.
*  And I'm sort of, I mean, a lot of people are thinking about this, but I'm
*  often surprised that not more are.
*  Is how is it that we don't know how to create computer systems that can do these
*  things, and yet we have these amazing systems that we don't know how to directly
*  create computer programs that can do these things, but these neural networks
*  can do all these amazing things.
*  And it just feels like that is obviously the question that sort of is calling out
*  to be answered if you are, if you have any degree of curiosity, it's, it's like,
*  how is it that, that humanity now has these artifacts that can do these things
*  that we don't know how to do?
*  Yeah.
*  I love the image of the circus reaching towards the light of the objective function.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just, it's, it's this organic thing that we've grown and we have
*  no idea what we've grown.
*  Well, thank you for working on safety and thank you for appreciating the beauty of
*  the things you discover and thank you for talking today, Chris.
*  This is wonderful.
*  Thank you for taking the time to chat as well.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Chris Ola and before that with
