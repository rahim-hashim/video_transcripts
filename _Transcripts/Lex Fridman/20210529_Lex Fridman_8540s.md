# Frank Wilczek: Physics of Quarks, Dark Matter, Complexity, Life & Aliens | Lex Fridman Podcast #187
**Lex Fridman:** [May 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTe8uFqbws)
*  The following is a conversation with Frank Wilczek, a theoretical physicist at MIT who won
*  the Nobel Prize for the co-discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of strong interaction.
*  Quick mention of our sponsors, the Information, NetSuite, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Aidsleep.
*  Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
*  As a side note, let me say a word about asymptotic freedom. Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus
*  of an atom. Strong interaction is responsible for the strong nuclear force that binds them.
*  But strong interaction also holds together the quarks that make up the protons and neutrons.
*  Frank Wilczek, David Gross, and David Pulitzer came up with a theory postulating that when quarks
*  come really close to one another, the attraction abates and they behave like free particles.
*  This is called asymptotic freedom. This happens at very, very high energies,
*  which is also where all the fun is. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
*  and here is my conversation with Frank Wilczek. What is the most beautiful idea in physics?
*  The most beautiful idea in physics is that we can get a compact description of the world that's
*  very precise and very full at the level of the operating system of the world.
*  That's an extraordinary gift, and we get worried when we find discrepancies between
*  our description of the world and what's actually observed at the level even of a part in a billion.
*  You actually have this quote from Einstein that the most incomprehensible thing about the universe
*  is that it is comprehensible, something like that.
*  Yes. That's the most beautiful surprise that I think that really was, to me, the most profound
*  result of the scientific revolution of the 17th century with the shining example of Newtonian
*  physics that you could aspire to completeness, precision, and a concise description of the world
*  of the operating system. It's gotten better and better over the years, and that's the continuing
*  miracle. There are a lot of beautiful sub-miracles too. The form of the equations is governed by
*  high degrees of symmetry, and they have a very surprising mind-expanding structure, especially
*  in quantum mechanics. But if I had to say, the single most beautiful revelation is that, in fact,
*  the world is comprehensible. Would you say that's a fact or a hope?
*  It's a fact. You can point to things like the rise of
*  gross national products per capita around the world as a result of the scientific revolution.
*  You can see it all around you in recent developments with exponential production of wealth,
*  control of nature at a very profound level where we do things like sense tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny
*  vibrations to tell that there are black holes colliding far away, or we test laws, as I alluded
*  to, as a part in a billion, and do things in what appear on the surface to be entirely different
*  conceptual universes. I mean, on the one hand, pencil and paper are nowadays computers that
*  calculate abstractions, and on the other hand, magnets and accelerators and detectors that look
*  at the behavior of fundamental particles, and these different universes have to agree,
*  or else we get very upset. And that's an amazing thing if you think about it.
*  It's telling us that we do understand a lot about nature at a very profound level.
*  There are still things we don't understand, of course, but as we get better and better answers
*  and better and better ability to address difficult questions, we can ask more and more ambitious
*  questions. Well, I guess the hope part of that is because we are surrounded by mystery. So we've,
*  one way to say it, if you look at the growth of GDP over time, that we figured out quite a lot and
*  weren't able to improve the quality of life because of that, and we've figured out some fundamental
*  things about this universe, but we still don't know how much mystery there is. And it's also
*  possible that there's some things that are in fact incomprehensible to both our minds and the
*  tools of science. The sad thing is we may not know it because in fact they are incomprehensible.
*  And that's the open question is how much of the universe is comprehensible. If we figured out
*  everything what's inside the black hole and everything that happened at the moment of the
*  big bang, does that still give us the key to understanding the human mind and the emergence
*  of all the beautiful complexity we see around us? That's not like when I see these objects,
*  like I don't know if you've seen them, like cellular automata, all these kinds of objects
*  where the from simple rules emerges complexity. It makes you wonder maybe it's not reducible to
*  simple beautiful equations, the whole thing, only parts of it. That's the tension I was getting at
*  with the hope. Well, when we say the universe is comprehensible, we have to kind of draw careful
*  distinctions about or definitions about what we mean by that. Both the universe and the
*  comprehensive. Exactly. So in certain areas of understanding reality, we've made extraordinary
*  progress, I would say, in understanding fundamental physical processes and getting
*  very precise equations that really work and allow us to do profound sculpting of matter,
*  to make computers and iPhones and everything else, and they really work and they're
*  extraordinary productions. That's all based on the laws of quantum mechanics and they really work
*  and they give us tremendous control of nature. On the other hand, as we get better answers,
*  we can also ask more ambitious questions and there are certainly things that have been observed
*  even in what would be usually called the realm of physics that aren't understood. For instance,
*  there seems to be another source of mass in the universe, the so-called dark matter
*  that we don't know what it is and it's a very interesting question what it is.
*  But also, as you were alluding to, it's one thing to know the basic equations, it's another thing
*  to be able to solve them in important cases. So we run up against the limits of that in things
*  like chemistry where we'd like to be able to design molecules and predict their behavior
*  from the equations. We think the equations could do that in principle, but in practice,
*  it's very challenging to solve them in all but very simple cases.
*  And then there's the other thing, which is that a lot of what we're interested in is historically
*  conditioned. It's not a matter of the fundamental equations, but about what has evolved or come out
*  of the early universe and formed into people and frogs and societies and things. And the basic
*  laws of physics only take you so far in that it provides a foundation, but you need entirely
*  different concepts to deal with those kind of systems. One thing I can say about that is that
*  the laws themselves point out their limitations, their laws for dynamical evolution. So they tell
*  you what happens if you have a certain starting point, but they don't tell you what the starting
*  point should be, at least. And the other thing that emerges from the equations themselves
*  is the phenomena of chaos and sensitivity to initial conditions, which tells us that
*  you have that there are intrinsic limitations on how well we can spell out the consequences of the
*  laws if we try to apply them. It's the old apple pie. If you want to, what is it, make an apple pie
*  from scratch, you have to build the universe or something like that.
*  Well, you're much better off starting with apples than starting with quarks. Let's put it that way.
*  In your book, A Beautiful Question, you ask, does the world embody beautiful ideas?
*  The book is centered around this very interesting question. It's like Shakespeare. You can dig in
*  and read into all the different interpretations of this question. But at the high level,
*  what to use the connection between beauty of the world and physics of the world?
*  In a sense, we now have a lot of insight into what the laws are, the form they take that
*  allow us to understand matter in great depth and control it, as we've discussed.
*  It's an extraordinary thing how mathematically ideal those equations turn out to be.
*  In the early days of Greek philosophy, Plato had this model of atoms built out of the five perfectly
*  symmetrical batonic solids. There was somehow the idea that mathematical symmetry should
*  govern the world. We've out-Plato'd Plato by far in modern physics because we have symmetries that
*  are much more extensive, much more powerful that turn out to be the ingredients out of which we
*  construct our theory of the world, and it works. That's certainly beautiful. The idea of symmetry,
*  which is a driving inspiration in much of human art, especially decorative art like the alhambra
*  or wallpaper designs or things you see around you everywhere, also turns out to be the dominant
*  theme in modern fundamental physics, symmetry and its manifestations. The laws turn out to
*  have these tremendous amounts of symmetry. You can change the symbols and move them around in
*  different ways, and they still have the same consequences. That's beautiful.
*  It's beautiful.
*  These concepts that humans find appealing also turn out to be the concepts that govern how the
*  world actually works. I don't think that's an accident. I think humans were evolved to
*  be able to interact with the world in ways that are advantageous and to learn from it.
*  We are naturally evolved or designed to enjoy beauty and symmetry, and the world has it.
*  That's why we resonate with it.
*  Well, it's interesting that the ideas of symmetry emerge at many levels of the hierarchy
*  of the universe. You're talking about particles, but it also is at the level of chemistry and
*  biology. The fact that our cognitive perception system and whatever our cognition is also finds
*  it appealing. Somehow, our sense of what is beautiful is grounded in this idea of symmetry
*  or the breaking of symmetry. Symmetry is at the core of our conception of beauty,
*  whether it's the breaking or the non-breaking of the symmetry. It makes you wonder why.
*  I come from Russia, and the question of Dostoyevsky, he has said that beauty will
*  save the world. Maybe as a physicist, you can tell me what do you think he meant by that?
*  I don't know if it saves the world, but it does turn out to be a tremendous source of insight into
*  the world when we investigate the most fundamental interactions, things that are hard to access
*  because they occur at very short distances between very special kinds of particles whose
*  properties are only revealed at high energies. We don't have much to go on from everyday life,
*  and the experiments are difficult to do, so you can't really follow a wholly empirical procedure
*  in the Baconian style, figure out the laws step by step just by accumulating a lot of data.
*  What we actually do is guess, and the guesses are kind of aesthetic, really. What would be a
*  nice description that's consistent with what we know, and then you try it out and see if it works.
*  By gosh, it does in many profound cases. There's that, but there's another source of symmetry,
*  which I didn't talk so much about in a beautiful question, but does relate to your comments,
*  and I think very much relates to the source of symmetry that we find in biology and
*  in our heads, in our brain, which is that, although it is discussed a bit in a beautiful
*  question and also in fundamentals, is that when you have, symmetry is also a very important
*  means of construction. When you have, for instance, simple viruses that need to construct their coat,
*  their protein coat, the coats often take the form of platonic solids, and the reason is that the
*  viruses are really dumb, and they only know how to do one thing, so they make a pentagon,
*  then they make another pentagon, and they make another pentagon, and they all glue together in
*  the same way, and that makes a very symmetrical object. So the rules of development, when you have
*  simple rules and they work again and again, you get symmetrical patterns. In fact, it's a recipe
*  also for generating fractals, like the kind of broccoli that has all this internal structure,
*  I wish I had a picture to show, but maybe people remember it from the supermarket,
*  and you say, how did a vegetable get so intelligent to make such a beautiful object with all this
*  fractal structure, and the secret is stupidity. You just do the same thing over and over again,
*  and in our brains also, we came out, we start from single cells, and we're all
*  from single cells, and they reproduce, and each one does basically roughly the same thing.
*  The program evolves in time, of course, different modules get turned on and off,
*  different regions of the genetic code get turned on and off, but basically a lot of the same things
*  are going on, and they're simple things, and so you produce the same patterns over and over again,
*  and that's a recipe for producing symmetry, because you're getting the same thing in many,
*  many places. If you look at, for instance, the beautiful drawings of Ramon Icahal, the great
*  neuroanatomist who drew the structure of different organs like the hippocampus,
*  you see it's very regular and very intricate, and it's symmetry in that sense, because it's
*  many repeated units that you can take from one place to the other and see that they look more
*  or less the same. But what you're describing, this kind of beauty that we're talking about now,
*  is a very small sample in terms of space-time in a very big world, in a very short, brief
*  moment in this long history. In your book, Fundamentals, 10 Keys to Reality,
*  I'd really recommend people read it. You say that space and time are pretty big, or very big.
*  How big are we talking about? Can you tell a brief history of space and time?
*  It's easy to tell a brief history, but the details get very involved, of course. But one thing I'd
*  like to say is that if you take a broad enough view, the history of the universe is simpler
*  than the history of Sweden, say, because your standards are lower. But just to make it
*  a quantitative, I'll just give a few highlights. It's a little bit easier to talk about time,
*  so let's start with that. The Big Bang occurred, we think. The universe was much hotter and denser
*  and more uniform about 13.8 billion years ago, and that's what we call the Big Bang.
*  It's been expanding and cooling. The matter in it has been expanding and cooling ever since.
*  In a real sense, the universe is 13.8 billion years old. That's a big number, kind of hard
*  to think about. A nice way to think about it, though, is to map it onto one year. So let's say
*  the universe just linearly mapped the time intervals from 13.8 billion years on to one year.
*  The Big Bang then is on January 1st at 12 a.m. You wait for quite a long time
*  before the dinosaurs emerge. The dinosaurs emerge on Christmas, it turns out.
*  Four months, almost four months later. Getting close to the end, yes.
*  Getting close to the end.
*  And the extinction event that let the mammals and ultimately humans inherit the Earth from
*  the dinosaurs occurred on December 30th. All of human history is a small part of the last day.
*  We're occupying only a human lifetime is a very, very infinitesimal part of this
*  interval of these gigantic cosmic reaches of time. In space, we can tell a very similar story. In
*  fact, it's convenient to think that the size of the universe is the distance that light can travel
*  in 13.8 billion light years. That's how far you can see out. That's how far things can
*  signals can reach us from. That is a big distance because compared to that,
*  the Earth is a fraction of a light second. Again, it's really, really big.
*  So if we want to think about the universe as a whole in space and time, we really need
*  a different kind of imagination. It's not something you can
*  grasp in terms of psychological time in a useful way. You have to use exponential notation and
*  abstract concepts to really get any hold on these vast times and spaces.
*  On the other hand, let me hasten to add that that doesn't make us small
*  or make the time that we have to us small because again, looking at those pictures of what
*  our minds are and some of the components of our minds, these beautiful drawings of the cellular
*  patterns inside the brain, you see that there are many, many, many processing units. If you analyze
*  how fast they operate, I tried to estimate how many thoughts a person can have in a lifetime.
*  That's kind of a fuzzy question, but I'm very proud that I was able to define it pretty precisely.
*  It turns out we have time for billions of meaningful thoughts in a lifetime.
*  It's a lot. We shouldn't think of ourselves as terribly small either in space or in time
*  because although we're small in those dimensions compared to the universe, we're large compared to
*  meaningful units of processing information and being able to conceptualize and understand things.
*  Yeah, but 99% of those thoughts are probably food, sex, or internet-related.
*  Well, they're not. That's right.
*  Only like 0.1 is Nobel Prize-winning ideas.
*  But that's true. But there's more to life than winning Nobel Prize.
*  How did you do that calculation? Can you maybe break that apart a little bit just for fun,
*  sort of an intuition of how we calculate the number of thoughts?
*  The number of thoughts, right. It's necessarily imprecise because a lot of things are going on
*  in different ways. What is a thought? But there are several things that point to more or less the same
*  rate of being able to have meaningful thoughts.
*  For instance, the one that I think is maybe the most penetrating is how fast we can process
*  visual images. How do we do that? If you've ever watched old movies, you can see that when,
*  well, any movie, in fact, a motion picture is really not a motion picture. It's a series of
*  snapshots that are playing one after the other. Because our brains also work that way, we take
*  snapshots of the world, integrate over a certain time, and then go on to the next one. Then by
*  post-processing, create the illusion of continuity and flow, we can deal with that. If the flicker
*  rate is too slow, then you start to see that it's a series of snapshots. You can ask,
*  what is the crossover? When does it change from being something that is matched to our
*  processing speed versus too fast? It turns out about 40 per second. Then if you take 40 per second
*  as how fast we can process visual images, you get to several billions of thoughts.
*  If you similarly ask, what are some of the fastest things that people can do? Well,
*  you can play video games, they can play the piano very fast if they're skilled at it.
*  Again, you get to similar units. How fast can people talk? Within a couple of orders of magnitude,
*  you get more or less to the same idea. That's how you can say that there's room for billions
*  of meaningful thoughts. I won't argue for exactly two billion versus 1.8 billion. It's not that kind
*  of question. I think any estimate that's reasonable will come out within say 100 billion and 100
*  million. It's a lot. It would be interesting to map out for an individual human being the
*  landscape of thoughts that they've traveled. If you think of thoughts as a set of trajectories,
*  what that landscape looks like. I've been recently really thinking about
*  the Richard Dawkins idea of memes and just all this ideas and the evolution of ideas inside of
*  one particular human mind and how they're then changed and evolved by interaction with other
*  human beings. It's interesting to think about. If you think the number is billions, you think
*  there's also social interaction. There's interaction in the same way you have
*  interaction with particles. There's interaction between human thoughts. Perhaps that interaction
*  in itself is fundamental to the process of thinking. Without social interaction, we would be
*  stuck walking in a circle. We need the perturbation of other humans to create change and evolution.
*  Once you bring in concepts of interactions and correlations and relations, then you have
*  what's called a combinatorial explosion that the number of possibilities expands exponentially
*  technically with the number of things you're considering. It can easily rapidly outstrip
*  these billions of thoughts that we're talking about. We definitely cannot by brute force
*  master complex situations. Think of all the possibilities in a complex situation.
*  Even something as relatively simple as chess is still something that human beings can't comprehend
*  completely. Even the best players still sometimes lose and they consistently lose to computers these
*  days. In computer science, there's a concept of NP-complete. Large classes of problems,
*  when you scale them up beyond a few individuals, become intractable. In that sense, the world is
*  inexhaustible. That makes it beautiful that we can make any laws that generalize efficiently and well
*  can compress all of that combinatorial complexity into a simple rule. That itself is beautiful.
*  It's a happy situation, I think, that we can find general principles of the operating system
*  that are comprehensible, simple, extremely powerful, and let us control things very well
*  and ask profound questions. On the other hand, that the world is going to be inexhaustible.
*  Once we start asking about relationships and how they evolve and social interactions,
*  we'll never have a theory of everything in any meaningful sense.
*  Of everything, everything. Truly everything. Can I ask you about the Big Bang? We talked about the
*  space and time are really big, but then, and we humans give a lot of meaning to the word space
*  and time in our daily lives. But then, can we talk about this moment of beginning and how we're
*  supposed to think about it? That at the moment of the Big Bang, everything was, what, infinitely
*  small, and then it just blew up? We have to be careful here because there's a common misconception
*  that the Big Bang is like the explosion of a bomb in empty space that fills up the surrounding
*  place. It is space. Yeah. As we understand it, it's the fact, or the hypothesis, but
*  well supported up to a point, that everywhere in the whole universe,
*  early in the history, matter came together into a very hot, very dense, if you run it backwards in
*  time, matter comes together into a very hot, very dense, and yet very homogeneous plasma of all the
*  different kinds of elementary particles and quarks and antiquarks and gluons and photons, electrons,
*  and anti-electrons, everything, all of that stuff. Like really hot, really, really, really hot. We're
*  talking about way, way hotter than the surface of the sun. In fact, if you take the equations as
*  they come, the prediction is that the temperature just goes to infinity, but then the equations
*  break down. The equations become infinity equals infinity, so they don't feel...
*  It's called a singularity. We don't really know. This is running the equations backwards,
*  so you can't really get a sensible idea of what happened before the Big Bang. We need different
*  equations to address the very earliest moments. Things were hotter and denser. We don't really
*  know why things started out that way. We have a lot of evidence that they did start out that way,
*  but since most of the... We don't get to visit there and do controlled experiments. Most of the
*  record is very, very processed, and we have to use very subtle techniques and powerful instruments
*  to get information that has survived. Get closer and closer to the Big Bang.
*  Get closer and closer to the beginning of things. What's revealed there is that,
*  as I said, there undoubtedly was a period when everything in the universe that we have been able
*  to look at and understand, and that's consistent with everything, was in a condition where it was
*  much, much hotter and much, much denser, but still obeying the laws of physics as we know them today.
*  Then you start with that. All the matter is in equilibrium, and then with small quantum
*  fluctuations and run it forward, and then it produces, at least in broad strokes,
*  the universe we see around us today. If you think we'll ever be able to,
*  with the tools of physics, with the way science is, with the way the human mind is, we'll ever be able
*  to get to the moment of the Big Bang in our understanding or even the moment before the Big
*  Bang. Can we understand what happened before the Big Bang?
*  Well, I'm optimistic, both that we'll be able to measure more, so observe more,
*  and that we'll be able to figure out more. There are very, very tangible prospects for
*  observing the extremely early universe, even much earlier than we can observe now,
*  through looking at gravitational waves. Gravitational waves, since they interact so weakly
*  with ordinary matter, send a minimally processed signal from the Big Bang. It's a very weak
*  signal because it's traveled a long way and diffused over long spaces, but people are
*  gearing up to try to detect gravitational waves that could have come from the early universe.
*  Yeah, LIGO's incredible engineering project. It's the most sensitive, precise devices on Earth.
*  The fact that humans can build something like that is truly awe-inspiring from an
*  engineering perspective. Right, but these gravitational
*  waves from the early universe will probably be of a much longer wavelength than LIGO is capable of
*  sensing. There's a beautiful project that's contemplated to put lasers in different
*  locations in the solar system. We really, really separated by solar system scale differences,
*  like artificial planets or moons in different places, and see the tiny motions of those
*  relative to one another as a signal of radiation for the Big Bang. We can also maybe indirectly
*  see the imprint of gravitational waves from the early universe on the photons,
*  the microwave background radiation that is our present way of seeing into the earliest universe.
*  But those photons interact much more strongly with matter. They're much more strongly processed,
*  so they don't give us directly such an unprocessed view of the very early universe.
*  If gravitational waves leave some imprint on that as they move through, we could detect that too.
*  People are, as we speak, working very hard towards that goal.
*  It's so exciting to think about a sensor the size of the solar system.
*  That would be a pinnacle artifact of human endeavor to me. It would be such an inspiring thing.
*  That just we want to know, and we go to these extraordinary lengths of making gigantic things
*  that are also very sophisticated because what you're trying to do, you have to understand how
*  they move. You have to understand the properties of light that are being used, the interference
*  between light. You have to be able to make the light with lasers and understand the quantum
*  theory and get the timing exactly right. It's an extraordinary endeavor involving
*  all kinds of knowledge from the very small to the very large, and all in the service of
*  curiosity and built on a grand scale. It would make me proud to be a human if we did that.
*  I love that you're inspired both by the power of theory and the power of experiments.
*  Both, I think, are exceptionally impressive that the human mind can come up with theories
*  that give us a peek into how the universe works, but also construct tools that are way bigger than
*  the evolutionary origins we came from.
*  By the way, the fact that we can design such things and they work
*  is an extraordinary demonstration that we really do understand a lot.
*  It's our ability to answer questions that also leads us to be able to address
*  more ambitious questions. You mentioned that at the Big Bang in the early days,
*  things are pretty homogeneous. Yes.
*  But here we are sitting on earth, two hairless apes, you could say, with microphones.
*  In talking about the brief history of things, you said it's much harder to describe Sweden than it is
*  the universe. There's a lot of complexity. There's a lot of interesting details here.
*  How does this complexity come to be, do you think? It seems like there's these pockets.
*  We don't know how rare of like, were hairless apes just a merge?
*  And then that came from the initial soup that was homogeneous.
*  Is that an accident?
*  Well, we understand in broad outlines how it could happen. We certainly don't understand
*  why it happened exactly in the way it did. There are certainly open questions about the
*  origins of life and how inevitable the emergence of intelligence was and how that happened.
*  But in the very broadest terms, the universe early on was quite homogeneous, but not completely
*  homogeneous. There were part in 10,000 fluctuations in density within this primordial plasma.
*  As time goes on, there's an instability which causes those density contrasts to increase.
*  There's a gravitational instability where it's denser, the gravitational attractions are stronger,
*  and so that brings in more matter and it gets even denser and so on and so on.
*  There's a natural tendency of matter to clump because of gravitational interactions.
*  Then the equation is complicated. We have lots of things clumping together.
*  Then we know what the laws are, but we have to, to a certain extent,
*  wave our hands about what happens. But basic understanding of chemistry says that if things
*  and the physics of radiation tells us that as things start to clump together, they can radiate,
*  give off some energy so they don't just slow down. As a result, they lose energy. They can
*  clomber it together, cool down, form things like stars, form things like planets.
*  And so in broad terms, there's no mystery. That's what the scenario, that's what the equations tell
*  you should happen. But because it's a process involving many, many individual units,
*  the application of the laws that govern individual units to these things is very delicate.
*  Computationally very difficult. And more profoundly, the equations have this probability
*  of chaos or sensitivity to initial conditions, which tells you tiny differences in the initial
*  state can lead to enormous differences in the subsequent behavior. So,
*  fundamental physics at some point says, okay, chemists, biologists, this is your problem.
*  And then again, in broad terms, we know how it's conceivable that humans and things like that can
*  complex structure can emerge. It's a matter of having the right kind of temperature and
*  the right kind of stuff. So you need to be able to make chemical bonds that are reasonably stable
*  and be able to make complex structures. And we're very fortunate that carbon has this ability to make
*  backbones and elaborate branchings and things. So you can get complex things that we call
*  biochemistry. And yet the bonds can be broken a little bit with the help of energetic injections
*  from the sun. So you have to have both the possibility of changing, but also the possible
*  useful degree of stability. And we know at that very, very broad level,
*  physics can tell you that it's conceivable. If you want to know what really happened,
*  what really can happen, then you have to go to chemistry. If you want to know what
*  actually happened, then you really have to consult the fossil record and biologists.
*  So these ways of addressing the issue are complementary in a sense. They
*  use different kinds of concepts, they use different languages, and they address different
*  kinds of questions, but they're not inconsistent. They're just complementary.
*  It's kind of interesting to think about those early fluctuations as our earliest ancestors.
*  Yes, that's right. So it's amazing to think that this is the modern answer to the
*  modern version of what the Hindu philosophers had, that art thou.
*  Those little quantum fluctuations in the early universe are the seeds out of which
*  complexity, including plausibly humans, really evolve. You don't need anything else.
*  That brings up the question of asking for a friend here. If there's other pockets of complexity,
*  commonly called as alien intelligent civilizations out there.
*  Well, we don't know for sure, but I have a strong suspicion that the answer is yes, because
*  the one case we do have at hand to study here on Earth, we sort of know what the conditions were
*  that were helpful to life, the right kind of temperature, the right kind of star
*  that maintains that temperature for a long time, the liquid environment of water.
*  Once those conditions emerged on Earth, which was roughly four and a half billion years ago,
*  it wasn't very long before what we call life started to leave relics. So we can find
*  the primitive forms of life that are almost as old as the Earth itself in the sense that
*  once the Earth was turned from a very hot boiling thing and cooled off into a solid mass with water,
*  life emerged very, very quickly. So it seems that these general conditions for life are enough
*  to make it happen relatively quickly. Now, the other lesson I think that one can
*  draw from this one example, it's dangerous to draw lessons from one example, but that's all we've got.
*  That the emergence of intelligent life is a different issue altogether. That took a long time
*  and seems to have been pretty contingent. For a long time, well, for most of the history of life,
*  it was single-celled things. Even multicellular life only rose about 600 million years ago,
*  100 million years ago or so much after. Then intelligence is kind of a luxury.
*  Many more kinds of creatures have big stomachs and then big brains. In fact,
*  most have no brains at all in any reasonable sense. Then the dinosaurs ruled for a long,
*  long time and some of them were pretty smart, but they were at best bird brains because birds
*  came from the dinosaurs. It could have stayed that way. Then the emergence of humans was very
*  contingent and kind of a very, very recent development on evolutionary timescales.
*  You can argue about the level of human intelligence, but I think that's what we're
*  talking about. It's very impressive and can ask these kinds of questions and discuss them
*  intelligently. This is a long-winded answer or justification of my feeling is that the
*  conditions for life in some form are probably satisfied many, many places around the universe
*  and even within our galaxy. I'm not so sure about the emergence of intelligent life
*  or the emergence of technological civilizations. That seems much more contingent and special.
*  It's conceivable to me that we're the only example in the galaxy.
*  I don't know one way or the other. I have different opinions on different days of the week.
*  One of the things that worries me in the spirit of being humble is that our particular kind of
*  intelligence is not very special. There are all kinds of different intelligences. Even more
*  broadly, there could be many different kinds of life. The basic definition. I just had
*  somebody that you know, Sarah Walker. I just had a very long conversation with her about even just
*  a very basic question of trying to define what is life from a physics perspective. Even that
*  question within itself. I think one of the most fundamental questions in science and physics and
*  everything is just trying to get some universal laws around the ideas of what is life. That
*  unlocks a bunch of things around life, intelligence, consciousness, all those kinds of things.
*  I agree with you in a sense, but I think that's a dangerous question because
*  the answer can't be any more precise than the question. The question, what is life,
*  assumes that we have a definition of life and that it's a natural phenomenon that can be
*  distinguished. But really there are edge cases like viruses and some people would like to say that
*  electrons have consciousness. If you really have fuzzy concepts, it's very hard to reach precise
*  kinds of scientific answers. But I think there's a very fruitful question that's adjacent to it,
*  which has been pursued in different forms for quite a while and is now becoming very sophisticated
*  and reaching in new directions. That is, what are the states of matter that are possible?
*  In high school or grade school, you learn about solids, liquids, and gases, but that really just
*  scratches the surface of different ways that are distinguishable that matter can form into
*  macroscopically different meaningful patterns that we call phases of matter.
*  There are precise definitions of what we mean by phases of matter
*  and that have been worked out fruitful over the decades. We were discovering new states of matter
*  all the time and having to work at what we mean by matter. We're discovering the capabilities of
*  matter to organize in interesting ways. Some of them like liquid crystals are important ingredients
*  of life. Our cell membranes are liquid crystals and that's very important to the way they work.
*  Recently, there's been a development where we're talking about states of matter that
*  are not static but that have dynamics that have characteristic patterns not only in space but in
*  time. These are called time crystals and that's been a development that's just in the last
*  decade or so. It's really flourishing. Is there a group of states of matter that corresponds to life?
*  Maybe, but the answer can't be any more definite than the question.
*  I mean, I got to push back on the question. Those are just words. I disagree with you.
*  The question points to a direction. The answer might be able to be more precise than the question
*  because just as you're saying, we could be discovering certain characteristics and
*  patterns that are associated with a certain type of matter macroscopically speaking.
*  And that we can then be able to post facto say, let's assign the word life to this kind of matter.
*  I agree with that completely. So it's not a disagreement. It's very frequent in physics
*  or in science that words that are in common use get refined and reprocessed
*  into scientific terms. That's happened for things like force and energy.
*  In a way, we find out what the useful definition is or symmetry, for instance.
*  The common usage may be quite different from the scientific usage but the scientific usage
*  is special and takes on a life of its own and we find out what the useful version of it is.
*  The fruitful version of it is. So in that spirit, I think if we can identify states of matter
*  or linked states of matter that can carry on processes of self-reproduction and development
*  and information processing, we might be tempted to classify those things as life.
*  Can I ask you about the craziest one, which is the one we know maybe least about,
*  which is consciousness? Is it possible that there are certain kinds of matter we'd be able to
*  classify as conscious? So there's the panpsychists, the philosophers who try to imply that
*  all matter has some degree of consciousness and you can almost construct a physics of consciousness.
*  Again, we're in such early days of this but nevertheless, it seems useful to talk about it.
*  Is there some sense from a physics perspective to make sense of consciousness?
*  Again, consciousness is a very imprecise word and loaded with connotations that I think we
*  don't want to start a scientific analysis with that, I don't think. It's often been
*  important in science to start with simple cases and work up consciousness. I think what most
*  people think of when you talk about consciousness is, okay, what am I doing in the world? This is my
*  experience. I have a rich inner life and experience and where is that in the equations? I think that's
*  a great question, a great, great question. Actually, I think I'm gearing up to try to
*  address that in coming years. One version of asking that question, just as you said now,
*  is what is the simplest formulation of that to study? I think I'm much more comfortable with
*  the idea of studying self-awareness as opposed to consciousness because that sort of gets rid of the
*  mystical aura of the thing. Self-awareness is in simple, I think, contiguous at least
*  with ideas about feedback. If you have a system that looks at its own state and responds to it,
*  that's a kind of self-awareness. More sophisticated versions could be like in information
*  processing things, computers that look into their own internal state and do something about it.
*  I think that could also be done in neural nets. This is called recurrent neural nets,
*  which are hard to understand and kind of a frontier. I think understanding those
*  and gradually building up a kind of profound ability to
*  conceptualize different levels of self-awareness. What do you have to not know and what do you have
*  to know? When do you know that you don't know it? When do you think you know that you don't really
*  know? When we clarify those issues and get a rich theory around self-awareness, I think
*  that will illuminate the questions about consciousness in a way that scratching your
*  chin and talking about qualia and blah, blah, blah, blah is never going to do.
*  Well, I also have a different approach to the whole thing. From a robotics perspective, you can
*  engineer things that exhibit qualities of consciousness without understanding
*  how things work. From that perspective, it's like a back door, like enter through the psychology door.
*  Precisely. I think we're on the same wavelength here. Let me just add one comment, which is
*  I think we should try to understand consciousness as we experience it
*  in evolutionary terms and ask ourselves why does it happen?
*  This thing seems useful. Why is it useful? Why is it useful?
*  I think we've got a conscious eye watch here. Interesting question. Thank you, Siri.
*  I'll get back to you later. I'm morally certain that what's going to emerge from analyzing
*  recurrent neural nets and robotic design and advanced computer design is that having this kind
*  of looking at the internal state in a structured way that doesn't look at everything, it's
*  encapsulated, looks at highly processed information, is very selective and makes
*  choices without knowing how they're made. There will also be an unconscious. I think that that
*  is going to turn out to be really essential to doing efficient information processing.
*  That's why it evolved because it's helpful because brains come at a high cost.
*  There has to be a good why.
*  There's a reason. They're rare in evolution and big brains are rare in evolution and they
*  come at a big cost. They have high metabolic demands. They require very active lifestyle,
*  warm-bloodedness and take away from the ability to support metabolism of digestion.
*  It comes at a high cost. It has to pay back.
*  I think it has a lot of value in social interaction. I'm spending the rest of the day today with
*  our friends that are our legged friends in robotic form at Boston Dynamics.
*  My probably biggest passion is human-robot interaction. It seems that consciousness from
*  the perspective of the robot is very useful to improve the human-robot interaction experience.
*  First, the display of consciousness, but then to me there's a gray area between the display
*  of consciousness and consciousness itself. If you think of consciousness from an evolutionary
*  perspective, it seems like a useful tool in human communication.
*  Yes, it's certainly, well, whatever consciousness is will turn out to be. I think addressing it
*  through its use and working up from simple cases and also working up from engineering experience
*  in trying to do efficient computation, including efficient management of social interactions,
*  is going to really shed light on these questions. As I said, in a way that
*  musing abstractly about consciousness never would.
*  As I mentioned, I talked to Sarah Walker. First of all, she says hi, spoke very highly of you.
*  One of her concerns about physics and physicists and humans is that we may not fully understand
*  the system that we're inside of. Meaning, there may be limits to the kind of physics we do
*  in trying to understand the system of which we're part of. The observer is also the observed.
*  In that sense, it seems like our tools of understanding the world, this is mostly centered
*  around the questions of what is life, trying to understand the patterns that are characteristic
*  of life and intelligence, all those kinds of things. We're not using the right tools
*  because we're in the system. Is there something that resonates with you there?
*  Yes, we have limitations, of course, in the amount of information we can process.
*  On the other hand, we can get help from our silicon friends.
*  We can get help from all kinds of instruments that make up for our perceptual deficits.
*  At a conceptual level, we can use different kinds of concepts to address different kinds of questions.
*  I'm not sure exactly what problem she's talking about.
*  It's a problem akin to an organism living in a 2D plane trying to understand a three-dimensional
*  world. Well, we can do that. In fact, for practical purposes, most of our experience
*  is two-dimensional. It's hard to move vertically, and yet we've produced conceptually a
*  three-dimensional symmetry and, in fact, four-dimensional space-time. By thinking
*  in appropriate ways and using instruments and getting consistent accounts and rich accounts,
*  we find out what concepts are necessary. I don't see any end in sight of the process or any
*  showstoppers because—let me give you an example. For instance, QCD, our theory of the strong
*  interaction, has nice equations to help to discover. What's QCD? Quantum chromodynamics.
*  It's our theory of the strong interaction, the interaction that is responsible for nuclear physics.
*  It's the interaction that governs how quarks and gluons interact with each other and make
*  protons and neutrons and all the related particles and many things in physics. It's one of the
*  four basic forces of nature as we presently understand it. We have beautiful equations,
*  which we can test in very special circumstances using at high energies, at accelerators. We're
*  certain that these equations are correct. Prizes are given for it. People try to knock it down,
*  and they can't. But the situations in which we can calculate the consequences of these equations
*  are very limited. For instance, no one has been able to demonstrate that this theory, which is
*  built on quarks and gluons, which you don't observe, actually produces protons and neutrons
*  and the things you do observe. This is called the problem of confinement. So no one's been
*  able to prove that analytically in a way that a human can understand. On the other hand,
*  we can take these equations to gigantic computers and compute, and by God, you get the world's
*  from it. So these equations, in a way that we don't understand in terms of human concepts,
*  we can't do the calculations, but our machines can do them. So with the help of what I like to
*  call our silicon friends and their descendants in the future, we can understand in a different way
*  that allows us to understand more. But I don't think no human is ever going to be able to
*  solve those equations in the same way. But I think that when we find limitations to
*  our natural abilities, we can try to find workarounds. Sometimes that's appropriate
*  concepts. Sometimes it's appropriate instruments. Sometimes it's a combination of the two.
*  But I think it's premature to get defeatist about it. I don't see any logical contradiction
*  or paradox or limitation that will bring this process to a halt.
*  Well, I think the idea is to continue thinking outside the box in different directions, meaning
*  just like how the math allows us to think in multiple dimensions outside of our perception
*  system, sort of thinking, coming up with new tools of mathematics or computation or
*  all those kinds of things to take different perspectives on our universe.
*  Well, I'm all for that. I've even elevated into a principle, which is of complementarity,
*  following Bohr, that you need different ways of thinking, even about the same things,
*  in order to do justice to their reality and answer different kinds of questions about them.
*  We've several times alluded to the fact that human beings are hard to understand.
*  And the concepts that you use to understand human beings, if you want to prescribe drugs for them
*  or see what's going to happen if they move very fast or get exposed to radiation.
*  And so that requires one kind of thinking that's very physical based on the fact that
*  the materials that were made out of. On the other hand, if you want to understand how a person's
*  going to behave in a different kind of situation, you need entirely different concepts from
*  psychology. There's nothing wrong with that. You can have very different ways of addressing
*  the same material that are useful for different purposes.
*  Can you describe this idea, which is fascinating, of complementarity a little bit? First of all,
*  what state is the principle? What is it? And second of all, what are good examples,
*  starting from quantum mechanics? You still mentioned psychology. Let's talk about this more.
*  In your new book, one of the most fascinating ideas, actually.
*  I think it's a wonderful, yeah, it's sort of to me, it's, well, it's the culminating chapter
*  of the book. And I think since the whole book is about the big lessons or big takeaways from
*  profound understanding of the physical world that we've achieved, including that it's mysterious in
*  some ways, this was the final overarching lesson, complementarity. And it's an
*  approach. So unlike some of these other things, which are just facts about the world,
*  like the world is both big and small and different, and is big, but we're not small,
*  things we talked about earlier, and the fact that the universe is comprehensible and how
*  complexity could emerge from simplicity. And those things are in the broad sense,
*  facts about the world. Complementarity is more an attitude towards the world,
*  encouraged by the facts about the world. And it's the idea, the concept that they approach
*  that or the realization that it can be appropriate and useful and inevitable and unavoidable
*  to use very different descriptions of the same object or the same system or the same situation
*  to answer different kinds of questions that may be very different and even
*  in mutually uninterpretable, in mutually incomprehensible.
*  RL But both correct somehow.
*  CB But both correct and sources of different kinds of insight.
*  RL Which is so weird.
*  CB Yeah. Well-
*  RL But it seems to work in so many cases.
*  CB It works in many cases, and I think it's a deep fact about the world and how we should approach
*  it. Its most rigorous form, where it's actually a theorem, if quantum mechanics is correct,
*  occurs in quantum mechanics, where the primary description of the world is in terms of wave
*  functions. But let's not talk about the world, let's talk about a particle, an electron.
*  It's the primary description of that electron is its wave function. And the wave function can be
*  used to predict where it's going to be, if you observe, it'll be in different places with
*  different probabilities, or how fast it's moving. And it'll also be moving in different ways with
*  different probabilities, that's what quantum mechanics says. And you can predict either set
*  of probabilities, what's going to happen if I make an observation of the position or the velocity.
*  But, so the wave function gives you ways of doing both of those. But to do it, to get those
*  predictions, you have to process the wave function in different ways. You process it one way for
*  position and in a different way for momentum. And those ways are mathematically incompatible.
*  It's like, you know, it's like you have a stone and you can sculpt it into Venus de Milo, or you
*  can sculpt it into David, but you can't do both. And that's an example of complementarity. But
*  to answer different kinds of questions, you have to analyze the system in different ways
*  that are mutually incompatible, but both valid to answer different kinds of questions.
*  So in that case, it's a theorem. But I think it's a much more widespread phenomena that applies to
*  many cases where we can't prove it as a theorem. But it's a piece of wisdom, if you like, and
*  appears to be a very important insight. Do you? And if you ignore it, you can get very
*  confused and misguided. Do you think this is a useful hack
*  for ideas that we don't fully understand? Or is this somehow a fundamental property of
*  all or many ideas that you can take multiple perspectives and they're both true? Well,
*  I think it's both. So it's both the answer to all questions.
*  Yes, that's right. It's not either or. It's both.
*  It's paralyzing to think that we live in a world that's fundamentally surrounded by complementary
*  ideas. Because we somehow want to attach ourselves to absolute truths, and absolute truths certainly
*  don't like the idea of complementarity. Yes, Einstein was very uncomfortable with
*  complementarity. And in a broad sense, the famous Bohr-Einstein debates
*  revolved around this question of whether the complementarity that is a foundational feature
*  of quantum mechanics as we have it is a permanent feature of the universe and our description of
*  nature. And so far, quantum mechanics wins. And it's gone from triumph to triumph. Whether
*  complementarity is rock bottom, I guess you can never be sure. But it looks awfully good,
*  and it's been very successful. And certainly its complementarity has been extremely useful
*  and fruitful in that domain, including some of Einstein's attempts to challenge it
*  with the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment turned out to be confirmations
*  of that have been useful in themselves. So thinking about these things was fruitful,
*  but not in the way that Einstein hoped. So as I said, in the case of quantum mechanics and this
*  dilemma or dichotomy between processing the wave function in different ways, it's a theorem.
*  They're mutually incompatible, and the physical correlate of that is the Heisenberg uncertainty
*  principle. You can't have position and momentum determined at once. But in other cases, like
*  one that I like to point out as an example is free will and determinism. It's much less
*  of a theorem and more a way of thinking about things that I think is
*  is reassuring and avoids a lot of unnecessary quarreling and confusion.
*  The quarreling I'm okay with and the confusion I'm okay with. I mean, people debate about
*  difficult ideas. But the question is whether it could be almost a fundamental truth.
*  I think it is a fundamental truth.
*  Free will is both an illusion and not.
*  Yes, I think that's correct.
*  And I loaded the reason why people say quantum mechanics is weird and complementarities
*  is a big part of that. To say that our actual whole world is weird, the whole hierarchy of
*  the universe is weird in this kind of particular way. And it's quite profound, but it's also
*  humbling. Because it's like we're never going to be on sturdy ground in the way that humans
*  like to be. It's like you have to embrace that this whole thing is a
*  like, unsteady mess.
*  Well, it's one of many lessons in humility that we run into in profound understanding of the world.
*  I mean, the Copernican Revolution was one, that the Earth is not the center of the universe.
*  Darwinian evolution is another, that humans are not the pinnacle of God's creation.
*  And the apparent result of deep understanding of physical reality, that
*  mind emerges from matter and there's no call on special life forces or souls.
*  These are all lessons in humility. And I actually find complementarity a liberating concept.
*  There's a story about Dr. Johnson and he's talking with Boswell and Boswell,
*  Boswell was, they were discussing a sermon that they both heard and the sort of culmination of
*  the sermon was the speaker saying, I accept the universe. And Dr. Johnson said, well,
*  he damn well better. And there's a certain joy in accepting the universe because it's mind expanding.
*  To me, complementarity also suggests tolerance, suggests opportunities for understanding
*  things in different ways that add to rather than detract from understanding. So I think
*  it's an opportunity for mind expansion and demanding that there's only one way that
*  to think about things can be very limiting. And the free will one, that's a trippy one though.
*  To think like I am the decider of my own actions and at the same time I'm not is
*  tricky to think about, but it's, there does seem to be some kind of profound truth in that.
*  Well, I think it is tied up. It will turn out to be tied up when we understand things better
*  with these issues of self-awareness and where we get what we perceive as making choices,
*  what does that really mean and what's going on under the hood. But I'm speculating about
*  a future understanding that's not in place at present. Your sense there will always be,
*  like as you dig into the self-awareness thing, there'll always be some places where complementarity
*  is going to show up. Oh, definitely. Yeah. I mean, there will be, how should I say,
*  there'll be kind of a God's eye view, which sees everything that's going on in the computer or the
*  brain. And then there's the brain's own view or the central processor or whatever it is,
*  that's what we call the self, the consciousness, that's only aware of a very small part of it.
*  And those are very different. So the God's eye view can be deterministic while the self view
*  sees free will. I'm pretty sure that's how it's going to work out actually. But as it stands,
*  free will is a concept that we definitely, at least I feel I definitely experience. I can choose
*  to do one thing than another. And other people I think are sufficiently similar to me that I
*  trust that they feel the same way. And it's an essential concept in psychology and law and so
*  forth. But at the same time, I think that mind emerges from matter. And that there's an alternative
*  description of matter that's up to subtleties about quantum mechanics, which I don't think
*  are relevant here, really is deterministic. Let me ask you about some particles.
*  Okay. First, the absurd question, almost like a question that like Plato would ask,
*  what is the smallest thing in the universe?
*  As far as we know, the fundamental particles out of which we build our most successful description
*  of nature are points. They have zero, they have, don't have any internal structure. That's they,
*  so that's as small as can be to. So what does that mean operationally? That means if you,
*  that they obey equations that describe entities that are singular concentrations of energy,
*  momentum, angular momentum, the things that particles have, but localized at individual
*  points. Now, that mathematical structure is only revealed partially in the world because to
*  process the wave function in a way that accesses information about the precise position of things,
*  you have to apply a lot of energy. And that's not, you know, that's an idealization that you
*  can apply infinite amount of energy to determine a precise position. But at the mathematical level,
*  we build the world out of particles that are points. So do they actually exist? And what
*  are we talking about? So like, so let me ask sort of, do quarks exist? Yes. Do electrons exist? Yes.
*  Do photons exist? Yes. But what does it mean for them to exist? Okay. So well, the hard answer to
*  that, the precise answer is that we construct the world out of equations that contain entities that
*  are reproducible, that exist in vast numbers throughout the universe, that have definite
*  properties of mass, spin, and a few others that we call electrons. And what an electron is, is
*  defined by the equations that it satisfies theoretically. And we find that there are many,
*  many exemplars of that entity in the physical world. So in the case of electrons, we can,
*  you know, isolate them and study them in individual ones in great detail, and we can check that they
*  all actually are identical. And that's why chemistry works. And yes, so that in that case,
*  so that in that case, it's very tangible. Similarly with photons, you can study them
*  individually, the units of light. And nowadays, it's very practical to study individual photons
*  and determine their spin and their other basic properties and check out the equations in great
*  detail. For quarks and gluons, which are the other two main ingredients of our model of matter
*  that's so successful, it's a little more complicated because the quarks and gluons
*  that appear in our equations don't appear directly as particles you can isolate
*  and study individually. They always occur within
*  bound, what are called bound states or structures like protons. A proton, roughly speaking,
*  is composed of three quarks and a lot of gluons, but we can detect them in a remarkably direct
*  way actually nowadays. Whereas at relatively low energies, the behavior of quarks is complicated.
*  At high energies, they can propagate through space relatively freely for a while and we can
*  see their tracks. So ultimately, they get recaptured into protons and other
*  mesons and funny things. But for a short time, they propagate freely. And while that happens,
*  we can take snapshots and see their manifestations. This is actually this
*  kind of thing is exactly what I got the Nobel Prize for predicting that this would work.
*  And similarly for gluons, although you can't isolate them as individual particles and study
*  them in the same way we study electrons, say, you can use them theoretically as entities out
*  of which you build tangible things that we actually do observe. But also you can,
*  at accelerators at high energy, you can liberate them for brief periods of time and study
*  and get convincing evidence that they leave tracks and you can get convincing evidence
*  that they were there and have the properties that we wanted them to have.
*  Can we talk about asymptotic freedom, this very idea that you won the Nobel Prize for?
*  So it describes a very weird effect to me, weird in the following way. So
*  the way I think of most forces or interactions, the closer you are, the stronger the effect,
*  the stronger the force. With quarks, the closer they are, the less the strong interaction.
*  And in fact, they basically act like free particles when they're very close.
*  That's right.
*  But this requires a huge amount of energy. Can you describe me
*  how does this even work? How weird it is?
*  A proper description must bring in quantum mechanics and relativity. So a proper description
*  and equations, so a proper description really is probably more than we have time for and
*  we require quite a bit of patience on your part.
*  How does relativity come into play?
*  Oh, relativity is important because when we talk about
*  trying to think about short distances, we have to think about very large momenta and very large
*  momenta are connected to very large energy in relativity. And so the connection between
*  how things behave at short distances and how things behave at high energy really is connected
*  through relativity in sort of a slightly backhanded way. Quantum mechanics indicates that
*  to analyze short distances, you need to bring in probes that carry a lot of momentum.
*  This again is related to uncertainty because it's the fact that you have to bring in a lot of
*  momentum that interferes with the possibility of determining position and momentum at the same time.
*  If you want to determine position, you have to use instruments that bring in a lot of momentum.
*  And because of that, those same instruments can't also measure momentum because they're
*  disturbing the momentum. And then the momentum brings in energy.
*  So there's also the effect that asymptotic freedom comes from the possibility of spontaneously making
*  quarks and gluons for short amounts of time that fluctuate into existence and out of existence.
*  And the fact that that can be done with a very little amount of energy and
*  uncertainty and energy translates into uncertainty and time. So if you do that
*  for a short time, you can do that. Well, it all comes in a package. So I told you it would take
*  a while to really explain. But the... But the fact that you can do that for a short time,
*  the... But the results can be understood. I mean, we can state the results pretty simply, I think.
*  So in everyday life, we do encounter some forces that increase with distance and kind of turn off
*  at short distances. That's the way rubber bands work, if you think about it. If you pull them
*  hard, they resist, but they get flabby if the rubber band is not pulled. And so there are...
*  That can happen in the physical world. But what's really difficult is to see how that could be a
*  fundamental force that's consistent with everything else we know. And that's what asymptotic freedom is.
*  It says that there's a very particular kind of fundamental force that involves
*  special particles called gluons with very special properties that enables that kind of behavior. So
*  at the time we did our work, there were experimental indications that quarks and gluons
*  did have this kind of property, but there were no equations that were capable of capturing it.
*  And we found the equations and showed how they work and showed how they... That they were basically
*  unique. And this led to a complete theory of how the strong interaction works, which is
*  the quantum chromodynamics we mentioned earlier. And so that's the phenomenon that quarks
*  and gluons interact very, very weakly when they're close together. That's connected through
*  relativity with the fact that they also interact very, very weakly at high energies. So at high
*  energies, the simplicity of the fundamental interaction gets revealed. At the time we did
*  our work, the clues were very subtle. But nowadays, at what are now high energy accelerators, it's all
*  obvious. So we would have had a much... Well, somebody would have had a much easier time.
*  20 years later, looking at the data, you can sort of see the quarks and gluons. As I mentioned,
*  they leave these short tracks that would have been much, much easier. But from indirect clues,
*  we were able to piece together enough to make that behavior a prediction rather than a post-diction.
*  Right. So it becomes obvious at high energies.
*  It becomes very obvious. When we first did this work, it was frontiers of high energy physics. And
*  at big international conferences, there would always be sessions on testing QCD and whether
*  these... Whether this proposed description of the strong interaction was in fact correct and so forth.
*  And it was very exciting. But nowadays, the same kind of work, but much more precise with
*  calculations to more accuracy and experiments that are much more precise
*  and comparisons that are very precise. Now it's called calculating backgrounds because
*  people take this for granted and want to see deviations from the theory, which would be
*  the new discoveries. Yeah, the cutting edge becomes the foundation,
*  the foundation becomes boring. Yes. Is there some, for basic explanation purposes, is there
*  something to be said about strong interactions in the context of the strong nuclear force for the
*  attraction between protons and neutrons versus the interaction between quarks within protons?
*  Well, quarks and gluons have the same relation basically to nuclear physics as electrons and
*  photons have to atomic and molecular physics. So atoms and photons are the dynamic entities that
*  really come into play in chemistry and atomic physics. Of course, you have to have the atomic
*  nuclei, but those are small and relatively inert, really the dynamical part. And for
*  most purposes of chemistry, you just say you have this tiny little nucleus, which QCD gives you.
*  Don't worry about it. It's there. The real action is the electrons moving around and exchanging and
*  things like that. But we wanted to understand the nucleus too. And so atoms are sort of
*  quantum mechanical clouds of electrons held together by electrical forces, which is photons,
*  and then this radiation, which is another aspect of photons. That's where all the fun happens is
*  the electrons and the photons and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, that's right. And the nucleus are
*  kind of the... Well, they give the positive charge and most of the mass of matter, but they don't,
*  since they're so heavy, they don't move very much in chemistry. And I'm oversimplifying drastically.
*  They're not contributing much to the interaction in chemistry.
*  For most purposes in chemistry, you can just idealize them as concentrations of positive
*  mass and charge that are... You don't have to look inside, but people are curious what's inside.
*  And that was a big thing on the agenda of 20th century physics starting in the 19... Well,
*  starting with the 20th century and unfolding throughout of trying to understand what forces
*  held the atomic nucleus together, what it was and so on. Anyway, the story that emerges from QCD
*  is that very similar to the way that... Well, broadly similar to the way that
*  clouds of electrons held together by electrical forces give you atoms and ultimately molecules.
*  Protons and neutrons are like atoms made now out of quark clouds held together by gluons,
*  which are like the photons that give the electric forces, but this is giving a different force,
*  the strong force. And the residual forces between protons and neutrons that
*  are left over from the basic binding are like the residual forces between atoms that give
*  molecules, but in the case of protons and neutrons, it gives you atomic nuclei.
*  So again, for definitional purposes, QCD, quantum chromodynamics,
*  is basically the physics of strong interaction.
*  Yeah, we now would understand... I think most physicists would say it's the theory of
*  quarks and gluons and how they interact, but it's a very precise and I think it's fair to say,
*  very beautiful theory based on mathematical symmetry of a high order. And another thing
*  that's beautiful about it is that it's kind of in the same family as electrodynamics,
*  the conceptual structure of the equations are very similar. They're based on having particles
*  that respond to charge in a very symmetric way. In the case of electrodynamics, it's photons that
*  respond to electric charge. In the case of quantum chromodynamics, there are three kinds of charge
*  that we call colors, but they're nothing like colors. They really are like different kinds of charge.
*  They rhyme with the same kind of... It's similar kind of dynamics.
*  Similar kind of dynamics. I like to say that QCD is like QED on steroids. Instead of one photon,
*  you have eight gluons. Instead of one charge, you have three color charges. But there's a strong
*  family resemblance between them. But the context in which QCD does this thing is it's much higher
*  energies. That's where it comes to life. Well, it's a stronger force so that to
*  access how it works and kind of pry things apart, you have to inject more energy.
*  That gives us, in some sense, a hint of how things were in the earlier universe.
*  Yeah. Well, in that regard, asymptotic freedom is a tremendous blessing because
*  it means things get simpler at high energy. The universe was born free.
*  Born free. That's very good. Yes. The universe was born... So in atomic physics, a similar
*  thing happens in the theory of stars. Stars are hot enough that the interactions between
*  electrons and photons are... They're liberated. They don't form atoms anymore. They make a plasma.
*  Which in some ways is simpler to understand. You don't have complicated chemistry.
*  And in the early universe, according to QCD, similarly atomic nuclei dissolved into the
*  constituent quarks and gluons, which are moving around very fast and interacting in relatively
*  simple ways. And so this opened up the early universe to scientific calculation.
*  Can I ask you about some other things that you've done in the past?
*  What are axions? And what is the strong CP problem?
*  Okay. So let me start with what the strong CP problem is. First of all,
*  C is charge conjugation, which is the
*  the notional transformation, if you like. The change in the charge conjugation.
*  The transformation, the notional transformation, if you like, that changes all particles into
*  their antiparticles. And the concept of C symmetry, charge conjugation symmetry,
*  is that if you do that, you find the same laws would work. So the laws are symmetric. If
*  the behavior that particles exhibit is the same as the behavior you get with all their antiparticles,
*  then P is parity, which is also called spatial inversion. It's basically looking at a mirror
*  universe and saying that the laws that are obeyed in a mirror universe, when you look at it,
*  when you look at the mirror images obey the same laws as the sources of their images. There's no
*  way of telling left from right, for instance, that the laws don't distinguish between left and right.
*  Now, in the mid 20th century, people discovered that both of those are not quite true.
*  That really the equation that the mirror universe, the universe
*  that you see in a mirror is not going to obey the same laws as the universe that we actually
*  interpret. You would be able to tell if you did the right kind of experiments,
*  which was the mirror and which was the real thing.
*  That's the parity and they show that the parity doesn't necessarily hold.
*  It doesn't quite hold. Examining what the exceptions are turned out to lead to low
*  kinds of insight about the nature of fundamental interactions, especially properties of neutrinos
*  and the weak interactions. It's a long story. So you just define the C and the P, the conjugation
*  charge conjugation. Now that I've done that, I want to shove them off.
*  Because it's easier to talk about T, which is time reversal symmetry. We have very good reasons to
*  think CPT is an accurate symmetry of nature. It's on the same level as relativity and quantum
*  mechanics basically. So that better be true. So it's symmetric when you do conjugation parity
*  and time. And time and space reversal. If you do all three, then you get the same
*  physical consequences. But that means that CP is equivalent to T. But what's observed in the world
*  is that T is not quite an accurate symmetry of nature either. So most phenomena at the fundamental
*  level, so interactions among elementary particles and the basic gravitational interaction.
*  If you ran them backwards in time, you'd get the same laws. So if again, going back,
*  unless this time we don't talk about a mirror, but we talk about a movie. If you take a movie
*  and then run it backwards, that's the time reversal.
*  It's good to think about a mirror in time.
*  Yeah, it's like a mirror in time. If you run the movie backwards, it would look very strange if
*  you were looking at complicated objects and a Charlie Chaplin movie or whatever. It would
*  look very strange if you ran it backwards in time. But at the level of basic interactions,
*  if you were able to look at the atoms and the quarks involved, they would obey the same laws.
*  To a very good approximation, but not exactly.
*  Not exactly. That means you could tell.
*  You could tell, but you'd have to do very, very subtle experiments with high energy accelerators
*  to take a movie that looked different when you ran it backwards. This was a discovery by
*  two great physicists named Jim Cronin and Val Fitch in the mid-1960s. Previous to that,
*  over all the centuries of development of physics with all these precise laws,
*  they did seem to have this gratuitous property that they look the same if you run the equations
*  backwards. It's kind of an embarrassing property actually, because life isn't like that. So
*  empirical reality does not have this imagery in any obvious way, and yet the laws did.
*  It's almost like the laws of physics are missing something fundamental about life,
*  if it holds that property, right? That's the embarrassing nature of it.
*  Well, people worked hard at what's this is a problem that's thought to belong to the
*  foundations of statistical mechanics or the foundations of thermodynamics to understand
*  how behavior, which is grossly not symmetric with respect to reversing the direction of time
*  in large objects, how that can emerge from equations which are symmetric with respect
*  to changing the direction of time to a very good approximation. And that's still an interesting
*  endeavor. Actually, it's an exciting frontier of physics now to sort of explore the boundary
*  between when that's true and when it's not true, when you get to smaller objects,
*  and exceptions like time crystals. I definitely have to ask about time
*  crystals in a second here. So the CP problem and T, so there's flaws to all of these.
*  We're in danger of infinite regress, but we'll convert soon.
*  It can't possibly be turtles all the way down. We're going to get to the bottom turtle.
*  So it got to be a real, I mean, it's a really puzzling thing why the laws should have this very
*  odd property that we don't need. And in fact, it's kind of an embarrassment in addressing empirical
*  reality, but it seemed to be exactly true for a long time. And it's a very interesting thing.
*  It's been true for a long time. And then almost true. And in a way, almost true is more disturbing
*  than exactly true because exactly true, it could have been just a fundamental feature of the world.
*  And at some level, you just have to take it as it is. And if it's a beautiful, easily articulatable
*  regularity, you could say that, okay, that's fine as a fundamental law of nature. But to say
*  that is approximately true, but not exactly. That's weird. So there was great progress
*  in the late part of the 20th century in getting to an understanding of fundamental interactions
*  in general that shed light on this issue. It turns out that the basic principles of relativity
*  and quantum mechanics plus the kind of high degree of symmetry that we found,
*  the so-called gauge symmetry that characterizes the fundamental interactions, when you put all
*  that together, it's a very, very constraining framework. And it has some indirect consequences
*  because the possible interactions are so constrained. And one of the indirect consequences
*  is that the possibilities for violating the symmetry between forwards and backwards in time
*  are very limited. They're basically only two. And one of them occurs and leads to a very rich
*  theory that explains the Cronin-Fisch experiment and a lot of things that have been done subsequently
*  has been used to make all kinds of successful predictions. So that's turned out to be a very
*  rich interaction. It's esoteric and the effects only show up at accelerators and are small.
*  But they might've been very important in the early universe and be connected to the asymmetry
*  between matter and anti-matter in the present universe. But that's another digression.
*  The point is that that was fine. That was a triumph to say that there was one possible
*  kind of interaction that would violate time reversal symmetry. And sure enough, there it is.
*  But the other kind doesn't occur. So we still got a problem. Why doesn't it occur?
*  So we're close to really finally understanding this profound gratuitous feature of the world
*  that is almost but not quite symmetric under reversing the direction of time, but not quite
*  there. And to understand that last bit is a challenging frontier of physics today.
*  And we have a promising proposal for how it works, which is a kind of theory of evolution.
*  So there's this possible interaction, which we call a coupling, and there's a numerical quantity
*  that tells us how strong that is. And traditionally in physics, we think of these
*  kinds of numerical quantities as constants of nature that you just have to put them in, right?
*  From experiment, they have a certain value and that's it. And who am I to question what God
*  did? They seem to be just constants. But in this case, it's been fruitful to think and work out a
*  theory where that strength of interaction is actually not a constant. It's a field.
*  It's a... Fields are the fundamental ingredients of modern physics. There's an electron field,
*  there's a photon field, which is also called the electromagnetic field. And so
*  all of these particles are manifestations of different fields. And there could be a field,
*  something that depends on space and time, so a dynamical entity instead of just a constant here.
*  And if you do things in a nice way, that's very symmetric, very much suggested
*  aesthetically by the theory, but the theory we do have, then you find that you get a field
*  which, as it evolves from the early universe, settles down to a value that's just right
*  to make the laws very nearly exact, invariant or symmetric with respect to reversal of time.
*  It might appear as a constant, but it's actually a field that evolved over time.
*  It evolved over time. But when you examine this proposal in detail, you find that it hasn't quite
*  settled down to exactly zero. The field is still moving around a little bit. And because the motion
*  is so difficult, the material is so rigid, and this material, the field that fills all space is so
*  rigid. Even small amounts of motion can involve lots of energy. And that energy takes the form
*  of particles, fields that are in motion are always associated with particles, and those are the
*  axions. And if you calculate how much energy is in these residual oscillations, this axion gas that
*  fills all the universe, if this fundamental theory is correct, you get just the right amount
*  to make the dark matter that astronomers want, and it has just the right properties. So I'd love to
*  believe that. So that might be a thing that unlocks, might be the key to understanding dark matter.
*  Yeah, I'd like to think so. And many physicists are coming around to this point of view, which
*  I've been a voice in the wilderness, I was a voice in the wilderness for a long time, but now
*  it's become very popular, maybe even dominant. So almost like, so this axion particle slash field
*  would be the thing that explains dark matter. It explains, yeah, it would solve this fundamental
*  question of finally, of why the laws are almost, but not quite exactly, the same as the laws of
*  time. And so, it's the same if you run them backwards in time, and then seemingly in a
*  totally different conceptual universe, it would also provide, give us an understanding of the
*  dark matter. That's not what it was designed for, and the theory wasn't proposed with that in mind,
*  but when you work out the equations, that's what you get.
*  Absolutely. I think I vaguely read somewhere that there may be early experimental validation
*  of axion. Is that, am I reading the wrong?
*  Well, there have been quite a few false alarms, and I think there are some of them still,
*  people desperately want to find this thing. But I don't think any of them are convincing at this
*  point, but there are very ambitious experiments, and kind of new, you have to design new kinds of
*  antennas that are capable of detecting these predicted particles, and it's very difficult,
*  they interact very, very weakly. If it were easy, it would have been done already, but
*  I think there's good hope that we can get down to the required sensitivity and actually test
*  whether these ideas are right in coming years or maybe decades.
*  And then understand one of the big mysteries, like literally big in terms of
*  its fraction of the universe is dark matter. Let me ask you about, you mentioned a few times,
*  time crystals. What are they? These things are, it's a very beautiful idea when we start to
*  treat space and time as similar frameworks, physical phenomena.
*  Right, that's what motivated it.
*  First of all, what are crystals? And what are time crystals?
*  Okay, so crystals are orderly arrangements of atoms in space, and many materials, if you
*  cool them down gently, will form crystals. And so we say that that's a state of matter that
*  forms spontaneously. And an important feature of that state of matter is that the end result,
*  the crystal, has less symmetry than the equations that give rise to the crystal.
*  So the equations, the basic equations of physics are the same if you move a little bit, so you can
*  move, they're homogeneous, but crystals aren't. The atoms are in particular places, so they have
*  less symmetry. And time crystals are the same thing in time. But of course, so it's not positions
*  of atoms, but it's orderly behavior that certain states of matter will arrange themselves into
*  spontaneously if you treat them gently and let them do what they want to do.
*  But repeat in that same way indefinitely.
*  That's the crystalline form. You can also have time liquids, or you can have all kinds of
*  other states of matter. You can also have space-time crystals where the pattern only repeats if,
*  with each step of time, you also move in a certain direction in space. So yeah,
*  but basically it's states of matter that displace structure in time spontaneously.
*  So here's the difference. When it happens in time, it sure looks a lot like its motion,
*  and if it repeats indefinitely, it sure looks a lot like perpetual motion.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, looks like free lunch. I was told that there's no such thing as free lunch.
*  Does this violate laws of thermodynamics?
*  No, but it requires a critical examination of the laws of thermodynamics. I mean, let me say on
*  background that the laws of thermodynamics are not fundamental laws of physics. There are things we
*  prove under certain circumstances emerge from the fundamental laws of physics. We don't
*  posit them separately. They're meant to be deduced, and they can be deduced under limited
*  circumstances, but not necessarily universally. And we found finding some of the subtleties and
*  sort of edge cases where they don't apply in a straightforward way. And this is one.
*  Yeah. So time crystals do have this structure in time, but it's not a free lunch, because
*  although in a sense things are moving, they're already doing what they want to do.
*  So if you want to extract energy from it, you're going to be foiled because there's no spare energy
*  there. So you can add energy to it and kind of disturb it, but you can't extract energy
*  from this motion because it wants to do that. That's the lowest energy configuration that there
*  is, so you can't get further energy out of it. So in theory, I guess perpetual motion,
*  you would be able to extract energy from it. If such a thing was to be created, you could milk
*  it for energy. Well, what's usually meant in the literature of perpetual motion is
*  a kind of macroscopic motion that you could extract energy from, and somehow it would crank
*  back up. That's not the case here. If you want to extract energy, this motion is not something
*  you can extract energy from. If you intervene in the behavior, you can change it, but only by
*  injecting energy, not by taking away energy. You mentioned that a theory of everything may be quite
*  difficult to come by. A theory of everything broadly defined, meaning like truly a theory
*  of everything. But let's look at a more narrow theory of everything, which is that what the way
*  it's used often in physics is a theory that unifies our current laws of physics,
*  general relativity, quantum field theory. Do you have thoughts on this dream of a theory
*  of everything in physics? How close are we? Is there any promising ideas out there in your view?
*  Well, it would be nice to have. It would be aesthetically pleasing.
*  Will it be useful?
*  No, probably not. Well, I shouldn't. It's dangerous to say that, but probably not. I think we're
*  certainly not in the foreseeable future. Maybe to understand black holes?
*  Yeah, but that's yes, maybe to understand black holes, but that's not useful.
*  Well, to understand, it's not useful in the sense that we're not going to be basing any technology
*  anytime soon on black holes, but it's more severe than that, I would say. It's that the kinds of
*  questions about black holes that we can't answer within the framework of existing theory
*  are ones that are not going to be susceptible to astronomical observation in the foreseeable future.
*  They're questions about very, very small black holes when quantum effects come into play,
*  or so that black holes are not black holes. They're emitting this discovery of Hawking
*  called Hawking radiation, which for astronomical black holes is a tiny, tiny effect that no one
*  has ever observed. It's a prediction that's never been checked.
*  Like supermassive black holes that doesn't apply?
*  No, no. The predicted rate of radiation from those black holes is so tiny that it's
*  absolutely unobservable and is overwhelmed by all kinds of other effects.
*  So it's not practical in the sense of technology. It's not even practical in the sense of
*  application to astronomy. Our existing theory of general relativity and quantum theory and our
*  theory of the different fundamental forces is perfectly adequate to all problems of
*  technology, for sure, and almost all problems of astrophysics and cosmology that appear,
*  except with the notable exception of the extremely early universe, if you want to ask
*  what happened before the Big Bang or what happened right at the Big Bang,
*  which would be a great thing to understand, of course. We don't.
*  But what about the engineering question? So if we look at space travel, I think you've spoken
*  with him, Eric Weinstein, really, he says things like, we want to get off this planet.
*  His intuition is almost a motivator for the engineering project of space exploration. In
*  order for us to crack this problem of becoming a multiplanetary species, we have to solve the
*  physics problem. His intuition is like, if we figure out what he calls the source code, which is like,
*  like, well, like a theory of everything might give us clues on how to start hacking the fabric of
*  reality, like getting shortcuts, right? It might. I can't say that, you know,
*  I can't say that it won't, but I can say that in the 1970s and early 1980s, we achieved
*  huge, huge steps in understanding matter. QCD, much better understanding of the weak interaction,
*  much better understanding of quantum mechanics in general, and it's had minimal impact on
*  technology. On rocket design. On propulsion. Certainly on rocket design, on anything,
*  any technology whatsoever. And now we're talking about much more esoteric things.
*  And since I don't know what they are, I can't say for sure that they won't affect technology,
*  but I'm very, very skeptical that they would affect technology. Because, you know, to access
*  them, you need very exotic circumstances to make new kinds of particles with high energy. You need
*  accelerators that are very expensive and you don't produce many, many of them and so forth. You know,
*  it's just, it's a pipe dream, I think. Yeah, about space exploration. I'm not sure exactly
*  what he has in mind, but to me, it's more a problem of something between biology and
*  and information processing. What you mean, how should I, I think human bodies are not
*  well adapted to space. Even Mars, which is the closest thing to a kind of human environment
*  that we're going to find anywhere close by. Very, very difficult to maintain humans on Mars
*  and kind of, you know, very expensive and very unstable. However, if we
*  take a broader view of what it means to bring human civilization
*  outside of the Earth, if we're satisfied with, you know, sending mines out there that we can
*  converse with and actuators and that we can manipulate and sensors that we can get feedback
*  from, I think that's where it's at. I think that's so much more realistic and I think that's
*  the long-term future of space exploration. It's not hauling human bodies all over the place and
*  that's just silly. Well, it's possible that human bodies, so like you said, it's a biology problem.
*  What's possible is that we extend human lifespan in some way. We have to look at a bigger picture.
*  It could be just like you're saying, by sending robots with actuators and kind of extending
*  our limbs, but it could also be extending some aspect of our minds, some information.
*  And it could be cyborgs. It could be... Now we're talking.
*  It could be human brains or cells that realize something like human brain architecture within
*  artificial environments, you know, shells, if you like, that are more adapted to the conditions of
*  space. So that's entirely man-machine hybrids as well as sort of remote
*  outposts that we can communicate with. I think those will happen.
*  Yeah, to me, there's some sense in which, as opposed to understanding the physics of
*  the fundamental fabric of the universe, I think getting to the physics of life, the physics of
*  intelligence, the physics of consciousness, the physics of information that brings from which life
*  emerges, that will allow us to do space exploration. Yeah, well, I think physics in the larger sense
*  has a lot to contribute here. Not the physics of the universe, but the physics of the universe.
*  Not the physics of finding fundamental new laws in the sense of another quark or axions even.
*  Physics has a lot of experience in analyzing complex situations and analyzing new states of
*  matter and devising new kinds of instruments that do clever things. Physics in that sense
*  has enormous amounts to contribute to this kind of endeavor. But I don't think that looking for
*  a so-called theory of everything has much to do with it at all. What advice would you give to a
*  young person today with a bit of fire in their eyes? High school student, college student,
*  thinking about what to do with their life, maybe advice about career or bigger advice about life
*  in general? Well, first read fundamentals because I've tried to give some coherent,
*  deep advice. That's fundamentals, 10 keys to reality by Frank Wilczek. So that's a good place
*  available everywhere. If you want to learn what I can tell you. Is there an audiobook?
*  Yes, there is an audiobook. That's awesome. Yeah, I think I can give three pieces of wise advice
*  that I think are generally applicable. One is to cast a wide net
*  and to really look around and see what looks promising, what catches your imagination.
*  You have to balance those two things. You can have things that catch your imagination, but
*  don't look promising in the sense that the questions aren't ripe.
*  The timing isn't right yet.
*  Mathematical thinking and conceptualization that I really enjoy and am good at.
*  That's one thing. Cast a wide net, look around. That's a pretty easy thing to do today because
*  of the internet. You can look at all kinds of things. You have to be careful though because
*  there's a lot of crap. You can tell the difference if you do a little digging.
*  Don't settle on just what your thesis advisor tells you to do or what your teacher tells you
*  to do. Look for yourself and get a sense of what seems promising. Not what seemed promising 10
*  years ago. That's one. Another thing is to read history and read the masters,
*  history of ideas and masters of ideas. I benefited enormously early in my career from reading
*  in physics, Einstein in the original and Feynman's lectures as they were coming out,
*  and Darwin. Galileo, you can learn what it is to wrestle with difficult ideas and how great minds
*  did that. You can learn a lot about style, how to write your ideas up and express them in clear
*  ways. Also, just a couple of that with, I also enjoy reading biographies.
*  Biographies, yes, similarly. It gives you the context of the human being that created those.
*  Right, and brings it down to earth in the sense that it was really human beings who did this.
*  It's not, and they made mistakes. I also got inspiration from Bertrand Russell,
*  who was a big hero, and H.G. Wells. Read the masters, make contact with great minds.
*  When you are sort of narrowing down on a subject, learn about the history of the subject because
*  that really puts in context what you're trying to do and also gives a sense of community
*  and grandeur to the whole enterprise. Then the third piece of advice is complementary to both
*  those, which is to get the basics under control as soon as possible. If you want to do theoretical
*  work in science, you have to learn calculus, multivariable calculus, complex variables,
*  group theory. Nowadays, you have to be highly computer literate. If you want to do experimental
*  work, you also have to be computer literate, then you have to learn about electronics and
*  optics and instruments. Get that under control as soon as possible because it's like learning a
*  language. To produce great works and express yourself fluently and with confidence,
*  it should be your native language. These things should be like your native language,
*  so you're not wondering what is the derivative. This is just part of your, it's in your bones,
*  so to speak. The sooner that you can do that, the better. All those things can be done in parallel
*  and should be. You've accomplished some incredible things in your life, but
*  the sad thing about this thing we have is it ends. Do you think about your mortality? Are you afraid
*  of death? Well, afraid is the wrong word. I mean, I wish it weren't going to happen and I'd like to,
*  but- Do you think about it? Occasionally, I think about it very operationally in the sense that
*  there's always a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. This is a classic subject in
*  computer science, actually, and machine learning that when you're in an unusual circumstance,
*  you want to explore to see what the landscape is and gather data, but then at some point,
*  you want to use that, make choices and say, this is what I'm going to do and exploit the knowledge
*  you've accumulated. The longer the period of exploitation you anticipate, the more
*  exploration you should do in new directions. For me, I've had to adjust the balance of
*  exploration and exploitation. That's how you've explored quite a lot.
*  Yeah. Well, I haven't shut off the exploitation at all. I'm still hoping for-
*  The exploration.
*  The exploration, right. I'm still hoping for 10 or 15 years of top flight performance, but
*  several years ago now, when I was 50 years old, I was at the Institute for Advanced Study and my
*  office was right under Freeman Dyson's office and we were kind of friendly. He found out it was my
*  50th birthday and said, congratulations, and you should feel liberated because no one expects
*  much of a 50-year-old theoretical physicist. He obviously had felt liberated by reaching a certain
*  age. Yeah, there is something to that. I feel I don't have to keep in touch with the latest
*  hyper-technical developments in particle physics or string theory because I'm really not going to
*  be exploiting that. I am exploring in these directions of machine learning and things like
*  that, but I'm also concentrating within physics on exploiting directions that I've already
*  established and the laws that we already have and doing things like I'm very actively involved
*  in helping people, experimentalists and engineers even, to design antennas that are capable of
*  detecting axions. There we're deep in the exploitation stage. It's not a matter of finding
*  the new laws but of really using the laws we have to kind of finish the story off.
*  It's complicated, but I'm very happy with my life right now and I'm enjoying it and I don't want to
*  cloud that by thinking too much that it's going to come to an end. It's a gift I didn't earn.
*  Is there a good thing to say about why this gift that you've gotten and didn't deserve is so damn
*  enjoyable? What's the meaning of this thing, of life? To me, interacting with people I love,
*  my family and I have a very wide circle of friends now and I'm trying to produce some
*  institutions that will survive me as well as my work. It's a positive feedback loop when
*  you do something and people appreciate it and then you want to do more and they get rewarded.
*  How should I say? This is another gift that I didn't earn and don't understand, but I have a
*  dopamine system and I'm happy to use it. It seems to get energized by the creative
*  process, but the process of exploration. Yes, very much so. All of that started from the
*  little fluctuations shortly after the Big Bang. Frank, whatever those initial conditions and
*  fluctuations did that created you, I'm glad they did. Thank you for all the work you've done,
*  for the many people you've inspired. Most of your ideas were pretty useless, as it is for all humans,
*  but you had quite a few truly special ideas and thank you for bringing those to the world and
*  thank you for wasting your valuable time with me today. It's been a joy and I hope people
*  enjoy it. I think the kind of mind expansion that I've enjoyed by interacting with
*  physical reality at this deep level, I think can be conveyed and enjoyed by many, many people.
*  That's one of my missions in life. Beautiful. Thanks for listening to this conversation with
*  Frank Wilczek and thank you to the information, Natsuite, ExpressVPN, Blinkist and 8 Sleep.
*  Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.
*  Nothing happens until something moves. Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
