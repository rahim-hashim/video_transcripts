# Lee Cronin: Origin of Life, Aliens, Complexity, and Consciousness | Lex Fridman Podcast #269
**Lex Fridman:** [March 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZecQ64l-gKM)
*  The following is a conversation with Leek Ronin, a chemist from University of Glasgow,
*  who is one of the most fascinating, brilliant, out-of-the-box thinking scientists I have ever
*  spoken to. This episode was recorded more than two weeks ago, so the war in Ukraine is not mentioned.
*  I have been spending a lot of time each day talking to people in Ukraine and Russia.
*  I have family, friends, colleagues, and loved ones in both countries. I will try to release
*  a solo episode on this war, but I have been failing to find the words that make sense of it
*  for myself and others, so I may not. I ask for your understanding no matter which path I take.
*  Most of my time is spent trying to help as much as I can privately. I am talking to people who
*  are suffering, who are angry, afraid. When I returned to this conversation with Leek,
*  I couldn't help but smile. He is a beautiful, brilliant, and hilarious human being. He is
*  basically a human manifestation of the mad scientist Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty.
*  I thought about quitting this podcast for a time, but for now at least I will keep going.
*  I love people too much. You, the listener. I meet folks on the street or when I run.
*  You say a few kind words about the podcast and we talk about life, the small things,
*  and the big things. All of it gives me hope. People are just amazing. You are amazing.
*  I ask for your support, wisdom, and patience as I keep going with this silly little podcast,
*  including through some difficult conversations. And hopefully many fascinating and fun ones too.
*  This is the Lux Freedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now to your friends, here's Lee Cronin.
*  When we say fast, this is a pretty surprising fact. Maybe you can actually correct me and
*  elaborate, but it seems like 70 or 80% of the time that Earth has been around, there's been life on
*  it. Some very significant percentage. When you say fast, the slow part is from single cell
*  or from bacteria to some more complicated organism. It seems like most of the time
*  that Earth has been around, it's been single cell or very basic organisms, a couple billion years.
*  I recently revisited our history and saw this. I was just looking at the timeline. Wait a minute.
*  How did life just spring up so quickly? Really quickly. That makes me think that it really
*  wanted to. Put another way, it's very easy for life to spring.
*  Yeah, I agree. I think it's much more inevitable. I try to not provoke, but try and push chemists
*  to think about this because chemists are central to this problem of understanding the origin of
*  life on Earth, at least, because we're made of chemistry. But I wonder if the origin of life
*  on a planet or the emergence of life on the planet is as common as the formation of a star.
*  If you start framing it in that way, it allows you to then look at the universe slightly differently
*  because we can get into this, I think, in quite some detail. To come back to your question,
*  I have little idea of how life got started, but I know it was simple. I know that the process of
*  selection had to occur before the biology was established. So that selection built the framework
*  from which life kind of grew in complexity and capability and functionality and autonomy.
*  I think these are all really important words that we can unpack over the next while.
*  Can you say all the words again? So you said selection, so natural selection,
*  the original A-B testing. And then complexity, and then the degree of autonomy and sophistication,
*  because I think that people misunderstand what life is. Some people say that life is a cell,
*  and some people that say that life is a virus or life is an on-off switch. I don't think it's that.
*  Life is the universe developing a memory. And the laws of physics, and the way, well, there are no
*  laws of physics. Physics is just memory-free stuff. So there's only a finite number of ways you can
*  arrange the fundamental particles to do things. Life is the universe developing a memory. So it's
*  sewing a piece of art slowly, and then you can look back at it. So
*  there's a stickiness to life. It's like the universe doing stuff. And when you say memory,
*  it's like there's a stickiness to a bunch of the stuff that's building together. So you can,
*  in a stable way, trace back the complexity that tells a coherent story.
*  Yeah. And I think, yeah.
*  Okay. That's, by the way, very poetic. Beautiful. Life is the universe developing a memory.
*  Okay. And then there's autonomy, complexity we'll talk about, but
*  it's a really interesting idea that selection preceded biology.
*  Yeah. I think-
*  So first of all, what is chemistry? Does sand still count as chemistry?
*  Sure. I mean, as a chemist, a card-carrying chemist, if I'm allowed a card, I don't know.
*  I don't know what I am most days, actually.
*  What is the card made of? What's the chemical composition of the card?
*  So what is chemistry? Well, chemistry is the thing that happens when you bring electrons together
*  and you form bonds. So bonds, or I say to people when they talk about life elsewhere,
*  and I just say, well, there's bonds, there's hope. Because bonds allow you to get heterogeneity.
*  They allow you to record those memories, or at least on earth. You could imagine a Stanislav
*  Lemtri world where you might have life emerging or intelligence emerging before life. That may
*  be something to do on like Solaris or something. But to get to selection, if atoms can combine
*  and form bonds, those atoms can bond to different elements and those molecules
*  will have different identities and interact with each other differently. And then you can start
*  to have some degree of causation or interaction, and then selection, and then existence.
*  And then you go up the path of complexity. And so at least on earth, as we know it,
*  there is a sufficient pool of available chemicals to start searching that conventorial space of bonds.
*  So okay, this is a really interesting question. Let's lay it out. So bonds, almost like cards,
*  we say there's bonds, there is life, there's intelligence, there's consciousness.
*  And what you just made me realize is those can emerge, or let's put bonds aside,
*  those can emerge in any order. That's really brilliant. So intelligence can come before life.
*  It's like panpsychists believe that consciousness, I guess, comes before life and before intelligence.
*  So consciousness permeates all matter. It's some kind of fabric of reality.
*  Okay, so within this framework, you can arrange everything. But you need to have the bonds
*  that precedes everything else. Oh, and the other thing is selection. So like the mechanism of
*  selection, that could precede, couldn't that precede bonds too? Whatever the hell selection is.
*  I would say that there is an elegant order to it. Bonds allow selection, allows the emergence of
*  life, allows the emergence of multicellularity, and then more information processing, building state
*  machines all the way up. However, you could imagine a situation if you had, I don't know,
*  a neutron star or a sun or what, a theraminitic loops interacting with one another, and these
*  oscillators building state machines, and these state machines reading something out in the
*  environment. Over time, these state machines would be able to literally record what happened
*  in the past and sense what's going on in the present and imagine the future. However, I don't
*  think it's ever going to be within a human comprehension that type of life. I wouldn't
*  count it out because, you know, whenever you, I know in science, whenever I say something's
*  impossible, I then wake up the next day and say, no, that's actually wrong. I mean, there are some
*  limits, of course. I don't see myself traveling fast and light anytime soon. But-
*  Eric Weinstein says that's possible. So he will say you're-
*  Sure, but I'm an experimentalist as well. So one of my, I have two superpowers. My stupidity,
*  and I don't mean that as a, you know, I'm like absolutely completely witless, but I mean my
*  ability to kind of just start again and ask the question and then do it with an experiment.
*  I always wanted to be a theoretician growing up, but I just didn't have the intellectual capability.
*  But I was able to think of experiments in my head, like I've been doing in my lab or in that, you
*  know, when I was a child outside, and then those experiments in my head and then outside
*  reinforced one another. So I think that's a very good way of kind of grounding the science, right?
*  Well, that's a nice way to think about theoreticians is they're just people who
*  run experiments in their head. I mean, that's exactly what Einstein did, right? But you're also
*  capable of doing that in the head, in your head, inside your head and in the real world. And the
*  connection between the two is when you first discovered your superpower of stupidity. I like
*  it. Okay. What's the second superpower? Your accent or?
*  Well, I don't know. I like, I am genuinely curious. So my curious, so I have, you know,
*  like everybody ego problems, but my curiosity is bigger than my ego. So as long as that happens,
*  I can, I can, I can hope.
*  That's awesome. That is so powerful. You're just dropping some powerful lines. So curiosity
*  is bigger than ego. That's something I have to think about because you always struggle
*  about the role of ego in life. And that's, that's so nice to think about. Don't think about the
*  size of ego, the absolute size of ego. Think about the relative size of ego to the other,
*  the other horses pulling at you. And if the curiosity one is bigger than ego,
*  do just fine and make you fun to talk to. Anyway, so those are the two superpowers. How do those
*  connect to natural selection or in selection and bonds? And I forgot already life and consciousness.
*  So we're going back to selection in the universe and origin of life on earth.
*  I mean, selection is a foot. I'm convinced that selection is a force in the universe. So
*  not mean not a fundamental force, but a, but a directing, but it is a directing force because
*  existence, although existence appears to be the default, the existence of what, why does,
*  and we can get to this later, I think, but it's amazing that the discrete things exist.
*  And, you know, you see this cup, it's not the, you know, sexiest cup in the world, but it's
*  pretty functional. This cup, the complexity of this cup isn't just in the object. It is
*  literally the lineage of people making cups and recognizing that, seeing that in their head,
*  making an abstraction of a cup and then making a different one. So I wonder how many billions of
*  cups have, you know, come before this one. And that's the process of selection and existence.
*  And the only reason the cup is still used is quite useful. I like the handle, you know,
*  it's convenient so I don't die. I can keep hydration. And so I think we are missing
*  something fundamental in the universe about selection. And I think what biology is, is a,
*  is a selection amplifier. And that the, this is where autonomy comes in. And actually,
*  I think that how humanity is going to, humans and autonomous robots or whatever we're going to call
*  them in the future, we'll supercharge that even further. So selection is happening in the universe,
*  but if you look in the asteroid belt selection, if objects are being kicked in and out the asteroid
*  belt, those trajectories are quite complex. You don't really look at that as productive selection
*  because it's not doing anything to improve its function. But is it? The asteroid belt has
*  existed for some time. So there is some selection going on, but the functionality is somewhat
*  limited. On earth, at the formation of earth, interaction of chemicals and molecules in the
*  environment gave selection and then things could happen. Because you could think about
*  in chemistry, we can have an infinite number of reactions happen, but they don't all,
*  all the reactions are allowed to happen, don't happen. Why? Because there are energy barriers.
*  So there must be some things called catalysts out there, or there are bits of minerals that when
*  two molecules get together on that mineral, it lowers the energy barrier for the reaction. And
*  so the reaction is, is promoted. So suddenly you get one reaction over another series of possibilities
*  occurring that makes a particular molecule. And this keeps happening in steps. And before you know
*  it, there's almost these waves as discrete reactions work together and you start to build
*  a machinery that is run by existence. So as you go forward in time, the fact that the molecules,
*  the bonds are getting, there are more bonds in a molecule, there's more function,
*  there's more capability for this molecule to interact with other molecules to redirect them.
*  It's like a series of little, and I don't want to use this term too much, but it's almost thinking
*  about the simplest von Neumann constructor, that's the simplest molecule that could build
*  a more complicated molecule, build a more complicated molecule. And before you know it,
*  when that more complicated molecule can act on the causal chain that's produced itself
*  and change it, suddenly you start to get towards some kind of autonomy. And that's where life,
*  I think, emerges in earnest. Every single word in the past few paragraphs, let's break those apart.
*  Who's von Neumann? What's the constructor? The closing of the loop that you're talking about,
*  the molecule that starts becoming, I think you said the smallest von Neumann constructor,
*  the smallest, the minimal. So what do all those things mean? And what are we supposed to imagine
*  when we think about the smallest von Neumann constructor? So John von Neumann is a real hero,
*  actually, not just me, but many people, I think, computer science and physics. He was an incredible
*  intellect who probably solved a lot of the problems that we're working on today and just
*  forgot to write them down. And I'm not sure if it's John von Neumann or Johnny, as I think his
*  friends called him, but I think he was Hungarian mathematician, came to the US, and basically was
*  involved in the Manhattan Project and developing computation and came up with all sorts of ideas.
*  And I think it was one of the first people to come up with cellular automata.
*  Really? I didn't know this whole fact.
*  I think so. And I think-
*  Well, anyway, if he didn't come up with it, he probably did come up with it and didn't write it
*  down.
*  There was a couple of people who did at the same time. And then Conway obviously took it on and
*  then Wolfram loves CAs. There is his fabric of the universe. And what I think he imagined was that
*  he wasn't satisfied. And this may be incorrect recollection, but a lot of what I say is going
*  to be kind of just way out of my-
*  Okay. Lee, you're just part of the universe creating its memory, designing-
*  Exactly. Yeah. Rewriting history.
*  Rewriting history.
*  Exactly. Imperfectly. But what I mean is I think he liked this idea of thinking about
*  how could a Turing machine literally build itself without a Turing machine? It's like literally how
*  did state machines emerge? And I think that von Neumann constructors, he wanted to conceive of a
*  minimal thing, autonoma, that could build itself. And what would those rules look like in the world?
*  And that's what a von Neumann kind of constructor looked like. It's a minimal hypothetical object
*  that could build itself, self-replicate. And I'm really fascinated by that because I think that
*  although it's probably not exactly what happened, it's a nice model because as chemists,
*  if we could go back to the origin of life and think about what is a minimal machine
*  that can get structured randomly, so like with no prime mover, with no architect,
*  it assembles through just existence. So random stuff bumping in together and you make this first
*  molecule. So you have molecule A and molecule A interacts with another random molecule B and they
*  get together and they realize by working together they can make more of themselves. But then they
*  realize they can mutate so they can make AB prime. So AB prime is different to AB and then AB prime
*  can then act back where A and B were being created and slightly nudge that causal chain
*  and make AB prime more evolvable or learn more. So that's the closing the loop part.
*  Closing the loop part, got it. It feels like the mutation part is not that difficult. It feels like
*  the difficult part is just creating a copy of yourself as step one. It seems like one of the
*  greatest inventions in the history of the universe is the first molecule that figured out,
*  holy shit, I can create a copy of myself. How hard is that? I think it's really, really easy.
*  Okay, I did not expect that. I think it's really, really easy. Well, let's take a step back. I think
*  replication, replicating molecules are rare. But if you say, I think I was saying on, I probably got
*  into trouble on Twitter the other day, so I was trying to work this. There's about more than 18
*  mils of water in there. So one mole of water, 6.022 times 10 to the 23 molecules. That's about the
*  number of stars in the universe, I think, of the order. So there's three universe worth.
*  Oh, did somebody corrected you on Twitter? Yeah, as ever. I've always been corrected.
*  It's a great fact. But there's a lot of molecules in the water. And so there's a lot of, so although
*  it's for you and me, really hard to conceive of, if existence is not the default for a long period
*  of time, because what happens is the molecules get degraded. So much of the possibilities in the
*  universe are just broken back into atoms. So you have this kind of destruction of the molecules for
*  our chemical reactions. So you only need one or two molecules to become good at copying themselves,
*  for them suddenly to then take resources in the pool and start to grow. And so then replication
*  actually over time, when you have bonds, I think is much simpler, much easier. And I even found
*  this in my lab years ago. One of the reasons I started doing inorganic chemistry and making rust,
*  making a bit of rust based on a thing called molybdenum, molybdenum oxide, is this molybdenum
*  oxide, very simple. But when you add acid to it, and some electrons, they make these molecules,
*  you just cannot possibly imagine would be constructed big gigantic wheels of 154
*  molybdenum atoms in a wheel, or icosadodecahedron 132 molybdenum atoms, all in the same pot.
*  And I realized when I just finished experiments two years ago, I've just published a couple of
*  papers on this, that there actually, there is a random small molecule with 12 atoms in it that
*  can form randomly, but it happens to template its own production. And then by chance, it templates
*  the ring, just an accident, just like just an absolute accident. And that ring also helps make
*  the small 12 mer. And so you have what's called an autocatalytic set, where A makes B, and B helps
*  make A, and vice versa, and you then make this loop. So it's a bit like these, they all work in
*  synergy to make this chain of events that grow. And it doesn't take a very sophisticated model to
*  show that if you have these objects are competing and then collaborating to help one another build,
*  they just grow out of the mess. And although they seem improbable, they are improbable,
*  in fact impossible in one step. There's multiple steps. This is when the blind people look at the
*  blind watchmaker argument, and you talk about how could a watch sometime spontaneously emerge? Well,
*  it doesn't. It's a lineage of watches and cruder devices that are bootstrapped onto one another.
*  Right. So it's very improbable. But once you get that little discovery, like with the wheel,
*  and fire, it just explodes because it's so successful, it explodes. It's basically
*  selection. So this templating mechanism that allows you to have a little
*  like blueprint for yourself, how you go through different procedures, is to build copies of yourself.
*  So in chemistry, somehow it's possible to imagine that that kind of thing
*  is easy to spring up. In more complex organisms, it feels like a different thing and much more
*  complicated. We're having multiple abstractions of the birds and the bees conversation here.
*  But with complex organisms, it feels like difficult to have reproduction.
*  That's going to get clipped out. I'm going to make fun of that.
*  It's difficult to develop this idea of making copies of yourself or no?
*  Because that seems like a magical idea for life to... Wow. That feels like very necessary for what
*  selection is, for what evolution is. But then if selection precedes all of this, then maybe these
*  are just like echoes of the selecting mechanism at different scales.
*  Yeah, that's exactly it. So selection is the default in the universe, if you want to.
*  What happens is that life, the solution that life has got on Earth, life on Earth, biology on Earth,
*  is unique to Earth. We can talk about that. That was really hard fought for. But that is the
*  solution that works on Earth, the ribosome, the fundamental machine that is responsible for every
*  life form, every cell on Earth, wherever it is in the Kingdom of Life. That is an incredibly
*  complex object, but it was evolved over time and it wasn't involved in a vacuum. I think that once
*  we understand that selection can occur without the ribosome, but what the ribosome does,
*  it's a phase transition in replication. I think that that, and also technology that is
*  probably much easier to get to than we think.
*  Why do you put the ribosome as the central part of living organisms on Earth?
*  It basically is a combination of two different polymer systems, so RNA and peptides. So the RNA
*  world, if you like, gets transmitted and builds proteins and the proteins are responsible for all
*  the catalysis, the majority of the catalysis that goes on in the cell. No ribosome, no proteins,
*  no decoding, no evolution. So ribosomes are looking at the action. You don't put the RNA
*  itself as the critical thing. Information, you put action as the most important thing.
*  I think the actual molecules that we have in biology right now are entirely contingent
*  on the history of life on Earth. There are so many possible solutions and this is where
*  chemistry gets itself into origin of life. Chemistry gets itself into a bit of a trap.
*  Yeah, let me interrupt you there. You've tweeted. I'm going to set your tweets like
*  a Shakespeare. Okay. It's surprising you haven't gotten canceled on Twitter yet.
*  Your brilliance once again saves you. I'm just kidding. You like to have a little bit of fun
*  on Twitter. You've tweeted that, quote, origin of life research is a scam. So if this is Shakespeare,
*  can we analyze this word? Why is the origin of life research a scam? Aren't you kind of doing
*  origin of life research? Okay. It was tongue in cheek, but yeah, I think, and I meant it
*  as tongue in cheek. I'm not doing the origin of life research. I'm trying to make artificial life
*  and I also want to bound the likelihood of the origin of life on Earth, but more importantly,
*  to find origin of life elsewhere. But let me directly address the tweet. There are many,
*  many good chemists out there doing origin of life research, but I want to nudge them.
*  And I think they're brilliant. There's no question the chemistry they are doing,
*  the motivation is great. So what I meant by that tweet is saying that maybe they're making
*  assumptions about saying, if only I could make this particular type of molecule, say this RNA
*  molecule or this phosphodiester or this other molecule, it's going to somehow unlock the origin
*  of life. And I think that origin of life has been looking at this for a very long time.
*  And whilst I think it's brilliant to work out how you can get to those molecules,
*  I think that chemistry and chemists doing origin of life could be nudged into doing something even
*  more profound. And so the argument I'm making, it's a bit like right now, let's say, I don't know,
*  the first Tesla that makes its way to, I don't know, into a new country in the world. Let's say
*  there's a country X that has never had a Tesla before and they get the Tesla.
*  Russia.
*  And what they do is they take the Tesla apart and say, we want to find the origin of cars in
*  the universe and say, okay, how did this form? And how did this form? And they just randomly
*  keep making until they make the door, they make the wheel, they make the steering column and all
*  this stuff. And they say, oh, that's the route. That's the way cars emerged on earth. But actually,
*  we know that there's a causal chain of cars going right back to Henry Ford and the horse and carriage.
*  And before that, maybe, you know, where people were using wheels. And I think that obsession
*  with the identities that we see in biology right now are giving us a false sense of security about
*  what we're looking for. And I think the origin of life chemistry is in danger of not making the
*  progress that it deserves because the chemists are doing this. The field is exploding right now.
*  There's amazing people out there, young and old, doing this. And there's deservedly so more money
*  going in. You know, I used to complain there's more money being spent searching for the Higgs
*  boson that we know exists and the origin of life. You know, why is that? We understand the origin
*  of life. We're going to actually work out what life is. We're going to be out bound the likelihood
*  of finding life elsewhere in the universe. And most important for us, we are going to know,
*  or have a good idea of what the future of humanity looks like. You know, we need to understand
*  that although we're precious, we're not the only life forms in the universe. Well, that's my very
*  strong impression. I have no data for that. It's just right now a belief. And I want to turn that
*  belief into a more than a belief by experimentation. But coming back to the scam, the scam is if we just
*  make this RNA, we've got this, you know, this fluke event, we know how that's simple. Let's make
*  this phosphodiester or let's make ATP or ADP. We've got that part nailed. Let's now make this
*  other molecule, another molecule. And how many molecules are going to be enough? And then the
*  reason I say this is when you go back to Craig Venter, when he invented his life form, Cyndia,
*  this microbe, this minimal plasma, it's a myoplasma, something, I don't know the name of
*  it. But he made this wonderful cell and said, I've invented life. Not quite. He facsimileed
*  the genome from this entity and made it in the lab or the DNA. But he didn't make the cell. He had
*  to take an existing cell that has a causal chain going all the way back to Luca. And he showed when
*  he took out the gene, the genes and put in his genes, synthesized, the cell could boot up.
*  But it's remarkable that he could not make a cell from scratch. And even now today,
*  synthetic biologists cannot make a cell from scratch, because there's some contingent
*  information embodied outside the genome in the cell. And that is just incredible. So there's
*  lots of layers to the scam. Well, let me then ask the question, how can we create life in a lab from
*  scratch? What have been the most promising attempts at creating life in the lab from scratch?
*  Has anyone actually been able to do it? Do you think anyone will be able to do it in the near
*  future if they haven't already? Yeah, I think that nobody has made life in the lab from scratch.
*  Lots of people would argue that they have made progress. Craig Venter, I think the synthesis of
*  a synthetic genome milestone in human achievement. Brilliant. Yeah, can we just walk back and say,
*  what would you say from your perspective, one of the world experts in exactly this area,
*  what does it mean to create life from scratch? Where if you sit back, whether you do it or
*  somebody else does it, it's like, damn, this is, we just created life. Well, what I would,
*  I can tell you what I would expect, I would like to be able to do is to go from sand to cells
*  in my lab. And can you explain what sand is? Yeah, just inorganic stuff. Like basically,
*  sand is just silicon oxide with some other ions in it, maybe some inorganic carbon, some carbonates,
*  just basically clearly dead stuff. You could just grind rocks into sand. And it would be what,
*  in a vacuum so they could remove anything else that could possibly be like a shadow of life that
*  can assist in the chemical. You could do that. You could insist and say, look, I'm going to take,
*  and not just inorganic, I want some more, I want to cheat and have some organic, but I want
*  inorganic organic, and I'll explain the play on words in a moment. So I would like to basically
*  put into a world, say a completely, you know, a synthetic world, if you like a closed world,
*  put some inorganic materials, and just literally add some energy in some form, be it lightning or
*  heat, UV light, and run this thing in cycles over time, and let it solve the search problem.
*  I see the origin of life as a search problem in chemical space. And then I would wait,
*  literally wait for a life form to crawl out the test tube. That's a joke I tell my group.
*  Literally wait for a very, don't worry, it's going to be very feeble. It's not going to take over the
*  world. You know, there's ways of ethically containing it. Names last words. Indeed, indeed,
*  indeed. But I, you know, this is being recorded, right? It will not make you look good once it
*  crawls out of the lab and destroys all of human civilization. But yes, that's-
*  But there is very good, there's very good things you can do to prevent that. For instance,
*  if you put stuff in your world, which isn't earth abundant. So let's say we make life based on
*  molybdenum, and it escapes, it would die immediately because there's not enough
*  molybdenum in the environment. So we can put in, we can do it, we can do responsible life, or as
*  I fantasized with my research group on our way day, that would go in, it's, you know, I think it's
*  actually morally, if we don't find, until humanity finds life in the universe, this is going on the
*  tangent, it's our moral obligation to make origin of life bombs, identify dead planets and bomb
*  them with our origin of life machines and make them alive. I think it is our moral obligation to
*  do that. I'm sure some people might argue with me about that, but I think that we need more life in
*  the universe. And then we kind of forget we did it and then come back.
*  And then-
*  So where did you come from? But coming back to the, what I'd expect. So I just say-
*  Father? Are you back? It's, I think this is once again a Rick and Morty episode.
*  Definitely all Rick and Morty all the way down. So we, I imagine we have this pristine
*  experiment and everything is, you know, sanitized and we put in inorganic materials and we have
*  cycles with them, day night cycles, up, down, whatever. And we look for evidence of replication
*  and evolution over time. And that's what the experiment should be. Now, are there people
*  doing this in the world right now? There are a couple of, there's some really good groups
*  doing this. There's some really interesting scientists doing this around the world.
*  They're kind of perhaps too much associated with the scam. So, and so they're using molecules
*  that are already, were already invented by biology. So there's a bit of replication built in.
*  But I still think the work that is doing, they're doing is amazing. But I would like people to be a
*  bit freer and say, let's just basically shake a load of sand in a box and wait for life to come
*  out because that's what happened on earth. And so that we have to understand that. Now, how would I
*  know I've been successful? Well, because I'm not obsessing with what molecules are in life now,
*  I would wager a vast quantity of money. I'm not very rich, so it'd just be a few dollars. But for
*  me, the solution space will be different. So the genetic material will be not RNA.
*  The proteins will not be what we think. The solutions will be just completely different
*  and it might be, and it will be very feeble because that's the other thing we should be able to show
*  fairly robustly that even if I did make or someone did make a new life form in the lab,
*  it would be so poor that it's not going to leap out. The fear about making a lethal life form
*  in the lab from scratch is similar to us imagining that we're going to make the Terminator,
*  Boston Dynamics tomorrow. The problem is we don't communicate that properly. I know you yourself
*  very well. You explain this very well. There is not the AI catastrophe coming.
*  We're very far away from that. That doesn't mean we should ignore it. Same with the origin of life
*  catastrophe. It's not coming anytime soon. We shouldn't ignore it. But we shouldn't let that
*  fear stop us from doing those experiments. But this is a much, much longer discussion because
*  there's a lot of details there. I would say there is potential for catastrophic events
*  to happen in much dumber ways. In AI space, there's a lot of ways to create, like social
*  networks are creating a kind of accelerated set of events that we might not be able to control.
*  Social network virality in the digital space can create mass movements of ideas that can then,
*  if times are tough, create military conflicts and all those kinds of things. But that's not
*  super intelligent AI. That's an interesting at scale application of AI. If you look at viruses,
*  viruses are pretty dumb. But at scale, their application is pretty detrimental. Origin of life,
*  much like all of the kind of virology, the very contentious word of gain of function research
*  and virology, sort of like research on viruses, messing with them genetically,
*  that can create a lot of problems if not done well. So we have to be very cautious. Whenever
*  you're ultra cautious about stuff in AI or in virology and biology, it borders on cynicism,
*  where it's like everything we do is going to turn out to be destructive and terrible, so I'm just
*  going to sit here and do nothing. Okay, that's a possible solution, except for the fact that
*  somebody's going to do it. Science and technology progresses, so we have to do it in an ethical way,
*  in a good way, considering in a transparent way, in an open way, considering
*  all the possible positive trajectories that could be taken and making sure as much as possible that
*  we walk those trajectories. So yeah, I don't think Terminator is coming, but a totally unexpected
*  version of Terminator may be around the corner. Yeah, it might be here already. Yeah, so I agree
*  with that. And so going back to the origin of life discussion, I think that in synthetic biology
*  right now, we have to be very careful about how we edit genomes and edit synthetic biology to do
*  things. So that's where things might go wrong in the same way as Twitter turning ourselves into
*  strange scale effects. I would love origin of life research or artificial life research to get to the
*  point where we have those worries, because that's why I think we're just so far away from that.
*  You know, right now, I think there are two really important angles. There is the origin of life
*  people, researchers who are faithfully working on this and trying to make those molecules,
*  the scan molecules I talk about. And then there are people on the creationist side is saying,
*  look, the fact you can't make these molecules and you can't make a cell means that evolution
*  isn't true and all this other stuff. Gotcha. Yeah. And so, and I find that really frustrating
*  because actually the origin of life research is all working in good faith, right? Yes.
*  And so what I'm trying to do is give origin of life research a little bit more of an open context.
*  And one of the things I think is important, I really want to make a new life form in my lifetime.
*  I really want to prove that life is a general phenomena, a bit like gravity in the universe,
*  because I think that's going to be really important for humanity's global psychological state
*  meaning going forward. That's beautifully, that's beautifully put. So one, it will help us
*  understand ourselves. So that's useful for science, but two, it gives us a kind of hope, if not,
*  an awe at all the huge amounts of alien civilizations that are out there. If you can build life
*  and understand just how easy it is to build life, then that's just as good, if not much better,
*  than discovering life on another planet. Yeah. It's, I mean, it's cheaper. It's much cheaper
*  and much easier and probably much more conclusive because once you're able to create life,
*  like you said, it's a search problem that there's probably a lot of different ways to do it.
*  So once you create the, once you find the first solution, you probably have all the right
*  methodology for finding all kinds of other solutions. Yeah. And wouldn't it be great if
*  we could find a solution? I mean, it's probably a bit late for, I mean, I worry about climate change,
*  but I'm not that worried about climate change. And I think one day you could think about,
*  could we engineer a new type of life form that could basically, and I don't want to do this,
*  and I don't think we should do this necessarily, but it's a good thought experiment that would
*  perhaps take CO2 out of the atmosphere or an intermediate life form. So it's not quite alive.
*  It's almost like an add-on that we can, a time-dependent add-on you could give to,
*  say, cyanobacteria in the ocean or to maybe to wheat and say, right, we're just going to,
*  we're going to fix a bit more CO2 and we're going to work out how much we need to fix to basically
*  save the climate. And we're going to use evolutionary principles to basically get there.
*  What worries me is that biology has had a few billion years to find a solution for CO2 fixation.
*  It hasn't really done. It's not, the solution isn't brilliant for our needs, but biology wasn't
*  thinking about our needs. Biology was thinking about biology's needs. But I think if we can do,
*  as you say, make life in the lab, then suddenly we don't need to go to everywhere and conclusively
*  prove it. I think we make life in the lab. We look at the extent of life in the solar system.
*  How far did Earth life get? Probably we're all Martians. Probably life got going on Mars,
*  the chemistry on Mars seeded Earth. That might have been a legitimate way to kind of truncate
*  the surface. But in the outer solar system, we might have completely different life forms
*  on the oscillators, on Europa and, and Titan. And that would be a cool thing because-
*  Okay. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Did you just say that you think
*  in terms of likelihood, life started on Mars, like statistically speaking, life started on Mars and
*  seeded Earth? It could be possible because life was like, so Mars was habitable for the type of
*  life that we have right now, type of chemistry before Earth. So it seems to me that Mars got
*  searching doing chemistry, like- It started way before.
*  Yeah. And so they had a few more replicators and some other stuff. And if those replicators got
*  ejected from Mars and landed on Earth, and Earth was like, I don't need to start again.
*  Right. Thanks for that. And then it just carried on. So I'm not going, I think we will find evidence
*  of life on Mars, either life we put there by mistake, contamination, or actually life,
*  the earliest remnants of life. And that would be really exciting. It's a really good reason to go
*  there. But I think it's more unlikely because of the gravitational situation in the solar system,
*  if we find life in the outer solar system- Titan and all that, that'll be its
*  own thing. Exactly.
*  Wow. That'll be so cool. If we go to Mars and we find life that looks a hell of a lot similar to
*  Earth life, and then we go to Titan and all those weird moons with the ices and the volcanoes and
*  all that kind of stuff. And then we find there something that looks, I don't know, way weirder.
*  Yeah. Some other, some non-RNA type of situation.
*  Or we might find almost life, like in the pre-biodic chemical space. And I think there are four types
*  of exoplanets we can go look for, right? Because when JWST goes up and Touchwood goes up and
*  everything's fine, when we look at a star, well, we know statistically most stars have planets
*  around them. What type of planet are they? Are they going to be dead? Are they going to be just
*  pre-biodic origin of life coming? So are they going to be technological? And so we have intelligence
*  on them. And will they have died? So from, had life on them, but not-
*  Those are the four states of-
*  And suddenly it's a bit like I want to classify planets the way we classify
*  stars. And I think that in terms of rather than having this, oh, we've found methane,
*  that's evidence of life. We found oxygen, that's the evidence of life. We found whatever
*  molecule marker and start to then frame things a little bit more.
*  As those four states. Which by the way, you're just saying four, but there could be
*  a, before the dead, there could be other states that we humans can't even conceive of.
*  Yeah, yeah. Just pre-biotic, almost alive, got the possibility to come alive. I think-
*  But there could be a post-technological, like whatever we think of as technology,
*  that could be a like pre-conscious, like where we all meld into one super intelligent conscious,
*  some weird thing that naturally happens over time.
*  Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think that all bets are on them.
*  The metaverse.
*  Yeah, we are.
*  We join into a virtual metaverse and start creating, which is kind of an interesting idea,
*  almost arbitrary number of copies of each other much more quickly to mess with different ideas.
*  And I can create a thousand copies of Lex, like every possible version of Lex, and then just see,
*  and then I just have them argue with each other until in the space of ideas and see who wins out.
*  How could that possibly go wrong? But anyway, especially in this digital space where you can
*  start exploring with AIs mixed in, you can start engineering arbitrary intelligences.
*  You can start playing in the space of ideas, which might move us into a world that looks very
*  different than a biological world. Our current world, the technology,
*  is still very much tied to our biology. We might move past that completely.
*  We definitely will.
*  That could be another phase then.
*  Sure.
*  But I did say technological, so I think I agree with you. Let's get this right. So,
*  dead world, no prospect of alive. Prebiotic world, life emerging, living, and technological.
*  And the dead one, you probably won't be able to tell between the dead never been alive and the
*  dead one. Maybe you've got some artifacts, and maybe there's five. There's probably not more
*  than five. And I think the technological one could have life on it still, but it might just have
*  exceeded. Because one way that life might survive on Earth is if we can work out how to deal with
*  the real climate change that comes when the sun expands. There might be a way to survive that.
*  I think that we need to start thinking statistically when it comes to
*  looking for life in the universe.
*  Let me ask you then statistically, how many alien civilizations are out there
*  in those four phases that you're talking about? When you look up to the stars,
*  and you're sipping on some wine, and talking to other people with British accents about something
*  intelligent, intellectual, I'm sure. Do you think there's a lot of alien civilizations looking back
*  at us and wondering the same?
*  My romantic view of the universe is really taking loans from my logical self. So, what I'm saying
*  is I have no idea. But having said that, there is no reason to suppose that life is as hard as we
*  first thought it was. So, if we just take Earth as a marker, and if I think that life is a much
*  more general phenomena than just our biology, then I think the universe is full of life.
*  The reason for the Fermi paradox is not that they're not out there, it's just that we can't
*  interact with other life forms because they're so different. I'm not saying that they're
*  necessarily like as depicted in Arrival or other, you know, I'm just saying that perhaps
*  there are very few universal facts in the universe, and maybe
*  that is not, it's quite hard, our technologies are quite divergent.
*  And so, I think that it's very hard to know how we're going to interact with alien life.
*  You think there's a lot of kinds of life that's possible. I guess that was the intuition.
*  Yeah.
*  You provided that the way biology itself, but even this particular kind of biology that we have on
*  Earth, is something that is just one sample of nearly infinite number of other possible
*  complex, autonomous, self-replicating type of things that could be possible. And so,
*  we're almost unable to see the alternative versions of us.
*  I mean, we'll still be able to detect them, we'll still be able to interact with them,
*  we'll still be able to, like, which, what exactly is lost in translation? Why can't we see them?
*  Why can't we talk to them? Because I too have a sense, you put it way more poetically, but
*  it seems both statistically and sort of romantically, it feels like the universe
*  should be teeming with life, like super intelligent life. And I just, I sit there and the Fermi
*  paradox is very, it's felt very distinctly by me when I look up at the stars, because it's like,
*  it's the same way I feel when I'm driving through New Jersey and listening to Bruce Springsteen and
*  feel quite sad. It's like Lucy Kay talks about pulling off to the side of the road and just
*  weeping a little bit. I'm almost like, wondering like, hey, why aren't you talking to us? You know,
*  it feels lonely. It feels lonely because it feels like they're out there.
*  I think that there are a number of answers to that. I think the Fermi paradox is perhaps based on the
*  assumption that if life did emerge in the universe, it would be similar to our life,
*  and there's only one solution. And I think that what we've got to start to do is go out and
*  look for selection detection, rather than an evolution detection, rather than life detection.
*  And I think that once we start to do that, we might start to see really interesting things.
*  And we haven't been doing this for very long. And we are living in an expanding universe,
*  and that makes the problem a little bit harder. Everybody's always leaving.
*  But I'm very optimistic that we will. Well, I don't know, there are two movies that came out
*  in the same, within six months of one another, Ad Astra and Cosmos. Ad Astra, the very expensive
*  blockbuster, you know, with Brad Pitt in it and saying there is no life and it's all, you know,
*  we've got to live on Earth has more pressures and Cosmos, which is a UK production, which basically
*  aliens can visit Earth one day and they were discovered in the UK. Right. It was quite,
*  it's a fun film. But I really loved those two films. And I'm, I, I, and at the same time,
*  those films, at the time those films are coming out, I was working on a paper,
*  a life detection paper. And I felt it was so hard to publish this paper. And it was almost as
*  depressed that I got so depressed trying to get this science out there that I felt the depression
*  of the film in Ad Astra, like life is, there's no life elsewhere in the universe. And, but I,
*  but I'm incredibly optimistic that I think we will find life in the universe, firm evidence of life
*  and it will have to start on Earth, making life on Earth and surprising us. We have to surprise
*  ourselves and make non-biological life on Earth. And then people say, well, you, you made this life
*  on Earth. Therefore it's the, you're part of the causal chain of that. And that might be true,
*  but if I can show how I, I'm able to do it with very little cheating or very little information
*  inputs, just creating like a, a model planet, some description and watching it, watching life
*  emerge, then I think that we will be even to, to persuade even the hardest critic that, that it's
*  possible. Now with regards to the Fermi paradox, I think that we might crush that with the JWST.
*  It's basically, if I recall correctly, the mirror is about 10 times the size of the Hubble
*  that we're going to be able to do spectroscopy, look at colors of exoplanets, I think.
*  Not brilliantly, but we'll be able to start to classify them. And we'll start to get a real
*  feel for what's going on in the universe on these exoplanets. Cause it's only in the last
*  few decades, I think, maybe even last decade that we even
*  came to recognize that exoplanets even are common. And I think that that gives us a lot of optimism
*  that life is going to be out there. But I think we have to start framing,
*  we have to start preparing the fact that biology is only one solution. I can tell you with confidence
*  that biology on earth does not exist anywhere else in the universe. We are absolutely unique.
*  Well, okay. I love the confidence, but where does that confidence come from? You know, chemistry,
*  like how many options does chemistry really have? Many. That's the point. And the thing is,
*  this is where the origin of life scam comes in, is that people don't quite count, they don't count
*  the numbers. So if biology, as you find on earth is common everywhere, then there's something really
*  weird going on that basically written in the quantum mechanics, there's some kind of these
*  bonds must form over these bonds and this catalyst must form over this catalyst when they're all
*  quite equal. Life is contingent. The origin of life on earth was contingent upon the chemistry
*  available at the origin of life on earth. So that means if we want to find other earth-like worlds,
*  we look for the same kind of rocky world, we might look in the same zone as earth and we might expect
*  reasonably to find biological-like stuff going on. That would be a reasonable hypothesis,
*  but it won't be the same. It can't be. It's like saying, I don't believe in magic. That's why I'm
*  sure. I just don't believe in magic. I believe in statistics and I can do experiments. And so I won't
*  get the same, exactly the same sequence of events. I'll get something different. And so there is
*  TikTok elsewhere in the universe, but it's not the same as our TikTok, right? That's what I mean.
*  Which aspect of it is not the same? Well, I just think, so what is TikTok? TikTok is a
*  social media where people upload videos, silly videos. So I guess there might be-
*  Well, there's humor, there's attention, there's ability to process, there's ability for
*  intelligent organisms to collaborate on ideas and find humor and ideas and play with those ideas,
*  make them viral memes. Humor seems to be kind of fundamental to the human experience.
*  And I think that that's a really interesting question we can ask. Is humor a fundamental
*  thing in the universe? I think maybe it will be, right? In terms of, if you think about in a game
*  theoretic sense, humor, the emergence of humor serves a role in our game engine. And so if
*  selection is fundamental in the universe, so is humor. Well, I actually don't know exactly
*  what role humor serves. Maybe it's like, from a chemical perspective, it's like a catalyst
*  for, I guess it's of several purposes. One is the catalyst for spreading ideas on the internet.
*  That's modern humor. But humor is also a good way to deal with the difficulty of life. It's a kind
*  of valve, release valve for suffering. Throughout human history, life has been really hard. And for
*  the people that I have known in my life who've lived through some really difficult things,
*  really difficult things, humor is part of how they deal with that. It's usually dark humor.
*  Yeah, it's interesting. I don't know exactly what's the more mathematically general way to
*  formulate what the hell is humor? What humor does it serve? But I still, we're kind of joking here,
*  but it's a counterintuitive idea to me to think that life elsewhere in the universe
*  is very different than life on earth. And also, each instantiation of life is likely very different
*  from each other. Maybe there's a few clusters of similar life, but it's much more likely,
*  what you're saying, to me it's a kind of novel thought. I'm not sure what to do with it. But
*  you're saying that it's more common to be a weird outcast in the full spectrum of life than it is to
*  be in some usual cluster. So every instantiation of a kind of chemistry that results in complexity,
*  that's autonomous and self-replicating, however how you define life, that is going to be very
*  different every time. I don't know. It feels like a selection is a fundamental kind of directed
*  force in the universe. Won't selection result in a few pockets of interesting complexities?
*  If we ran earth over again, over and over and over, you're saying it's going to come up, but
*  there's not going to be elephants every time? Yeah, I don't think so. I think that there will
*  be similarities. And I think we don't know enough about how selection globally works.
*  But it might be that the emergence of elephants was wired into the history of earth in some way,
*  like the gravitational force, how evolution was going, the Cambrian explosions, blah blah blah,
*  the emergence of mammals. But I just don't know enough about the contingency, the variability.
*  All I do know is you count the number of bits of information required to make an elephant
*  and think about the causal chain that provides the lineage of elephants going all the way back to
*  LUCA, there's a huge scope for divergence. Yeah, but just like you said, with chemistry and selection,
*  the things that result in self-replicating chemistry and self-replicating organisms,
*  those are extremely unlikely, as you're saying. But once they're successful, they multiply. So
*  like, I just, it might be a tiny subset of all things that are possible in the universe,
*  chemically speaking, it might be a very tiny subset is actually successful at creating elephants.
*  Or elephant-like, or slash human-like creatures. Well, there's two different questions. The first
*  one, if we were to reset earth and to start again. At the different phases, sorry to keep interrupting.
*  Yeah, no, if we restart earth and start again, say we could go back to the beginning and do the
*  experiment or have a number of earths, how similar would biology be? I would say that there would be
*  broad similarities. But the emergence of mammals is not a given unless we're going to throw an
*  asteroid at each planet at each time and try and faithfully reproduce what happens. Then there's
*  the other thing about when you go to another earth-like planet elsewhere, maybe there's a
*  different ratio, particular elements, maybe there's the bombardment at the beginning of the planet
*  was quicker or longer than earth. And I just don't have enough information there. What I do know
*  is that the complexity of the story of life on earth gives us lots of scope for variation.
*  And I just don't think it's a reasonable mathematical assumption to think that
*  life on earth happened again would be the same as what we have now.
*  Okay. But you've also extended that to say that we might, as an explanation for the Fermi paradox,
*  that means we're not able to interact with them. Or that's an explanation for why we haven't
*  at scale heard from aliens is they're different than us.
*  Well, right now, we've only been looking for say 70, 80 years. So I think that the reason
*  we have not found aliens yet is that we haven't worked out what life is.
*  No, but the aliens have worked that out, surely. I mean, they're not going to be able to do that.
*  I mean, statistically speaking, there must be a large number of aliens that are way ahead of us
*  on this whole life question. Unless there's something about this stage of intellectual
*  evolution that often quickly results in nuclear war and destroys itself. There's something
*  in this process that eventually, I don't know, crystallizes the complexity and it stops
*  either dies or stops developing. But most likely they already figured it out. And why aren't they
*  contacting us? There's some grad student somewhere wants to study a new green planet.
*  Maybe they have. I mean, I don't have a coherent answer to your question,
*  other than to say that if there are other aliens out there, and they're far more advanced,
*  they might be in contact with each other. And they might also, we might be at a point where,
*  what I'm saying quite critically is it takes two to talk, right? So the aliens might be there. But
*  if we don't have the ability to recognize them and talk to them, then the aliens aren't going
*  to want to talk to us. And I think that's a critical point that probably, if that's a filter,
*  there needs to be an ability for one to communicate with the other. And we need to know what life is
*  before we do that. So we haven't qualified to even join their club to have a talk.
*  Well, I think they still want to teach us how to talk, right? But my worry is that,
*  or I think they would want to teach us how to talk like you do when you meet it.
*  Like when you even meet, I was going to say child, but that's a human species. I mean, like an ant.
*  You want to try to communicate with them through whatever devices you can, given what an ant is
*  like. I just, I worry mostly about the humans are just too close-minded or don't have the right tools.
*  No, I'm going to push back on this quite significantly. I would say, because we don't
*  understand what life is, and because we don't understand how life emerged in the universe,
*  we don't understand the physics that gave rise to life yet. And that means our description,
*  fundamental description, I'm way out of my pay grade, even further out, but I'll say it anyway,
*  I think it's a fun. You don't get paid much anyway. So as you said earlier, so.
*  So I would say that we, because we don't understand the universe yet, we do not understand
*  how the universe spat out life. And we don't know what life is. And I think that until we understand
*  that, it is going to limit our ability to even, we don't qualify to talk to the aliens. So I'm going
*  to say that they might be there, but we just, I'm not going to say that I believe in interdimensional
*  aliens being present. Yeah, but I think you're just being self-critical. Like we don't qualify.
*  I think the fact that we don't qualify qualifies us. We're interesting in our innocence.
*  No, I'm saying that because we don't understand causal chains and the way that information is
*  propagated in the universe, and we don't understand what replication is yet, and we don't understand
*  how life emerged, I think that we would not recognize aliens. And if someone doesn't
*  recognize you, you wouldn't go and talk to it. You don't go and talk to ants. You don't go and
*  talk to birds or maybe some birds you do, right? Because you can. There's just enough cognition.
*  So I'm saying because we don't have enough cognitive, our cognitive abilities are not yet
*  where they need to be. We probably aren't even communicating with them. So you don't agree with
*  the dating strategy of playing hard to get because us humans that seem to attract us.
*  Within a species, that's fine. But I think we don't actually have abstraction. No, actually,
*  I think in this talk, in this conversation, you've helped me crystallize something that I think has
*  been troubling me for a long time with the Fermi paradox. I'm pretty sure that a reasonable avenue
*  is to say that you would not go and talk to your cat about calculus, right?
*  But I would still pet it.
*  Sure, but I'm not talking about petting a cat. The analogy is that the aliens are not going to talk
*  to us because we, and I'm using calculus as an analogy for abstraction, because we lack the
*  layer, the fundamental layer of understanding what life is and what the universe is in our reality,
*  that it would be so counterproductive interacting with intelligent alien species
*  that it would cause more angst for human race.
*  But they don't care. Okay, they got to be self-interested. So they'll probably,
*  they more care about is it interesting for them? Maybe they, I mean, surely there's a way to
*  pet the cat in this analogy, because even if we lack complete understanding, it must be a very
*  frustrating experience for other kinds of intelligence to communicate with us.
*  Still, there must be a way to interact with us. Like perturb the system in interesting ways,
*  to see what these creatures do.
*  We might actually find the answer. I mean, again, at my pay grade in a simulation
*  of the Earth, or say, let's say a simulation where we allow an intelligent AI to emerge,
*  right? And that AI, we then give it the objective is to be curious, interact with other intelligence
*  in its universe. And then we might find the parameters required for that AI to work with.
*  And I think you're fine if the AI will not talk to other AIs that don't share
*  the ability to abstract to the level of the AI, because it's just a cat. And
*  would you are you going to travel 20 light years to go and pet a cat?
*  So not because of the inability to do so, but because of like boredom is it's more interested.
*  It will start talking to it will spend most it will spend a majority of its time talking to
*  other AI systems that can at least somewhat understand it's much more fun.
*  It's a bit like, do we know that plants are conscious? Well,
*  plants unconscious in the way we typically think, but we don't talk to them. They could be,
*  right? But there's a lot of people on Earth who like gardening. There's always going to be a
*  weird. They're not talking, they're just gardening.
*  Okay. Well, you're not romantic enough to see gardening as a way of communication between humans.
*  Oh, okay. You've got me. But there's ways. There's always going to be the people who are curious,
*  Jane Goodall, who lives with the chimps, right? There's always going to be curious
*  intelligence species that visit the weird or Earth planet and try to interact. I mean, it's,
*  yeah, I think it's a super cool idea that you're expressing. I just kind of have a sense,
*  maybe it's a hope that there's always going to be a desire to interact even with those that don't,
*  can't possibly understand the depth of what you understand.
*  So I'm with you. So I want to be as positive as you that aliens do exist and we will interact
*  with them. What I'm trying to do is to give you a reasonable hypothesis why we haven't yet.
*  And also something to strive for, to be able to do that. I mean, there is the other view that
*  the universe is just too big and life is just too rare. But I want to come up with an alternative
*  explanation, which I think is reasonable and not being philosophically and scientifically
*  thought out, which is this, if you can't actually communicate with the object, the person, the thing
*  competently, you don't even know it's there. Then there's no point yet.
*  See, I disagree with that, but I'm totally aligned with your hopeful vision, which is like,
*  we need to understand the origin of life. It will help us engineer life, will help us engineer
*  intelligent life through perhaps on the computer side, through simulation and explore all the ways
*  that life emerges. And that will allow us to, I think the fundamental reason we don't see
*  overwhelming amounts of life is I actually believe aliens, of course, these are all just kind of
*  open-minded beliefs. It's difficult to know for sure about any of this, but I think there's a lot
*  of alien civilizations which are actively communicating with us and we're too dumb.
*  We don't have the right tools to see it. That's what I'm saying.
*  No, but maybe I misinterpreted you, but I interpreted you to say they kind of tried a few times
*  and they're like, oh God. No, no, no. What I'm saying is this goes two ways. Yeah,
*  I agree with you. There could be information out there, but just put in such a way that we just
*  don't understand it yet. Sorry if I didn't make that clear. I think we qualify as soon as we can
*  decode their signal. Right. So when you say qualified, got it, got it. So you mean we're
*  just not smart enough. The word qualified was throwing me off. So we're not smart enough to do,
*  it's like the machines need to get smarter. And there's a lot of people who believe,
*  let me get your opinion on this, about UFO sightings.
*  So sightings of weird phenomena. What does UFO mean? It means it's a flying object and it's not
*  identified clearly at the time of sighting. That's what UFO means. So it could be a physics
*  phenomena, it could be ball lightning, it could be all kinds of fascinating. I was always fascinated
*  with ball lightning. The fact that there could be physical phenomena in this world
*  that are observable by the human eye, of course, all physical phenomena generally are fascinating
*  that really smart people can't explain. I love that. Because it's like, wait a minute,
*  especially if you can replicate it, it's like, wait a minute, how does this happen? That's like
*  the precursor to giant discoveries in chemistry and biology and physics and so on. But it sucks
*  when those events are super rare, like leg ball lightning. So that's out there. And then,
*  of course, that phenomena could have other interpretations that don't have to do
*  with the physics, the chemistry, the biology of Earth. It could have to do with more
*  extraterrestrial explanations that in large part, thanks to Hollywood and movies and all those
*  kinds of things, captivates the imaginations of millions of people. But just because it's
*  science fiction that captivates the imagination of people doesn't mean that some of those sightings,
*  all it takes is one. One of those sightings is actually a sign that it's extraterrestrial
*  intelligence, that it's an object that's not of this particular world. Do you think there's a
*  chance that that's the case? What do you make, especially the pilot sightings, what do you make
*  of those? So I agree there's a chance, there's always a chance, any good scientist would have to,
*  or observationist would have to, you know, I want to see if aliens exist come to Earth.
*  What I know about the universe is I think it's unlikely right now that there are aliens visiting
*  us, but not impossible. I think the releases, the dramatization that's been happening politically,
*  saying we're going to release all this information, this classified information,
*  I was kind of disappointed because it was just very poor material. And right now,
*  the ability to capture high resolution video, everybody is carrying around with them an
*  incredible video device now, and we haven't got more compelling data. And so that we've just
*  seen grainy pictures, a lot of hearsay, instrument kind of malfunctions and whatnot. And so I think
*  on balance, I think it's extremely unlikely, but I think something really interesting is happening.
*  And also during the pandemic, right, we've all been locked down, we all want to have,
*  we want to, our imaginations are, you know, running riot. And I think that the, I don't think that
*  the information out there has convinced me there are any anything interesting on the UFO side.
*  But what it has made me very interested about is how humanity is opening up its mind to ponder
*  aliens and the mystery of our universe. And so I don't want to dissuade people from having those
*  thoughts and say you're stupid and look at that, it's clearly incorrect. That's not right. That's
*  not fair. What I would say is that I lack sufficient data, replicated observations to make me go, oh,
*  I'm going to take this seriously. But I'm really interested by the fact that there is this great
*  deal of interest. And I think that it drives me to maybe want to make an artificial life form even
*  more and to help NASA and the Air Force and whoever go and look for things even more,
*  because I think humanity wants to know what's out there. There's this yearning isn't there?
*  Yeah, but I see I almost, depending on the day, I sometimes agree with you, but
*  with the thing you just said, but
*  one of the disappointing things to me about the sightings,
*  I still hold the belief that a non-zero number of them
*  is an indication of something very interesting. So I don't side with the people who say
*  everything can be explained with like sensor artifacts kind of thing.
*  Yeah, I agree with you. I didn't say that either. I would say I just don't have enough data.
*  Right. But the thing I want to push back on is the statement that everybody has a high definition
*  camera. One of the disappointing things to me about the report that the government released,
*  but in general, just having worked with government, having worked with people all over,
*  is how incompetent we are. Like if you look at the response to the pandemic,
*  how incompetent we are in the face of great challenges without great leadership. How
*  incompetent we are in the face of the great mysteries before us without great leadership.
*  And I just think it's actually the fact that there's a lot of high definition cameras is not
*  enough to capture the full richness of weird, of the mysterious phenomena out there of which
*  extraterrestrial intelligence visiting earth could be one. I don't think we have, I don't think
*  everybody having a smartphone in their pocket is enough. I think that allows for TikTok videos.
*  I don't think it allows for the capture of even interesting, relatively rare human events.
*  That's not that common. It's rare to have been the right moment in the right time to be able to
*  capture the thing. I agree. I agree. Let me rephrase what I think on this. I haven't seen
*  enough information. I haven't really actively sought it out. I must admit, but I'm with you
*  in that I love the idea of anomaly detection in chemistry in particular. I want to make anomalies,
*  sorry, or not necessarily make anomalies. I want to understand an anomaly. Let me give you two from
*  chemistry, which are really quite interesting. Phlogiston, going way back where people said,
*  there's this thing called Phlogiston. And for ages, the alchemists got really this kind of,
*  that fire is a thing. And that's one. And then we determined that Phlogiston wasn't what we thought
*  it is. Let's go to physics, the ether. The ether is a hard one because I think actually the ether
*  might exist. And I'll tell you what I think the ether is later. Can you explain ether?
*  So as the vacuums, the light traveling through the ether in the vacuum, there is some thing that we
*  call the ether that basically mediates the movement of light. And then the other one is cold fusion,
*  which is more of a, so a few years ago that people observed it when they did some electrochemistry,
*  when they were splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, that you got more energy out than you put
*  in and people got excited and they thought that this was a nuclear reaction. And in the end,
*  it was kind of discredited because you didn't detect neutrons and all that stuff. But I'm pretty
*  sure, I'm a chemist, I'm going, telling you this on your podcast, but why not? I'm pretty sure there's
*  interesting electrochemical phenomena that's not completely bottomed out yet, that there is something
*  there. However, we lack the technology and the experimental design. So what I'm saying in your
*  response about aliens is we lack the experimental design to really capture these anomalies. And we
*  are encircling the planet with many more detection systems. We've got satellites everywhere. So there
*  is, I do hope that we are going to discover more anomalies. And remember that the solar system isn't
*  just static in space, it's moving through the universe. So there's just more and more chance.
*  I'm not what with Avi Loeb, that he's generating all sorts of kind of a cult, I would say, with
*  this. But I'm not against him. I think there is a finite chance if there are aliens in the universe,
*  that we're going to happen upon them, because we're moving through the universe.
*  What's the nature of the following that Avi Loeb has?
*  He's doubling down more and more and more and say there are aliens, interdimensional aliens and
*  everything else, right? He's gone from space junk accelerating out of two interdimensional stuff
*  in a very short space of time. He's obviously bored. Or he wants to tap into the psyche and
*  understand. And he's playfully kind of trying to interact with society and his peers to say,
*  stop saying it's not possible. And which I agree with, we shouldn't do that. But we should frame
*  it statistically in the same way we should frame everything as good scientists, statistically.
*  Yeah, good scientists. Recently, idea of good scientists is,
*  I take quite skeptically, I've been listening to a lot of scientists tell me about what is good,
*  what is good science.
*  That makes me sad, because you've been interviewed, what I would consider a lot of really good
*  scientists.
*  No, that's true. And but that's exactly right. And most of the people I talked to are incredible
*  human beings. But there's a humility that's required. Science is not science cannot be
*  dogmatism.
*  Sure, I agree. I mean,
*  authority, like a PhD does not give you authority. A lifelong pursuit or a particular task does not
*  give you authority. You're just as lost and clueless as everybody else. But you're more curious
*  and more stubborn. So that's a nice quality to have. But overall, just
*  using the word science and statistics can often, as you know, kind of become a catalyst for
*  dismissing new ideas, out of the box ideas, wild ideas, all that kind of stuff.
*  Well, yes and no. I think that so I'm, I like to some people find me extremely annoying in science,
*  because I'm basically, I quite rude and disruptive, not in a rude, you know,
*  so to people and say they're ugly or stupid or anything like that. I just say,
*  you know, you're wrong. Why do you think this and, and something I gift I got given by society when
*  I was very young, because I was in the learning difficulties class at school,
*  is I was told I was stupid. And so I know, I know I'm stupid. But I always wanted to be smart,
*  right? I always, I remember going to school going, maybe today they're going to tell me I,
*  I'm not as stupid as I was yesterday. And it was always disappointed always. And so when I went
*  into academia and everyone says, you're wrong, I was like, join the queue. Because it allowed me to
*  walk through the, you know, the wall. So I think that people like to always imagine science is a
*  bit like living in a Japanese house, the paper walls, and everyone sits in their paper in their
*  room. And I annoy people because I walk straight through the wall, not because why should, why
*  should I be a chemist and not a mathematician? Why should I be a mathematician, not computer
*  scientist? Because if the problem requires us to walk through those walls, but I like walking
*  through the walls, like, but I as long then I have to put up, you know, I have to do good, so I have
*  to win the people in those rooms across by good science, by taking their criticisms and addressing
*  them head on. And I think we must do that. And I think that I try and do that in my own way. And I
*  kind of love walking through the walls. And it gives me, it's difficult for me, personally,
*  it's quite painful. But it always leads to a deeper understanding of the people I'm with,
*  in particular, you know, the arguments I have with all sorts of interesting minds, because
*  I want to solve the problem, or I want to understand more about why I exist.
*  You know, that's, that's it, really. And I think we have to not dismiss science on that basis. I
*  think we can, we can work with science. No, science is beautiful. But humans with egos,
*  and all those kinds of things can sometimes misuse good things, like social justice, like all ideas
*  we all aspire to misuse these beautiful ideas to, to manipulate people to all those kinds of things.
*  And sure. And that's, there's assholes in every space and walk of life, including science. And
*  those are, those are no good. But yes, you're right. The scientific method
*  has proven to be quite useful. That said, for difficult questions for difficult,
*  rare explanations for rare phenomena, you have to walk cautiously.
*  Because the scientific method, when you totally don't understand something,
*  and it's rare, you can replicate it doesn't quite apply.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. I agree with you. The challenge is to, is to not dismiss the anomaly
*  because you can't replicate it. I mean, we can talk about this. This is something I realized when we
*  were developing assembly theory. And people think in the track they're on is so dogmatic, but there
*  is this thing that they see, but they don't see. And it takes a bit of time and you just have to
*  keep reframing it. And my approach is to say, well, why can't this be right? Why must we accept
*  that RNA is the only way into life? I mean, who said, does RNA have a special, special class of
*  information that's encoded in the universe? No, of course it doesn't, right? RNA is not a special
*  molecule in the space of all the other molecules. But it's so elegant and simple and it works so
*  well for the evolutionary process that we kind of use that as an intuition to explain that that
*  must be the only way to have life. Sure. But you mentioned assembly theory. Well, first let me
*  pause bathroom break. You did? Yeah, let's take two minutes. We took a quick break and offline,
*  you mentioned to me that you have a lab in your home. And then I said that you're basically Rick
*  from Rick and Morty, which is something I've been thinking this whole conversation. And then you say
*  that there's a glowing pickle that you used something involving cold plasma, I believe.
*  I don't know, but can you explain the glowing pickle situation?
*  And is there many arbitrarily many versions of you in alternate dimensions? So I think you're aware
*  of I tried to make an electrochemical memory in at home using a and the only way using a pickle,
*  the only way I could get any traction with it was actually by plugging it into a very high voltage
*  alternating current and then putting in a couple of electrodes. But my kids weren't impressed.
*  They're not impressed with anything I do, any experiments I do at home. I think it's quite funny.
*  But you connected a pickle to some electric. I mean, 240 volts, yeah, AC. Yeah. And then had
*  a couple of electrodes on it. So what happens is a pickle. This is a classic thing you do.
*  I mean, I shouldn't pranks you do you put a plug pickle into the mains and just leave it,
*  run away and leave it. And what happens is it it starts to decompose heats up and then explodes
*  because the water turns to steam and it just violently explodes. But I wondered if I could
*  cause the iron sodium potassium ions in the pickle to migrate had been in a jar, right? So in a brine.
*  That was yeah, that was not my that was not my best experiments. I've been far better
*  experiments in my lab at home. At that time was a failed experiment. But you never know it could.
*  Every experiment is a successful experiment. If you stick with it long enough.
*  Well, I mean, I get I got kicked out of my own lab by my research team many years ago. And for good
*  reason. I mean, my team is brilliant. And I used to go and just break things. So what I do do at
*  home is I have a kind of electronics workshop. And I prototype experiments there, then I try and then
*  I try and suggest to my team sometimes maybe we can try this thing. And they will just say, Oh,
*  wow, that's not going to work because of this. And I'll say, Oh, but actually, I've tried and
*  here's some code and here's some hardware. Can we have a go? So that I'm doing that less and less
*  now as I get even more busy. But that's quite fun. Because then they feel that we're in the,
*  you know, in the experiment together. You do in fact, brilliantly, just like Rick from Rick and
*  Morty, connects chemistry with computation. So sort of. And when we say chemistry, we don't mean
*  the simulation of chemistry, of modeling of chemistry, we mean chemistry in the physical
*  space, as well as in the digital space, which is fascinating. We'll talk about that. But first,
*  you mentioned assembly theory. So we'll stick on theory in these big ideas, I would say,
*  revolutionary ideas. That's the intersection between mathematics and philosophy. What is
*  assembly theory? And generally speaking, how would we recognize life if we saw it?
*  So assembly theory is a theory goes back a few years now, my struggle for maybe almost 10 years,
*  when I was going to origin of life conferences and artificial life conferences, where I thought that
*  everybody was dancing around the problem of what life is and what it does. But I'll tell you about
*  what assembly theory is, because I think it's easier. So assembly theory literally says, if you
*  take an object, any given object, and you are able to break the object into parts very gently, so just
*  maybe let's say take a piece of very intricate Chinese porcelain, and you tap it just with a
*  hammer or the nail at some point, and it will fragment into many parts. And if that object is
*  able to fragment into many and you count those parts, the different parts, so they're unsymmetrical,
*  assembly theory says, the larger the number of parts, unsymmetrical parts that object has,
*  the more likely it is that object has been created by an evolutionary or information process,
*  especially if that object is not one off, you've got an abundance of them. And that's really
*  important. And I so because if you what I'm literally saying about the abundance, if you
*  have a one off object, and you break it into parts, and it has lots of lots of parts, you'd say, well,
*  that's, that could be incredibly intricate and complex, but it could be just random.
*  And I was troubled with this for years, because I saw in reality that assembly theory works,
*  but when I talked to very good computational complexity, computation lists, algorithmic
*  complexity people, they said, you haven't really done this properly, haven't thought about it.
*  It's like, this is the random problem. And so I kept working this up because I invented
*  an assembly theory in chemistry, first of all, with molecules. And so the thought experiment was,
*  how complex does a molecule need to be? When I find it that it couldn't possibly have risen
*  by chance probabilistically. And if I found this molecule able to detect enough quantities
*  in the same object, like a machine, like a mass spectrometer. So typically, in a mass spectrometer,
*  you you weigh the molecules electric field, you probably have to have all the order of 10,000
*  identical molecules to get a signal. So 10,000 identical molecules that are complex, was the
*  chance of them occurring by chance? Well, we can do the math, let's take a molecule like strickening,
*  or, or, yeah, so strickening is a good molecule actually to take, or Viagra is a good molecule.
*  I made jokes about Viagra because it's complex molecule. And one of my friends said, yeah,
*  if we find Viagra on Mars in detectable quantities, we know something is up.
*  Yeah. But anyway, it's a complex molecule. So what you do is you take this molecule in the
*  mass spectrometer, and you hit it with some electrons or in electric field, and it breaks
*  apart. And if the larger than the larger than number of different parts, you know,
*  when it starts to get to a threshold, my idea was that that molecule could not be created by chance,
*  probabilistically. So that was where assembly thought theory was born in an experiment in a
*  mass spec experiment. And I was thinking about this, because NASA sending mass spectrometers to Mars,
*  to Titan, is going to send them to Europa, there's going to be a nuclear powered mass spectrometer
*  going to Titan. I mean, this is the coolest experiment ever. They're not only sending a drone
*  that's going to fly around Titan, it's going to be powered by a nuclear slug, a nuclear battery,
*  and it's going to have a mass spectrometer on it. Is this already launched? No, it's Dragonfly,
*  and it's going to be launched in a few years. I think it got pushed a year because of the pandemic.
*  So I think three or four years. Dragonfly. Nuclear Dragonfly is going to fly to Titan
*  and collect data about the composition of the various chemicals on Titan.
*  Yeah, I'm trying to convince NASA, I don't know if I'll be able to convince the Dragonfly team
*  that they should apply this approach, but they will get data and depending on how good their
*  mass spectrometer is. But I had this thought experiment anyway, I did this thought experiment,
*  and for me it seemed to work. I turned the thought experiment into an algorithm,
*  into an algorithm in assembly theory. And I basically, assembly theory, if I take,
*  let's just make it generic and let's just take the word abracadabra. So if you have a book with
*  lots of words in it and you find abracadabra one-off and there's a rat book that's been written by,
*  in a random way, a set of monkeys in a room and you un-typewriters and you find one-off
*  abracadabra, no big deal. But if you find lots of recurrences of abracadabra, well, that means
*  something weird is going on. But let's think about the assembly number of abracadabra.
*  So abracadabra has a number of letters in it, you can break it down, so you just cut the letters up.
*  But when you actually reassemble abracadabra, the minimum number of weights of organizing those
*  letters, so you have an A, a B, and keep going up, there's just, when you cut abracadabra up into
*  parts, you can put it together again in seven steps. So what does that mean? That means if you
*  basically don't re-, you're allowed to reuse things you make in a chain at the beginning,
*  that's the memory of the universe, the process that makes abracadabra. And because of that
*  causal chain, you can then get to abracadabra quicker than the number of letters for having
*  to specify only in seven. So if you take that to a molecule and you cut the molecule up into parts,
*  and you can, on the causal chain, and you basically start with the atoms and then bonds,
*  and then you randomly add on those parts to make the A, make the B, make the, and keep going all
*  the way up, I found that literally assembly theory allows me to say how compressed a molecule is.
*  So when there's some information in there. And I realized assembly theory isn't just confined to
*  molecular space, it can apply to anything, but let me finish the molecular argument. So what I did is
*  I had this theory with one of my students, we wrote an algorithm. We basically took the
*  20 million molecules from the database and we just calculated their assembly number,
*  and that's the index. Basically, if I take a molecule and I cut it up into bonds,
*  what is the minimum number of steps I need to take to reform that molecule from atoms?
*  So reusability of previously formed things is somehow fundamental to the part of the box.
*  Exactly. So it's like a memory in the universe. I'm making lots of leaps here. It's kind of weird.
*  I'm saying there's a process that can form the A and the B and the C, let's say, and then because
*  we've formed A and B before, we can use A and B again with no extra cost except one unit. So that's
*  the kind of the chain of events. And that's how you think about memory here when you say the universe,
*  when you talk about the universe or life is the universe creating memory.
*  Exactly. So we went through chemical space and we looked at the assembly numbers and we were
*  able to classify it. We said, okay, let's test it. Let's go. So we're able to take a whole bunch of
*  molecules and assign an assembly index to them. And it's just a function of the number of bonds
*  in the molecule and how much symmetry. So literally, assembly theory is a measure of how
*  little symmetry a molecule has. So the more asymmetry, the more information, the more weird
*  it is, like a Jackson Pollock or some description. So I then went and did a lot of experiments.
*  And I basically took those molecules, I cut them up in the mass spec and measured the number of
*  peaks without any knowledge of the molecule. And we found the assembly number, there was almost
*  not quite a one-to-one correlation, but almost because not all bonds are equal. They have
*  different energies. I then did this using two other spectroscopic techniques, NMR,
*  nuclear magnetic resonance, which uses radio frequency to basically jangle the molecules and
*  get a signature out. And they also used infrared. And infrared and NMR almost gave us a one-to-one
*  correlation. So what am I saying? I'm saying by taking a molecule and doing either infrared or
*  NMR or mass spec, I can work out how many parts there are in that molecule and then put it on a
*  scale. And what we did in the next part of the work is we took molecules randomly from the
*  environment, from outer space, from all around earth, from the sea, from Antarctica,
*  and from fossils and so on. And even NASA, because they didn't believe us, blinded some samples.
*  And we found that all these samples that came from biology produced molecules that had a very
*  high assembly number, above a threshold of about 15. So basically all the stuff that came from an
*  ebiotic origin was low. There was no complexity there. So we suddenly realized that on earth,
*  at least, there is a cutoff that natural phenomena cannot produce molecules that need more than 15
*  steps to make them. So I realized that this is a way to make a scale of life, a scale of technology
*  as well. And literally, you could just go sniffing for molecules off earth, on Titan, on Mars. And
*  when you find a molecule in the mass spectrometer that gives you more than 15 parts, you'll know
*  pretty much for sure that it had to be produced by evolution. And this allowed me to come up with a
*  general definition of life based on assembly theory to say that if I find an object that has a
*  large number of parts, say an iPhone or Boeing 747 or any complex object, and I can find it in
*  abundance and cut it up, I can tell you whether that has been produced by an informational process
*  or not. And that's what assembly theory kind of does. But it goes a bit further. I then realized
*  that this isn't just about life, it's about causation. So actually, it tells you about whether
*  there's a causal structure. So now I can look at objects in the universe, say that again, this cup
*  and say, right, I'm going to look at how many independent parts it has. So that's the assembly
*  number. I'll then look at the abundance, how many cups? There are two on this table, maybe there's
*  a few more, you got snatched away. So assembly is a function of the complexity of the object
*  times the number of copy numbers of that object or a function of the copy number normalized. So I
*  realized there's a new quantity in the universe. You have energy, entropy, and assembly.
*  So assembly, the way we should think about that is how much reusability there is. Because
*  reusability is like the, like, can you play devil's advocate to this? So like, could this just be a nice
*  tertiary signal for living organisms? Like some kind of distant signal that's,
*  yeah, this is a nice property, but it's not capturing something fundamental? Or do you think
*  reusability is something fundamental to life and complex organisms? I think reusability is
*  fundamental in the universe, not just for life and complex organisms, it's about causation.
*  So I think assembly tells you, if you find objects, because you can do this with trajectories as well,
*  you think about it, that in the unit, the fact there are objects in the universe on earth,
*  is weird. You think about it, we should just have a comment or explosion of stuff.
*  The fact that not everything exists is really weird. Now then,
*  as I'm looking at two mugs and two water bottles, and the things that exist are kind of,
*  are similar and multiply in copies of each other.
*  So I would say that assembly allows you to do something that statistical mechanics,
*  people looking at entropy have got stuck with for a while. So I'm making it pretty bold. I mean,
*  I'm writing a paper with Sarah Walker on this at the moment. And we're realizing we don't want to
*  get ahead of ourselves, because I think that there's lots of ways where this is, you know,
*  it's a really interesting idea. It works for molecules. And it appears to work for any
*  objects produced by causation. Because you can take a motor car, you can look at the assembly
*  of the motor car, look at a book, look at the assembly of the book. Assembly theory tells you
*  there's a way of compressing and reusing. And so when people I talk to information theorists,
*  they say, oh, this is just logical depth. I say it is like logical depth, but it's experimentally
*  measurable. They say, oh, it's a bit like Komagolorov complexity. I say, but it's computable.
*  And now, okay, it's not infinitely computable, gets MP hard very quickly, right? It's very hard
*  problem when you could get but it's a computable enough, you could tractable enough to be able to
*  tell the difference between a molecule that's been formed by the random background and by
*  causation. And, and I think that that's really interesting, because until now, there's no way
*  of measuring complexity objectively. Complexity has required algorithmic comparisons and programs,
*  and human beings to label things. Assembly is label free. Well, not entirely, we can talk about
*  what that means in a minute. Okay, my brain has been broken a couple times here. I'm sorry,
*  I explained it really badly. No, it was very well explained. It was just fascinating. And
*  my brain is broken into pieces, and I'm trying to assemble it. So MP hard. So when you have a
*  molecule, you're trying to figure out, okay, if we were to reuse parts of this molecule,
*  which parts can we reuse to as an optimization problem and be hard to figure out the minimum
*  amount of reused components that will create this molecule. And it becomes difficult when you start
*  to look at a huge, huge molecules arbitrarily large. Because I'm also like mapping this,
*  can I think about this in complexity generally, like looking at a cellular automata system and
*  saying like, what's the what can this be used as a measure of complexity for like, arbitrarily
*  complicated system? Yeah, I think it can. It can. And I think that the question is, and what's the
*  benefit because there's plenty of I mean, in computer science and mathematics and physics,
*  people have been really seriously studying complexity for a long time. And I think there's
*  really interesting problems of where we course grade, and we lose information.
*  And all assembly theory does really assembly theory just explains weak emergence. And so what
*  assembly theory says, look, going from the atoms, into atoms that interact, those first replicators
*  that build one another, assembly at the the minimal level just tells you evidence that
*  there's been replication and selection. And I think the more selected something is the higher
*  the assembly. And so we were able to start to know how to look for selection in the universe.
*  If you go to the moon, there's nothing a very high assembly on the moon, it's up to human
*  artifacts we've left there. So again, let's go back to the sandbox. In assembly theory says,
*  if all the sand grains could stick together, that's the infinite combinatorial explosion
*  in the universe, that should be the default. We don't have that. Now let's assemble sand grains
*  together and do them in every possible way. So we have a series of minimal operations that can move
*  the sand together. But all that doesn't exist either. Now, because we have specific memory,
*  we say what we're going to put three sand grains in line or four make a cross or a triangle,
*  or something unsymmetrical. And once we've made the triangle and the unsymmetrical thing,
*  we remember that we can use it again, because on that causal chain. So what assembly theory allows
*  you to do is go to the actual object that you exist, you find in space. And actually the way
*  you get there is by disassembling it. So disassembly theory works by disassembling objects you have,
*  and understanding the steps to create them. And it works for molecules beautifully,
*  because you just break bonds. But like you said, it's going to be hard, very difficult.
*  It's a difficult problem to figure out how to break them apart. For molecules, it's easy. If
*  you just keep low enough in molecular weight space, it's good enough. So it's a complete theory.
*  When we start to think about objects, we can start to think about things at different levels,
*  different atoms. What you assign as your atom. So in a molecule, the atom, this is really confusing
*  because the word atom, I mean smallest breakable part. So in a molecule, the atom is the bond,
*  because you break bonds, not atoms. So in a car, the atom might be, I don't know, a small amount
*  of iron or the smallest reusable part, a rivet, a piece of plastic or something. So you've got to
*  be really careful. In a microprocessor, the atoms might be transistors. And so the amount of assembly
*  is something as is a function. You have to look at the atom level. What are your parts? What are
*  you counting? That's one of the things you get to choose. What is at what scale is the atom? What
*  is the minimal thing? I mean, there's a huge amount of trade-offs in when you approach a system
*  and try to analyze. Like if you approach earth, you know, an alien civilization, try to study earth.
*  What is the atom for trying to measure the complexity of life? Is it, are humans the atoms?
*  I would say to start with, you just use molecules. I can say for sure, if there are molecules of
*  sufficient complexity on earth, then I know that life has made them. And then go further and show
*  technology. There are molecules that exist on earth that are not possible even by biology.
*  You need a technology and you need to microprocessors to get there. So that's really cool.
*  And there's a correlation between that, between the coolness of that and assembly number,
*  whatever the measure was, what would you call the measure?
*  Assembly index. Yes, there are three kind of fundamental kind of labels we have. So there's
*  the quantity of assembly and the assembly. So if you have a box, let's just have a box of molecules.
*  So I'm going to have my box. We count the number of identical molecules and then we chop each molecule
*  up in an individual molecule class and calculate the assembly number. So basically you then have
*  a function that sums over all the molecules for each assembly and then you divide through. So you
*  make it, divide through by the number of molecules. So that's the assembly index for the box?
*  So that will tell you the amount of assembly in the box. So basically the assembly equation
*  we've come up with is like basically the sum of e to the power of the assembly index for molecule i
*  times the number of copies of the molecule i and then you normalize. So you sum them all up and
*  then normalize. So some boxes are going to be more assembled than others. Yeah, that's what they tell
*  me. So if you were to look at me as a box, so say I'm a box, am I a sum of my parts? In terms of
*  how do you know what's my assembly index? So let's just, we'll talk about the molecules in you. So
*  let's just take a pile of sand the same way as you and I would take you and just cut up all the
*  molecules. I mean and look at the number of copies and assembly number. So in sand let's say there's
*  probably going to be nothing more than an assembly number of two or three but there might be trillions
*  and trillions of sand grains in your body. There might be the assembly number is going to be higher
*  but there might not be as quite as many copies because the molecular weight is higher. So you
*  do want to average it out? You can average, you do average it. I'm not defined by the most impressive
*  molecules. No, no you're an average in your volume. Well I mean we're just working this out but what's
*  really cool is that you're going to have a really high assembly. The sand will have a very low
*  assembly. Your causal power is much higher. You get to make decisions, you're alive, you're aspiring.
*  Assembly says something about causal power in the universe and that's not supposed to exist
*  because physicists don't accept that causation exists at the bottom. So I understand at the
*  chemical level why the assembly is causation. Why is it causation? Because it's capturing the memory.
*  Exactly. Capturing memory but there's not an action to it. So I'm trying to see
*  how it leads to life. Well it's what life does. So I think it's, we don't know.
*  So yeah that's a good question. What is life versus what does life do? Yeah so that's, this is the
*  definition of life. The only definition we need. The assembly. Is basically that life is able to
*  create objects in abundance that are so complex. The assembly number is so high they can't possibly
*  form in an environment where there's just random interactions. So suddenly you can put life on a
*  scale and then life doesn't exist actually in that sense. It's just how evolved you are.
*  And you as an object, because you have incredible causal power, you could go and, you can go and,
*  you know, launch rockets or build cars or create drugs or, you know, you can do so many things.
*  You can build stuff, build more artifacts that show that you have had causal power and that
*  causal power was this kind of a lineage. And I think that over time, I've been realizing that
*  physics as a discipline has a number of problems associated with it. With me as a chemist it's kind
*  of interesting that assembly theory and I'm really, you know, I want to maintain some
*  credibility in the physicist's eyes, but I have to push them because physics is a really good
*  discipline. It's reduced the number. Physics is about reducing the belief system, but they're down
*  to some things in their belief system, which is kind of, really makes me kind of grumpy. Number one
*  is requiring order at the beginning universe magically. We don't need that. The second is the
*  second law. Well, we don't actually need that. And I-
*  This is blasphemous.
*  In a minute, I'll recover my career in a second. Although I think the only good thing about being
*  the Regis chair means I think there has to be an act of parliament to fire me.
*  Yeah. You can always go to Lee's Twitter and protest.
*  And I think the third thing is that, so we've got, you know, we've got the order at the beginning.
*  Second law.
*  Yeah, the second law. And the fact that causation is emergent,
*  right? And that time is emergent.
*  John Carroll just turned off this program. I think he believes that it's emergent. So
*  it's a causation is not-
*  That's clearly incorrect because we wouldn't exist otherwise. So physicists have kind of got
*  confused about time. Time is a real thing. Well, I mean, so look,
*  I'm very happy with the current description of the universe as physics gives me because I can do
*  a lot of stuff, right? I can go to the moon with Newtonian physics, I think, and I can understand
*  the orbit of Mercury with relativity. And so, and I can build transistors with quantum mechanics,
*  right? And I can do all this stuff. So I'm not saying the physics is wrong. I'm just saying,
*  if we say that time is fundamental, i.e. time is non-negotiable, there's a global clock,
*  I don't need to require that there's order been magically made in the past,
*  because that asymmetry is built into the way the universe is.
*  So if time is fundamental, I mean, you've been referring to this kind of
*  an interesting formulation of that is memory. Yeah.
*  So time is hard to like put a finger on like what the hell are we talking about?
*  Well-
*  Memory is a construction, especially when you have like, think about these local pockets of
*  complexity, these non-zero assembly index entities that's being constructed and they remember.
*  Never forget molecules.
*  But remember, the thing is, I invented assembly theory. I'll tell you I invented it. When I was
*  a kid, I mean, the thing is, I keep making fun of myself from research group. I've only ever had
*  one idea. I keep exploring that idea over the 40 years or so since I had that idea.
*  I used to- Well, aren't you the idea that the universe had? So it's very kind of hierarchical.
*  Anyway, go ahead. I'm sorry.
*  That's very poetic.
*  Yeah.
*  So I think I came up with assembly theory with the following idea when I was a kid.
*  I was obsessed about survival kits. What is the minimum stuff I would need to basically replicate
*  stuff? I would need to basically replicate my reality. I love computers and I love technology
*  or what technology is going to become. So I imagined that I would have basically this really
*  big truck full of stuff. I thought, well, can I delete some of that stuff out? Can I have a
*  blueprint? In the end, I kept making it smaller and got to maybe half a truck and then to a
*  suitcase. Then I went, okay, well, screw it. I want to carry my entire technology in my pocket.
*  How do I do it? I'm not going to launch into Steve Jobby and I play. I came up with a
*  matchbox survival kit. In that matchbox survival kit, I would have the minimum stuff that would
*  allow me to interact the environment to build my shelter, to build a fishing rod, to build
*  a water purification system. It's kind of like, so what did I use in my box to assemble in the
*  environment, to assemble, to assemble, to assemble? I realized I could make a causal chain in my
*  survival kit. So I guess that's probably why I've been obsessed with assembly theory for so long.
*  And I was just pre-configured to find it somewhere. And when I saw it in molecules, I realized that
*  the causal structure that we say emerges and the physics kind of gets really stuck because they're
*  saying that time, you can go backwards in time. I mean, how do we let physicists get away with
*  the notion that we can go back in time and meet ourselves? I mean, that's clearly a very
*  hard thing to let. The physicists would not let other sciences get away with that kind of heresy.
*  Right? So why are physicists allowed to get away with it?
*  Let's- So first of all, to push back to play devil's advocate, you are clearly married to
*  the idea of memory. You see in this, again, Rick from Rick and Morty way, you see you have these
*  deep dreams of the universe that is writing the story through its memories, through its chemical
*  compounds that are just building at top of each other. And then they find useful components they
*  can reuse. And then their reused components create systems that themselves are then reused
*  and all in this way construct things. But when you think of that as memory, it seems like
*  quite sad that you can walk that back. But at the same time, it feels like that memory,
*  you can walk in both directions on that memory in terms of time.
*  You could walk in both directions, but I don't think that that makes any sense because
*  the problem that I have with time being reversible is that, I mean, I'm just a,
*  I'm a dumb experimental chemist, right? So I love burning stuff, burning stuff and building stuff.
*  But when I think of reversible phenomena, I imagine in my head, I have to actually
*  manufacture some time. I have to borrow time from the universe to do that. I can't,
*  when anyone says, let's imagine that we can go back in time or reversibility,
*  you can't do that. You can't step out of time. Time is non-negotiable. It's happening.
*  No, but see, you're assuming that time is fundamental, which most of us do when we go
*  day to day, but it takes a leap of wild imagination to think that time is emergent.
*  No, time is not emergent. Yeah. I mean, this is an argument we can have, but I believe
*  I can come up with an experiment. An experiment that proves that time cannot possibly be emergent.
*  An experiment that shows how assembly theory kind of is the way that the universe produces
*  selection and that selection gives rise to life. And also to say, well, hang on, we could allow
*  ourselves to have a theory that requires us to have these statements to be possible. Like we need
*  to have order in the past, or we can have used the past hypothesis, which is order in the past,
*  but as well. Okay. And we have to have an arrow of time. We have to require that entropy
*  increases. And then we can say, look, the universe is completely closed and there's no novelty,
*  or that novelty is predetermined. What I'm saying is very, very important that time is fundamental,
*  which means if you think about it, the universe becomes more and more novel each step, it generates
*  this more states and next step than it was before. So that means bigger search. So what I'm saying is
*  that the universe wasn't capable of consciousness at day one, actually, because it didn't have enough
*  states. But today the universe is, so it's like how- All right, all right, hold on a second.
*  Now we've pissed off the panpsychist too. Okay. No, this is brilliant. Sorry.
*  Part of me is just joking, having fun with this thing, but because you're saying a lot of
*  brilliant stuff and I'm trying to slow it down before my brain explodes. So because I want to
*  break apart some of the fascinating things you're saying. So novelty, novelty is increasing in the
*  universe because the number of states is increasing. What do you mean by states?
*  So I think the physicists almost got everything right. I can't fault them at all. I just think
*  there's a little bit of dogma. I'm just trying to play devil's advocate. I'm very happy to be
*  entirely wrong on this. I'm not right on many things at all. But if I can make less assumptions
*  about the universe with this, then potentially that's a more powerful way of looking at things.
*  If you think of time as fundamental, you can make less assumptions overall.
*  Exactly. If time is fundamental, I don't need to add on a magical second law
*  because the second law comes out of the fact the universe is actually, there's more states available.
*  I mean, we might even be able to do weird things like dark energy in the universe,
*  might actually just be time. Right? Yeah. But then you still have to explain why time is
*  fundamental because I can give you one explanation that's simpler than time. Say God, you know,
*  like just because it's simple doesn't mean it's, but okay. You still have to explain God and you
*  still have to explain time. Like why is it fundamental? So let's just say existence is
*  default, which means time is the default. So how did you go from the existence to the
*  default? Well, look, we exist, right? So let's just be very-
*  We're yet to talk about what exists means. All right. Let's go all the way back. Yeah. Okay.
*  I think it's very poetic and beautiful what you're weaving into this. I don't think this
*  conversation is even about the assembly, which is fascinating. And we'll keep mentioning it
*  as something index and this idea that I don't think is necessarily connected to time.
*  Oh, I think it is deeply connected. I can't explain it yet.
*  You don't think everything you've said about assembly theory and assembly index can still
*  be correct even if time is emergent? So yeah, right now assembly theory appears to work.
*  I appear to be able to measure objects of high assembly in a mass spectrometer and look at their
*  abundance and you know, all that's fine, right? It's a nice, if nothing else, it's a nice way
*  of looking at how molecules can compress things. Now, am I saying that a time has to be fundamental
*  not emergent for assembly theory to work? No. I think I'm saying that the universe,
*  it appears that the universe has many different ways of using time. You could have three different
*  types of time. You could just have time that's- the way I would think of it, if you want to hold on
*  to emergent time, I think that's fine. Let's do that for a second. Hold on to emergent time
*  and the universe is just doing its thing. Then assembly time only exists when the universe starts
*  to write memories through bonds. So let's just say there's rocks running around, you know, there's
*  when the bond happens and selection starts, suddenly there are- the universe is remembering
*  cause and in the past and those structures will have effects in the future. So suddenly a new
*  type of time emerges at that point, which has a direction. And I think Sean Carroll at this point
*  might even turn the podcast back on and go, okay, I can deal with that. That's fine. But I'm just
*  basically trying to condense the conversation and say, hey, let's just have time fundamental and see
*  how that screws with people's minds. Why- You're triggering people by saying fundamental.
*  Why not? We just say like, let's say- Why am I- look, I'm walking through the wall. Why
*  should I grow up in a world where time- I don't go back in time. I don't meet myself in the past.
*  There are no aliens coming from the future, right? But-
*  You know, it's just like- No, no, no, but that's not- no, no, no, no,
*  that's like saying we're talking about biology or like evolutionary psychology and you saying,
*  okay, let's just assume that clothing is fundamental. People wearing clothes is
*  fundamental. It's like, no, no, no, no, wait a minute. You can't like, I think you're going
*  to get in a lot of trouble if you assume time is fundamental. Why? Give me one reason why I'm
*  getting into trouble time being fundamental. Because you might not understand the origins
*  of this memory that might be deeper. Like that this memory, that could be a thing that's explaining
*  the construction of these higher complexities better than just saying it's a search. It's
*  chemicals doing a search for reusable structures that they can then use as bricks to build a house.
*  Okay, so I accept that. So let's go back a second because it's a kind of- I wanted to drop the time
*  bomb at this part because I think we can carry on discussing it for many, many, many, many, many,
*  many days, many months. But I'm happy to accept that it might be wrong. But what I would like to
*  do is imagine a universe where time is fundamental and time is emergent and ask, let's just then talk
*  about causation. Because physicists require that causation- so this is where I'm going to go.
*  Causation emerges and it doesn't exist at the micro scale. Well, that clearly is wrong. Because
*  if causation has to emerge at the macro scale, life cannot emerge. So how does life emerge?
*  Life requires molecules to bump into each other, produce replicators. Those replicators need to
*  produce polymers. There needs to be cause and effect at the molecular level. There needs to be
*  non-agordic to an agordic transition at some point. And those replicators have consequence,
*  material consequence in the universe. Physicists just say, oh, you know what? I'm going to have
*  a bunch of particles in a box. I'm going to think about it in a Newtonian way, in a quantum way,
*  and I'll add on an arrow of time so I can label things and causation will happen magically later.
*  Well, how? Explain causation. And they can't. The only way I can reconcile causation
*  is having a fundamental time because this allows me to have a deterministic universe
*  that creates novelty. And there's so many things to unpack here. But let's go back to the point.
*  You said, can assembly theory work with emergent time? Sure, it can, but it doesn't give me a deep
*  satisfaction about how causation and assembly gives rise to these objects that move through time
*  and space. And again, what am I saying to bring it back? I can say without fear, take this water
*  bottle and look at this water bottle and look at the features on it. There's writing. You've got a
*  load of them. I know that causal structures gave rise to this. In fact, I'm not looking at just one
*  water bottle here. I'm looking at every water bottle that's ever been conceived of by humanity.
*  This here is a special object. In fact, Leibniz knew this. Leibniz, who was at the same time
*  with Newton, he kind of got stuck. I think Leibniz actually invented assembly theory.
*  The soul that you see in objects wasn't the mystical soul. It is assembly. It is a fact
*  there's been a history of objects related. And without the object in the past, this object
*  wouldn't exist. There is a lineage and there is conserved structures, causal structures that have
*  given rise to those. Fair enough. And you're saying it's just a simpler view if time is
*  fundamental. And it shakes the physicist's cage a bit, right? But I think that...
*  I just enjoy the fact that physicists are in cages. I would say that, you know,
*  Lee Smolin, I don't want to speak for Lee. I'm talking to Lee about this. I think Lee also is
*  in agreement that time has to be fundamental. But I think he goes further. You know, even in space,
*  I don't think you can go back to the same place in space. I've been to Austin a few times now.
*  This is my, I think, third time I've been to Austin. Is Austin in the same place? No.
*  The solar system is moving through space. I'm not back in the same space. Locally, I am.
*  Every event in the universe is unique. In space. And time. And time.
*  Doesn't mean we can't go back, though. I mean, let's just rest this conversation,
*  which was beautiful, with a quote from the Rolling Stones that you can't always get what you want,
*  which is you want time to be fundamental. But if you try, you'll get what you need,
*  which is assembly theory. Okay. Let me ask you about, continue talking about complexity,
*  and to clarify it with this beautiful theory of yours that you're developing, and I'm sure
*  we'll continue developing both in the lab and in theory. Yeah, it can't be said enough. Just
*  the ideas you're playing with in your head are just, and we've been talking about it,
*  just beautiful. So if we talk about complexity a little bit more generally,
*  maybe in an admiring, romantic way, how does complexity emerge from simple rules?
*  The why, the how. Okay, the nice algorithm of assembly is there.
*  I would say that the problem I have right now is, I mean, you're right, we can, about time as well.
*  The problem is I have this hammer called assembly, and everything I see is a nail.
*  So now let's just apply it to all sorts of things. We take the Bernard instability. The Bernard
*  instability is you have oil, you heat up oil, let's say on a frying pan. When you get convection,
*  you get honeycomb patterns. Take the formation of snowflakes, right? Take the emergence of a
*  tropical storm or the storm on Jupiter. When people say, let's talk about complexity in general,
*  what they're saying is, let's take this collection of objects that are correlated in some way,
*  and try and work out how many moving parts there are, how this got, how this exists.
*  So what people have been doing for a very long time is taking complexity and counting what
*  they've lost, calculating the entropy. And the reason why I'm pushing very hard on assembly
*  is entropy tells you how much you've lost. It doesn't tell you the microstates are gone.
*  But if you embrace the bottom up with assembly, those states, and you then understand the cause
*  or chain that gives rise to the emergence. So what I think assembly will help us do is understand
*  weak emergence, at the very least, and maybe allow us to crack open complexity in a new way.
*  And I've been fascinated with complexity theory for many years. I mean, as soon as I could,
*  I learned of the Mandelbrot set, and I could just type it up in my computer and run it,
*  and just show it and see it kind of unfold. It was just this kind of mathematical reality that
*  existed in front of me I just found incredible. But then I realized that actually, we were cheating.
*  We're putting in the boundary conditions all the time. We're putting in information.
*  And so when people talk to me about the complexity of things, I say, but relative what? How do you
*  measure them? So my attempt, my small attempt, naïve attempt, because there's many greater minds
*  than mine on the planet right now thinking about this properly, and you've had some of them on the
*  podcast, right? They're just absolutely fantastic. But I'm wondering if we might be able to reformat
*  the way we would explore algorithmic complexity using assembly. What's the minimum number of
*  constraints we need in our system for this to unfold? So whether it's like, you know,
*  if you take some particles and put them in a box, at a certain box size, you get quasi-crystallinity
*  coming out, right? But that emergence, it's not magic. It must come from the boundary conditions
*  you put in. So all I'm saying is a lot of the complexity that we see is a direct read of the
*  constraints we put in, but we just don't understand. So as I said earlier to the
*  poor origin of life chemists, you know, origin of life is a scam. I would say lots of complexity
*  calculation theories, a bit of a scam, because we put the constraints in, but we don't count them
*  correctly. And I'm wondering if- Oh, you're thinking in, sorry to drop, is assembly
*  theory, assembly index is a way to count the constraints? Yes, that's it. That's all it is.
*  So assembly theory doesn't lower any of the importance of complexity theory,
*  but it allows us to go across domains and start to compare things, compare the complexity of a
*  molecule, of a microprocessor, of the text you're writing, of the music you may compose.
*  You've tweeted, quote, assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood we had limited freedom
*  rather than radical freedom. So we've applied assembly theory to cellular automata in life
*  and chemistry. What does Nietzsche have to do with assembly theory? Oh, that gets me into free will
*  and everything. So let me say that again, assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood we had
*  limited freedom rather than radical freedom. Limited freedom, I suppose, is referring to the
*  fact that there's constraints or what is radical freedom? What is freedom? So Sartre was like,
*  believed in absolute freedom and that he could do whatever he wanted in his imagination. And
*  Nietzsche understood that his freedom was somewhat more limited. And it kind of takes me back to this
*  computer game that I played when I was 10. So I think it's called Dragon's Lair. Okay. Do you know
*  Dragon's Lair? I think I know Dragon's Lair. Dragon's Lair. I knew I was being conned, right?
*  Dragon's Lair. When you play the game, you're lucky that you grew up in a basically procedurally
*  generated worlds. That was RPG a little bit. No, it's like, is it turn-based play? Was it? No.
*  It was a role-playing game, but really good graphics and one of the first laser discs.
*  And when you actually flick the stick, you took, it's like it was like a graphical adventure game
*  with animation. And when I played this game, I really, you know, you could get through the
*  game in 12 minutes if you knew what you were doing, not making mistakes, just play the disc,
*  play the disc, play the disc. So it was just that timing. And actually it was a complete fraud
*  because all the animation has been prerecorded on the disc. It's like the Black Mirror, the
*  first interactive where they had all the, you know, several million kind of permutations of the movie
*  that you could select on Netflix. I've forgotten the name of it. So this was exactly that in the
*  laser disc. So you basically go left, go right, fight the ogre, slay the dragon. And when you
*  flick the joystick at the right time, it just goes to the next animation to play. It's not really
*  generating it. And I played that game and I knew I was being had. So, okay. I see. So to you,
*  Dragon Lair is the first time you realized that free will is an illusion.
*  Yeah. And why does assembly theory give you hints about free will, whether it's an illusion or
*  not? Yeah. So no, so not tightly. If I do think I have some will and I think I am an agent and I
*  think I can interact and I can play around with the model I have of the world and the cost functions,
*  right? And I can hack my own cost functions, which means I have a little bit of free will.
*  But as much as I want to do stuff in the universe, I don't think I could suddenly say,
*  I mean, actually this is ridiculous because now I say I could try and do it, right? It's like,
*  I'm suddenly give up everything and become a rapper tomorrow, right? Maybe I could try that,
*  but I don't have sufficient agency to make that necessarily happen. I'm on a trajectory.
*  So when in Dragon's Lair, I know that I have some trajectories that I can play with,
*  where Satra realized he thought that he had no assembly, no memory. He could just leap across
*  and do everything. And Nietzsche said, okay, I realize I don't have full freedom, but I have
*  some freedom. And assembly theory basically says that, it says, if you have these constraints in
*  your past, they limit what you were able to do in the future, but you can use them to do amazing
*  things. Let's say I'm a poppy plant and I'm creating some opiates. Opiates are really
*  interesting molecules. I mean, they're obviously great for medicine, cause great problems in
*  society. But let's imagine we fast forward a billion years, what will the opioids look like
*  in a billion years? Well, we can guess because we can see how those proteins will evolve and we can
*  see how the secondary metabolites will change. But they can't go radical. They can't suddenly
*  become, I don't know, like a molecule that you find in an OLED in a display. They will be limited
*  by the causal chain that produced them. And that's what I'm getting at, saying,
*  we are unpredictably predictable or predictably unpredictable within a constraint on the
*  trajectory we're on. Yeah. So the predictably part is the constraints of the trajectory.
*  And the unpredictable part is the part that you still haven't really clarified the origin of
*  the little bit of freedom. Yeah. So you're just arguing, you're basically saying that
*  radical freedom is impossible. You're really operating in a world of constraints that are
*  constrained by the memory of the trajectory of the chemistry that led to who you are. Okay. But
*  you know, even just a tiny bit of freedom, even if everything, if everywhere you are in cages,
*  if you can move around in that cage a little bit, you're free. I agree. And so the question is,
*  in assembly theory, if we're thinking about free will, where does the little bit of freedom come
*  from? What is the I they can decide to be a rapper? What, why? What is that? That's a cute little
*  trick we've convinced each other of so we can do fun tricks at parties, or is there something
*  fundamental that allows us to feel free to be free? I think that that's the question that I want to
*  answer. I know you want to answer it. And I think it's so profound. I'd let me have a go at it. I
*  would say that I don't take the stance of Sam Harris, because I think Sam Harris, when he said
*  the way he says it is almost, it's really interesting. I'd love to talk to him about
*  it. Sam Harris almost thinks himself out of existence, right? Because, do you know what I
*  mean? Yeah, well, I mean, he has different views on consciousness versus free will. I think he saves
*  himself with consciousness. He thinks himself out of existence with free will. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
*  So that mean there's no point, right? So I- He's a leaf floating on a river.
*  Yeah. I think that he's, I don't know, I'd love to ask him whether he really believes that,
*  and then we could play some games. Oh, yeah.
*  No, no, I then would say I'll get him to play a game of cards with me,
*  and I'll work out the conditions on which he says no, and then I'll get him to the conditions he
*  says yes, and then I'll trap him in his logical inconsistency with that argument. Because at some
*  point when he loses enough money, or the prospect of losing enough money, there's a way of basically
*  mapping out a series of- So what will is about, let's not call it free will, what will is about
*  is to have a series of decisions equally weighted in front of you, and those decisions aren't
*  necessarily energy minimization. Those decisions are a function of the model you've made in your
*  mind, you're in your simulation, and the way you've interacted in reality, and also other
*  interactions that you're having with other individuals, and happenstance. And I think that
*  you, there's a little bit of delay in time, so I think what you're able to do is say, well,
*  I'm going to do the counterfactual, I've done all of them, and I'm going to go this way.
*  And you probably don't know why, I think free will is actually a very complex interaction between
*  your unconscious and your conscious brain, and I think the reason why we're arguing about it
*  is so interesting, and we just, some people outsource their free will to their unconscious
*  brain, and some people try and overthink their free will in the conscious brain.
*  I would say that Sam Harris has realized his conscious brain doesn't have free will,
*  but his unconscious brain does. That's my guess, right?
*  And that he can't have access to the unconscious brain.
*  Yeah, and that's kind of annoying. And so he's just, he's going to, through meditation,
*  come to acceptance with that fact. Yeah.
*  Which is maybe okay, but I do think that I have the ability to make decisions, and I like my
*  decisions. In fact, I mean, this is an argument I have with some people that some days I feel
*  I have no free will and it's just an illusion, and this is one, and it makes me more radical,
*  if you like, you know, that I get to explore more of the state space, and I'm like, I'm going to
*  try and affect the world now. I'm really going to ask the question that maybe I dare not ask,
*  or do the thing I dare not do. And that allows me to kind of explore more.
*  It's funny that if you truly accept that there's no free will,
*  that is a kind of radical freedom. It's funny, but you're, because the little bit of the illusion
*  under that framework that you have that you can make choices, if choice is just an illusion of
*  psychology, you can do whatever the hell you want. That's the-
*  But we don't, do we? And I think-
*  But because you don't truly accept that you think that there's, like, you think there's a choice,
*  which is why you don't just do whatever the hell you want. Like, you feel like there's some
*  responsibility for making the wrong choice, which is why you don't do it. But if you truly accept
*  that the choice has already been made, then you can go, I don't know what is the most radical thing,
*  I mean, but I wonder what am I preventing myself from doing that I would really want to do?
*  Probably like humor stuff. Like, I would love to, if I could like save a game, do the thing,
*  and then reload it later, like do undo, it'd probably be humor, just to do something like
*  super hilarious. That's super embarrassing, and then just go, I mean, it's basically just fun.
*  I would add more fun to the world.
*  I mean, I sometimes do that. I sometimes, I try and mess up my reality in unusual ways by
*  just doing things because I'm bored, but not bored. I'm not expressing this very well. I think that
*  this is a really interesting problem that perhaps the hard sciences don't really understand that
*  they're responsible for because the question about how life emerged and how intelligence
*  emerges and consciousness and free will, they're all ultimately boiling down to some of the same
*  mechanics. I think my feeling is that they are the same problem again and again and again,
*  the transition from a boring world or a world in which there is no selection.
*  So I wonder if free will has something to do with selection and models and also the models
*  you're generating in the brain and also the amount of memory, your working memory,
*  have available at any one time to generate counterfactuals.
*  Oh, that's fascinating. So like the decision making process is a kind of selection.
*  That could be just another manifestation of the selection mechanism that's
*  pervasive throughout the universe. Okay. That's fascinating to think about.
*  There's not some kind of fundamental, its own thing or something like that,
*  that is just yet another example of selection.
*  Yeah. And in the universe that's intrinsically open, you want to do that because you generate
*  novelty. You mentioned something about, do cellular automata exist outside the human mind
*  in our little offline conversation? Why is that an interesting question? So cellular automata,
*  complexity, what's the relationship between complexity in the human mind and trees falling
*  in the forest? Infrastructure. So the CA, so when John von Neumann and Conway and Feynman
*  were doing CA's, they were doing it on paper. CA is cellular automata. Yeah. Just drawing them
*  on paper. How awesome is that, that they were doing cellular automata on paper? Yeah. And then
*  they were doing a computer that takes like forever to print out anything and program.
*  Sure. People are now with the TikTok kids these days with the TikTok,
*  don't understand how amazing it is to just play with cellular automata, arbitrarily changing
*  the rules as you want the initial conditions and see the beautiful patterns emerge, sing with
*  fractals, all of that. Oh, I've got a, you've just given me a brilliant idea. I wonder if there's a
*  TikTok account that's just dedicated to putting out CA rules and if it isn't, we should make one.
*  100%. And that will get- We'll get millions of views.
*  Millions. Yes. No, it'll get dozens.
*  Just have them running. So look, I kind of, CA, I love CA's.
*  Yeah, no. We just have to make one. I actually, a few years ago, I made some robots that talked
*  to each other, chemical robots that played the game of Hex, invented by John Nash,
*  by doing chemistry and they communicated by Twitter, which experiments they were doing.
*  They had a lookup table of experiments and robot one said, I'm doing experiment 10.
*  The other robot, okay, I'll do experiment one then.
*  And they communicated- Via Twitter.
*  Like publicly or DMs? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Oh, can you maybe quickly explain what the game of Hex is?
*  Yes, so it's basically a hexagonal board and you try and basically, you color each element on the
*  board at each hexagon and you try and get from one side to the other and the other one tries to block
*  you. Wait, how are they connected? So what are the robots?
*  It's a chemical- Yeah, let's go back. So the two robots.
*  Each robot was doing die chemistry. So making RGB, red, green, blue, red, green, blue, red,
*  green, blue. And they could just choose from experiments to do red, green, blue. Initially,
*  I said to my group, we need to make two chemical robots that play chess. And my group were like,
*  that's too hard. No, go away. But anyway, so we had the robot.
*  By the way, people listening to this should probably know that Lee Cronin is an amazing
*  group of brilliant people. He's exceptionally well-published. He's written a huge number of
*  amazing papers. Whenever he calls himself stupid and is a sign of humility, and I deeply respect
*  that and appreciate it. So people listening to this should know this is a world-class scientist
*  who doesn't take himself seriously, which I really appreciate and love. Anywho, talking about serious
*  science, we're back to your group rejecting your idea of chemical robots playing chess via dies.
*  So you went to a simpler game of hex. Okay. So what else?
*  The team that did it were brilliant. I think they still have PTSD from doing it because I said,
*  this is a workshop. What I'd often do is I have about 60 people on my team. And occasionally,
*  before lockdown, I would say, I'm a bit bored. We're going to have a workshop on something. Who
*  wants to come? And then basically about 20 people turn up to my office and I say, we're going to do
*  this mad thing. And then it would just self-organize and some of them would say, no, I'm not doing this.
*  And then you get left with the happy dozen. And what we did is we built this robot. And doing
*  die chemistry is really easy. You can just take two molecules, react them together and change color.
*  And what I wanted to do is have a palette of different molecules. You can react
*  commentorially and get different colors. So you've got two robots. I went, wouldn't it be cool
*  if the robots basically shared the same list of reactions to do? And they said, oh, and because
*  then you could do a kind of multi-core chemistry. Like they weren't, so you'd have two chemical
*  reactions going on at once and they could basically outsource the problem. But they're sharing the same
*  tape. Exactly. Okay. The robot one would say, I'm going to do, I'm going to do experiment one. And
*  the other robot says, I'll do experiment a hundred. And then they cross it off. But I wanted to make
*  it- That's brilliant by the way. That is genius. Well, I wanted to make it groovier. And I said,
*  look, let's have them competing to make, so they're playing a game of hex. And so when the robot does
*  an experiment and the more blue the dye, the more it gets the higher chance it gets to make the move
*  it wants on the hex board. So if it gets a red color, it gets down weighted in the other robot.
*  And so what the robots could do is they play each player move. And because the fitness function or
*  the optimization function was to make the color blue, they started to invent reactions. We didn't
*  weren't on the list. And they did this by not cleaning because we make cleaning optional. So
*  when one robot realized if it didn't clean its pipes, it could get blue more quickly. Yeah. And
*  the other robot realized that. So it was like getting dirty as well. And they-
*  I didn't tell you the consequences of super intelligence. Okay. But-
*  That was the game. And we- Communicating through Twitter though.
*  They were doing it through Twitter and Twitter banned them a couple of times. I said, come on,
*  you've got a couple of robots doing chemistry. It's really cool. Stop banning them. But in the
*  end, we had to take them off Twitter and they just communicated via a server. Because there were
*  people saying, you can still find it. Cronin lab one and Cronin lab two on Twitter. And it was like,
*  make move, wait, mix A and B, wait 10 seconds, answer blue. I really find it super compelling
*  that you would have a chemical entity that's communicating with the world. That was one of
*  the things I want to do in my origin of life reaction, right? Is basically have a reactor
*  that's basically just randomly enumerating through chemical space and have some kind of cycle.
*  And then read out what the molecule's reading out using a mass spectrometer
*  and then convert that to text and publish it on Twitter and then wait until it says I'm alive.
*  I reckon that Twitter account will get a lot of followers. And I'm still trying to convince
*  my group that we should just make an origin of life Twitter account. It's like, hello testing.
*  I'm here. Well, I'll share it. I like it. I particularly enjoy this idea
*  of a non-human entity communicating with the world via human design social network. It's quite a
*  beautiful idea. How we were talking about CAs existing outside the human mind.
*  I really admire Stephen Wolfram. I think he's a genius, clearly a genius. And trapped in is
*  actually is like a problem with being so smart is you get trapped in your own mind. And I tried to
*  convince Stephen that SEMRI theory wasn't nonsense. He was like, no, it's just nonsense.
*  I was a little bit sad by that. So nonsense applied even if it applied to the simplest construct of a
*  one dimensional cellular automata, for example. Yeah. Well, I mean, actually maybe I'm doing myself
*  a bit too down. It was just as a theory was coming through and I didn't really know how to explain it.
*  But we are going to use SEMRI theory in CAs instead of automata. But I wanted to,
*  what I was really curious about is why people marvel. I mean, you marvel at CAs and they're
*  complex. And I said, well, hang on that complexity is baked in because if you play the game of life
*  in a CA, you have to run it on a computer. You have to do a number of operations, put in the
*  boundary conditions. So is it surprising that you get this structure out? Is it manufactured
*  by the boundary conditions? And it is interesting because I think a cellular automata running them
*  is teaching me something about what real numbers are and aren't.
*  And I haven't quite got there yet. I was playing on the airplane coming over. I'm just realized,
*  I have no idea what real numbers are really. And I was like, well, I do actually have some notion
*  what real numbers are. And I think thinking about real numbers as functions, rather than
*  numbers is more appropriate. And then if you then apply that to CAs, then you're saying, well,
*  actually, why am I seeing this complexity in this rule? You've got this deterministic system,
*  and yet you get this incredible structure coming out. Well, isn't that what you'd get with any
*  real number as you apply it as a function? And you're trying to read it out to an arbitrary
*  precision? And I wonder if CAs are just helping me, my misunderstanding as CAs might be helping
*  me understand them in terms of real numbers. I don't know what you think.
*  Yeah, well, the function, but the devil's in the function. Which is the function that's generating
*  your real number. It seems like it's very important, the specific algorithm that function,
*  because some lead to something super trivial, some lead to something that's all chaotic,
*  and some lead to things that are just walk that fine line of complexity and structure.
*  I think we agree. So let's take it back a second. So take the logistic map or something,
*  logistic equation, where you have this equation, which is, you don't know what's going to happen
*  at m plus one, but once you've done m plus one, you know full time, you can't predict it.
*  For me, CAs and logistic equation feel similar. And I think what's incredibly interesting,
*  and I share your kind of wonder at running a CA, but also I'm saying, well, what is it about the
*  boundary conditions and the way I'm running that calculation? So in my group, with my team, we
*  actually made a chemical CA. We made game of life. We actually made a physical grid. I haven't been
*  out of publish this paper. It's been trapped in purgatory for a long time. But you wrote it up
*  as a paper, how to do a chemical formulation of the game of life. We made a chemical computer
*  and little cells. And I was playing game of life. With a BZ reactions, each cell would pulse on and
*  off, on and off, on and off. We have little stirrer bars and we have little gates. And we actually
*  played Conway's game of life in there. And we got structures in that game from the chemistry
*  that you wouldn't expect from the actual CA. So that was kind of cool in that-
*  Because they were interacting outside of the cell smell or-
*  So what's happening is you're getting noise. So the thing is that you've got this BZ reaction,
*  it gives on off, on off, on off, but there's also a wake and those wakes constructively interfere.
*  It's such a non-trivial way that's non-deterministic. And the non-determinism
*  in the system gives very rich dynamics. And I was wondering if I could physically make a chemical
*  computer with this CA that gives me something different that I can't get in a silicon
*  representation of a CA where all the states are clean. Because you don't have the noise
*  trailing into the next round. You just have the state.
*  So the paper in particular, so that's just a beautiful idea to use a chemical computer to
*  construct a cellular automaton, the famous one of game of life. But it's also interesting,
*  and it's a really interesting scientific question of whether some kind of random
*  perturbations or some source of randomness can have a significant constructive effect on the
*  complexity of the system. And indeed, I mean, whether it's random or just non-deterministic,
*  and can we bake in that non-determinism at the beginning? I'm trying to think about what is the
*  encoding space. The encoding space is pretty big. We have 49 sterots, 49 cells, 49 chem bits,
*  all connected to one another in like an analog computer, but being read out discreetly as the
*  BZ reaction. So just to say the BZ reaction is a chemical oscillator. And what happened in each
*  cell is it goes between red and blue. So two Russians discovered it, Belousov-Zaborskiski.
*  I think Belousov first proposed it, and everyone said, you're crazy, it breaks the second law.
*  And Zaborskiski said, no, it doesn't break the second law, it's consuming a fuel.
*  And so, and then, and it's like, there's a lot of chemistry hidden in the Russian literature,
*  actually, that just because the Russians just wrote it in Russian, they didn't publish it in
*  English-speaking journals. It's heartbreaking, actually. Well, it's, yeah, sad. And it's great
*  that it's there, right? It's not lost. I'm sure we will find a way of translating it properly.
*  The silver lining slash greater sadness of all of this is there's probably ideas in English-speaking,
*  like there's ideas in certain disciplines that, if discovered by other disciplines,
*  would crack open some of the biggest mysteries in those disciplines. Like computer science,
*  for example, is trying to solve problems like nobody else has ever tried to solve problems.
*  As if it's not already been all addressed in cognitive science and psychology and mathematics
*  and physics and just whatever you want to do, economics even. But if you look into that
*  literature, you might be able to discover some beautiful ideas. Obviously, Russian is
*  an interesting case of that, it's because there's a Lawson translation, but you said there's a source
*  of fuel, a source of energy. Yeah, yeah. So the BZ reaction, you have an acid in there called
*  melonic acid. And what happens is it's basically like a battery that powers it
*  and it loses CO2, so decarboxylates, it's just a chemical reaction. What that means we have to do
*  is continuously feed or we just keep the BZ reaction going in a long enough time so it's
*  like it's reversible in time. But only like, yeah.
*  But it's fascinating. I mean, the team that did it, I'm really proud of their persistence.
*  We made a chemical computer. It can solve little problems, it can solve traveling salesman problems
*  actually. But like I said, it's... So not any faster than a regular computer. Is there something
*  you could do? Maybe. I'm not sure. I think we can come up with a way of solving problems,
*  also really complex, hard ones, because it's an analog computer and it can energy minimize
*  really quickly. It doesn't have to basically go through every element in the matrix,
*  like flip it, it reads out. So we can actually do Monte Carlo by just shaking the box.
*  It's literally a box shaker. You don't actually have to encode the shaking of the box in silicon
*  memory and then just shuffle everything around. Yeah, and you can... It's analog, it's natural, so
*  it's an organic computer. Yeah, yeah. So I was playing around with this and I was kind of annoying
*  some of my colleagues and wondering if we could get to chemical supremacy, like quantum supremacy.
*  And I kind of calculated how big the grid has to be so we can actually start to solve problems
*  faster than a silicon computer. But I'm not willing to state how that is yet because I'm
*  probably wrong. It's not that it's any top secret thing. I think I can make a chemical computer that
*  can solve optimization problems faster than the silicon computer. That's fascinating. But then
*  you're unsure how big that has to be. Yeah, I think... It might be a big box, hard to shake.
*  It might be exactly a big box, hard to shake and basically a bit sloppy.
*  Did we answer the question about do cellular automata exist outside the mind?
*  We didn't, but I would posit that they don't. But I think minds can... Well...
*  So the mind is fundamental. What's the... Why?
*  Well, I mean... Sorry. Let's just go back. So as a physical phenomena, do CAs exist in physical
*  reality? I would say they probably don't exist outside the human mind, but now have constructed
*  them. They exist in computer memories. They exist in my lab. They exist on paper. So they
*  are... They emerge from the human mind. I'm just interested in... Because Stephen Wolfram likes
*  CAs. A lot of people like CAs and likes to think of them as minimal computational elements. I'm
*  just saying, well, do they exist in reality or are they a representation of a simple machine
*  that's just very elegant to implement? So it's a platonic question, I guess.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's... There's initial conditions. There's a memory in the system.
*  There are simple rules that dictate the evolution of the system. So what exists? The idea, the rules,
*  the... Yeah. People are using CAs as models for things in reality to say, hey, look, you can
*  do this thing in a CA. And when I see this, I'm saying, oh, that's cool. But what does that tell
*  me about reality? Where's the CA in space? Oh, I see. Right. It's a mathematical object.
*  So for people who don't know cellular automata, there's usually a grid, whether it's one-dimensional,
*  two-dimensional or three-dimensional. And it evolves by simple local rules. Like you die or are born
*  if the neighbors are alive or dead. And it turns out if you have...
*  With certain kinds of initial conditions and with certain kinds of very simple rules, you can
*  create arbitrarily complex and beautiful systems. And to me, whether drugs are involved or not,
*  I can sit back for hours and enjoy the mystery of it, how such complexity emerges. It gives me
*  almost like... People talk about religious experiences. It gives me a sense that you get to
*  have a glimpse at the origin of this whole thing. Whatever is creating this complexity from such
*  simplicity is the very thing that brought my mind to life. That's me, the human, our human civilization.
*  And yes, those constructs are pretty trivial. That's part of their magic is even in this trivial
*  framework, you could see the emergence, or especially in this trivial framework,
*  you could see the emergence of complexity from simplicity. I guess what Lee, you're saying is that
*  this is highly unlike systems we see in the physical world, even though they probably
*  carry some of the same magic mechanistically. I'm saying that the operating system that a CA
*  has to exist on is quite complex. And so I wonder if you're getting the complexity
*  out of the CA from the boundary conditions, the operating system, the underlying digital computer.
*  Those are some strong words against CAs then. I didn't realize...
*  Not against. I'm in love with CAs as well. I'm just saying they aren't as trivial as people think.
*  They are incredible. To get to that richness, you have to iterate billions of times and you need a
*  display and you need a math coprocessor and you need a von Neumann machine based on a Turing
*  machine with digital error correction and states. Wow. To think that for the simplicity of a grid,
*  you're basically saying a grid is not simple. Yeah.
*  It requires incredible complexity to bring a grid to life. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's what is simple. That's all I wanted to say. I agree with you with the wonder of CAs,
*  I just think. But remember, we take so much for granted what the CA is resting on.
*  Because von Neumann and Feynman weren't seeing these elaborate structures. They could not get that far.
*  Yeah, but that's the limitation of their mind. Yeah, exactly. The limitation of their pencil.
*  The question is whether the essential elements of the cellular automata
*  is present without all the complexities required to build a computer.
*  The reason I find it incredible is that my intuition is yes, it might look different.
*  There might not be a grid-like structure, but local interactions operating under simple rules
*  and resulting in multi-hierarchical complex structures feels like a thing that doesn't
*  require a computer. I agree. But coming back to von Neumann and Feynman and Wolfram,
*  their minds, the non-trivial minds, to create those architectures and do it and to put on those
*  state transitions. I think that's something that's really incredibly interesting, that
*  is understanding how the human mind builds those state transition machines.
*  I could see how deeply in love with the idea of memory you are. It's like how much of E equals
*  MC squared is more than an equation. It has Albert Einstein in it. You're saying you can't just say
*  the equations of physics are a really good simple capture of a physical phenomena.
*  That equation has the memory of the humans. Absolutely.
*  I don't know if you're implying this. That's a beautiful idea, but I don't know if I'm comfortable
*  with that diminishing the power of that equation. No, it enhances it.
*  I think it enhances it. That equation is a minimal compressed representation of reality.
*  We can use machine learning or Max Tegmark's AI Feynman to find lots of solutions for gravity,
*  but isn't it wonderful that the laws that we do find are the maximally compressed representations?
*  Yeah, but that representation, you can now give it as a gift. I guess the universe has the memory
*  of Einstein with that representation, but then you can now give it as a gift for free.
*  Einstein had to go through a lot of pain to get that bit of low memory. I say that physics and
*  chemistry and biology are the same discipline. They're just physics, laws in physics. There's
*  no such thing as a law in physics. It's just low memory stuff. Because you've got low memory
*  stuff, things reoccur quickly. As you build in more memory, you get to chemistry, so things become
*  more contingent. When you get to biology, more contingent still, and then technology.
*  So the more memory you need, the more your laws are local. That's all I'm saying. The less memory,
*  the more the laws are universal, because they're not laws. They are just low memory states.
*  We have to talk about a thing you've kind of mentioned already a bunch of times, but
*  doing computation through chemistry, chemical-based computation, I've seen you
*  refer to it as in a sexy title of chemputation. So what is chemputation and what is
*  chemical-based computation? Okay, so chemputation is a name I gave to the process of
*  building a state machine to make any molecule physically in the lab. As a chemist, chemists
*  make molecules by hand. Chemists have a lot of tacit knowledge, a lot of ambiguity. It's not
*  possible to go uniformly to the literature and read a recipe to make a molecule and then go and
*  make it in the lab every time. Some recipes are better than others, but they all assume some
*  knowledge. It's not universal what that is. So it's carried from human to human, some of that
*  implicit knowledge. You're saying, can we remove the human from the patient? Can we program?
*  By the way, what is a state machine? A state machine is, I suppose, an object, either abstract
*  or mechanical, where you can do a unit operation on it and flick it from one state to another.
*  So a turnstile would be a good example of a state machine. There's some kinds of states and some
*  transitions between states. It's very formal in nature in terms of how it's precise.
*  Yes. You can mathematically precisely describe a state machine. A very simple Boolean
*  gates are a very good way of building logic-based state machines. Obviously, a Turing machine,
*  the concept of a Turing machine where you have a tape and a read head and a series of rules in a
*  table. You would basically look at what's on the tape. If you're shifting the tape from left to
*  right and if you see a zero or one, you look in your lookup table and say, right, I've seen a zero
*  and a one. I then respond to that. So the turnstile would be, is there a human being pushing the
*  turnstile in the direction clockwise? If yes, I will open, let them go. If it's anti-clockwise,
*  no. So a state machine has some labels and a transition diagram.
*  You're looking to come up with a chemical computer to form state machines to create molecules?
*  What's the chicken and the egg?
*  So computation is not a chemical computer because we talked a few moments about
*  actually doing computations with chemicals. What I'm now saying is I want to use state
*  machines to transform chemicals. Build chemicals programmatically.
*  I get in trouble saying this. I said to my group, I shouldn't say it because I said,
*  look, we should make the crack bot. Is it in the crack robot? The robot that makes crack?
*  Oh, crack bot.
*  The robot that makes crack, but maybe we should scrub this from...
*  No, or maybe you can educate me on Breaking Bad with maths.
*  Yeah, so in Breaking Bad...
*  You want to make basically some kind of mix of Ex Machina and Breaking Bad.
*  No, I don't. For the record, I don't.
*  But you don't. I said that's what I'm going to do once you release the papers.
*  I shave my head and I'm going to live a life of crime. Anyway, I'm sorry.
*  No, no. So yeah, let's get back to... Indeed, it is about making drugs,
*  but importantly, making important drugs.
*  All drugs matter.
*  Yeah, but let's go back. So the basic thesis is chemistry is very analog. There is no state machine.
*  And I wandered through the paper walls in the Japanese house a few years ago and said,
*  okay, hey, organic chemist, why are you doing this analog? They said, well,
*  chemistry is really hard. You can't automate it. It's impossible. I said, but is it impossible?
*  They said, yeah. And they said, I got the impression they're saying it's magic.
*  And so when people tell me things are magic, it's like, no, no, they can't be magic. Right.
*  So let's break this down. And so what I did is I went to my group one day about eight years ago
*  and said, hey guys, I've written this new programming language for you. And so everything is clear.
*  And you're not allowed to just wander around the lab willy nilly. You have to pick up things in
*  order, go to the balance at the right time and all this stuff. And they looked at me as if I was
*  insane and basically kicked me out of the lab and said, no, don't do that. We're not doing that.
*  And I said, okay. So I went back the next day and said,
*  I'm going to find some money so we can make cool robots do chemical reactions. And everyone went,
*  that's cool. And so in that process, the person tried to convert the humans to become robots. And
*  next you could, you might as well just create the robots. Yes. But so in that, in that,
*  the formalization process. Yeah. So what I did is said, look, chemical, to make a molecule,
*  you need to do four things abstractly. I want to make a chemical Turing machine because the Turing
*  machine, you think about this, imagine a Turing machine. Turing machine is the ultimate
*  abstraction of a computation because it's been shown by Turing and others that basically a
*  universal Turing machine should be able to do all computations that you can imagine. It's like, wow,
*  why didn't I think of a Turing machine for chemistry? Let's think of a magic robot
*  that can make any molecule. Let's think about that for a second. Okay, great. How do we then
*  implement it? And I think, so what is the abstraction? So to do, to make any molecule,
*  you have to do a reaction. So you have to put reagents together, do a reaction in a flask,
*  typically. Then you, after the reaction, you have to stop the reaction. So you do what's called a
*  workup. So whatever, cool it down, add some liquid to it, extract. So then after you do the workup,
*  you separate. So you then remove the molecules, separate them all out. And then the final step is
*  purification. So reaction, workup, separate, purify. So this is basically a lot like, exactly
*  like a Turing machine where you have your tape, you have your tape head, you have some rules,
*  then you run it. So I thought, cool. I went to all the chemists and said, look, chemistry isn't that
*  hard. Reaction, workup, separation, purification, do that in cycles forever for any molecule,
*  all the chemistry done. And they said, chemistry is that hard. I said, but just in principle.
*  And I got a few very enlightened people to say, yeah, okay, in principle, but it ain't going to
*  work. And this was in about 2013, 2014. And I found myself going to an architecture conference,
*  almost by accident. It's like, why am I at this random conference on architecture?
*  And that was because I published a paper on inorganic architecture. And they said,
*  come to architecture conference, but the inorganic architect is about nano architecture.
*  It's not, and I went, okay. And then I found these guys at the conference, 3D printing,
*  ping pong balls and shapes. And this is through it. 3D printing was cool. And it's like,
*  this is ridiculous. Why are you 3D printing ping pong balls? And I gave them a whole load of abuse,
*  like I normally do when I first meet people, how to win friends and influence people. And then I was
*  like, oh my God, you guys are geniuses. And so I got, I got from, they were a bit confused because
*  I was calling them idiots and then call them geniuses. It's like, will you come to my lab and
*  we're going to build a robot to do chemistry with a 3D printer. And I said, oh, that's cool. All
*  right. So I had them come to the lab and we started to 3D print test tubes. So you imagine,
*  you know, 3D print a bottle and then, and then in the, and then use the same gantry to basically,
*  rather than to squirt out a plastic out of a nozzle, have a little syringe and jump chemicals in.
*  So we had the 3D printer, because simultaneously print the test tube and then put chemicals into
*  the test tube. And then, oh, so it's really end to end. Yeah. I was like, that'll be because
*  they've got G code to do it all. I was like, that's cool. So I got my group doing this and
*  I developed it a bit and I realized that we could take those unit operations and we built a whole
*  bunch of pumps and valves. And I realized that I could basically take the literature
*  and I made the first version of the computer in 2016, 17. I made some architectural decisions.
*  So I designed the pumps and valves in my group. I did all the electronics in my group. They were
*  brilliant. I cannot pay tribute to my group enough in doing this. They were just brilliant.
*  And there were some poor souls there that said, Lee, why are you making this design electronics?
*  I'm like, well, because I don't understand it. They're like, so you're making this design stuff
*  because you don't understand. It's like, yeah, it's like, but can we not just buy some? I said,
*  well, we can, but then I don't understand how to, you know, what bus they're going to use and
*  there's serial ports and all this stuff. I just wanted, and I made, I came up with a decision to
*  design a bunch of pumps and valves and use power over ethernet. So I've got one cable for power
*  and data, plug them all in, plug them all into a router. And then I made the state machine.
*  And there was a couple of cool things I did. Oh, they did actually. We got the abstraction. So
*  reaction, workup, separation, purification. And then I made the decision to do it in batch.
*  Now it's in batch. All chemistry had been digitized before, apparently,
*  and once it's been done, but everyone's been doing it in flow. And flow is continuous and
*  there are infinities everywhere and you have to just, and I realized that I could actually make
*  a state machine where I basically put stuff in the reactor, turn it from one state to another state,
*  stop it and just read it out. And okay. And I was kind of pitching it's electrical engineers saying,
*  you have it easy. You don't have to clean out the electrons. Electrons don't leave a big mess.
*  They leave some EM waste, but in my state machine I built in cleaning. So it's like we do an operation
*  and then it cleans the backbone and then can do it again. So what we managed to do over a couple
*  of years is develop the hardware, develop state machine, and we encoded three molecules. We did
*  the first three, we did nitol, a sleeping drug, rifinamide, anesthesia and Viagra.
*  And I could make jokes on the paper. It's a hard problem, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  That's very good. And then in the next one, what we did said, okay, my poor organic chemist said,
*  look, Lee, we've worked with you this long. We've made a robot that looks like it's going to take
*  our jobs away and not just take our jobs away, what we love in the lab, but now we have to become
*  programmers, but we're not even good programmers. We just have to spend ages writing lines of code
*  that are boring and it's not as elegant. I went, you're right. So then, but I knew because I had
*  this abstraction and I knew that there was language, I could suddenly develop a state
*  machine that would interpret the language, which was lossy and ambiguous and populate my abstraction.
*  So I built a chemical programming language that is actually going to be recursively
*  innumerable. It's going to be a Turing complete language actually, which is kind of cool, which
*  means it's for me verifiable. So where we are now is we can now read the literature using a bit of
*  natural language processing. It's not the best. There are many other groups that have done better
*  job, but we can use that language reading to populate the state machine and basically add,
*  subtract. We've got about a number of primitives that we basically program loops that we dovetail
*  together and we can make any molecule with it. Okay. So that's the kind of program synthesis.
*  So you start like literally you talk about like a paper, like a scientific paper that's being read
*  natural language processing, extracting some kind of details about chemical reactions and
*  the chemical molecules, the compos involved. And then that's that in GPT terms serves as a prompt
*  for the program synthesis. That's kind of trivial right now. There you have a bunch of different
*  for loops and so on that creates a program in this chemical language that can then be
*  interpreted by the chemical computer, the computer. Yeah. Computer. Yeah.
*  Everything sounds better in your British accent, but I love it. So the into the computer and that's
*  able to then basically be a 3d printer for these molecules. Yeah. I wouldn't call it a 3d printer.
*  I would call it a universal chemical reaction system because 3d printing gives the wrong
*  impression. But yeah, and it purifies. And the nice thing is that that code now that we call it
*  the Kydl code is really interesting because now so computation, what is computation?
*  Computation is what computing is to mathematics. I think computation is the process of taking
*  chemical code and some input reagents and making the same molecule, making the molecule
*  reproducibly every time without fail. What is computation? It's the process of taking a
*  using a program to take some input conditions and give you an output same every time,
*  right? Reliably. So the problem is now maybe you can push back and correct me on this.
*  So I know biology is messy. My question is how messy is chemistry? So the,
*  if we use the analogy of a computer, it's easier to make computation in a computer
*  very precise, that it's repeatable. It makes errors almost never if it does the exact same way over
*  and over and over and over. What about chemistry? Is there messiness in the whole thing? It can
*  then be somehow leveraged, can then be controlled, can be that removed? Do we want to remove it from
*  the system? Oh, yes and no, right? Is there messiness? There is messiness because chemistry
*  is like you're doing reactions on billions of molecules and they don't always work,
*  but you've got purification there. And so what we've found is at the beginning, everyone said
*  it can't work. It's going to be too messy. It will just fail. And I said, but you managed to
*  get chemistry to work in the lab. Are you magic? Are you doing something? So I would say,
*  now go back to the first ever computer or the ENIAC, five million soldered joints, 400,000
*  valves that are exploding all the time. Was that, would you have gone, okay, that's messy. So we've
*  got the, and have we got the equivalent of the ENIAC in my lab? We've got 15 computers in the
*  lab now and they, are they unreliable? Yeah, they fall apart here and there, but are they getting
*  better really quickly? Yeah. Are they now able to reliably make more? Are we at the point in the
*  lab where there are some molecules we would rather make on the computer than have a human being make?
*  Yeah, we've just done, we've just made a anti-influenza molecule and some antivirals,
*  six steps on the computer that would take a human being about one week to make Arbidol of continuous
*  labor. And all they do now is load up the reagents, press go button and just go away and drink coffee.
*  Wow. So this, I mean, and this is, you're saying this computer is just the early days. And so,
*  like some of the criticism just has to do with the early days. And yes, I would say that something
*  like this is quite impossible. So the fact that you're doing this is incredible. Not impossible,
*  of course, but extremely difficult. It did seem really difficult. And I do keep pinching myself
*  when I go in the lab. I was like, is it working? Like, yep. And it's not, you know, it does clog.
*  It does stop. You got to clean. This is great. It's, you know, but it's getting more reliable
*  because I made some, we just made design decisions and said, we are not going to abandon the
*  abstraction. Think about it. If the, if you, the von Neumann implementation was abandoned,
*  I mean, think about what we do to semiconductors to really constrain them to what we do to silicon
*  in a fab lab. We take computation for granted. Silicon is not in its natural state. We are doping
*  the hell out of it. It's incredible what they're able to accomplish and achieve that reliability
*  at the scale they do. Like you said, that's after more as well. What we have now and what we, you
*  know, how it started, you know, we started the bottom. Now we're here. We have only have 20
*  million molecules. We'll say 20 million molecules in one database, maybe a few hundred million in
*  all the pharmaceutical companies. And those few hundred million molecules are responsible for all
*  the drugs that we've had in humanity, except, you know, biologics for the last 50 years.
*  Now imagine what happens when a drug goes out of print, goes out of print because there's only a
*  finite number of manufacturing facilities in the world that make these drugs. Yeah.
*  Isn't that computer printing press? The chemistry. Yeah. And not only that we can protect the
*  Chi DL so we can stop bad actors doing it. We can encrypt them and we can give people like,
*  that's the name of the program language. The Chi DL is the name of the programming
*  language and the code we give the chemicals. So Chi, as in, you know, just for, it's like,
*  it's actually like an XML format, but I've now taken it from script to a fully expressible
*  programming language so we can do dynamics and there's four loops in there and conditional
*  statements. Right. But the structure, it started out as a, like a, like an XML thing. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And now we also, the chemist doesn't need to program in Chi DL. They can just go to the
*  software and type in add A to B reflux, do what they would normally do. And you just
*  convert it to Chi DL and they have a linter to check it. So how do you, you know, not with ASCII,
*  but because it's a Greek letter, how do you go with, how do you spell it? Just using the
*  English alphabet. We just, X D L. X D L, but we use, we put in Chi and it was named by one of my
*  students and I, and one of my post-docs many years ago and I quite liked it. It's like,
*  it's important. I think when the team are contributing to such big ideas, because there
*  ideas as well, I try not to just rename, I didn't call it Cronin or anything that, because they
*  keep saying, you know, is it the chemistry when they're putting stuff in the computer? One of my
*  students said, we are asking that, is it Cronin complete? And I was like, what does that mean?
*  I said, well, can we make it on the damn machine? And I was like, oh, is that a compliment or a
*  majority? And they're like, well, it might be better. Yeah. So you tweeted, quote, why does
*  chemistry need a universal programming language? For all the reasons you can think of reliability,
*  interoperability, collaboration, remove ambiguity, lower cost, increase safety, open up discovery,
*  molecular customization, and publication of executable chemical code, which is fascinating,
*  by the way, just publish code. And can you maybe elaborate a little bit more about this
*  Chi DL? What is the universal language of chemistry look like? A Cronin complete
*  language? It's a Turing complete language, really. But so what it has, it has a series of
*  operators in it, like add, heat, stir. So there's a bunch of just unit operations. And all it is,
*  really, is just, with chemical engineers, when I talked about this, that you've just rediscovered
*  chemical engineering. And I said, well, yeah, I know. I said, well, that's trivial. I said, well,
*  yes, it is trivial. And that's why it's good. Because not only have we rediscovered chemical
*  engineering, we've made it implementable on a universal hardware that doesn't cost very much
*  money. And so the Chi DL has a series of statements like define the reactor. So defines the reagents.
*  So they're all labels. So you assign them. And what I also implemented at the beginning is,
*  because I give all the hardware IP address, you put it on a graph. And so what it does is like,
*  the graph is equivalent to the processor firmware, the processor code. So when you take your Chi DL,
*  and you go to run it on your computer, you can run it on any compatible hardware in any
*  configuration. So what's your graph look like? As long as I can solve the problem on the graph
*  with these unit operations, you have the resources available. Chem piles.
*  We can carry on for years. But it is really, it's chempilation.
*  And what it now does is it says, okay, the problem we have before is, it was possible to
*  do robotics for chemistry, but the robots are really expensive. They were unique.
*  They were vendor locked. And what I want to do is to make sure that every chemist in the world
*  can get access to machinery like this at virtually no cost, because it makes it safer.
*  It makes it more reliable. And then if you go to the literature and you find a molecule that could
*  potentially cure cancer, and let's say the molecule that could potentially cure cancer takes
*  you three years to repeat, and maybe a student finishes their PhD in the time and they never
*  get it back. So it's really hard to kind of get all the way to that molecule. And it limits the
*  ability of humanity to build on it. If they just download the code and can execute it, it turns,
*  I would say the electronic laboratory notebook in chemistry is a data cemetery.
*  Because no one will ever reproduce it. But now the data cemetery is a Jupiter notebook,
*  and you can just execute it. And people can play with it. Yeah, they access to it. Reversed.
*  Orders of magnitude is increased. We'll talk about the, so as with all technologies,
*  I think there's way more exciting possibilities, but there are also terrifying possibilities. And
*  we'll talk about all of them. But let me just kind of linger on the machine learning side of this. So
*  you're describing programming, but it's a language. I don't know if you've heard about
*  OpenAI codecs, which is, I'm playing with it. Of course you are.
*  You really are Rick from Rick and Morty. This is great. Okay. Except philosophically, I mean,
*  he is, I guess, kind of philosophically deep too. So for people who don't know GPT, GPT-3,
*  it's a language model that can do natural language generation. So you can give it a prompt and it can
*  complete the rest of it. But it turns out that that kind of prompt, it's not just completes the
*  rest of it. It's generating like novel sounding text. And then you can apply that to generation
*  of other kinds of stuff. So these kinds of transformer based language models are really good
*  at forming deep representations of a particular space, like a medium, like language. So you can
*  then apply it to a specific subset of language like programming. So you can have it learn the
*  representation of the Python programming language and use it to then generate syntactically and
*  semantically correct programs. So you can start to make progress on one of the hardest problems
*  in computer science, which is program synthesis. How do you write programs that accomplish
*  different tasks? So what OpenAI Codex does is it to generate those programs based on a prompt of
*  some kind. Usually you can do a natural language prompt. So basically as you do when you program,
*  you write some comment, which serves the basic documentation of the inputs and the outputs and
*  the function of the particular set of code and it's able to generate that point being is you can
*  generate programs using machine learning using neural networks. Those programs operate on the
*  boring old computer. Can you generate programs that operate? There's got to be a clever version
*  of programs for this, but can you write programs that operate on a computer? Yep, there's actually
*  software out there right now. We can go and do it. It's a heuristic. It's rule-based, but we have
*  what we've done inspired by Codex actually is over the summer, I ran a little workshop. Some of my
*  groups got this inspired idea that we should get a load of students and ask them to manually
*  collect data to label chemical procedures in Tkydl and we have a cool synth reader.
*  So there's a bunch of people doing this right now, but they're doing it without abstraction.
*  And because we have an abstraction that's implementable in the hardware,
*  we've developed basically a chemical analog of Codex. When you say abstraction in the
*  hardware, what do you mean? So right now, a lot of people are doing machine learning and reading
*  chemistry and saying, oh, you've got all these operations, add, shake, whatever,
*  heat. But because they don't have a uniform, I mean, there's a couple of groups doing it,
*  competitors actually, and they're good, very good, but they can't run that code automatically.
*  They are losing meaning. And the really important thing that you have to do is generate context.
*  And so what we've learned to do with our abstraction is make sure we can pull the
*  context out of the text. And so can we take a chemical procedure and read it and generate
*  our executable code? Yes. What's the hardest part about that whole pipeline from the initial text,
*  interpreting the initial text of a paper, extracting the meaningful context and the
*  meaningful chemical information to then generating the program to then running that program in the
*  hardware? What's the hardest part about that pipeline as we look towards a universal Turing
*  computer? So the hardest thing with the pipeline is that the software, the model gets confused
*  between some meanings, right? So if chemists are very good at inventing words that aren't broken
*  down, so the classic word that you would use for boiling something is called reflux. So reflux is
*  you'd have a solvent in a round bomb flask, at reflux it would be boiling, going up the reflux
*  condenser and coming down. But that term reflux, to reflux could be changed to, people often make
*  up words, new words, and then the software can fall over. But what we've been able to do is a
*  bit like in Python, or any programming language, is identify when things aren't matched. So you
*  present the code and you say, this isn't matched, you may want to think about this. And then the
*  user goes and says, oh, I mean reflux and just ticks a box and collects it. So what the codex
*  or the Chemex does in this case, is it just it suggests the first go, and then the chemist
*  goes and corrects it. And I really want the chemist to correct it. Because it's not safe,
*  I believe, for to allow AI to just read literature and generate code at this stage.
*  Because now you're having actual, by the way, Chemex, nice, nice name. So you are unlike,
*  which is fascinating. We live in a fascinating moment in human history. But yes, you're
*  literally connecting AI to some physical and like, it's building something in the physical realm.
*  Especially in the space of chemistry that operates sort of invisibly.
*  Yeah, I would say that's right. And it's really important to understand those labeling schemes.
*  Right? And one of the things I was never, I was always worried about the beginning that the
*  abstraction was going to fall over. And the way we did it was just by brute force to start with,
*  we just kept reading the literature and saying, is there anything new? Can we have a new rule in?
*  And actually, our Chi DL language expand exploded. There was so many extra things we had to keep
*  adding. And then I realized the primitive still maintained, I could break them down again. So
*  we get it's pretty good. I mean, there are problems, there are problems of, you know,
*  interpreting any big sentence and turning it into an actionable code. And the codecs is not without
*  its problems. You can, you can crash it quite easily, right? You can generate nonsense. But boy,
*  it's interesting. I would love to learn to program now using codecs. Right? Just hacking
*  around, right? And I wonder if chemists in the future will learn to do chemistry by just hacking
*  around with the system writing different things. Because the key thing that we're doing with
*  chemistry is that where a lot of mathematical chemistry went wrong is people. And I think
*  Wolfram does this in Mathematica, he assumes that chemistry is a reaction where atom A or
*  molecule A reacts with molecule B to give molecule C. That's not what chemistry is.
*  Chemistry is take, take some molecule, take a liquid or a solid, mix it up and heat it,
*  and then extract it. So the programming language is actually with respect to the process operations.
*  And if you flick in process space, not in chemical graph space, you unlock everything,
*  because there's only a finite number of processes you need to do in chemistry.
*  And that's reassuring. And so we're in the middle of it. It's really exciting.
*  It's not the be all and the end all. And there is, like I say, errors that can creep in.
*  One day we might be able to do it without human interaction, you simulate it, and you'll know
*  enough about the simulation that the lab won't catch fire. But there are so many safety issues
*  right now that we've got to really be very careful, protecting the user, protecting the
*  environment, protecting misuse. I mean, there's lots to discuss if you want to go down that route,
*  because it's very, very interesting. You don't want Novichok being made or explosives being made
*  or recreational drugs being made. But how do you stop a molecular biologist making a drug
*  that's going to be important for them looking at their particular assay on a bad actor trying
*  to make methamphetamine? I saw how you looked at me when you said bad actor,
*  but that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm trying to get the details of this so I can be first.
*  Don't worry, we can protect you from yourself.
*  Okay. I'm not sure that's true, but that statement gives me hope. Does this ultimately excite you
*  about the future, or does it terrify you? So let's, we mentioned that time is fundamental.
*  It seems like you're at the cutting edge of progress that will have to happen, that will happen,
*  that there's no stopping it. And I, as we've been talking about, I see obviously a huge number of
*  exciting possibilities. So whenever you automate these kinds of things, just the world opens up.
*  It's like programming itself and the computer, regular computer, has created innumerable
*  applications and made the world better in so many dimensions. And it created, of course,
*  a lot of negative things that we, for some reason, like to focus on using that very technology to
*  tweet about it. But I think it made a much better world, but it created a lot of new dangers.
*  So maybe you can speak to when you have, when you kind of stand at the end of the road for building
*  a really solid, reliable, universal computer, what are the possibilities that are positive?
*  What are the possibilities that are negative? How can we minimize the chance of the negative?
*  Yeah, that's a really good question. So there's so many positive things from drug discovery,
*  from supply chain stress, for basically enabling chemists to basically build more productive in the
*  lab, right? Where the computer is not going to replace the chemist. There's going to be a Moore's
*  law of molecules, right? There's going to be so many more molecules we can design, so many more
*  diseases we can cure. So chemists in the lab, as researchers, that's better for science, so they can
*  build a bunch of, like they could do science at a much more accelerated pace. So it's not just the
*  development of drugs, it's actually like doing the basic understanding of the science of drugs.
*  And the personalization, the cost of drugs right now, we're all living longer, we're all having
*  more and more, we know more about our genomic development, we know about our predetermination,
*  and we might be able to, one dream I've got is like, imagine, you can work at your genome assistant,
*  tells you you're going to get cancer in seven years time, and you have your personal computer
*  that cooks up the right molecule just for you to cure it, right? That's a really positive idea.
*  The other thing is, when drugs, so right now, I think it's absolutely outrageous that not all of
*  humanity has access to medicine. And I think the computer might be able to change that fundamentally
*  because it will disrupt the way things are manufactured. So let's stop thinking about
*  manufacturing in different factories. Let's say that computers, clinical grade computers,
*  or drug grade computers will be in facilities all around the world, and they can make things on
*  demand as a function of the cost. Maybe people won't be able to afford the latest and greatest
*  patent, but maybe they'll be able to get the next best thing, and we'll basically democratize,
*  make available drugs to everybody that they need. There's lots of really interesting things there.
*  So I think that's going to happen. I think that now let's take the negative. Before we do that,
*  let's imagine what happened, go back to a really tragic accident a few years ago, well not accident,
*  an act of murder by that pilot on the, I think it was Eurowings or Swisswings, but what he did is,
*  plane took off, he waited until his pilot went to the toilet, he was a co-pilot, he locked the door,
*  and then set the autopilot above the out, so he set the altimeter or the descend height to zero.
*  So the computer just took the plane into the out. Now, I mean, that was such a tragedy that obviously
*  the guy was mentally ill, but it wasn't just a tragedy for him, it was for all the people on board.
*  But what if, and I was inspired by this, and my thinking, what can I do to do,
*  to anticipate problems like this in the computer? Had the software, and I'm sure Boeing and Airbus
*  will be thinking, oh, maybe I can give the computer a bit more situational awareness. So whenever
*  one, some tries to drop the height of the plane and it knows it's above the out, so just say,
*  oh no, computer says, no, we're not letting you do that. Of course, he would have been out to find
*  another way, maybe fly it until it runs out of fuel or something, but you know. Keep anticipating
*  all the large number of trajectories that can go negative, all those kinds of running into the alps,
*  and try to at least make it easy for the engineers to build systems that are protecting us that.
*  Yeah, and let's just think, so what in the computer world right now with KyDLs, let's just
*  not think about what I'm doing right now. What I'm doing right now is it's completely open,
*  right? Everyone's going to know KyDLs and be playing with them, making them more easier and
*  easier, but what we're going to start to do, it makes sense to encrypt the KyDLs in such a way,
*  let's say you work for a pharmaceutical company and you have a license to make a given molecule.
*  Well, you get issued with a license by the FDA or your local authority, and they'll say, right,
*  your license to do it, here it is, it's encrypted, and the KyDL gets run. So you have a license for
*  that instance of use. Easy to do. Computer science has already solved the problem. So the fact that
*  we all trust online banking, right, the right now, then we can secure it. I'm 100% sure we can
*  secure the computer because of the way we have a many, it's like the same mapping problem that you,
*  to actually reverse engineer a KyDL will be as hard as reverse engineering the encryption key,
*  brute force, it will be cheaper to just actually buy the regulated medicine.
*  And actually people aren't going to want to then make their own fake pharmaceuticals because it'll
*  be so cheap to do it. We'll drop the cost of access to drugs. Now what will happen? Recreational drugs.
*  People start saying, well, I want access to recreational drugs. Well, it's going to be up to,
*  it's going to accelerate that social discussion that's happening in the US and Canada and UK,
*  everywhere, right? Because cost goes down, access goes up.
*  Given cannabis, THC, to some people who've got epilepsy isn't literally forgive the term a
*  no brainer because these poor people go from seizures like every day to maybe seizures just
*  once every few months. That's an interesting idea to try to minimize the chance that it can get
*  into like the hands of individuals like terrorists or people that want to do harm.
*  Now with that kind of thing, you're putting a lot of power in the hands of governments,
*  in the hands of institutions. And so then emerge the kind of natural criticism you might have of
*  governments that can sometimes use these for ill, use them as weapons of war, not weapon, not
*  tools of betterment. So, and sometimes not just war against other nations, but war against its own
*  people as it has been done throughout history. Well, I'm thinking, so there's another way of
*  doing it, a decentralized peer to peer version where, and what you have to do, I'm not saying
*  you should adopt a blockchain, but there is a way of maybe taking KyDLs and put them in blockchain.
*  Here's an idea. Let's just say the way we're doing my lab right now is we go to the literature,
*  we take a recipe to make a molecule, convert that to KyDL and diligently make it in the robot
*  and validate it. So we, I would call mining proof of work, proof of synthesis, right?
*  Proof of the synthesis.
*  Yeah, yeah, but this is cool because suddenly when you actually synthesize it, you can get
*  the analytical data, but there's also a fingerprint in there of the impurities that get carried across
*  because you can never make one something 100% pure. That fingerprint will allow you to secure
*  your KyDL. So what you do is encrypt those two things. So suddenly you can have people out there
*  mining and what you could do perhaps is do the type of thing that we need to basically look at
*  the way that contact tracing should have been done in COVID where people are given the information.
*  So you've just been in contact with someone COVID, you choose, I'm not telling you to stay at home,
*  you choose, right? So now if we could imagine a similar thing, like you have got access to these
*  chemicals, they will have these effects, you choose and publicize it or maybe it's out somewhere.
*  I don't know. I'm not a policymaker on this. And what my job here is to not just make the
*  technology possible, but to have it as open as a discussion as possible with people to say, hey,
*  can we stop childhood mortality with this technology? And to those benefits outweigh
*  the one-off where people might use it for terrorism or people might use it for recreational drugs.
*  Chemify, which is the name of the entity that will make this happen, I think we have some
*  social responsibilities as an entity to make sure that we're not enabling people to manufacture
*  personal drugs, weapons at will. And what we have to do is have a discussion with society,
*  with the people who invest in this, with people that are going to pay for this,
*  to say, well, do you want to live longer? And do you want to be healthier? And are you willing
*  to accept some of the risks? And I think that's a discussion to have. So by the way, when you say
*  personal drugs, do you mean the illegal ones? Or do you have a concern of just putting the
*  manufacturer of any kind of legal drugs in the hands of regular people because they might,
*  dose matters, they might take way too much? I mean, I would say, to be honest, the chances
*  of computers being, well, should always never say, the fact I can now say this means it's totally
*  going to come true, right? I'm going to do it. I cannot imagine that computers will be in people's
*  houses anytime soon, but they might be at the local pharmacy, right? And if you've got a drug
*  manufacturing facility in every town, then you just go and they give you a prescription. They
*  do it in such a way, they format it so that you don't have to take 10 pills every day. You get
*  one manufactured for you that has all the materials you need and the right distribution.
*  Got it. But you mentioned recreation drugs. And the reason I mentioned it, because I know people
*  are going to speak up on this, if the drug is legal, there's to me no reason why you can't
*  manufacture, I mean, for recreation. I mean, you can do it right now. What do you have against fun,
*  I mean, I'm a chemistry professor in a university who's an entrepreneur as well.
*  I just think I need to be as responsible as I can in the discussion. Sure. Not sure. Sure. But I know,
*  so let me be the one that says like, there's nothing, because you have said recreational
*  drugs and like terrorism in the same sentence. Yeah, yeah. I think, I think let's make sure we
*  draw a line that there's real dangers to the world of terrorists, of bio warfare. And then there's a
*  little bit of weed. So I have, I mean, I think it's up to the society to, to tell his governments
*  what it wants, what's acceptable, right? And if it becomes, let's say that THC's become, you know,
*  heavily acceptable, and that you can modify them. So let's say there's, let's say it's like blood
*  type. There's a particular type of THC that you tolerate better than I do. Then why not, why not
*  have a machine that makes the one you like? Yeah. And then, and why not? The perfect brownie.
*  Okay. And I think that that's fine. But I'm, you know, we're so far away from that. I can barely
*  get the thing to work in the lab, right? I mean, it's reliability and all this other stuff. But
*  what I think is going to happen in the short term, it's going to turbocharge molecular discovery,
*  reliability, and that will change the world. That's super exciting. You have a draft of a paper
*  titled autonomous intelligent exploration, discovery and optimization of nanomaterials.
*  So we are talking about automating engineering of nanomaterials. How hard is this problem?
*  And as we continue down this thread of the positives and the worrisome, what are the things
*  we should be excited about? And what are the things we should be terrified about? And how do
*  we minimize the chance of the terrifying consequences? So in this robot, the robot does
*  all the heavy lifting. So the robot basically is an embodied AI. I really like AI in a domain
*  specific way. One that, as you should say at this point, there was an attempt in the 60s,
*  Joshua Leidenberg and some really important people did this that made an AI to try and guess if
*  organic molecules in the mass spectrum were alien or not. Yes. And they did, they failed because
*  they didn't have assembly theory. I see. And when I, and I, and that-
*  Wait, wait, what does assembly theory give you about alien versus human life?
*  Well, no, it just, it tells you about unknown, the degree of unknowns. You can fingerprint stuff.
*  They were trying to basically just look at the corpus of complex organic molecules. So when I
*  was a bit down about assembly theory, because I couldn't convince referees and couldn't convince
*  computational, people interested in computational complexity, I was really quite depressed about it.
*  And I mean, I've been working with Sarah Walker's team and I think she, you know, I think she also
*  invented assembly theory in some way. We can talk about it later. When I found the AI not working
*  for the Dendrel project, I suddenly realized I wasn't totally insane. Coming back to this nano
*  robot. So what it does is it's basically like a computer, but now what it does is it squirts
*  a liquid with gold in it, in the test tube, and it adds some reducing agents, some electrons to
*  make the gold turn into a nanoparticle. Now when gold becomes a nanoparticle, it gets a characteristic
*  color, a plasmon. So it's a bit like if you look at the sheen on the gold wedding ring or gold bar
*  or something, those are the ways of conducting electrons basically reflect light. What we did is
*  we randomly squirt the gold particle and the reducing agent in and we measure the UV, we measure
*  the color. And so what we do is we've got the robot has a mind, so it has a mind where in a simulation
*  it randomly generates nanoparticles and the plasmon, the color that comes out, randomly
*  imagines in its head. It then, well the other, so that's the imaginary side of the robot and the
*  physical side of the robot, it squirts in the chemicals and looks at the color and it uses a
*  genetic algorithm and a map elite actually on it and it goes around in cycles and refines
*  the color to the objective. Now we use two different points, we have an exploration
*  and an optimization. They're two different, so the exploration just says just do random stuff
*  and see how many different things you can get and when you get different things try and optimize
*  and make the peak sharper, sharper, sharper. And what it does after a number of cycles is it
*  physically takes a sample of the optimized nanomaterial, resets all the round bottom
*  flasks, cleans them and puts the seed, physical seed back in. And then what this robot is able
*  to do is search a space of 10 to the 23 possible reactions in just a thousand experiments in three
*  days. And it makes five generations of nanoparticles which get nicer and nicer in
*  terms of shape and color and definition and then at the end it outputs a KyDL code.
*  Wow, it's doing the search for programs in the physical space. So it's doing a kind of reinforcement
*  learning. Yeah, yeah in the physical space. With the exploration and the optimization. And that KyDL
*  will work on any computer or any qualified hardware. So now that's it. Now that's a general
*  piece of code that can replicate somewhat maybe perfectly what it created. That's amazing. That's
*  incredible. But the nanoparticles themselves are dumb. The robot has all the thinking. So we don't
*  try and imply any self-replication or try and get the particles to make themselves. Although it would
*  be cool to try. So well there you go. Those are famous last words for the end of human civilization.
*  Would be cool to try. So is it possible to create molecules that start approaching this question
*  that we started this conversation which is the origin of life. To start to create molecules that
*  have lifelike qualities. So have the replication. Have like complex start to create complex
*  organisms. So we have done this with the oxides. I talked about earlier with the limton oxides and
*  the rings and the bulls. And the problem is that they are they do they autocadalytically enhance
*  one another. So they would I guess you would call it self-replication. But because there's limited
*  function and mutation they're pretty dumb. So they don't do very much. So I think the prospect of
*  us being able to engineer a nanomaterial life form in the short term like I said earlier.
*  My aim is to do this of course. I mean I'm you know on one hand I'm saying it's impossible and
*  the other hand saying I'm doing it. So which is it Lee? You know it's like well I think we can do
*  it but only in the robot. So the causal chain that's going to allow it is in the robot. These
*  particles if they do start to self-replicate the system's going to be so fragile that I don't think
*  anything dangerous will come out. It doesn't mean we shouldn't treat them as potentially you know
*  I mean I don't want to scare people like gain a function we're going to produce stuff that comes
*  out. Our number one kill switch is that we always try to search a space of objects that don't exist
*  in our reality. It don't exist in the environment. So even if something got out it just would die
*  immediately. It's like making a silicon life form or something or you know. Which is the opposite
*  oftentimes gain of function research is focused on like how do you get a dangerous thing to be
*  closer to something that works with humans. So have it jump to humans. So that's the one
*  good mode to operate on is always try to operate on chemical entities that are very different than
*  the kind of chemical environment that humans operate in. Yeah and also I mean I'll say
*  something dramatic which may not be may not be true so I should be careful. If let's say we did
*  discover a new living system and it was made out of a shadow biosphere and we just released it in
*  the environment who cares it's going to use different stuff. It'll just live. Just live yeah.
*  I thought one of my biggest fantasies is actually is like a planet that's basically half in the
*  sun. It doesn't rotate right and you have two different origins of life on that planet
*  and they don't share the same chemistry. Yeah and then the only way time they recognize each other
*  is when they become intelligent they go well what's that moving. Yeah I wonder. They co-evolve
*  that's fascinating. I mean so one fascinating thing to do is exactly what you were saying which is a
*  life bomb. Yeah. Which is like try to focus on atmospheres or chemical conditions of other planets
*  and try within this kind of exploration optimization system try to discover
*  life forms that can work in those conditions and then you send those life forms over there and see
*  what kind of stuff they build up. Like you can do like a large scale it's kind of a safe
*  physical environment to do large scale experiments. It's another planet. Yeah so look I'm going to say
*  something quite contentious. I mean Elon wants to go to Mars. I think it's brilliant wants to go
*  Mars but I would counter that and say is Elon just obsessed with getting humanity off earth or what
*  about just technology. So if we do technology so Elon either needs to take a computer to Mars
*  because he needs to manufacture drugs right on demand right because you zero cost payload and
*  all that stuff is just code or what we do is we actually say hang on it's quite hard for humans
*  to survive on Mars why don't we write a series of origin of life algorithms where we put our
*  embed our culture in it right. It's a very Ridley spot from Prometheus right. Yeah. Which is a
*  terrible film by the way but anyway and dump it on Mars and just terraform Mars and what we do is
*  we evolve life on Mars that is suited to life on Mars. Yeah. Rather than brute forcing human life
*  on Mars. So one of the questions is you know what is human culture what is the things you encode
*  some of it is knowledge some of it is information but the thing that Elon talks about and I think
*  I think about I think you think about as well is some of the more unique aspects of human
*  of what makes us human which is our particular kind of consciousness. So he talks about the
*  flame of human consciousness. Yeah. That's one of the questions is can we
*  instill consciousness into other beings because that's a sad thought that whatever
*  this thing inside our minds that hopes and dreams and fears and loves can all die
*  yeah but I think you already know the answer to that question. I have a robot lawn mower at home
*  my kids call it CC cool cutter it's a robo-mow and it the way it works it has an electric field
*  around the perimeter and it just tell it the area and it goes out and goes from its base station
*  just mows a bit gets to the perimeter detects perimeter then chooses a random angle rotates
*  around and goes on yeah but my kids call it cool cutter it's a she I don't know why it's a she
*  they just they when they were like quite young they called it I don't want to be sexist there
*  it could be a he but they liked they gendered the lawn mower they gendered the lawn mower okay yeah
*  why not but I was thinking this lawn mower if you apply integrated information theory to lawn mower
*  the lawn mower is conscious now information integrated information theory is that people
*  say as a flawed way of measuring consciousness but I don't think it is I think assembly theory
*  actually measures consciousness in the same way consciousness is something that is generated over
*  a population of objects of humans consciousness didn't suddenly spring in our consciousness is
*  evolved together right the fact we're here and the robots we leave behind they all have some of that
*  so we won't lose it all sure consciousness requires that we have many models being generated it's not
*  just one domain specific AI right I think the the way it created consciousness I'm going to say
*  unashamedly the best way to write a chemical conscious to make a consciousness is in a chemical
*  system because you just have access to many more states and the problem right now we're making
*  silicon consciousness is you just don't have enough states so there are more possible states or sorry
*  there are more possible configurations possible in your brain than there are atoms in the universe
*  and you can you can switch between them you can't do that on a core i-10 it's got it's got 10 billion
*  12 billion 14 billion transistors but you can't you can't reconfigure them as dynamically well
*  you've shared this intuition a few times already that the larger number of states somehow correlates
*  the greater possibility of life but it's also possible the constraints are essential here yeah
*  yeah I mean but coming back to the you worry that something's lost I agree
*  but I think that you know we will get to an AGI but I wonder if it's if it's not it can't be
*  separate from human it can't be separate from human consciousness because the causal chain
*  that produced it came from humans so the people what I kind of try and suggest heavily to people
*  worry about the existential threat of AI saying I mean you put it much more elegantly earlier like
*  we should worry about algorithms on dumb algorithms written by human beings on twitter
*  driving us insane right and doing acting in odd ways yeah I think intelligence this is what I
*  have been in eloquent in trying to describe it partially because I try not to think too deeply
*  through this stuff because then you become a philosopher I still aspire to actually building
*  a bunch of stuff but my sense is super intelligence leads to deep integration into human society so
*  like intelligence is strongly correlated like intelligence the way we conceive of intelligence
*  materializes as a thing that becomes a fun entity to have at a party and with humans so like it's a
*  mix of wit intelligence humor like intelligence like knowledge ability to do reasoning and so on
*  but also humor emotional intelligence ability to love to dream to share those dreams to
*  to play the game of human civilization the push and pull the whole dance of it the whole dance of
*  life and I think that kind of super intelligent being is not the thing that that worries me I
*  think that ultimately will enrich life it's again the dumb algorithms the dumb algorithms that scale
*  in the hands of people that are too don't study history that don't study human psychology and human
*  nature just applying too broadly for selfish near-term interests that's the biggest danger
*  yeah I think it's not a new danger right um right I now know how I should use twitter and how I
*  shouldn't use twitter right um I like to provoke people into thinking I don't want to provoke
*  people into outrage it's not fun it's not a good thing for humans to do right and I think that
*  when you get people into outrage they take sides and taking sides is really bad but I think that
*  we're all beginning to see this and I think that actually I'm very optimistic about how things will
*  evolve because you know I wonder how much how much productivity has twitter and social media
*  has taken out of humanity because how many now um I mean so the good thing about twitter is it gives
*  power so it gives voice to minorities right and and that's good in some degree but I wonder how
*  much voice does it give to all sorts of other problems that don't need to disemerge by the way
*  when you say minorities I think uh or at least if I were to agree with you what I would say
*  is minorities broadly defined any small groups yeah uh of people that uh it magnifies the concerns
*  of the small versus the big that is good to some degree um but I think I mean I have to be careful
*  because I think I have a very I mean I think that the world isn't that broken right I think the
*  world is a pretty cool place I think academia is really great I think climate change presents
*  a really interesting problem for humanity that we will solve I like how you said it's a pretty
*  cool problem for civilization it's a big one well it's a bunch of I want to there's a bunch
*  of really yeah really big problems that if solved can significantly improve the quality of life or
*  learn that ultimately is what we're trying to do it improve like how awesome life is for the
*  maximum number of people yeah and I think that the coming back to consciousness I don't think the
*  universe is doomed to heat death right it's one of the optimists that's why I want to kind of nudge
*  you into thinking that time is fundamental because the time is fundamental then suddenly
*  you don't have to give it back the universe just constructs stuff you know and what we see around
*  us in our construction I know everyone's worried about how fragile civilization is and I mean look
*  at the fundamentals we're the good we're good until the the sun expands right we've got quite
*  a lot of resource on earth we're trying to be quite cooperative humans are nice to each other
*  when they when they're not under enormous stress but coming back to the consciousness thing are we
*  going to send human beings to mars or conscious robots to mars or are we going to send some hybrid
*  and I don't know the answer to that question right now I guess you know Elon's going to have a pretty
*  good go at getting there I'm not sure whether I have my I have my doubts but I'm not qualified
*  you know I'm sure people have their doubts that computation works yeah but but but I've got it
*  working and I you know and most most of the cool technologies we have today and take for granted
*  like the airplane a aforementioned airplane were things that people doubted every like majority of
*  people doubted before they came to life yeah and they come to life and speaking of hybrid AI and
*  humans it's fascinating to think about all the different ways that hybridization that merger can
*  happen I mean we have currently have the smartphones so there's already a hybrid but there's all kinds
*  of ways that hybrid happens how we and other technology play together like a computer how that
*  changes the fabric of human civilization is like wide open who knows who knows if you remove
*  if you remove cancer if you remove major diseases from humanity there's going to be a bunch of
*  consequences we're not anticipating many of them positive but many of them negative many of them
*  most of them at least that hope are weird and wonderful and and fun in ways that are totally
*  unexpected and we sitting on a porch with a bottle of jack daniels and a rocker will say
*  kids these days don't appreciate how hard we had it back in the day I gotta ask you um speaking of
*  nudging you and uh yosha bach nudge each other on twitter quite a bit in uh wonderful intellectual
*  debates and of course for people who don't know josh abak is this brilliant guy he's been on the
*  podcast a couple times you tweeted or he tweeted he tweeted josh abak everyone should follow him as
*  well you should definitely follow mr lee cronin dr lee cronin um he tweeted dinner with lee cronin
*  we discussed that while we can translate every working model of existence into a turing machine
*  the structure of the universe might be given by wakes of non-existence in a pattern generated by
*  all possible automata which exists by default and then he followed on saying face to face is the best
*  so the dinner the dinner was face to face what is josh talking about uh in wakes quote wakes of
*  non-existence in a pattern generated by all possible automata which exists by default
*  so automata exists by default apparently and then there's wakes of non-existence what the hell is
*  non-existence in the universe that's a top that's um and also in another conversation um you tweeted
*  it's state machines all the way down which presumably is the origin story of this discussion
*  yeah and then josh has said again nudging nudging nudging slash trolling uh josh has said you've
*  seen the light welcome friend many foundational physicists effectively believe in some form of
*  hypercomputation lee is coming around to this idea and then you said i think there are notable
*  differences first i think the universe does not have to be a computer second i want to understand
*  how the universe emerges constructors that build computers and third is that there is uh something
*  below church touring okay what the heck is this dinner conversation about uh maybe and put another
*  way maybe zooming out a little bit are there interesting agreements and disagreements between
*  you and and joshua bach that uh that can elucidate some of the other topics we've been talking about
*  yeah so josh has an incredible mind and he has he's so well read um and uses language really
*  elegantly it bamboozles me at times so i'm uh so often i'm using i'm describing concepts in a way
*  that i built from the ground up and so we misunderstand each other a lot and he's floating in in the
*  clouds is that what you're saying something like not quite but i think so this concept of a
*  turing machine so a turing machine turing machines i would argue and i think um this is not
*  the turing machine the universe is not a turing machine biology is not even a turing machine
*  right and because turing machines don't evolve right there's a there is this problem that people
*  see turing machines everywhere but isn't interesting the universe gave rise to biology
*  that gave rise to intelligence that gave rise to alan turing who invented the abstraction of the
*  turing machine and allowed us to digitize and and so i've been looking for the mystery at the origin
*  of life the origin of intelligence and the origin of this and i when i discussed with yasha i think
*  yosha he was saying well the universe of course the universe is a turing machine of course there's
*  a there's a hyper computer there and i and i think we got kind of trapped in our words and terms
*  because of course it's possible for a turing machine or computers to exist in the universe
*  we have them but what i'm trying to understand is where did the transition of continuous
*  discrete occur and i've been and this is because of my my general foolishness of understanding
*  the continuous but i guess what i'm trying to say is there were constructors before there were
*  abstractors because how did the universe abstract itself into existence and it goes back to earlier
*  saying could the universe of intelligence have come first what's a constructor what's an
*  abstractor so the abstractor is the ability of say of alan turing and girdle and very and church
*  to to think about the mathematical universe and to label things and then from those labels to come
*  up with a set of axioms with those labels and to basically understand the universe mathematically
*  and say okay i can label things but where did the labeler come from where is the prime labeler even
*  if the universe is not a turing computer does that negate the possibility that a turing computer
*  can simulate the universe like just because the abstraction was formed at a later time
*  does that mean that abstraction this is to our cellular automata conversation yeah you were
*  taking away some of the magic from the cellular automata because very intelligent biological
*  systems came up with that cellular automata well this is where the existence is the default right
*  is it does the fact that we exist and we can come up with a turing machine does that mean the
*  universe has to be a turing machine as well but can it be a turing machine though that's a
*  so there has to be in the canopy can it be sure um i don't know i don't understand if it has to be
*  or not can it be but can the universe have turing machines in it sure they do exist now
*  i'm wondering though maybe this is this is really if things get really hairy
*  is i think the universe maybe in the past did not have the computational power that it has now
*  now
*  this is almost like a law of physics kind of it's so the computational power is not
*  you can get some free lunch yeah i mean the fact that we now we sit here in this period in time
*  and we can imagine all these robots and all these machines and we built them and so we can easily
*  imagine going back in time that the universe was capable of having them but i don't think it can
*  so the universe may have been a lot dumber computationally and i think that's why i don't
*  want to go back to the time discussion but i think it has some relationship with it the universe is
*  basically smarter now than it used to be and it's going to continue getting smart smarter over time
*  because of novelty generation and the ability to create objects within objects within objects
*  you know there's a perhaps as ground in physics there's intuition of conservation
*  yeah that stuff is conserved like like you're not you've always had all everything you're just
*  rearranging books on the bookshelf through time so okay you're saying like new books are being
*  written which laws you want to break at the origin of the origin of the big bang you had to break the
*  second law because we got order for free yeah well what i'm telling you now is that the energy isn't
*  conserved in the universe oh this is the second law okay i got you so because but not in a mad way
*  okay so computation potentially is not conserved which is a fascinating idea intelligence is not
*  conserved complexity is not conserved i suppose that's deeply connected to time being fundamental
*  the natural consequence of that is if time is fundamental and the universe is inflating in time
*  if you like then there are one or two conservation laws we need to have a look at
*  and i wonder if that means the total energy of the universe is actually increasing over time
*  and i might this may be completely ludicrous but we do have all this dark energy that's we
*  have some anomalies let's say dark matter and dark energy if we don't add them in
*  galaxy it's so dark matter i think doesn't doesn't hold you know you need to hold the
*  galaxies together and there's some other observational issues could dark energy just be time
*  so figuring out what dark energy is might give us some deep clues about this
*  so it could be that i mean i'm not saying there's perpetual motions allowed in this free lunch but
*  i'm saying if the universe is intrinsically asymmetric and it appears to be
*  and it's generating novelty and it appears to couldn't that just be a mechanistically how
*  reality works and therefore i don't really like this idea that it's not a real world
*  and therefore i don't really like this idea that the and so i want to live in a deterministic
*  universe that is undetermined yeah right the only way i can do that is if time is fundamental
*  because otherwise it's all the rest of us just it's just slight of hand because the physicists
*  will say yes everything is deterministic newton is newtonian mechanics it's deterministic
*  quantum mechanics is deterministic let's take the ever ready in view and then basically we can just
*  draw out this massive universe branching but it closes again we get it all back and don't worry
*  your feeling of free will is effective but what the physicists are actually saying is the entire
*  future is mapped out and that is clearly problematical and clearly um that's not so clear
*  yeah it's just it's just problematic it well yeah yeah so it's it's because that maybe it's
*  just the way it is it's problematic to you a creature along the timeline i want to reduce
*  the number of beliefs i need to understand the universe so if time is fundamental i don't need
*  to have magic order at the beginning and i don't need a second law but you do need the magical
*  belief that time is fundamental well i need the i need the observation that i'm seeing to be just
*  the how it is all the way down but the earth also looks flat if you if you agree with your
*  observation so we can't necessarily trust our observation i know the earth isn't flat because
*  i can send a satellite into space like you see now you're using the tools of science and the
*  technology but i'm using but i'm saying i'm going to do experiments that start to show
*  i mean i i think that it's worth so if you can't so if i cannot do an experiment or a thought
*  experiment that will test this assumption then the assumption is without merit really in the end
*  you know that's it's fine yeah so that's a beautiful idea you hold yourself to that's
*  that's a that's given that you think deeply in a philosophical way you think about some of these
*  really important issues and you have theoretical frameworks like assembly theory it's really nice
*  that you're always grounded with experiment that's all i have that's so refreshing that's
*  so beautifully refreshing now that we're holding you to the grounded in experiment to the harsh
*  truth of reality let me ask the big ridiculous question what is the meaning of this whole thing
*  what's the meaning of life why this uh time is fundamental it's marching forward and along this
*  long timeline come along a bunch of descendants of apes that uh have come up with cellular
*  automata and computers and now computers why i have so many different answers to this question
*  it depends on on what day i would say that given the way of the conversation we had today i'd say
*  the meaning well we make our own meaning i think that's fine but i think the universe wants to
*  explore every possible configuration that it's allowed us to explore and this goes back to the
*  kind of question that you're asking about yasha and the the existence and non-existence of things
*  right so if the universe is a turing machine is churning through a lot of states um and you think
*  about combinatorial theory before assembly theory so everything is possible what yasha and i were
*  saying is um well not everything is we don't see the combinatorial explosion we see something else
*  and what we see is um evidence of memory so there's there clearly seems to be some interference
*  between the combinatorial explosion of things and what the universe allows and it's like this kind
*  of constructive destructive interference so maybe the universe is not just about um it is
*  assembling objects in space and time and those objects are able to search more um space and time
*  and the universe is just infinitely creative and i guess i'm searching for why the universe is
*  infinitely creative is infinitely creative and maybe the meaning is just simply to make as many
*  objects create as many things as possible and i and i see a future the universe that doesn't result
*  in the heat death of the universe the universe is going to extract every ounce of creativity it can
*  out of it because that's what we see on earth right and if you think that almost like intelligence
*  is not conserved that maybe creativity isn't either maybe like it's an infinite well so like
*  creativity is ultimately tied to novelty you're coming up with cool new configurations of things
*  and maybe that just can continue indefinitely and uh this human species that was created along the
*  way is probably just one method like that's able to ask the universe about itself it's just one
*  way to explore creativity maybe there's other meta levels on top of that like obviously as a collective
*  intelligence will create organisms maybe there'll be organisms that uh ask themselves questions
*  about themselves in uh in a in a deeper bigger picture way that we humans do first to ask
*  questions about the humans and then construct some kind of hybrid systems that ask themselves
*  about the collective aspect just like some weird stacking that we can't even imagine yet and that
*  stacking i mean i have discussed this stacking a lot with um with sarah walker who's a professor
*  of physics and and uh astrobiology at asu and we argue about you know how creative the universe
*  is going to be and is it as deterministic as all that because i think she's she's more of a free
*  will thinker and i'm of a less free will thinker but i think we're beginning to converge
*  and understanding that um because there's simply a missing understanding right now the we don't
*  we don't understand how the universe we don't know what rules the universe has to allow the
*  universe to contemplate itself so asking the meaning of it before we know even know what
*  those rules are is premature but my guess is that it's not meaningless and it isn't just about that
*  and there's there are three levels of meanings obviously the universe wants us to do stuff
*  we're interacting with each other so we create meaning in our own society and our own interactions
*  for humanity but i do think there is something else going on but because reality is so weird
*  we're just scratching at that and i think that we have to make the experiments better and we have to
*  perhaps join across not just for the computation lists and what i tried to do with yasha is meet
*  him halfway say well what happens if i become a computation list what do i gain a lot it turns out
*  because i can make Turing machines in the universe because on the one hand i'm making computers which
*  are state machines inspired by Turing on the other hand i'm saying they can't exist well clearly
*  that's that i can't have my cake and eat it so there's something weird going on there so then
*  did the universe have to make a continuous to discrete transition or is the universe just
*  discrete it's probably just discrete so if it's just discrete then there are i will then give yasha
*  his Turing-like property in the universe but maybe there's something else below it which is
*  the constructor that constructs a Turing machine that then constructs you know it's a bit like the
*  you you generate a computing system that then is able to build an abstraction that then recognizes
*  it can make a generalizable abstraction because human beings with mathematics have been able to
*  go on and build physical computers if that makes any sense and i think that's the meaning i think
*  that's you know as far as we can the meaning will be further elucidated with further experiments
*  so yeah well you mentioned Sarah i think you and Sarah Walker are just these fascinating human beings
*  i'm really fortunate to have the opportunity to be in your presence to study your work to
*  follow along with your work i'm big i'm a big fan like i told you offline i hope we get a chance to
*  talk again with perhaps just the two of us but also with Sarah that's a fascinating dynamic
*  uh for people who haven't heard i suppose on clubhouse is where i heard you guys talk but you have
*  a incredible dynamic and i also can't wait to hear you and yasha talk so i think if there's
*  some point in this uh predetermined or yet to be determined future uh where the the three of us
*  you and Sarah or the four of us with yosha could meet and talk would be a beautiful future and i
*  look i look i look forward to most futures but i look forward to that one in particular lee thank
*  you so much for spending your valuable time with me today thanks lex it's been a pleasure
*  thanks for listening to this conversation with lee cronin to support this podcast please check
*  out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from the mad scientist
*  Rick Sanchez of rick and morty fame to live is to risk it all otherwise you're just a an inner
*  chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you
*  thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
