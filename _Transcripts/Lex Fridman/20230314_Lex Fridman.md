# Sam Harris: Trump, Pandemic, Twitter, Elon, Bret, IDW, Kanye, AI & UFOs | Lex Fridman Podcast #365
**Lex Fridman:** [March 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyrjgf-_Vdk)
*  The following is a conversation with Sam Harris, his second time on the podcast. As I said two
*  years ago when I first met and spoke with Sam, he's one of the most influential,
*  pioneering thinkers of our time, as the host of the Making Sense podcast, creator of the Waking
*  Up app, and the author of many seminal books on human nature and the human mind, including
*  The End of Faith, The Moral Landscape, Lying, Free Will, and Waking Up.
*  In this conversation, besides our mutual fascination with AGI and free will,
*  we do also go deep into controversial, challenging topics of Donald Trump,
*  Hunter Biden, January 6th, vaccines, lab leak, Kanye West, and several key figures
*  at the center of public discourse, including Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, both of whom have been
*  of Sam and have become friends of mine, somehow in an amazing life trajectory that I do not
*  deserve in any way and in fact believe is probably a figment of my imagination.
*  And if it's alright, please allow me to say a few words about this personal aspect of the
*  conversation of discussing Joe, Elon, and others. What's been weighing heavy on my heart since the
*  beginning of the pandemic, now three years ago, is that many people I look to for wisdom
*  in public discourse stop talking to each other as often, with respect, humility, and love,
*  when the world needed those kinds of conversations the most. My hope is that they start talking
*  again. They start being friends again. They start noticing the humanity that connects them,
*  that is much deeper than the disagreements that divide them. So let me take this moment to say,
*  with humility and honesty, why I look up to and am inspired by Joe, Elon, and Sam.
*  I think Joe Rogan is important to the world as a voice of compassionate curiosity and open-mindedness
*  to ideas both radical and mainstream, sometimes with humor, sometimes with brutal honesty,
*  always pushing for more kindness in the world. I think Elon Musk is important to the world as
*  an engineer, leader, entrepreneur, and human being who takes on the hardest problems that face
*  humanity and refuses to accept the constraints of conventional thinking that made the solutions to
*  these problems seem impossible. I think Sam Harris is important to the world as a fearless voice who
*  fights for the pursuit of truth against growing forces of echo chambers and audience capture,
*  taking unpopular perspectives and defending them with rigor and resilience.
*  I both celebrate and criticize all three privately, and they criticize me, usually more
*  effectively, for which I always learn a lot and always appreciate. Most importantly, there is
*  respect and love for each other as human beings, the very thing that I think the world needs most
*  now in a time of division and chaos. I will continue to try to mend divisions, to try to
*  understand, not to ride, to turn the other cheek if needed, to return hate with love.
*  Sometimes people criticize me for being naive, cheesy, simplistic, all of that. I know. I agree.
*  But I really am speaking from the heart. And I'm trying. This world is too fucking beautiful not
*  to try. In whatever way I know how. I love you all. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Sam Harris.
*  What is more effective at making a net positive impact on the world? Empathy or reason?
*  It depends on what you mean by empathy. There are at least two kinds of empathy. There's the cognitive
*  form, which is, I would argue, even a species of reason. It's just understanding another person's
*  point of view. You understand why they're suffering or why they're happy. You have a theory of mind
*  about another human being that is accurate. And so you can navigate in relationship to them
*  more effectively. And then there's another layer entirely, not incompatible with that,
*  but just distinct, which is what people often mean by empathy, which is more
*  emotional contagion. You feel depressed and I begin to feel depressed along with you because
*  it's contagious. We're so close and I'm so concerned about you and your problems become
*  my problems and it bleeds through. Right now, I think both of those capacities are very important,
*  but the emotional contagion piece, and this is not really my thesis, this is something I have
*  more or less learned from Paul Bloom, the psychologist who wrote a book on this topic
*  titled Against Empathy. The emotional social contagion piece is a bad guide rather often
*  for ethical behavior and ethical intuitions. Oh, boy.
*  And so I'll give you the clear example of this, which is
*  we find stories with a single identifiable protagonist who we can effortlessly empathize
*  with far more compelling than data. So if I tell you, this is the classic case of the little girl
*  who falls down a well. This is somebody's daughter. You see the parents distraught on television.
*  You hear her cries from the bottom of the well. The whole country stops. There was an example of
*  this 20, 25 years ago, I think, where it was just wall to wall on CNN. This is just the perfect use
*  of CNN. It was 72 hours, whatever it was, of continuous coverage of just extracting this
*  girl from a well. So we effortlessly pay attention to that. We care about it. We will donate money
*  toward it. It marshals 100% of our compassion and altruistic impulse.
*  Whereas if you hear that there's a genocide raging in some country you've never been to
*  and never intended to go to, the numbers don't make a dent. And we find the story boring. We'll
*  change the channel in the face of a genocide. It doesn't matter. And it literally, perversely,
*  it could be 500,000 little girls have fallen down wells in that country and we still don't care.
*  Many of us have come to believe that this is a bug rather than a feature of our moral psychology.
*  And so empathy plays an unhelpful role there. So ultimately, I think, when we're making big
*  decisions about what we should do and how to mitigate human suffering and what's worth
*  valuing and how we should protect those values, I think reason is the better tool. But it's not
*  that I would want to dispense with any part of empathy either. Well, there's a lot of
*  changes to go on there. But briefly to mention, you've recently talked about effective altruism
*  on your podcast. I think you mentioned some interesting statement. I'm going to horribly
*  misquote you, but that you'd rather live in a world, like it doesn't really make sense,
*  but you'd rather live in a world where you care about maybe your daughter and son,
*  more than a hundred people that live across the world, something like this,
*  like where the calculus is not always perfect, but somehow it makes sense to live in a world where
*  it's irrational in this way. And yet empathetic in the way you've been discussing.
*  Right. I'm not sure what the right answer is there, or even whether there is one right answer that
*  could be multiple peaks on this part of the moral landscape. But the opposition is between an ethic
*  that's articulated by someone like the Dalai Lama, or really any exponent of classic Buddhism,
*  would say that the ultimate enlightened ethic is true dispassion with respect to friends and
*  strangers. The mind of the Buddha would be truly dispassionate. You would love
*  and care about all people equally. And by that light, it seems some kind of ethical failing,
*  or at least a failure to fully actualize compassion in the limit or enlightened wisdom in the limit,
*  to care more or even much more about your kids than the kids of other people, and to prioritize
*  your energy in that way. So you spend all this time trying to figure out how to keep your kids
*  healthy and happy, and you'll attend to their minutest concerns, however superficial. And again,
*  there's a genocide raging in Sudan or wherever, and it takes up less than 1% of your bandwidth.
*  I'm not sure it would be a better world if everyone was running the Dalai Lama program there.
*  I think some prioritization of one's nearest and dearest ethically might be optimal,
*  because we'll all be doing that, and we'll all be doing that in a circumstance where we have certain
*  norms and laws and other structures that force us to be dispassionate where that matters.
*  Like when my daughter gets sick, I have to take her to a hospital. I really want her to get
*  attention, and I'm worried about her more than I'm worried about everyone else in the lobby.
*  But the truth is, I actually don't want a totally corrupt hospital. I don't want a hospital that
*  treats my daughter better than anyone else in the lobby because she's my daughter, and I've bribed
*  the guy at the door or whatever, or the guy's a fan of my podcast, or whatever the thing is.
*  You don't want starkly corrupt, unfair situations. When you get pressed down
*  the hierarchy of Maslow's needs individually and societally, a bunch of those variables change,
*  and they change for the worse, understandably. But yeah, when everyone's corrupt and you're
*  in a state of collective emergency, you've got a lifeboat problem, you're scrambling to get into
*  the lifeboat, yeah, then fairness and norms and the other vestiges of civilization
*  begin to get stripped off. We can't reason from those emergencies to normal life. In normal life,
*  we want justice, we want fairness, we're all better off for it even when the spotlight of
*  our concern is focused on the people we know, the people who are friends, the people who are family,
*  people we have good reason to care about. We still, by default, want a system that protects
*  the interests of strangers too, and we know that generally speaking, just in game theoretic terms,
*  we're all going to tend to be better off in a fairer system than a corrupt one.
*  One of the failure modes of empathy is our susceptibility to anecdotal data. Just a good
*  story will get us to not think clearly. But what about empathy in the context of just discussing
*  ideas with other people? And then there's a large number of people, like in this country,
*  red and blue, half the population believes certain things on immigration or on the response
*  to the pandemic or any kind of controversial issue, even if the election was fairly executed.
*  Having an empathy for their worldview, trying to understand where they're coming from,
*  not just in the explicit statement of their idea, but the entirety of the roots from which their
*  idea stems, that kind of empathy while you're discussing ideas. What is in your pursuit of
*  truth, having empathy for the perspective of a large number of other people
*  versus raw mathematical reason? I think it's important, but it only takes you so far.
*  It doesn't get you to truth. Truth is not decided by democratic principles. And
*  certain people believe things for understandable reasons, but those reasons are nonetheless bad,
*  they don't scale, they don't generalize, they're not reasons anyone should adopt for themselves or
*  respect epistemologically. And yet their circumstance is understandable and it's
*  something you can care about. I think there's many examples of this that you might be thinking of,
*  but one that comes to mind is I've been super critical of Trump, obviously, and
*  I've been super critical of certain people for endorsing him or not criticizing him when he
*  really made it patently obvious who he was, if there had been any doubt initially.
*  There was no doubt when we have a sitting president who's not agreeing to a peaceful transfer of
*  power. I'm critical of all of that and yet the fact that many millions of Americans didn't see
*  what was wrong with Trump or didn't see through his con, they bought into the idea that he was a
*  brilliant businessman who might just be able to change things because he's so unconventional and
*  so his heart is in the right place. He's really a man of the people even though he's gold-plated
*  everything in his life. They bought the myth somehow of largely because they had seen him on
*  television for almost a decade and a half, pretending to be this genius businessman who
*  could get things done. It's understandable to me that many very frustrated people who have
*  not had their hopes and dreams actualized, who have been the victims of globalism and
*  many other current trends, it's understandable that they would be confused and not see the
*  liability of electing a grossly incompetent, morbidly narcissistic person into the presidency.
*  So which is to say that I don't blame, there are many, many millions of people who I don't
*  necessarily blame for the Trump phenomenon but I can nonetheless bemoan the phenomenon as indicative
*  of very bad state of affairs in our society. So there's two levels to it. I think you have
*  to call a spade a spade when you're talking about how things actually work and what things are
*  likely to happen or not but then you can recognize that people have very different life experiences
*  and I think empathy and probably the better word for what I would hope to embody there is compassion.
*  To really wish people well and to really wish strangers well, effortlessly wish them well,
*  and to realize that there is no opposition between selfishness and selflessness because
*  wise selfishness really takes into account other people's happiness. Do you want to live
*  in a society where you have everything but most other people have nothing or do you want to live
*  in a society where you're surrounded by happy, creative, self-actualized people who are having
*  their hopes and dreams realized? I think it's obvious that the second society is much better
*  however much you can guard your good luck. But what about having empathy for certain principles
*  that people believe? For example, the pushback, the other perspective on this because you said
*  bought the myth of Trump as the great businessman. There could be a lot of people that are supporters
*  of Trump who could say that Sam Harris bought the myth that we have this government of the people,
*  by the people, that actually represents the people as opposed to a bunch of elites who are running a
*  giant bureaucracy that is corrupt, that is feeding themselves and they're actually not representing
*  the people. And then here's this chaos agent Trump who speaks off the top of his head,
*  yeah, he's flawed in all this number of ways. He's more comedian than he is a presidential
*  type of figure and he's actually creating the kind of chaos that's going to shake up this bureaucracy,
*  shake up the elites that are so uncomfortable because they don't want the world to know about
*  the game they got running on everybody else. So that's a kind of perspective that they would take
*  and say, yeah, there's these flaws that Trump has, but this is necessary.
*  I agree with the first part. So I haven't bought the myth that it's a truly representative
*  democracy in the way that we might idealize. And on some level, I mean, this is a different
*  conversation, but on some level, I'm not even sure how much I think it should be. I'm not sure
*  how much we want in the end everyone's opinion given equal weight about just what we should do
*  about anything. And I include myself in that. I mean, there are many topics around which
*  I don't deserve to have a strong opinion because I don't know what I'm talking about
*  or what I would be talking about if I had a strong opinion. And I think we'll probably get to that,
*  to some of those topics because I've declined to have certain conversations on my podcast just
*  because I think I'm the wrong person to have that conversation. And I think it's important to see
*  those bright lines in one's life and in the moment politically and ethically. So yeah, I think,
*  so leave aside the viability of democracy, I'm under no illusions that all of our institutions
*  are worth preserving precisely as they have been up until the moment. This great orange wrecking
*  ball came swinging through our lives. But it was a very bad bet to elect someone who is
*  grossly incompetent and worse than incompetent, genuinely malevolent in his selfishness.
*  And this is something we know based on literally decades of him being in the public eye. He's not
*  a public servant in any normal sense of that term. And he couldn't possibly give an honest
*  or sane answer to the question you asked me about empathy and reason and like, how should we,
*  what should guide us? I genuinely think he is missing some necessary moral and psychological
*  tools. And this is, I can feel compassion for him as a human being because I think
*  having those things is incredibly important and genuinely loving other people is incredibly
*  important. And knowing what all that's about is, that's really the good stuff in life. And I
*  am, I think he's missing a lot of that. But I think we don't want to promote people to
*  the highest positions of power in our society who are far outliers in pathological terms. We want
*  them to be far outliers in the best case, in wisdom and compassion and some of the things you've,
*  some of the topics you've brought up. And we want someone to be deeply informed. We want someone to
*  be unusually curious, unusually alert to how they may be wrong or getting things wrong
*  consequentially. He's none of those things. And in so far as we're going to get normal
*  mediocrities in that role, which I think is often the best we could expect, let's get normal
*  mediocrities in that role, not once in a generation narcissists and
*  frauds. I mean, it's like the, I mean, just take honesty as a single variable, right? I think you
*  want, yes, it's possible that most politicians lie at least some of the time. I don't think
*  that's a good thing. I think people should be generally honest, even to a fault. Yes,
*  there are certain circumstances where lying I think is necessary. It's kind of on a continuum
*  of self-defense and violence. So it's like if you're going to, if the Nazis come to your door
*  and ask you if you've got Anne Frank in the attic, I think it's okay to lie to them. But
*  Trump, there's, arguably there's never been a person that anyone could name in human history
*  who's lied with that kind of velocity. I mean, it's just, he was just a blizzard of lies,
*  great and small, to pointless and effective. But it was just, it says something
*  fairly alarming about our society that a person of that character got promoted. And so, yes,
*  I have compassion and concern for half of the society who didn't see it that way. And that's
*  going to sound elitist and smug or something for anyone who's on that side listening to me. But
*  it's genuine. I mean, I understand that I barely have the, I'm like one of the luckiest people in
*  the world and I barely have the bandwidth to pay attention to half the things I should pay attention
*  to in order to have an opinion about half the things we're going to talk about. So how much
*  less bandwidth to somebody who's working two jobs or a single mom who's raising multiple kids,
*  even a single kid. It's just, it's unimaginable to me that people have the bandwidth to really track
*  this stuff. And so then they jump on social media and they get inundated by misinformation and
*  they see what their favorite influencer just said. And now they're worried about vaccines and it's
*  just, it's, we're living in an environment where our information space has become so corrupted.
*  We've built machines to further corrupt it. I mean, we've built a business model for the internet
*  that it further corrupts it. So it's, it is just, it's chaos in informational terms. And
*  I don't fault people for being confused and impatient and at their wits end.
*  And yes, Trump was an enormous fuck you to the establishment. And that was understandable for
*  many reasons. To me, Sam Harris, the great Sam Harris is somebody I've looked up to for a long time
*  as a beacon of voice of reason. And there's this meme on the internet. And I would love you to
*  steel man the case for it. And against that Trump broke Sam Harris's brain,
*  that there is something is disproportionately to the actual impact that Trump had on our society.
*  He had an impact on the ability of balanced, calm, rational minds to see the world clearly,
*  to think clearly you being one of the beacons of that. Is there a degree to which he broke your
*  brain? Otherwise known as Trump derangement syndrome, medical condition. Yeah. I think Trump
*  derangement syndrome is a very clever meme because it just throws the problem back on the person
*  who's criticizing Trump. But in truth, the true Trump derangement syndrome was not to have seen
*  how dangerous and divisive it would be to promote someone like Trump to that position of power. And
*  and in the final moment, not to see how untenable it was to still support someone who, a sitting
*  president who was not committing to a peaceful transfer of power. I mean, if that wasn't a bright
*  line for you, you have been deranged by something because that was one minute to midnight for our
*  democracy as far as I'm concerned. And I think it really was but for the integrity of a few people
*  that we didn't suffer some real constitutional crisis and real emergency after January 6th.
*  I mean, if Mike Pence had caved in and decided to not certify the election, right? Literally,
*  you can count on two hands the number of people who held things together at that moment. And so
*  it wasn't for want of trying on Trump's part that we didn't succumb to some real truly uncharted
*  catastrophe with our democracy. So the fact that that didn't happen is not a sign that those of us
*  who were worried that it was so close to happening were exaggerating the problem.
*  I mean, it's like you almost got run over by a car, but you didn't. And so the fact that you're
*  adrenalized and you're thinking, boy, that was dangerous. I probably shouldn't wander in the
*  middle of the street with my eyes closed. You weren't wrong to feel that you really had a problem
*  and came very close to something truly terrible. So I think that's where we were and I think we
*  shouldn't do that again. So the fact that he's coming back around as potentially a viable
*  candidate, I'm not spending much time thinking about it, frankly, because I'm waiting for the
*  moment where it requires some thought. I mean, it took up, I don't know how many podcasts I devoted
*  to the topic. It wasn't that many in the end against the number of podcasts I devoted to other
*  topics, but there are people who look at Trump and just find him funny, entertaining, not
*  especially threatening. It's just good fun to see somebody who's just not taking anything seriously
*  and it's just putting a stick in the wheel of business as usual again and again and again
*  and again. They don't really see anything much at stake. It doesn't really matter if we don't
*  support NATO. It doesn't really matter if he says he trusts Putin more than our intelligence services.
*  It doesn't matter if he's on the one hand saying that he loves
*  the leader of North Korea and on the other threatening to bomb them back to the stone
*  age on Twitter. It all can be taken in the spirit of reality television. This is the part of the
*  movie that's just fun to watch. I understand that. I can even inhabit that space for a few minutes
*  at a time, but there's a deeper concern that we're in the process of entertaining ourselves to death,
*  that we're just not taking things seriously. This is a problem I've had with several other people
*  we might name who just appear to me to be goofing around at scale and they lack a kind of
*  moral seriousness. They're touching big problems where lives hang in the balance,
*  but they're just fucking around. I think they're really important problems that we have to get
*  our heads straight around. It's not to say that institutions don't become corrupt. I think they
*  do. I'm quite worried both about the loss of trust in our institutions and the fact that trust
*  has eroded for good reason, that they have become less trustworthy. They've become infected by
*  political ideologies that are not truth tracking. I worry about all of that,
*  but I just think we need institutions. We need to rebuild them. We need experts who are real experts
*  to value expertise over amateurish speculation and conspiracy thinking and bullshit.
*  The kind of amateur speculation we're doing on this very podcast.
*  I'm usually alert to the moments where I'm just guessing or where I actually feel like I'm
*  talking from within my wheelhouse. I try to telegraph that a fair amount with people.
*  It's different. You can invite someone onto your podcast who's an expert about something that you're
*  not an expert about. Then you, in the process of getting more informed yourself, your audience is
*  getting more informed. You're asking smart questions. You might be pushing back at the margins,
*  but you know that when push comes to shove on that topic, you really don't have a basis to have a
*  strong opinion. If you were going to form a strong opinion that was this counter to the expert you
*  have in front of you, it's going to be by deference to some other expert who you've brought in or who
*  you've heard about or whose work you've read or whatever. There's a paradox to how we value
*  authority in science that most people don't understand. I think we should at some point
*  unravel that because it's the basis for a lot of public confusion. Frankly, it's the basis for a
*  lot of criticism I've received on these topics. People think that I'm against free speech or I'm
*  an establishment shill or it's like I just think I'm a credentialist. I just think people with PhDs
*  from Ivy League universities should run everything. It's not true, but there's a
*  ton of confusion. There's a lot to cut through to get to daylight there because people are
*  very confused about how we value authority in the service of rationality generally.
*  You've talked about it, but it's just interesting the intensity of feeling you have. You've had this
*  famous phrase about Hunter Biden and children in the basement. Can you just revisit this case?
*  Let me give another perspective on the situation of January 6th and Trump in general.
*  It's possible that January 6th and things of that nature revealed that our democracy is actually
*  pretty fragile and that Trump is not a malevolent and ultra competent malevolent figure.
*  It's simply a jokester. He just by creating the chaos revealed that it's all pretty fragile
*  because you're a student of history and there's a lot of people like Vladimir Lenin,
*  Hitler who are exceptionally competent at controlling power, at being executives and
*  taking that power, controlling the generals, controlling all the figures involved, and
*  certainly not tweeting, but working in the shadows behind the scenes to gain power.
*  They did so extremely competently and that is how they were able to gain power.
*  The pushback with Trump was doing none of that. He was creating what he's very good at, creating
*  drama, sometimes for humor's sake, sometimes for drama's sake, and simply revealed that our
*  democracy is fragile. He's not this once in a generation horrible figure, once in a generation
*  narcissist. I don't think he's a truly scary, sinister, Putin-like or much less Hitler-like
*  figure. Not at all. He's not ideological. He doesn't care about anything beyond himself.
*  He's much less scary than any really scary totalitarian.
*  He's more brave in your world than 1984.
*  This is what Eric Weinstein never stops badgering me about, but he's still wrong,
*  Eric. My analogy for Trump was that he's an evil Chauncey Gardner. I don't know if you remember
*  the book or the film Being There with Peter Sellers. Peter Sellers is this
*  gardener who really doesn't know anything, but he gets recognized as this wise man and he gets
*  promoted to immense power in Washington because he's speaking in a semblance of wisdom. He's got
*  these very simple aphorisms or what seem to be aphorisms. All he cares about is gardening.
*  He's just talking about his garden all the time, but he'll say something, but in the spring,
*  the new shoots will bloom and people read into that some kind of genius insight politically,
*  and so he gets promoted. That's the joke of the film. For me, Trump has always been someone like
*  an evil Chauncey Gardner. It's not to say he's totally... Yes, he has a certain kind of genius.
*  He's got a genius for creating a spectacle around himself. He's got a genius for getting the eye of
*  the media always coming back to him, but it's a kind of self-promotion that only works if you
*  actually are truly shameless and don't care about having a reputation for anything that I or you
*  would want to have a reputation for. It's like the pure pornography of attention, and he just wants
*  more of it. I think the truly depressing and genuinely scary thing was that we have a country
*  at least half of the country, given how broken our society is in many ways. We have a country that
*  didn't see anything wrong with that, bringing someone who obviously doesn't know what he should
*  know to be president and who's obviously not a good person, who obviously doesn't care about
*  people, can't even pretend to care about people really in a credible way. If there's a silver
*  lining to this, it's along the lines you just sketched, it shows us how vulnerable our system
*  is to a truly brilliant and sinister figure. I think we really dodged a bullet. Yes, someone far
*  more competent and conniving and ideological could have exploited our system in a way that Trump
*  didn't. If we plug those holes eventually, that would be a good thing, and he would have done a
*  good thing for our society. One of the things we realized, and I think nobody knew, I certainly
*  didn't know it and I didn't hear anyone talk about it, is how much our system relies on norms rather
*  than laws. Yes, civility. It's quite possible that he never did anything illegal, truly illegal.
*  I think he probably did a few illegal things, but illegal such that he really should be thrown in
*  jail for it. At least that remains to be seen. All of the chaos, all of the
*  diminishment of our stature in the world, all of the opportunity costs of spending years focused on
*  nonsense, all of that was just norm violations. All of that was just all a matter of not
*  saying the thing you should say, but that doesn't mean they're insignificant. It's not illegal
*  for a sitting president to say, no, I'm not going to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
*  We'll wait and see whether I win. If I win, the election was valid. If I lose, it was fraudulent.
*  Aren't those humorous perturbations to our system of civility such that we know what the limits are
*  and now we start to think that and have these kinds of discussions?
*  That wasn't a humorous perturbation because he did everything he could. Granted, he wasn't very
*  competent, but he did everything he could to try to steal the election. The irony is he claimed to
*  have an election stolen from him, all the while doing everything he could to steal it,
*  declaring it fraudulent in advance, trying to get the votes to not be counted as the evening wore
*  on, knowing that they were going to be disproportionately Democrat votes because of the
*  position he took on mail-in ballots. All of it was fairly calculated. The whole circus of
*  the clown car that crashed into Four Seasons landscaping and you got Rudy Giuliani with his
*  hair dye and you got Sidney Powell and all these grossly incompetent people lying as freely as they
*  could breathe about election fraud. All of these things are getting thrown out by largely Republican
*  election officials and Republican judges. It wasn't for want of trying that he didn't.
*  Maintain his power in this country. He really tried to steal the presidency.
*  He just was not competent and the people around him weren't competent. That's a good thing and
*  it's worth not letting that happen again. But he wasn't competent so he didn't do everything he could.
*  No, he did everything he could. He didn't do everything that could have been done by someone
*  more competent. Right, but the tools you have as a president, you could do a lot of things. You can
*  declare emergencies, especially during COVID. You could postpone the election. You can create
*  military conflict. Any kind of reason to postpone the election. There's a lot of stuff.
*  He tried to do things and he would have to have done those things through other people and there
*  are people who refused to do those things. There are people who said they would quit. They would
*  quit publicly. There are multiple books written about the last hours of this presidency and
*  the details are shocking in what he tried to do and tried to get others to do. It's awful.
*  It's just awful that we were that close to a true unraveling of our political process.
*  I mean, it's the only time in our lifetime that anything like this has happened.
*  It's deeply embarrassing on the world stage. It's just like we looked like a banana republic there
*  for a while and we're the lone superpower. It's not good. The people who thought,
*  well, we just need to shake things up and this is a great way to shake things up and having people
*  storm our Capitol and smear shit on the walls, that's just more shaking things up.
*  It's all just for the lulls. There's a nihilism and cynicism to all of that, which again,
*  in certain people it's understandable. Frankly, it's not understandable if you've got a billion
*  dollars and you have a compound in Menlo Park or wherever. There are people who are cheerleading
*  this stuff who shouldn't be cheerleading this stuff and who know that they can get on their
*  Gulfstream and fly to their compound in New Zealand if everything goes to shit.
*  Right? So there's a cynicism to all of that that I think we should be deeply critical of.
*  What I'm trying to understand is not and analyze is not the behavior of this particular human being,
*  but the effect it had in part on the division between people. To me, the degree, the meme
*  of Sam Harris's brain being broken by Trump represents, you're like the person I would
*  look to to bridge the division. Well, I don't think there is something profitably to be said
*  to someone who's truly captivated by the personality cult of Trumpism. There's nothing
*  that I'm going to say to, there's no conversation I'm going to have with Candace Owens say about
*  Trump that's going to converge on something reasonable. You don't think so? No, I haven't
*  tried with Candace, but I've tried with many people who are in that particular orbit. I've
*  had conversations with people who won't admit that there's anything wrong with Trump, anything.
*  I'd like to push for the empathy versus reason. When you operate in the space of reason, yes,
*  but I think there's a lot of power in you showing, in you, Sam Harris, showing that you're
*  willing to see the good qualities of Trump publicly showing that. I think that's the way to win over
*  the Candace Owens. But he has so few of them. He has fewer good qualities than virtually anyone
*  I can name. He's funny. I'll grant you that he's funny. He's a good entertainer.
*  There's others. Look at just policies and actual impacts he had.
*  I've admitted that. No, no. I've admitted that many of his policies I agree with,
*  many, many of his policies. Probably more often than not, at least on balance, I agreed with his
*  policy that we should take China seriously as an adversary. There's a lot of fine print to a lot
*  of this because the way he talks about these things and many of his motives that are obvious
*  are things that I don't support. But take immigration. I think it's obvious that we
*  should have control of our borders. I don't see the argument for not having control of our borders.
*  We should let in who we want to let in and we should keep out who we want to keep out
*  and we should have a sane immigration policy. I didn't necessarily think it was a priority to
*  build the wall, but I never criticized the impulse to build the wall because if tens of
*  thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are coming across that border and we are not in a
*  position to know who's coming, that seems untenable to me. I can recognize that many people in our
*  society are on balance, the victims of immigration. There is in many cases a zero-sum contest between
*  the interests of actual citizens and the interests of immigrants. I think we should have control of
*  our borders. We should have a sane and compassionate immigration policy. We should let in
*  refugees. Trump on refugees was terrible. But I would say 80% of the policy concerns people
*  celebrated in him are concerns that I either share entirely or certainly sympathize with.
*  That's not the issue. The issue is largely what you said it was. It's not so much the person,
*  it's the effect on everything he touches. He has this superpower of deranging and destabilizing
*  almost everything he touches and compromising the integrity of almost anyone who comes into
*  his orbit. As you looked at these people who served as chief of staff or in various cabinet
*  positions, people had real reputations for probity and levelheadedness, whether you
*  shared their politics or not. These were real people. Some of them were goofballs, but
*  many people who just got totally trashed by proximity to him and then trashed by him when
*  they finally parted company with him, yeah, it's just people bent over backwards to accommodate
*  his norm violations. It was bad for them and it was bad for our system.
*  None of that discounts the fact that we have a system that really needs a proper house cleaning.
*  Yes, there are bad incentives and entrenched interests. I'm not a fan of the concept of
*  the deep state because it has been so propagandized, but yes, there's something like that
*  that is not flexible enough to respond intelligently to the needs of the moment.
*  There's a lot of rethinking of government and of institutions in general that I think
*  we should do, but we need smart, well-informed, well-intentioned people to do that job.
*  The well-intentioned part is hugely important. Just give me someone who is not the most
*  selfish person anyone has ever heard about in their lifetime. What we got with Trump was
*  literally the one most selfish person I think anyone could name. Again, there's so much known
*  about this man. That's the thing. It predates his presidency. We knew this guy 30 years ago.
*  This is what, to come back to those inflammatory comments about Hunter Biden's laptop,
*  the reason why I can say with confidence that I don't care what was on his laptop is that
*  and that includes any evidence of corruption on the part of his father.
*  There's been precious little of that that's actually emerged. It's like there is no,
*  as far as I can tell, there's not a big story associated with that laptop as much as people
*  bang on about a few emails, but even if there were just obvious corruption, like Joe Biden
*  was at this meeting and he took this amount of money from this shady guy for bad reasons,
*  given how visible the lives of these two men have been, given how much we know about Joe Biden and
*  how much we know about Donald Trump and how they have lived in public for almost as long as I've
*  been alive, both of them, the scale of corruption can't possibly balance out between the two of them.
*  If you show me that Joe Biden has this secret life where he's driving a Bugatti and he's
*  living like Andrew Tate and he's doing all these things I didn't know about, okay, then I'm going
*  to start getting a sense that, all right, maybe this guy is way more corrupt than I realized.
*  Maybe there is some deal in Ukraine or with China that is just like this guy is not who he seems.
*  He's not the public servant he's been pretending to be. He's been on the take for decades and
*  decades and he's just, he's as dirty as can be. He's all mobbed up and it's a nightmare
*  and he can't be trusted. That's possible if you show me that his life is not at all what it seems,
*  but on the assumption that having looked at this guy for literally decades
*  and knowing that every journalist has looked at him for decades, just how many affairs is he having,
*  just how many drugs is he doing, how many houses does he have, what are the obvious conflicts of
*  interest? You hold that against what we know about Trump and the litany of indiscretions,
*  you can put on Trump's side that testify to his personal corruption, to testify to the fact that
*  he has no ethical compass. There's simply no comparison, right? So that's why I don't care
*  about what's on the laptop. Now, if you tell me Trump is no longer running for president in 2024
*  and we can put Trumpism behind us and now you're saying, listen, there's a lot of stuff on that
*  laptop that makes Joe Biden look like a total asshole. Okay, I'm all ears. In 2020, it was a
*  forced choice between a sitting president who wouldn't commit to a peaceful transfer of power
*  and a guy who's obviously too old to be president, who has a crack addicted son,
*  who lost his laptop. And I just knew that I was going to take Biden in spite of whatever litany
*  of horrors was going to come tumbling out of that laptop. And that might involve sort of,
*  so the actual quote is Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses of children
*  in the basement. There's a dark humor to it, right? Which is, I think you speak to,
*  I would not have cared. There's nothing, it's Hunter Biden, it's not Joe Biden.
*  Whatever the scope of Joe Biden's corruption is, it is infinitesimally compared to the corruption.
*  We know Trump was involved in, it's like a firefly to the sun, is what you're speaking to. But let me
*  make the case that you're really focused on the surface stuff, that it's possible to have
*  corruption that masquerades in the thing we mentioned, which is civility. You can spend
*  hundreds of billions of dollars or trillions towards the war in the Middle East, for example.
*  Something that you've changed your mind on in terms of the negative impact it has on the world.
*  And that, the military industrial complex, everybody's very nice, everybody's very civil,
*  it's very upfront. Here's how we're spending the money. Yeah, it's sometimes somehow disappears
*  in different places, but that's the way war is complicated. And it's everyone is very polite.
*  There's no Coke and strippers or whatever is on the laptop. It's very nice and polite.
*  In the meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of civilians die of hate. Just an incredible
*  amount of hate is created because people lose their family members, all that kind of stuff,
*  but there's no strippers and Coke on a laptop. Yeah, but it's not just superficial. It is,
*  when someone only wants wealth and power and fame, that is their objective function. They're like a
*  robot that is calibrated just to those variables. And they don't care about the risks we run on any
*  other front. They don't care about environmental risk, pandemic risk, nuclear proliferation risk,
*  none of it. They're just tracking fame and money and whatever can personally
*  redound to their self-interest along those lines. And they're not informed about the other risks
*  we're running really. In Trump, you had a president who was repeatedly asking his generals,
*  why couldn't we use our nuclear weapons? Why can't we have more of them? Why do I have fewer
*  nuclear weapons than JFK? As though that were a sign of anything other than progress.
*  And this is the guy who's got the button. Somebody's following him around with a bag
*  waiting to take his order to launch. It's a risk we should never run. One thing Trump has going
*  for him, I think, is that he doesn't drink or do drugs. People allege that he does speed, but
*  let's take him at his word. He's not deranging himself with pharmaceuticals, at least, but
*  apart from Diet Coke. There's nothing wrong. Just for the record, let me push back on that.
*  There's nothing wrong with Diet Coke. I consume a very large amount.
*  I occasionally have some myself. There's no scientific evidence that I observed
*  the negatives of all those studies about aspartame and all that. I don't know.
*  I hope you're right. Everything you said about the military industrial complex is
*  true. We've been worrying about that on both sides of the aisle for a very long time. That
*  phrase came from Eisenhower. So much of what ails us is a story of bad incentives.
*  Bad incentives are so powerful that they corrupt even good people. How much more do they corrupt
*  bad people? At minimum, you want reasonably good people, at least non-pathological people,
*  in the system trying to navigate against the grain of bad incentives. Better still,
*  all of us can get together and try to diagnose those incentives and change them.
*  We will really succeed when we have a system of incentives where
*  the good incentives are so strong that even bad people are effortlessly behaving as though
*  they're good people because they're so successfully incentivized to behave that way.
*  It's almost the inversion of our current situation. Yes, and you say I changed my
*  mind about the war. Not quite. I was never a supporter of the war in Iraq. I was always
*  worried that it was a distraction from the war in Afghanistan. I was a supporter of the war in
*  Afghanistan. I will admit in hindsight, that looks like at best a highly ambiguous and painful
*  exercise, more likely a fool's errand. It did not turn out well. It wasn't for want of trying.
*  I have not done a deep dive on all of the failures there. Maybe all of these failures are failures
*  in principle. Maybe that's not the kind of thing that can be done well by anybody, whatever our
*  intentions. The move to Iraq always seemed questionable to me. When we knew the immediate
*  problem at that moment, Al-Qaeda was in Afghanistan and then bounced into Pakistan.
*  Anyway, yes, but my sense of the possibility of nation building, my sense of insofar as the
*  neocon spirit of responsibility and idealism that America was the kind of nation that should
*  be functioning in this way as the world's cop. We have to get in there and untangle some of these
*  knots by force rather often because if we don't do it over there, we're going to have to do it
*  over here kind of thing. Yes, some of that has definitely changed for me in my thinking.
*  There are obviously cultural reasons why it failed in Afghanistan. If you can't change the culture,
*  you're not going to force a change at gunpoint in the culture. It certainly seems that that's not
*  going to happen. It took us over 20 years apparently to realize that.
*  That's one of the things you realize with the wars. There's not going to be a strong
*  signal that things are not working. You can just keep pouring money into a thing, a military effort.
*  Well, also there are signs of it working too. You have all the stories of girls now going
*  to school. The girls are getting battery acid thrown in their faces by religious maniacs.
*  Then we come in there and we stop that. Now girls are getting educated and that's all good. Our
*  intentions are good there. We're on the right side of history there. Girls should be going to school.
*  Malala Yousafzai should have the Nobel Prize and she shouldn't have been shot in the face by
*  the Taliban. We know what the right answers are there. The question is, what do you do
*  when there are enough, in this particular case, religious maniacs who are willing to die and let
*  their children die in defense of crazy ideas and moral norms that belong in the seventh century?
*  It's a problem we couldn't solve and we couldn't solve it even though we spent
*  trillions of dollars to solve it.
*  Lennie This reminded me of the thing that you and Jack Dorsey jokingly had for a while,
*  the discussion about banning Donald Trump from Twitter. Does any of it bother you now that
*  Twitter files came out? It has to do with the Hunter Biden laptop story. Does it bother you
*  that there could be a collection of people that make decisions about who to ban and not
*  and that could be susceptible to bias and to ideological influence?
*  Dave Well, I think it always will be or in the absence of perfect AI, it always will be.
*  Lennie This becomes relevant with AI as well
*  because there's some censorship on AI happening and it's an interesting question there as well.
*  I don't think Twitter is as important as people think it is. I used to think it was more important
*  when I was on it and now that I'm off of it, first let me say it's just an unambiguously good thing
*  in my experience to lease your Twitter account. Even the good parts of Twitter that I miss
*  were bad in the aggregate, the degree to which it was fragmenting my attention, the degree to which
*  my life was getting doled out to me in periods between those moments where I checked Twitter
*  and had my attention diverted. I was not a crazy Twitter addict. I was probably a pretty normal
*  user. I was not someone who was tweeting multiple times a day or even every day.
*  I think I probably averaged something like one tweet a day. In reality, it would be like four
*  tweets one day and then I wouldn't tweet for the better part of a week. I was looking a lot because
*  it was my newsfeed. I was just following 200 very smart people and I just wanted to see what they
*  were paying attention to. They would recommend articles and I would read those articles.
*  Then when I would read an article that I thought I should signal boost, I would tweet. All of that
*  seemed good and that's all separable from all of the odious bullshit that came back at me
*  largely in response to this Hunter Biden thing. But even the good stuff has a downside. It comes
*  at just this point of your phone is this perpetual stimulus which is intrinsically
*  fragmenting of time and attention. Now my phone is much less of a presence in my life. It's not
*  that I don't check Slack or check email. I use it to work. But my sense of just what the world is
*  and my sense of my place in the world, the sense of where I exist as a person has changed a lot
*  by deleting my Twitter account. We all know this phenomenon. We say of someone that person is too
*  online. What does it mean to be too online and where do you draw that boundary? How do you know?
*  What constitutes being too online? Well, in some sense, I think being on social media at all
*  is to be too online. Given what it does to, given the kinds of information it signal boosts and
*  given the impulse it kindles in each of us to reach out to our audience in specific moments
*  and in specific ways. There are lots of moments now where I have an opinion about something,
*  but there's nothing for me to do with that opinion. There's no Twitter. There are lots of things
*  that I would have tweeted in the last months that are not the kind of thing I'm going to do a podcast
*  about. I'm not going to roll out 10 minutes on that topic on my podcast. I'm not going to take
*  the time to really think about it. But had I been on Twitter, I would have reacted to this thing in
*  the news or this thing that somebody did. What do you do with that thought now?
*  I just let go of it. Chocolate ice cream is the most delicious thing ever.
*  It's usually not that sort of thing. But then you look at the kinds of problems people create for
*  themselves. You look at the life deranging and reputation destroying things that people do.
*  The analogous things that have happened to me, the things that have really bent my life around
*  professionally over the past decade, so much of it is Twitter. Honestly, in my case, almost 100%
*  of it was Twitter. The controversies I would get into, the things I would think I would have to
*  respond to in a podcast, like I would release a podcast on a certain topic, I would see some
*  blowback on Twitter, it would give me the sense that there was some signal that I really had to
*  respond to. Now that I'm off Twitter, I recognize that most of that was just totally specious. It
*  was not something I had to respond to. But yet I would then do a cycle of podcasts responding to
*  that thing, like taking my foot out of my mouth or taking someone else's foot out of my mouth.
*  It became this self-perpetuating cycle, which
*  if you're having fun, great. If it's generative of useful information and engagement professionally
*  and psychologically, great. There was some of that on Twitter. There were people who I connected
*  with because one of us DM'd the other on Twitter and it was hard to see how that was going to happen
*  otherwise. But it was largely just a machine for manufacturing unnecessary controversy.
*  Do you think it's possible to avoid the drug of that? Now that you've achieved this zen state,
*  is it possible for somebody like you to use it in a way that doesn't pull you into the whirlpool?
*  Anytime there's attacks, that's how I tried to use it.
*  Yeah, but it's not the way I wanted to use it. It's not the way it promises itself as a-
*  You wanted to have debate.
*  I wanted to actually communicate with people. I wanted to hear from the person because,
*  again, it's like being in Afghanistan. There are the potted cases where it's obviously good.
*  In Afghanistan, the girl who's getting an education, that is just here. That's why we're
*  here. That's obviously good. I have those moments on Twitter where it's like, okay,
*  I'm hearing from a smart person who's detected an error I made in my podcast or in a book,
*  or they've just got some great idea about something that I should spend time on. I would never have
*  heard from this person in any other format and now I'm actually in dialogue with them. It's
*  fantastic. That's the promise of it, to actually talk to people. I kept getting lured back into that.
*  No, the same or sanity preserving way of using it is just as a marketing channel. You just put
*  your stuff out there and you don't look at what's coming back at you. I'm on other social media
*  platforms that I don't even touch. My team posts stuff on Facebook and on Instagram. I never even
*  see what's on there.
*  So you don't think it's possible to see something and not let it affect your mind?
*  No, that's definitely possible. I did that for vast stretches of time.
*  But then the promise of the platform is dialogue and feedback. If I know, for whatever reason,
*  I'm going to see 99 to 1 awful feedback, bad faith feedback, malicious feedback. Some of
*  it's probably even bots and I'm not even aware of who's a person and who's a bot.
*  But I'm just going to stare into this funhouse mirror of acrimony and dishonesty. The reason
*  why I got off is not because I couldn't recalibrate and find equanimity again with all
*  the nastiness that was coming back at me and not that I couldn't ignore it for vast stretches of
*  time. But I could see that I kept coming back to it hoping that it would be something that I could
*  use, a real tool for communication. I was noticing that it was insidiously changing the way I felt
*  about people, both people I know and people I don't know. Mutual friends of ours who are behaving in
*  certain ways on Twitter, which just seemed insane to me, and I was just trying to get
*  insane to me. That became a signal I felt like I had to take into account somehow. You're seeing
*  people at their worst, both friends and strangers. I felt that as much as I could try to recalibrate
*  for it, I felt that I was losing touch with what was real information because people are performing,
*  people are faking, people are not themselves. You're seeing people at their worst.
*  And so I felt like, all right, was being advertised to me here on not just a daily basis,
*  an hourly basis or an increment sometimes of multiple times an hour. I probably checked Twitter
*  at minimum 10 times a day, and maybe I was checking it 100 times a day on some days,
*  right, where things were really active and I was really engaged with something.
*  What was being delivered into my brain there was subtly false information about how dishonest and
*  generally unethical, totally normal people are capable of being. It is a funhouse mirror.
*  I was seeing the most grotesque versions of people who I know. People who I know I could sit down at
*  dinner with and they would never behave this way. And yet they were coming at me on Twitter.
*  It was essentially turning ordinary people into sociopaths. People are just,
*  and there are analogies that many of us have made. One analogy is road rage. People behave
*  in the confines of a car in ways that they never would if they didn't have this metal box around
*  them moving at speed. All of that becomes quite hilarious and obviously dysfunctional when they
*  actually have to stop at the light next to the person they just flipped off. And they
*  realized they didn't understand that the person coming out of that car next to them with cauliflower
*  ear is someone who they never would have rolled their eyes at in public because they would have
*  taken one look at this person and realized this is the last person you want to fight with.
*  That's one of the heartbreaking things is to see people who I know, who I admire,
*  who I know are friends, be everything from snarky to downright mean derisive towards each other.
*  It doesn't make any sense. This is the only place where I've seen people I really admire
*  who have had a calm head about most things, like really be shitty to other people. It's
*  probably the only place I've seen that. And I choose to maybe believe that that's not really
*  them. There's something about the system. Like if you go paintballing, if you, Jordan Peterson,
*  and whoever, you're going to shoot your friends. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to shoot your friends,
*  but you kind of accept that that's kind of what you're doing in this little game that you're
*  playing. But it's sometimes hard to remind yourself of that.
*  And I think I was guilty of that, definitely.
*  There's nothing, I don't think I ever did anything that I
*  really feel bad about, but yeah, it was always pushing me to the edge of snide-ness somehow.
*  And it's just not healthy. So the reason why I deleted my Twitter account in the end was that
*  it was obviously making me a worse person. And so, is there some way to be on there where
*  he's not making you a worse person? I'm sure there is, but it's given the nature of the platform
*  and given what was coming back at me on it, the way to do that is just to basically
*  use it as a one-way channel of communication, just marketing. It's like, here's what I'm
*  paying attention to. Look at it if you want to, and just push it out, and then you don't look at
*  what's coming back at you. I put out a call for questions on Twitter, and then actually quite
*  surprising, there's a lot of good, I mean, they're like, even if they're critical, they're like,
*  being thoughtful, which is nice. I used it that way too, and that was what kept me hooked.
*  But then there's also TouchBalls69 wrote a question.
*  Ask what? I can't imagine. This is part of it. But one way to solve this is,
*  we've got to get rid of anonymity for this. Let me ask the question. Ask Sam why he sucks
*  was the question. Yeah, that's good. Well, one reason why I sucked was Twitter. That was,
*  and I've since solved that problem. So TouchBalls69 should be happy that I suck a little bit less.
*  Now that I'm off Twitter, I don't have to hear from TouchBalls69 on the regular.
*  The fact that you have to see that, it probably can have a negative effect, even in moderation,
*  just to see that there is, like for me, the negative effect is slightly losing faith
*  in the underlying kindness of humanity. Yeah, that was for me. Yeah.
*  You can also just reason your way out of it, saying that this is anonymity, and this is kind
*  of fun, and this is kind of just the shit show of Twitter. It's okay, but it does mentally affect
*  you a little bit. I don't read too much into that kind of comment. That's just trolling.
*  I understand the fun the person is having on the other side of that.
*  Do you though? I do. Well, I do. I don't behave that way,
*  but I do. For all I know, that person could be 16 years old.
*  It could be also an alt account for Elon. I don't know.
*  Yeah, that's right. Yeah. No, I'm pretty sure Elon would just tweet that under his own name
*  at this point. Oh, man. You love each other.
*  Speaking of which, now that Elon has taken over Twitter, is there something that he could do to
*  make this platform better? Twitter and just social media in general, but because of the
*  aggressive nature of his innovation that he's pushing, is there any way to make Twitter a
*  pleasant place for Sam Harris? Maybe.
*  Like in the next five years? I don't know. I think I'm agnostic as to whether or not he or
*  anyone could make a social media platform that really was healthy. So you were just observing
*  yourself week by week, seeing the effect that has on your mind and on how much you're actually
*  learning and growing as a person, and it was negative. Yeah, and I also seen the negativity
*  in other people's lives. I mean, he's not going to admit it, but I think it's obviously negative
*  for Elon. That was one of the things that when I was looking into the Funhaus Mirror, I was also
*  seeing the Funhaus Mirror on his side of Twitter, and it was just even more exaggerated. When I was
*  asking myself, why is he spending his time this way? I then reflected on why was I spending my
*  time this way to a lesser degree and at lesser scale and at lesser risk, frankly. It's not just
*  Twitter. This is in part an internet phenomenon. It's like the whole Hunter Biden mess that you
*  explored. I was on somebody's podcast, but that was based on a clip taken from that podcast,
*  which was highly misleading as to the general shape of my remarks on that podcast.
*  Even I had to then do my own podcast, untangling all of that and admitting that even in the full
*  context, I was not speaking especially well and didn't say exactly what I thought in a way that
*  would have been recognizable to anyone, even someone with not functioning by a spirit of
*  charity, but the clip was quite distinct from the podcast itself. The reality is that we're
*  living in an environment now where people are so lazy and their attention is so fragmented
*  that they only have time for clips. 99% of people will see a clip and will assume
*  there's no relevant context I need to understand what happened in that clip.
*  Obviously, the people who make those clips know that, and they're doing it quite maliciously.
*  In this case, the person who made that clip and subsequent clips of other podcasts
*  was quite maliciously trying to engineer some reputational immolation for me.
*  Being signal-boosted by Elon and other prominent people who can't take the time to watch anything
*  other than a clip, even when it's their friend or someone who's ostensibly their friend in that clip.
*  It's a total failure, an understandable failure of ethics that everyone is so short on time
*  and they're so fucking lazy. We now have these contexts in which we react so quickly to things.
*  Twitter is inviting an instantaneous reaction to this clip that it's just too tempting to just
*  say something and not know what you're even commenting on. Most of the people who saw that
*  clip don't understand what I actually think about any of these issues. The irony is people are going
*  to find clips from this conversation that are just as misleading and they're going to export those,
*  and then people are going to be dunking on those clips. We're all living and dying by clips now.
*  It's dysfunctional.
*  See, I think it's possible to create a platform. I think we will keep living on clips,
*  but when I saw that clip of you talking about children and so on, just knowing that you have
*  a sense of humor, we just went to a dark place in terms of humor. I didn't even bother. Then I knew
*  that the way clips work is that people will use it for virality's sake, but giving a person benefit
*  of the doubt, that's not even the right term. It's not like I was really interpreting it
*  in the context of knowing your past.
*  The truth is, I even give Trump the benefit of the doubt when I see a clip of Trump.
*  There are famous clips of Trump that are very misleading as to what he was saying in context,
*  and I've been honest about that. There were good people on both sides
*  scandal around his remarks after Charlottesville. The clip that got exported and got promoted by
*  everyone left of center, from Biden on down, the New York Times, CNN, there's nobody that I'm aware
*  of who has honestly apologized for what they did with that clip. He did not say what he seemed to
*  be saying in that clip about the Nazis at Charlottesville. I have always been very clear
*  about that. Even people who I think should be marginalized and people who
*  should be defenestrated because they really are terrible people who are doing dangerous things
*  for bad reasons, I think we should be honest about what they actually meant in context.
*  This goes to anyone else we might talk about who's more where the case is much more confusing.
*  I'm sure we're going to get to AI, but the prospect of being able to manufacture clips
*  with AI and deep fakes where it's going to be hard for most people most of the time to even figure out
*  whether they're in the presence of something real. Forget about being divorced from context.
*  There was no context. That's a misinformation apocalypse that we're right on the cusp of.
*  It's terrifying. It could be just a new world like where Alice is going to wonderland,
*  where humor is the only thing we have and it will save us. Maybe in the end, Trump's approach
*  to social media was the right one after all. Nothing is true and everything's absurd.
*  We can't live that way. People function on the basis of what they assume is true.
*  People have functioned.
*  To do anything. You have to know what you think is going to happen.
*  You have to at least give a probabilistic weighting over the future. Otherwise,
*  you're going to be incapacitated. People want certain things and they have to have a rational
*  plan to get those desires gratified. They don't want to die. They don't want their kids to die.
*  You tell them that there's a comet hurtling toward Earth and they should get outside and look up.
*  They're going to do it. If it turns out it's misinformation, it's going to matter because
*  it comes down to what medicines do you give your children? We're going to be manufacturing fake
*  journal articles. I'm sure someone's using chat GPT for this as we speak.
*  And if it's not persuasive now to most people, I'll be amazed if it's a year before.
*  We can actually create journal articles that would take a PhD to debunk that are completely fake.
*  There are people who are celebrating this kind of
*  coming cataclysm. They're the people who don't have anything to lose who are celebrating it or
*  so confused that they just don't even know what's at stake. And then there are the few people
*  who we could count on a few hands who have managed to insulate themselves or at least imagine they've
*  insulated themselves from the downside here enough that they're not implicated in the great
*  unraveling we are witnessing or could witness. The shaking up of what is true. So actually that
*  returns us to experts. Do you think experts can save us? Is there such thing as expertise
*  and experts in something? How do you know if you've achieved it? I think it's important to
*  acknowledge upfront that there's something paradoxical about how we relate to authority,
*  especially within science. I don't think that paradox is going away and it doesn't have to
*  be confusing. It's not truly a paradox. It's just like there are different moments in time.
*  So it is true to say that within science or within rationality generally, whenever you're
*  having a fact-based discussion about anything, it is true to say that the truth or falsity of a
*  statement does not even slightly depend on the credentials of the person making the statement.
*  Right? So it doesn't matter if you're a Nobel Laureate, you can be wrong. The last sentence
*  you spoke could be total bullshit. And it's also possible for someone who's deeply uninformed
*  to be right about something or to be right for the wrong reasons or someone just gets lucky.
*  And there are middling cases where you have a backyard astronomer who's got no credentials,
*  but he just loves astronomy and he's got a telescope and he spends a lot of time looking
*  at the night sky and he discovers a comet that no one else has seen, not even the professional
*  expert astronomers. I mean, I got to think that happens less and less now, but some version of
*  that keeps happening and it may always keep happening in every area of expertise. Right?
*  Right. So it's true that truth is orthogonal to the reputational concerns we have among
*  apes who are talking about the truth. But it is also true that most of the time,
*  real experts are much more reliable than frauds or people who are not experts. Right? And expertise
*  really is a thing. Right? And when you're flying an airplane in a storm, you don't want just
*  randos come into the cockpit saying, listen, I've got a new idea about how we should tweak these
*  controls. Right? You want someone who's a trained pilot and that training gave them something. Right?
*  It gave them a set of competences and intuitions and they know what all those dials and switches
*  do. Right? And I don't. Right? I shouldn't be flying that plane. So when things really matter,
*  and putting this at 30,000 feet in a storm sharpens this up, we want real experts to be in charge.
*  Right? And we are at 30,000 feet a lot of the time on a lot of issues. Right? And whether they're
*  public health issues, whether it's a geopolitical emergency like Ukraine,
*  climate change, just pick your topic. There are real problems and the clock is rather often ticking
*  and their solutions are non-obvious. Right? And so expertise is a thing and deferring to experts
*  much of the time makes a lot of sense. At minimum, it prevents spectacular errors of incompetence and
*  foolhardiness. But even in the case of some where you're talking about someone,
*  people like ourselves who are like, we're well-educated, we're not the worst possible
*  candidates for the Dunning-Kruger effect. When we're going into a new area where we're not experts,
*  we're fairly alert to the possibility that it's not as simple as things seem at first and we
*  don't know how our tools translate to this new area. We can be fairly circumspect, but we're also,
*  because we're well-educated and we're pretty quick studies, we can learn a lot of things pretty fast
*  and we can begin to play a language game that sounds fairly expert. Right? And in that case,
*  the invitation to do your own research is when times are good, I view as an invitation to waste
*  your time pointlessly. Right? When times are good. Now, the truth is times are not all that good.
*  We have the ongoing public display of failures of expertise. We have experts who are obviously
*  corrupted by bad incentives. We've got experts who perversely won't admit they were wrong when
*  they in fact were demonstrated to be wrong. We've got institutions that have been captured by
*  political ideology that's not truth tracking. This whole woke
*  encroachment into really every place, whether it's universities or science journals or government,
*  or I mean, it's just like that has been genuinely deranging.
*  So there's a lot going on where experts and the very concept of expertise has seemed to discredit
*  itself, but the reality is that there is a massive difference when anything matters, when there's
*  anything to know about anything, there is a massive difference most of the time between
*  someone who has really done the work to understand that domain and someone who hasn't. And if I get
*  sick or someone close to me gets sick, I have a PhD in neuroscience. Right? So I can read a medical
*  journal article and understand a lot of it. Right? And so I'm just fairly conversant with
*  medical terminology and I understand its methods and I'm alert to the difference because in
*  neuroscience I've spent hours and hours in journal clubs analyzing the difference between good and
*  bad studies. I'm alert to the difference between good and bad studies in medical journals. Right?
*  And I understand that bad studies can get published and et cetera, and experiments can be poorly
*  designed. I'm alert to all of those things, but when I get sick or when someone close to me gets
*  sick, I don't pretend to be a doctor. Right? I've got no clinical experience. I don't go down the
*  rabbit hole on Google for days at a stretch trying to become a doctor, much less a specialist in the
*  domain of problem that has been visited upon me or my family. Right? So if someone close to me gets
*  cancer, I don't pretend to be an oncologist. I don't start reading in journals of oncology
*  and try to really get up to speed as an oncologist because one is a bad and very likely misleading
*  use of my time. Right? And if I had a lot of runway, if I decided, okay, it's really important
*  for me to know everything I can. At this point, I know someone's going to get cancer. I may not go
*  back to school and become an oncologist, but what I want to do is I want to know everything I can
*  know about cancer. Right? So I'm going to take the next four years and spend most of my time on cancer.
*  Okay. I could do that. Right? I still think that's a waste of my time.
*  I still think at the end of even at the end of those four years, I'm not going to be the best
*  person to form intuitions about what to do in the face of the next cancer that I have to confront.
*  I'm still going to want a better oncologist than I've become to tell me what he or she would do if
*  they were in my shoes or in the shoes of my family member. I'm not advocating a
*  blind trust and authority. Like if you get cancer and you're talking to one oncologist
*  and they're recommending some course of treatment, by all means, get a second opinion, get a third
*  opinion. Right? But it matters that those opinions are coming from real experts and not from
*  you know, Robert Kennedy Jr., you know, who's telling you that, you know, you got it because
*  you got a vaccine. Right? It's like, it's just, we're swimming in a sea of misinformation where
*  you've got people who are moving the opinions of millions of others who should not have an opinion
*  on these topics. Like there's no, there is no scenario in which you should be getting your
*  opinion about vaccine safety or climate change or the war in Ukraine or anything else that we might
*  want to talk about from Candace Owens. Right? It's just like, she's not a relevant expert on any of
*  those topics. And what's more, she doesn't seem to care. Right? And she's living in a culture
*  that has amplified that not caring into a business model and an effective business model. Right? So
*  it's just, it's something very Trumpian about all that. Or like that's the problem is the culture,
*  it's not these specific individuals. So the paradox here is that expertise is a real thing
*  and we defer to it a lot as a labor saving device. And it's just as, and just based on the
*  reality that it's very hard to be a polymath. Right? And specialization is a thing. Right?
*  And so there are people who specialize in a very narrow topic. They know more about that topic than
*  the next guy, no matter how smart that guy or gal is. And that those differences matter, but it's
*  also true that when you're talking about facts, sometimes the best experts are wrong. The scientific
*  consensus is wrong. You get a sea change in the thinking of a whole field because one person
*  who's an outlier for whatever reason decides, okay, I'm going to prove this point and they
*  prove it. Right? So somebody like the doctor who believed that stomach ulcers were not due to stress,
*  but were due to H. pylori infections. Right? So he just drank a vial of H. pylori bacteria and
*  proved that and quickly got an ulcer and convinced the field that at minimum H. pylori was involved
*  in that process. Okay. So yes, everyone was wrong. That doesn't disprove the reality of
*  expertise. It doesn't disprove the utility of relying on experts most of the time,
*  especially in an emergency, especially when the clock is ticking, especially when you're in this
*  particular cockpit and you only have one chance to land this plane. Right? You want the real pilot
*  at the controls. But there's just a few things to say. So one, you mentioned this example with
*  cancer and doing your own research. There are several things that are different about
*  our particular time in history. One, doing your own research has become more and more effective
*  because you can read, the internet made information a lot more accessible. So you can read
*  a lot of different meta-analyses. You can read blog posts that describe to you exactly the flaws
*  in the different papers. They make up the meta-analyses. And you can read a lot of those
*  blog posts that are conflicting with each other. And you can take that information in,
*  and in a short amount of time, you can start to make good faith interpretations. For example,
*  I don't know, I don't want to overstate things, but if you suffer from depression, for example,
*  then you could go to an expert and a doctor that prescribes you some medication.
*  But you could also challenge some of those ideas and seeing like, what are the different
*  medications, what are the different side effects, what are the different solutions to depression,
*  all that kind of stuff. And I think depression is just a really difficult problem. That's very,
*  I don't want to, again, state incorrect things, but I think there's a lot of variability of what
*  depression really means. So being introspective about the type of depression you have and the
*  different possible solutions you have, just doing your own research as a first step before
*  approaching a doctor or as you have multiple opinions could be very beneficial in that case.
*  Now that's depression, that's something that's been studied for a very long time.
*  With a new pandemic that's affecting everybody, it's, you know, with the airplane equated to like
*  9-11 or something, like the new emergency just happened and everybody, every expert in the world
*  is publishing on it and talking about it. So doing your own research there could be exceptionally
*  effective in asking questions. And then there's a difference between experts, virologists,
*  and it's actually a good question, who is exactly the expert in a pandemic. But there's the actual
*  experts doing the research and publishing stuff. And then there's the communicators of that expertise.
*  And the question is, if the communicators are flawed, to a degree where doing your own research
*  is actually the more effective way to figure out policies and solutions. Because you're not
*  competing with experts, you're competing with the communicators of expertise. That could be WHO,
*  CDC in the case of the pandemic, or politicians, or political type of science figures like Anthony
*  Fauci. There's a question there of the effectiveness of doing your research,
*  your own research in that context. And the competing forces there, incentives that you've
*  mentioned, is you can become quite popular by being contrarian, by saying everybody's lying to
*  you, all the authorities are lying to you, all the institutions are lying to you. So those are the
*  waters you're swimming in. But I think doing your own research in that kind of context could be
*  quite effective. Let me be clear, I'm not saying you shouldn't do any research. I'm not saying that
*  you shouldn't be informed about an issue. I'm not saying you shouldn't read articles on whatever the
*  topic is. And yes, if I got cancer or someone close to me got cancer, I probably would read more about
*  cancer than I've read thus far about cancer. And I've read some. So I'm not making a virtue of
*  ignorance and a blind obedience to authority. And again, I recognize that authorities can
*  discredit themselves or they can be wrong. They can be wrong even when there's no discredit.
*  There's a lot we don't understand about the nature of the world. But still this vast gulf
*  between truly informed opinion and bullshit exists. It always exists. And conspiracy thinking is
*  rather often, most of the time, a species of bullshit, but it's not always wrong. There are
*  real conspiracies and there really are just awful corruptions born of bad incentives within
*  our scientific processes, within institutions. And again, we've mentioned a lot of these things
*  in passing, but what woke political ideology did to scientific communication during the pandemic
*  was awful. And it was really corrosive of public trust, especially on the right.
*  For understandable reasons, it was crazy some of the things that were being said and still is.
*  And these cases are all different. You take depression. We just don't know enough about
*  depression for anyone to be that confident about anything. And there are many different modalities
*  in which to interact with it as a problem. So there's pharmaceuticals have whatever promise
*  they have, but there's certainly reason to be concerned that they don't work well for everybody.
*  It's obvious they don't work well for everybody, but they do work for some people.
*  But again, depression is a multifactorial problem and there are different levels at which to
*  influence it. And there are things like meditation, there are things like just life changes.
*  One of the first things about depression is that when you're depressed, all of the things that
*  would be good for you to do are precisely the things you don't want to do. You don't have any
*  energy to socialize. You don't want to get things done. You don't want to exercise.
*  All of those things, if you've got those up and running, they do make you feel better
*  in the aggregate. But the reality is that there are clinical level depressions that are so bad
*  that we just don't have good tools for them. And it's not enough to tell you there's no life change
*  someone's going to embrace that it's going to be an obvious remedy for that.
*  The pandemic are obviously a complicated problem, but I would consider it much simpler than
*  depression in terms of what's on the menu to be chosen among the various choices.
*  It's less multifactorial.
*  The logic by which you would make those choices. Yeah. So it's like we have a virus,
*  we have a new virus. It's some version of bad. It's human transmissible. We're still catching up.
*  We're catching up to every aspect of it. We don't know how it spreads.
*  We don't know how effective masks are. Well, at a certain point, we knew it was respiratory.
*  But how respiratory? And whether it's spread by fomites. All that we were confused about a lot
*  of things. And we're still confused. It's been a moving target this whole time and it's been
*  changing this whole time. And our responses to it have been, we ramped up the vaccines as quickly
*  as we could, but too quick for some, not quick enough for others. We could have done human
*  challenge trials and got them out more quickly with better data. And I think that's something
*  we should probably look at in the future because to my eye, that would make ethical sense to do
*  challenge trials. And so much of my concern about COVID, I mean, many people are confused about my
*  concern about COVID. My concern about COVID has for much of the time not been narrowly focused on
*  COVID itself. How dangerous I perceive COVID to be as a illness. It has been for the longest time,
*  even more a concern about our ability to respond to a truly scary pathogen next time.
*  Well, outside those initial months, give me the first six months to be
*  quite worried about COVID and the unraveling of society.
*  And the supply of toilet paper.
*  You want to secure a steady supply of toilet paper. But beyond that initial period,
*  when we had a sense of what we were dealing with and we had every hope that the vaccines
*  are actually going to work and we knew we were getting those vaccines in short order.
*  Beyond that, and we knew just how dangerous the illness was and how dangerous it wasn't.
*  For years now, I've just been worrying about this as a failed dress rehearsal for something much
*  worse. I think what we prove to ourselves at this moment in history is that we have built
*  informational tools that we do not know how to use and we have made ourselves, we've basically
*  enrolled all of human society into a psychological experiment that is deranging us and making it
*  virtually impossible to solve coordination problems that we absolutely have to solve
*  next time when things are worse.
*  Do you understand who is at fault for the way this unraveled? The way we didn't seem to have
*  the distrust in institutions and the institution of science that grew
*  seemingly exponentially or got revealed through this process. Who is at fault here?
*  And what's to fix?
*  So much blame to go around, but so much of it is not a matter of bad people conspiring to do bad
*  things. It's a matter of incompetence and misaligned incentives and just ordinary,
*  plain vanilla dysfunction.
*  But my problem was that people like you, people like Brett Weinstein, people that I look to for
*  reasonable, difficult conversations on difficult topics have a little bit lost their mind,
*  became emotional and dogmatic in style of conversation, perhaps not in the depth of actual
*  ideas. But there, you know, a tweet something of that nature, not about you, but just it feels
*  like the pandemic made people really more emotional than before. And then Kimbo Musk responded,
*  something I think you probably would agree with. Maybe not. I think it was the combo of Trump and
*  the pandemic. Trump triggered the far left to be way more active than they could have been without
*  him. And then the pandemic handed big government nanny state lefties a huge platform on a silver
*  platter, a one, two punch. And here we are.
*  I would agree with some of that. I'm not sure how much to read into the nanny state concept, but.
*  But yet like basically got people on the far left really activated.
*  Yeah.
*  And then gave control to, I don't know if you say nanny state, but just control to government
*  that when executed poorly has created a complete distrust in government.
*  My fear is that there was going to be that complete distrust anyway, given the nature of
*  the information space, given the level of conspiracy thinking, given the gaming of
*  these tools by an anti-vax cult. I mean, there really is an anti-vax cult that just ramped up
*  its energy during this moment.
*  But it's a small one.
*  It's not to say that everything, every concern about vaccines is a species of,
*  it was born of misinformation or born of this cult, but there is a cult that is just,
*  and the core of Trumpism is a cult. I mean, QAnon is a cult. And so there's a lot of lying and
*  there's a lot of confusion. It's almost impossible to exaggerate how confused some people are and
*  how fully their lives are organized around that confusion. I mean, there are people who think that
*  the world's being run by pedophile cannibals and that Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey and
*  Michelle Obama are among those cannibals. I mean, like they're adjacent to the pure crazy,
*  there's the semi-crazy and adjacent to the semi-crazy, there's the grifting opportunist
*  asshole. And the layers of bad faith are hard to fully diagnose. But the problem is
*  all of this is getting signal-boosted by an outrage machine that is preferentially spreading
*  misinformation. It has a business model that is guaranteed that is preferentially sharing
*  misinformation. Can I actually just on a small tangent, how do you defend yourself against the
*  claim that you're a pedophile cannibal? It's difficult. Here's the case I would make,
*  because I don't think you can use reason. I think you have to use empathy. You have to understand.
*  Part of it, I mean, I find it very difficult to believe that anyone believes these things. I mean,
*  I think that there's, and I'm sure there's some number of people who are just pretending to
*  believe these things because it's just, again, this is sort of like the four-chanification of
*  everything. It's just Pepe the Frog, right? None of this is what it seems. They're not signaling
*  an alliance with white supremacy or neo-Naziism, but they're not doing it. They just don't fucking
*  care. It's just cynicism overflowing its banks. It's just fun to wind up the normies. Look at all
*  the normies who don't understand that a green frog is just a green frog, even when it isn't just a
*  green frog. It's just gumming up everyone's cognitive bandwidth with bullshit. I get that
*  that's fun if you're a teenager and you just want to vandalize our new sphere, but at a certain point,
*  we have to recognize that real questions of human welfare are in play, right? There's like,
*  there are wars getting fought or not fought, and there's a pandemic raging, and
*  there's medicine to take or not take. But I mean, to come back to this issue of COVID,
*  I don't think I got so out of balance around COVID. I think people are quite confused about
*  what I was concerned about. Yes, there was a period where I was crazy because anyone who was
*  taking it seriously was crazy because they had no idea what was going on. So it's like, yes,
*  I was wiping down packages with alcohol wipes because people thought it was transmissible by
*  touch. When we realized that was no longer the case, I stopped doing that. So again, it was a
*  moving target, and a lot of things we did in hindsight around masking and school closures
*  looked fairly dysfunctional, right? Unnecessary. I think the criticism that people would
*  say about your talking about COVID, and maybe you can correct me, but you were
*  skeptical, or you were against skepticism of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.
*  So people who get nervous about the vaccine but don't fall into the usual anti-vax camp,
*  which I think there was a significant enough number, they're getting nervous. I mean,
*  especially after the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, I too was nervous about anything
*  where a lot of money could be made. You just see how the people who are greedy,
*  they come to the surface all of a sudden. A lot of them that run institutions are actually
*  really good human beings. I know a lot of them, but it's hard to know how those two combine together
*  when there's hundreds of billions, trillions of dollars to be made. So that skepticism,
*  the sense was that you weren't open enough to the skepticism.
*  I understand that people have that sense. I'll tell you how I thought about it and think about
*  it. One, again, it was a moving target. So there was a point in the timeline where
*  it was totally rational to expect that the vaccines were both working, both they were
*  reasonably safe and that COVID was reasonably dangerous. The trade-off for basically everyone
*  was it was rational to get vaccinated. Given the level of testing and how many people had
*  been vaccinated before you, given what we were seeing with COVID, that that was a forced choice.
*  You're eventually going to get COVID and the question is, do you want to be vaccinated when
*  you do? There was a period where that forced choice, where it was just obviously reasonable
*  to get vaccinated, especially because there was every reason to expect that while it wasn't a
*  perfectly sterilizing vaccine, it was going to knock down transmission a lot and that matters.
*  And so it wasn't just a personal choice. You were actually being a good citizen when you decided to
*  run whatever risk you were going to run to get vaccinated because there are people in our society
*  who actually can't get vaccinated. I know people who can't take any vaccines. They're so allergic.
*  I mean, they in their own person seem to justify all of the fears of the anti-vax cult. I mean,
*  it's like they're the kind of person who Robert Kennedy Jr. can point to and say, see, vaccines
*  are, well, we'll fucking kill you, right? Because of the experience and then we're still, I know
*  people who have kids who fit that description, right? So we should all feel a civic responsibility
*  to be vaccinated against egregiously awful and transmissible diseases for which we have
*  relatively safe vaccines to keep those sorts of people safe.
*  And there was a period of time when it was thought that the vaccine could stop transmission.
*  Yes. And so again, all of this has begun to shift. I don't think it has shifted as much as
*  Brett Weinstein thinks it's shifted, but yes, there are safety concerns around the mRNA vaccines
*  especially for young men, right? As far as I know, that's the purview of actual heightened concern.
*  But also there's now a lot of natural immunity out there. Basically everyone who was going to
*  get vaccinated has gotten vaccinated. The virus has evolved to the point in this context where
*  it seems less dangerous. Again, I'm going more on the seemings than on research that I've done
*  at this point, but I'm certainly less worried about getting COVID. I've had it once. I've been
*  vaccinated. So you ask me now, how do I feel about getting the next booster? I don't know
*  that I'm going to get the next booster, right? So I was somebody who was waiting in line at four
*  in the morning, hoping to get some overflow vaccine when it was first available.
*  At that point, given what I thought I knew based on the best sources I could consult and based on
*  anecdotes that were too vivid to ignore, both data and personal experience,
*  it was totally rational for me to want to get that vaccine as soon as I could.
*  And now I think it's totally rational for me to do a different kind of cost benefit analysis and
*  wonder, listen, do I really need to get a booster? How many of these boosters am I going to get for
*  the rest of my life, really? And how safe is the mRNA vaccine for a man of my age? And do I need
*  to be worried about myocarditis? All of that is completely rational to talk about now. My concern
*  is that at every point along the way, I was the wrong person and Brett Weinstein was the wrong
*  person. And there's many other people I could add to this list to have strong opinions about any of
*  this stuff. I just disagree with that. I think, yes, in theory, I agree 100%, but I feel like experts
*  failed at communicating, not at doing- They did.
*  And I just feel like you and Brett Weinstein actually have the tools with the internet,
*  given the engine you have in your brain of thinking for months at a time, deeply about the
*  problems that face our world, that you actually have the tools to do pretty good thinking here.
*  But there would be deference to experts and pseudo experts behind all of that.
*  Well, the papers, you would stand on the shoulders of giants, but you can serve those
*  shoulders better than the giants themselves. Yeah, but I knew we were going to disagree
*  about that. I saw his podcast where he brought on these experts who had, many of them, had the
*  right credentials, but for a variety of reasons, they didn't pass the smell test for me. One larger
*  problem, and this goes back to the problem of how we rely on authority in science, is that you can
*  always find a PhD or an MD to champion any crackpot idea. It is amazing, but you could find
*  PhDs and MDs who would sit up there in front of Congress and say that they thought smoking was
*  not addictive, or that it was not harmful, there was no direct link between smoking and lung cancer.
*  You could always find those people. Some of the people Brett found were people who had obvious
*  tells to my point of view, to my eye. Some of the same people were on Rogan's podcast.
*  It's hard because if a person does have the right credentials and they're not saying something
*  floridly mistaken, and we're talking about something where there are genuine unknowns,
*  how much do we know about the safety of these vaccines? At that point, not a whole hell of a
*  lot. We have no long-term data on mRNA vaccines, but to confidently say that millions of people
*  are going to die because of these vaccines, and to confidently say that ivermectin is a panacea,
*  ivermectin is the thing that prevents COVID, there was no good reason to say either of those things
*  at that moment. Given that that's where Brett was, I felt like there was nothing to debate.
*  We're both the wrong people to be getting into the weeds on this. We're both going to defer to our
*  chosen experts. His experts look like crackpots to me, or at least the ones who are most vociferous
*  on those edgiest points. Your experts seem like, what is the term, mass hysteria? I forgot the term.
*  No, but it's like with climate science. It's received as a canard in half of our society now,
*  the claim that 97% of climate scientists agree that human-caused climate change is a thing.
*  Do you go with the 97% most of the time, or do you go with the 3% most of the time?
*  It's obvious you go with the 97% most of the time for anything that matters. It's not to say that
*  the 3% are always wrong. Again, things get overturned. Yes, as you say, I've spent much
*  more time worrying about this on my podcast than I've spent worrying about COVID. Our institutions
*  have lost trust for good reason. It's an open question whether
*  we can actually get things done with this level of transparency and pseudo transparency given our
*  information ecosystems. Can we fight a war, really fight a war that we may have to fight,
*  like the next Nazis? Can we fight that war when everyone with an iPhone is showing just how awful
*  it is that little girls get blown up when we drop our bombs? Could we as a society
*  do what we might have to do to actually get necessary things done when we're living in this
*  panopticon of just everyone's a journalist, everyone's a scientist, everyone's an expert,
*  everyone's got direct contact with the facts or semblance of the facts? I don't know.
*  I think yes, and I think voices like yours are exceptionally important, and I think there's
*  certain signals you send in your ability to steal me on the other side in your empathy,
*  essentially. That's the fight, that's the mechanism by which you resist
*  the dogmatism of this binary thinking. If you become a trusted person that's able to consider
*  the other side, then people will listen to you as the aggregator, as the communicator of expertise.
*  Because the virologists haven't been able to be good communicators. I still to this day don't
*  really know what am I supposed to think about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines today? As it
*  stands today, what are we supposed to think? What are we supposed to think about testing?
*  What are we supposed to think about the effectiveness of masks or lockdowns? Where's
*  the great communicators on this topic that consider all the other conspiracy theories,
*  all the communication that's out there, and actually aggregating it together and being able
*  to say this is actually what's most likely the truth. Also, some of that has to do with
*  humility, epistemic humility, knowing that you can't really know for sure.
*  Just like with depression, you can't really know for sure. I'm not seeing those communications
*  being effectively done even still today. Well, the jury is still out on some of it,
*  and again, it's a moving target. It's complicated. Some of it's a self-fulfilling
*  dynamic. In theory, a lockdown would work if we could only do it, but we can't really do it.
*  There's a lot of people who won't do it because they're convinced that this is the totalitarian
*  boot finally on the neck of the good people who are always having their interests
*  traduced by the elites. If you have enough people who think the lockdown for any reason
*  in the face of any conceivable illness is just code for the new world order coming to fuck you
*  over and take your guns, okay, you have a society that is now immune to reason.
*  Because there are absolutely certain pathogens that we should lock down for next time. It was
*  completely rational in the beginning of this thing to attempt a lockdown. We never really locked
*  down. To attempt some semblance of a lockdown just to quote, bend the curve, to spare our
*  healthcare system, given what we were seeing happening in Italy. That moment was not hard
*  to navigate, at least in my view. It was obvious at the time. In retrospect, my views on that
*  haven't changed, except for the fact that I recognize maybe it's just impossible given
*  the nature of people's response to that kind of demand. We live in a society that's just not
*  going to lock down. Unless the pandemic is much more deadly.
*  Right. That's a point I made, which was maliciously clipped out from some other podcast,
*  where someone's trying to make it look like I want to see children die. There's a pity more
*  children didn't die from COVID. This is actually the same person who... That's the other thing that
*  got so poisoned here. It's like that person, this psychopath or effective psychopath who's
*  creating these clips of me on podcasts. The second clip of me seeming to say that I wish
*  more children died during COVID, but it was so clear in context what I was saying that even the
*  clip betrayed the context, so it didn't actually work. This psycho, and again, I don't know whether
*  he actually is a psychopath, but he's behaving like one because of the incentives of Twitter.
*  This is somebody who Brett signal boosted as a very reliable source of information.
*  He kept retweeting this guy at me, against me. At one glance, I knew how unreliable this guy was,
*  but I think I'm not at all sad. One thing I think I did wrong, one thing that I do regret,
*  one thing I have not sorted out for myself is how to navigate the professional and personal pressure
*  that gets applied at this moment where you have a friend or an acquaintance or someone you know
*  who's behaving badly in public or behaving badly, behaving in a way that you think is bad in public.
*  And they have a public platform where they're influencing a lot of people,
*  and you have your own public platform where you're constantly getting asked to comment
*  on what this friend or acquaintance or colleague is doing.
*  I haven't known what I think is ethically right about the choices that seem forced on us at
*  moments like this. So I've criticized you in public about your interview with Kanye. Now,
*  in that case, I reached out to you in private first and told you exactly what I thought,
*  and then when I was going to get asked in public or when I was touching that topic on my
*  podcast, I more or less said the same thing that I said to you in private. Now,
*  that was how I navigated that moment. I did the same thing with Elon, at least at the beginning.
*  And we have maintained good vibes, which is not what I can say about Elon.
*  And I disagree with you because good vibes in the moment, there's a deep core of good
*  vibes that persist through time between you and Elon, and I would argue probably between
*  some of the other folks you mentioned. I think with Brett, I failed to reach out in private
*  to the degree that I should have. We had tried to set up a conversation in private that never
*  happened, but there was some communication, but it would have been much better for me to have made
*  more of an effort in private than I did before it spilled out into public. And I would say that's
*  true with other people as well. What kind of interaction in private do you think you should
*  have with Brett? Because my case would be beforehand and now still. The case I would like,
*  and this part of the criticism you sent my way, maybe it's useful to go to that direction.
*  Actually, let's go to that direction because I think I disagree with your criticism as you
*  stated publicly, but this is very- You're talking about your-
*  Of your review of Kanye. Yeah, yeah. The thing you criticized me for is actually the right thing to
*  do with Brett. Okay. You said Lex could have spoken with Kanye in such a way as to have
*  produced a useful document. He didn't do that because he has a fairly naive philosophy about
*  the power of love. Let's see if you can maintain that philosophy in the present.
*  Let's go. No, it's beautiful. He seemed to think that if he just got through the minefield to the
*  end of the conversation where the two of them still were feeling good about one another and
*  they can hug it out, that would be by definition a success. Let me make the case for this power of
*  love philosophy. First of all, I love you, Sam. You're still an inspiration and somebody I deeply
*  admire. Okay. Back at you. To me, in the case of Kanye, it's not only that you get through the
*  conversation and have hugs. It's that the display that you're willing to do that has power. Even if
*  it doesn't end in hugging, the actual turning the other cheek, the act of turning the other cheek
*  itself communicates both to Kanye later and to the rest of the world that we should
*  have empathy and compassion towards each other. There is power to that.
*  I believe in the power of that. It's not that I'm trying to convince Kanye that some of his ideas
*  are wrong, but I'm trying to illustrate that just the act of listening and truly trying to understand
*  the human being, that opens people's minds to actually questioning their own beliefs more.
*  It takes them out of the dogmatism, deescalates the kind of dogmatism that I've been seeing.
*  In that sense, I would say the power of love is the philosophy you might apply to Brett,
*  because the right conversation you have in private is not about, hey, listen, the experts you're
*  talking to, they seem credentialed, but they're not actually as credentialed as they are illustrating.
*  They're not grounding their findings in actual meta-analyses in the papers and so on, like making
*  a strong case. What are you doing? This is going to get a lot of people in trouble. Instead, just
*  being a friend in the dumbest of ways, being respectful, sending love their way, and just
*  having a conversation outside of all of this. Basically, showing that, removing the emotional
*  attachment to this debate, even though you are very emotionally attached, because in the case of COVID,
*  specifically, there is a very large number of lives at stake. Removing all of that and remembering
*  that you have a friendship. I think these are highly non-analogous cases. Your conversation with
*  Kanye misfired from my point of view for a very different reason. It has to do with Kanye. I've
*  never met Kanye, so obviously, I don't know him. I think he's either obviously in the midst of a
*  mental health crisis or he's a colossal asshole or both. Those aren't mutually exclusive. One of three
*  possibilities, he's either mentally ill, he's an asshole, or he's mentally ill and an asshole.
*  I think all three of those possibilities are possible for the both of us as well at the moment.
*  I would argue none of those are likely for either of us. Not to say we don't have our moments.
*  The reason not to talk to Kanye, I think you should have had the conversation you had with
*  him in private. That's great. I've got no criticism of what you said had it been in private.
*  I just thought you're not doing him a favor. If he's mentally ill,
*  he's in the middle of a manic episode, or I'm not a clinician, but I've heard it said of him that
*  he is bipolar, you're not doing him a favor sticking a mic in front of him and letting him
*  go off on the Jews or anything else. We know what he thought about the Jews. We know that there's
*  not much illumination that's going to come from him on that topic. If it is a symptom of his mental
*  illness that he thinks these things, well then you're not doing him a favor making that
*  even more public. If he's just an asshole and he's just an anti-Semite, an ordinary garden variety
*  anti-Semite, well then there's also not much to say unless you're really going to dig in
*  and kick the shit out of him in public. I'm saying you can do that with love. That's the other thing
*  here is that I don't agree that compassion and love always have this patient,
*  embracing, acquiescent face. They don't always feel good to the recipient. There is a sword of
*  wisdom that you can wield compassionately in moments like that where someone's full of shit
*  and you just make it absolutely clear to them and to your audience that they're full of shit.
*  There's no hatred being communicated. In fact, you could just say, listen, I'm going to do
*  everyone a favor right now and just take your foot out of your mouth. The truth is, I just
*  wouldn't have aired the conversation. I just don't think it was a document that had to get out there.
*  This is not a signal you're likely to get from your audience. I get that many people in your
*  audience thought, oh my God, that's awesome. You're talking to Kanye and you're doing it
*  in Lex style where it's just love and you're not treating him like a pariah and you're holding this
*  tension between he's this creative genius who is work we love and yet he's having this moment
*  that's so painful and what a tightrope walk. I get that maybe 90% of your audience saw it that way.
*  They're still wrong and I still think that was on balance not a good thing to put out into the work.
*  You don't think it opens up the mind and heart of people that listen to that? Just seeing a person?
*  If it does, it's opening up in the wrong direction where just gale force nonsense is coming in.
*  I think we should have an open mind and an open heart but there's some clear things here that
*  we have to keep in view. One is the mental illness component is its own thing. I don't
*  pretend to understand what's going on with him but insofar as that's the reason he's saying what he's
*  saying, do not put this guy on camera and let no one see it. Sorry, in that point real quick,
*  I had a bunch of conversations with him offline and I didn't get a sense of mental illness. That's
*  why I chose to sit down. Mental illness is such a... When he shows up in a gimp hood on
*  Alex Jones' podcast, either that's more genius performance in his world or he's unraveling further.
*  I wouldn't put that under mental illness. I think there's another conversation to be had about
*  how we treat artists because they're weirdos. Taking words from Kanye as if he's like Christopher
*  Hitchens or something like that, very eloquent, researched, written many books on history,
*  on politics and geopolitics, on psychology. Kanye didn't do any of that. He's an artist just
*  spouting off. There's a different style of conversation and a different way to treat
*  the words that are coming out of his mouth. Let's leave the mental illness aside. If we're going to
*  say that there's no reason to think he's mentally ill and this is just him being creative and
*  brilliant and opinionated, well then that falls into the asshole bucket for me. Then he's someone...
*  Honestly, the most offensive thing about him in that interview from my point of view is not
*  the anti-Semitism, which we can talk about because I think there are problems just letting him
*  spread those memes as well. But the most offensive thing is just how delusionally egocentric he is
*  or was coming off in that interview and in others. He has an estimation of himself as this omnibus
*  genius not only to rival Shakespeare, to exceed Shakespeare. He is the greatest mind that has
*  ever walked among us and he's more or less explicit on that point and yet he manages to talk for hours
*  without saying anything actually interesting or insightful or factually illuminating.
*  It's complete delusion of a very Trumpian sort. It's like when Trump says he's a genius who
*  understands everything, but nobody takes him seriously and one wonders whether Trump takes
*  himself seriously, Kanye seems to believe his own press. He actually thinks he's just a colossus
*  and he may be a great musician. It's certainly not my wheelhouse to compare him to any other musicians,
*  but one thing that's patently obvious from your conversation is he's not who he thinks he is
*  intellectually or ethically or in any other relevant way. So when you couple that to
*  the anti-Semitism he was spreading, which was genuinely noxious and ill-considered and
*  has potential knock-on effects in the black community. There's an ambient level of
*  anti-Semitism in the black community that is worth worrying about and talking about anyway.
*  There's a bunch of guys playing the knockout game in Brooklyn just punching orthodox Jews in the
*  face and I think letting Kanye air his anti-Semitism that publicly only raises the likelihood of that
*  rather than diminishes it. I don't know, so let me say just a couple things. So one, my belief at the
*  time was it doesn't, it decreases it. Showing empathy while pushing back decreases the likelihood
*  of that. It does might, it might on the surface look like it's increasing it, but that's simply
*  because the anti-Semitism or the hatred in general is brought to the surface and that people talk
*  about it. But I should also say that you're one of the only people that wrote to me privately
*  criticizing me and like out of the people I really respect and admire and that was really valuable
*  that I had to, painful because I had to think through it for a while. And I'm still, it still
*  haunts me because the other kind of criticism I got a lot of people basically said things towards
*  me based on who I am that they hate me. You mean anti-Semitic things or that you-
*  Anti-Semitic, I just hate the word anti-Semitic. It's like racist.
*  But here's the reality. So I'm someone, so I'm Jewish, although obviously not religious.
*  I have never taken, I've been a student of the Holocaust, obviously I know a lot about that and
*  there's reason to be a student of the Holocaust. But in my lifetime and in my experience, I have
*  never taken anti-Semitism very seriously. I have not worried about it. I have not made a thing of
*  it. I've done exactly one podcast on it. I had Barry Weiss on my podcast when her book came out
*  but it really is a thing and it's something we have to keep an eye on societally because it's a
*  unique kind of hatred. It's unique in that it seems, it's knit together with, it's not just
*  ordinary racism, it's knit together with lots of conspiracy theories that never seem to die out.
*  It can by turns equally animate the left and the right politically. It was so perverse about
*  anti-Semitism, look in the American context, with the far right, with white supremacists,
*  Jews aren't considered white. So they hate us in the same spirit in which they hate black people
*  or brown people or anyone who's not white. But on the left, Jews are considered extra white.
*  We're the extra beneficiaries of white privilege. And so it's a very, very, very, very, very
*  and in the black community, that is often the case. We're a minority that has thrived and so,
*  and it seems to stand as a counterpoint to all of the problems that other minorities suffer,
*  in particular, African-Americans in the American context. And yeah, Asians are now getting a little
*  bit of this, like the model minority issue, but Jews have had this going on for centuries and
*  millennia and it never seems to go away. And again, this is something that I've never
*  focused on, but this has been at a slow boil for as long as we've been alive. And there's no
*  guarantee it can't suddenly become much, much uglier than we have any reason to expect it to
*  become even in our society. And so there's kind of a special concern at moments like that where you
*  have an immensely influential person in a community who already has a checkered history
*  with respect to their own beliefs about the Jews and the conspiracies and all the rest.
*  And he's just messaging, not especially fully opposed by you and anyone else who's given him
*  the microphone at that moment to the world. And so that made my spidey sense tingle.
*  Yeah, it's complicated. The stakes are very high. And as somebody who's been obviously family and
*  also reading a lot about World War II and just this whole period, it was a very difficult
*  conversation. But I believe in the power, especially given who I am of not always,
*  but sometimes often turning the other cheek. Oh yeah. And again, things change
*  when they're for public consumption. The cut for me that has just the use case I keep stumbling upon
*  is the kinds of things that I will say on a podcast like this, or if I'm giving a public lecture,
*  versus the kinds of things I will say at dinner with strangers or with friends. If I'm in an
*  elevator with strangers, I do not feel, and I hear someone say something stupid, I don't feel
*  an intellectual responsibility to turn around in the confines of that space with them and say,
*  listen, that thing you just said about X, Y, or Z is completely false and here's why. But if somebody
*  says it in front of me on some public dais where I'm actually talking about ideas, that's when
*  there's a different responsibility that comes online. The question is how you say it.
*  Or even whether you say anything in those. There are definitely moments to privilege
*  civility or just to pick your battles. Sometimes it's just not worth it to get into it with somebody
*  out in real life. I just believe in the power of empathy, both in the elevator
*  and when a bunch of people are listening. When they see you willing to consider
*  another human being's perspective, it just gives more power to your words after.
*  Yeah, but until it doesn't. Because you can extend charity too far. It can be absolutely
*  obvious what someone's motives really are and they're dissembling about that. Then you're
*  taking at face value their representations, it begins to look like you're just being duped and
*  you're not actually doing the work of putting pressure on a bad actor. Again, the mental illness
*  component here makes it very difficult to think about what you should or shouldn't have said to
*  Kanya. I think the topic of platforming is pretty interesting. What's your view on
*  platforming controversial people? Let's start with the old, would you interview Hitler
*  on your podcast and how would you talk to him? Oh, and follow up question. Would you interview him
*  in 1935? 41? And then like 45? Well, I think we have an uncanny valley problem with respect to
*  this issue of whether or not to speak to bad people. If a person is sufficiently bad,
*  if they're all the way out of the valley, then you can talk to them and it's just totally
*  unproblematic to talk to them because you don't have to spend any time signaling to your audience
*  that you don't agree with them. If you're interviewing Hitler, you don't have to say,
*  listen, I just got to say before we start, I don't agree with the whole genocide thing and
*  I just think you're killing mental patients and vans and all that. That was all bad. It's a bad
*  look, Adolf. It can go without saying that you don't agree with this person and you're not
*  platforming them to signal boost their views. If they're sufficiently evil, you can go into it
*  very much as an anthropologist would. You just want to understand the nature of evil. You just
*  want to understand this phenomenon. How is this person who they are? And that strikes me as a
*  intellectually interesting and morally necessary thing to do. So yes, I think you always interview
*  Hitler. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Well, once he's Hitler-
*  But when do you know it?
*  Once he's legitimately Hitler.
*  But when do you know it? Is genocide really happening? It's like 42, 43?
*  No, if you're on the cusp of it where he's someone who's gaining power and you don't want to help
*  facilitate that, then there's a question of whether you can undermine him while pushing
*  back against him in that interview. So there are people I wouldn't talk to just because I don't
*  want to give them oxygen and I don't think that in the context of my interviewing them,
*  I'm going to be able to take the wind out of their sails at all. So it's like for whatever,
*  either because an asymmetric advantage, because I just know that they can do something within the
*  span of an hour that I can't correct for. It's like they can light many small fires and it just
*  takes too much time to put them out.
*  That's more like on the topic of vaccines, for example, having a debate on the efficacy of
*  vaccines. Yeah. It's not that I don't think sunlight is usually the best disinfectant.
*  I think it is. Even these asymmetries aside, it is true that a person can always make a mess faster
*  than you can clean it up, but still there are debates worth having even given that limitation.
*  And they're the right people to have those specific debates. And there's certain topics where
*  I'll debate someone just because I'm the right person for the job and it doesn't matter how
*  messy they're going to be. It's just worth it because I can make my points land at least
*  to the right part of the audience. So some of it is just your own skill and
*  competence and also interest in preparing correctly? Well, yeah. Yeah. And the nature
*  of the subject matter. But there are other people who just by default, I would say, well,
*  there's no reason to give this guy a platform. And there are also people who are so confabulatory
*  that they're making such a mess with every sentence that insofar as you're even trying
*  to interact with what they're saying, you're by definition going to fail and you're going to
*  seem to fail to a sufficiently large, uninformed audience where it's going to be a net negative
*  for the cause of truth, no matter how good you are. So for instance, I think talking to Alex Jones
*  on any topic for any reason is probably a bad idea because I just think he's just neurologically
*  wired to just utter a string of sentences. He'll get 20 sentences out, each of which contains more
*  lies than the last. And there's not time enough in the world to run down, and certainly not time
*  enough in the span of a conversation, to run down each of those leads to bedrock so as to falsify it.
*  I mean, he'll just make shit up or make shit up and then weave it in with half truths and
*  and micro truths that give some semblance of credibility to somebody out there. I mean,
*  apparently millions of people out there. And there's just no way to untangle that in real time with
*  him. I have noticed that you have an allergic reaction to confabularitization. Yeah, confabulation.
*  Confabulation. That if somebody says something a little micro untruth, it really stops your brain.
*  Here I'm not talking about micro untruths. I'm just talking about making up things out of whole
*  cloth. If someone says something like, well, what about, and then the thing they put
*  at the end of that sentence is just a set of pseudo facts that you can't possibly authenticate
*  or not in the span of that conversation. Whether it's about UFOs or anything else,
*  they will seem to make you look like an agonoramus when in fact everything they're saying is
*  specious, whether they know it or not. I mean, there's some people who are just crazy. There's
*  some people who are just bullshitting and they're not even tracking whether it's true, it just
*  feels good. And then some people are consciously lying about things. But don't you think there's
*  just a jazz masterpiece of untruth that you should be able to just wave off by saying, well, none of
*  that is backed up by any evidence. It's almost like take it to the humor place.
*  But the thing is, the place I'm familiar with doing this and not doing this is on specific
*  conspiracies like 9-11 truth. Because of what 9-11 did to my intellectual life, it sent me down a
*  path for the better part of a decade. I became a critic of religion. I don't know if I was ever
*  going to be a critic of religion, but it happened to be in my wheelhouse because I spent so much time
*  studying religion on my own. And I was also very interested in the underlying spiritual concerns
*  of every religion. And so I devoted more than a full decade of my life to just what is real here?
*  What is possible? What is the nature of subjective reality? And how does it relate to reality at
*  large? And is there anything to, who was someone like Jesus or Buddha? And are these people frauds
*  or are these just myths or is there really a continuum of insight to be had here that
*  is interesting? So I spent a lot of time on that question through the full decade of my 20s.
*  LW And that was launched in part by 9-11 truth.
*  No, but then when 9-11 happened, I had spent all this time reading religious books, empathically
*  understanding the motivations of religious people, knowing just how fully certain people believe what
*  they say they believe. So I took religious convictions very seriously. And then people
*  started flying planes into our buildings. And so I knew that there was something to be said about
*  that. The core doctrines of Islam. Yeah, exactly. So that became my wheelhouse for a time,
*  terrorism and jihadism and related topics. And so the 9-11 truth conspiracy thing kept getting aimed
*  at me. And the question was, well, do I want to debate these people?
*  LW Yeah, like Alex Jones, perhaps.
*  Yeah. So Alex Jones, I think was an early purveyor of it, although I don't think I knew who he was
*  at that point. And privately, I had some very long debates with people who, one person in my family
*  went way down that rabbit hole. And every six months or so, I'd literally write the two hour
*  email that would try to deprogram them, however ineffectually. And so I went back and forth for
*  years on that topic in private with people. But I could see the structure of the conspiracy. I
*  could see the nature of how impossible it was to play whack-a-mole sufficiently well so as to
*  convince anyone of anything who was not seeing the problematic structure of that way of thinking.
*  It's not actually a thesis. It's a proliferation of anomalies. You can't actually connect all the
*  dots that are being pointed to. They don't connect in a coherent way. They're incompatible
*  theses and their incompatibility is not being acknowledged. But they're running this algorithm.
*  Things are never what they seem. There's always malicious conspirators doing things perfectly.
*  We see evidence of human incompetence everywhere else. No one can tie their shoes expertly anywhere
*  else. But over here, people are perfectly competent. They're perfectly concealing.
*  Thousands of people are collaborating inexplicably. Incentivized by what? Who knows?
*  They're collaborating to murder thousands of their neighbors and no one is breathing a peep
*  about it. No one's getting caught on camera. No one's read the word of it to a journalist.
*  I've dealt with that style of thinking and I know what it's like to be in the weeds of a
*  conversation like that. The person will say, okay, well, but what do you make of the fact that
*  all those F-16s were flown 800 miles out to sea on the morning of 9-11 doing an exercise
*  that hadn't even been scheduled for that day. I dimly recall some thesis of that kind, but I'm
*  just making these things up now. That detail hadn't even been scheduled for that day. It was
*  inexplicably run that day. How long would it take to track that down? The idea that this is
*  anomalous, like there was an F-16 exercise run and it wasn't even supposed to be run that day.
*  Someone like Alex Jones, their speech pattern is to pack as much of that stuff in as possible
*  at the highest velocity that the person can speak. Unless you're knocking down each one of those
*  things to that audience, you appear to just be uninformed. He didn't know about the F-16s.
*  He doesn't know about Project Mockingbird. You haven't heard about Project Mockingbird? I just
*  made up Project Mockingbird. I don't know what it is, but that's the kind of thing that comes
*  tumbling out in a conversation like that. That's the kind of thing, frankly, I was worried about
*  in the COVID conversation because not that someone like Brett would do it consciously,
*  but someone like Brett is swimming in a sea of misinformation on social media, living on Twitter,
*  getting people sending the blog post and the study from the Philippines that showed that in
*  this cohort, Ivermectin did X. To actually run anything to ground, you have to actually
*  do the work journalistically and scientifically and run it to ground. For some of these questions,
*  you actually have to be a statistician to say, okay, they used the wrong statistics in this
*  experiment. Now, yes, we could take all the time to do that, or we could at every stage along the way
*  in a context where we have experts we can trust go with what 97% of the experts are saying about
*  X, about the safety of mRNA, about the transmissibility of COVID, about whether to
*  wear masks or not wear masks. I completely agree that that broke down
*  unacceptably over the last few years. Social media and blogs and the efforts of podcasters
*  and substack writers were not just a response to that, I think it was a symptom of that and a cause
*  of that. I think we're living in an environment where we have trained ourselves not to be able
*  to agree about facts on any topic, no matter how urgent. What's flying in our sky? What's
*  happening in Ukraine? Is Putin just denazifying Ukraine? There are people who we respect
*  who are spending time down that particular rabbit hole. Maybe there are a lot of Nazis
*  in Ukraine and that's the real problem. Maybe Putin's not the bad actor here. How much time
*  do I have to spend empathizing with Putin to the point of thinking, well, maybe Putin's got a point
*  and it's like, what about the polonium and the nerve agents and the killing of journalists and
*  Navalny? I'm not paying so much attention to that because I'm following all these interesting
*  people on Twitter and they're giving me some pro-Putin material here. There are some Nazis
*  in Ukraine. It's not like there are no Nazis in Ukraine. How am I going to weight these things?
*  I think people are being driven crazy by Twitter.
*  But you're kind of speaking to conspiracy theories that pollute everything. Every example you gave
*  is kind of a bad faith style of conversation. But it's not necessarily knowingly bad faith.
*  The people who are worried about Ukrainian Nazis, to my, I mean, they're some of the same people.
*  They're the same people who are worried about Ivermectin got suppressed. Ivermectin is really
*  the panacea, but it got suppressed because no one could make billions on it.
*  It's literally, in many cases, the same people and the same efforts to unearth those facts.
*  You're saying it's very difficult to have conversations with those kinds of people.
*  What about a conversation with Trump himself? Would you do a podcast with Trump?
*  No, I don't think so. I don't think I'd be learning anything about him. It's like with
*  Hitler, and I'm not comparing Trump to Hitler, but-
*  Clips guy, here's your chance. You got this one.
*  With certain world historical figures, I would just feel like, okay, this is an opportunity to
*  learn something that I'm not going to learn. I think Trump is among the most superficial people
*  we have ever laid eyes on. He is in public view. I'm sure there's some distance between who he is
*  in private and who he is in public, but it's not going to be the kind of distance that's going to
*  blow my mind. I think Joe Rogan was very wise not to have Trump on his podcast. I think all
*  he would have been doing is he would have put himself in a situation where he couldn't adequately
*  contain the damage Trump was doing, and he was just going to make Trump seem cool to a whole new,
*  a potentially new cohort of his massive audience. They would have had a lot of laughs. Trump's funny.
*  The entertainment value of things is so influential. There was that one debate where Trump
*  got a massive laugh on his line, only Rosie O'Donnell. The truth is we're living in a
*  political system where if you can get a big laugh during a political debate, you win.
*  It doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't matter how uninformed you are. It doesn't matter that
*  half the debate was about what the hell we should do about a threat of nuclear war or anything else.
*  It's, we're monkeys, right? And we like to laugh. Well, because you brought up Joe. He's somebody
*  like you I look up to. I've learned a lot from him because I think who he is privately as a human
*  being, also he's kind of the voice of curiosity to me. He inspired me. That's an unending,
*  open-minded curiosity, much like you are the voice of reason. They recently had a podcast.
*  Joe had recently a podcast with Jordan Peterson and he brought you up saying
*  they still have a hope for you. Any chance that you talk to Joe again and reinvigorate your friendship?
*  I reached out to him privately when I saw that. Did you use the power of love?
*  Joe knows I love him and consider him a friend, right? So there's no issue there.
*  He also knows I'll be happy to do his podcast when we get that together. So I've got no policy of not
*  talking to Joe or not doing his podcast. I think we got a little sideways along these same lines
*  where we've talked about Brett and Elon and other people. It was never to that degree with Joe because
*  Joe is in a very different lane and consciously so. Joe is a stand-up comic who interviews,
*  who just is interested in everything, interviews the widest conceivable variety of people
*  and just lets his interests collide with their expertise or lack of expertise. He's a super wide
*  variety of people. He'll talk about anything and he can always pull the rip cord saying,
*  I don't know what the fuck I'm saying. I'm a comic. I'm stoned. We just drank too much.
*  It's very entertaining. To my eye, it's all in good faith. I think Joe is an extraordinarily
*  ethical good person. Also doesn't use Twitter. Doesn't really use Twitter.
*  Yeah. The crucial difference though is that because he is an entertainer first,
*  I'm not saying he's not smart and he doesn't understand things. What's potentially confusing
*  is he's very smart and he's also very informative. His full-time job is taught. When he's not doing
*  stand-up or doing color commentary for the UFC, his full-time job is talking to lots of very smart
*  people at great length. He's created the Joe Rogan University for himself and he's gotten
*  a lot of information crammed into his head. It's not that he's uninformed, but when he feels that
*  he's uninformed or when it turns out he was wrong about something, he can always pull the rip cord
*  and say, I'm just a comic. We were stoned. It was fun. Don't take medical advice from me.
*  I don't play a doctor on the internet. I can't quite do that. You can't quite do that. We're
*  in different lanes. I'm not saying you and I are in exactly the same lane, but for much of Joe's
*  audience, I'm just this establishment shill just banging on about the universities and medical
*  journals. It's not true, but that would be the perception and as a counterpoint to a lot of
*  what's being said on Joe's podcast or certainly Brett's podcast on these topics, I can see how
*  they would form that opinion. In reality, if you listen to me long enough, you hear that
*  I've said as much against the woke nonsense as anyone, even any lunatic on the right who
*  can only keep that bright shining object in view. There's nothing that Candace Owens has said about
*  wokeness that I haven't said about wokeness insofar as she's speaking rationally about
*  wokeness, but we have to be able to keep multiple things in view. If you could only look at the
*  problem of wokeness and you couldn't acknowledge the problem of Trump and Trumpism and QAnon and
*  the explosion of irrationality that was happening on the right and bigotry that was happening on the
*  right, you were just disregarding half of the landscape and many people took half of the
*  problem in recent years. The last five years is a story of many people taking half of the problem
*  and monetizing that half of the problem and getting captured by an audience that only wanted that half
*  of the problem talked about in that way. This is the larger issue of audience capture, which
*  I'm sure it's an ancient problem, but it's a very helpful phrase that I think comes to us courtesy
*  of our mutual friend, Eric Weinstein. Audience capture is a thing and I believe I've witnessed
*  many casualties of it. If there's anything I've been on guard against in my life professionally,
*  it's been that. When I noticed that I had a lot of people in my audience who didn't like my
*  criticizing Trump, I really leaned into it. When I noticed that a lot of the other cohort in my
*  audience didn't like me criticizing the far left and wokeness, they thought I was exaggerating that
*  problem. I leaned into it because I thought those parts of my audience were absolutely wrong and I
*  didn't care about whether I was going to lose those parts of my audience. There are people who
*  have created, knowingly or not, there are people who've created different incentives for themselves
*  because of how they've monetized their podcasts and because of the kind of signal
*  they've responded to in their audience. Brett would consider this a totally invidious
*  ad hominem thing to say, but I really do worry that that's happened to Brett. I think I cannot
*  explain how you do 100, with all the things in the universe to be interested in and of all the
*  things he's competent to speak intelligently about, I don't know how you do 100 podcasts in a row on
*  COVID. It makes no sense. You think in part audience capture can explain that? I absolutely
*  think it can. For example, do you feel pressure to not admit that you made a mistake on COVID or made
*  a mistake on Trump? I'm not saying you feel that way, but do you feel this pressure? You've attacked
*  audience capture within the way you do stuff so you don't feel as much pressure from the
*  audience, but within your own ego. Again, the people who think I'm wrong about any of these
*  topics are going to think, okay, you're just not admitting that you're wrong, but now we're having
*  a dispute about specific facts. There are things that I believed about COVID or worried might be
*  true about COVID two years ago that I no longer believe or I'm not so worried about now and vice
*  versa. Certain things have flipped upside down. The question is, was I wrong? Here's the cartoon
*  version of it, but this is something I said probably 18 months ago and it's still true.
*  When I saw what Brett was doing on COVID, let's call it two years ago,
*  I said even if he's right, even if it turns out that Ivermectin is a panacea
*  and the mRNA vaccines kill millions of people, he's still wrong right now. His reasoning is
*  still flawed right now. His facts still suck right now and his confidence is unjustified now.
*  That was true then, that will always be true then. Not much has changed for me to revisit any of my
*  time points along the way. Again, I will totally concede that if I had teenage boys and their
*  schools were demanding that they be vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine, I would be powerfully
*  annoyed. I wouldn't know what I was going to do and I would be doing more research about
*  myocarditis and I'd be badgering our doctors and I would be worried that we have a medical system
*  and a pharmaceutical system and a healthcare system and a public health system that's not
*  incentivized to look at any of this in a fine-grained way and they just want one
*  blanket admonition to the entire population, just take the shot, you idiots.
*  I view that largely as a result, a panicked response to the misinformation explosion that
*  happened and the populist resistance animated by misinformation that just made it impossible
*  to get anyone to cooperate. Part of it is again, a pendulum swing in the wrong direction,
*  somewhat analogous to the woke response to Trump and the Trumpist response to woke.
*  A lot of people have just gotten pushed around for bad reasons, but understandable reasons.
*  But yes, there are caveats to my, things have changed about my view of COVID, but the question
*  is, if you roll back the clock 18 months, was I wrong to want to platform
*  Eric Topol, a very well-respected cardiologist on this topic or Nicholas Christakis to talk about
*  the network effects of whether we should close schools. He's written a book on COVID, his network
*  effects or his wheelhouse as both as an MD and as a sociologist. There was a lot that we believed
*  we knew about the efficacy of closing schools during pandemics, during the Spanish flu pandemic
*  and others. But there's a lot we didn't know about COVID. We didn't know how negligible the effects
*  would be on kids compared to older people. We didn't know it like the-
*  Well, my problem, I really enjoyed your conversation with Eric Topol, but also didn't.
*  So he's one of the great communicators in many ways on Twitter, like distillation of the current
*  data. But he, I hope I'm not overstating it, but there is a bit of an arrogance from him that I
*  think could be explained by him being exhausted by being constantly attacked by conspiracy
*  theory, like anti-vaxxers. To me, the same thing happens with people that start drifting to being
*  right-wing is to get attacked so much by the left, they become almost irrational and arrogant in
*  their beliefs. And I felt your conversation with Eric Topol did not sufficiently empathize with
*  people that have skepticism, but also did not sufficiently communicate uncertainty we have.
*  So many of the decisions you made, many of the things you were talking about
*  were kind of saying there's a lot of uncertainty, but this is the best thing we could do now.
*  Well, it was a forced choice. You're going to get COVID. Do you want to be vaccinated when you get
*  it? That was always, in my view, an easy choice. And it's up until you start breaking apart the
*  cohorts and you start saying, okay, wait a minute, there is this myocarditis issue in young men.
*  Let's talk about that. Before that story emerged, it was just clear that
*  if it's not knocking down transmission as much as we had hoped, it is still mitigating severe illness
*  and death. And I still believe that it is the current view of most people competent to analyze
*  the data that we lost something like 300,000 people unnecessarily in the U.S. because of vaccine
*  hesitancy. But I think there's a way to communicate with humility about the uncertainty of things
*  that would increase the vaccination rate. I do believe that it is
*  rational and sometimes effective to signal impatience with certain bad ideas and certain
*  conspiracy theories and certain forms of misinformation. I just think it makes you look
*  like a douchebag most times. Well, certain people are persuadable, certain people are not persuadable,
*  but it's the opportunity cost. Not everything can be given a patient hearing. So you can't
*  have a physics conference and then let people in to just trumpet their pet theories about the grand
*  unified vision of physics when they're obviously crazy or they're obviously half crazy.
*  You begin to get a sense for this when it is your wheelhouse, but there are people who
*  declare their irrelevance to the conversation fairly quickly without knowing that they have done it.
*  And the truth is, I think I'm one of those people on the topic of COVID. It's never that I felt,
*  listen, I know exactly what's going on here. I know these mRNA vaccines are safe. I know exactly
*  how to run a lockdown. No, this is a situation where you want the actual pilots to fly the plane.
*  We needed experts who we could trust. And insofar as our experts got captured by
*  all manner of things, some of them got captured by Trump. Some of them were made to look ridiculous
*  just standing next to Trump while he was bloviating about whatever, it's just going to go away.
*  There's just 15 people in a cruise ship and it's just going to go away. There's going to be no
*  problem. Or it's like when he said, many of these doctors think I understand this better than them.
*  They're just amazed at how I understand this. And you've got doctors, real doctors, the heads
*  of the CDC and NIH standing around just ashen faced while he's talking. All of this was deeply
*  corrupting of the public communication of science. And then again, I've banged on about the
*  depredations of wokeness. The woke thing was a disaster. It still is a disaster. But it doesn't
*  mean that... But the thing is there's a big difference between me and Brett in this case.
*  I didn't do 100 podcasts on COVID. I did like two podcasts on COVID. The measure of my concern
*  about COVID can be measured in how many podcasts I did on it. It's like once we had a sense of how
*  to live with COVID, I was just living with COVID. Okay, get vaxxed or don't get vaxxed. Wear a mask
*  or don't wear a mask. Travel or don't travel. You've got a few things to decide, but my kids
*  were stuck at home on iPads for too long. I didn't agree with that. It was obviously not functional.
*  I criticized that on the margins, but there was not much to do about it. But the thing I didn't do
*  is make this my life and just browbeat people with one message or another. We need a public
*  health regime where we can trust what competent people are saying to us about
*  what medicines are safe to take. And in the absence of that, even in the presence of that,
*  craziness is going to proliferate given the tools we've built. But in the absence of that,
*  it's going to proliferate for understandable reasons. And it's not going to be good next time
*  when orders of magnitude more dangerous hits us. And insofar as I think about this issue,
*  I think much more about next time than this time.
*  Before this COVID thing, you and Brett had some good conversations. I would say we're friends.
*  What do you admire most about Brett outside of all the criticism we've had about this COVID topic?
*  Well, I think Brett is very smart and he's a very ethical person who wants good things for the world.
*  I mean, I have no reason to doubt that. So the fact that we're crosswise on this issue does not
*  mean that I think he's a bad person. I mean, the thing that worried me about what he was doing,
*  and this was true of Joe and this was true of Elon, this is true of many other people,
*  is that once you're messaging at scale to a vast audience, you incur a certain kind of
*  responsibility not to get people killed. And I did worry that, yeah, people were making decisions
*  on the basis of the information that was getting shared there. And that's why I was,
*  I think, fairly circumspect. I just said, okay, give me the
*  the center of the fairway expert opinion at this time point and at this time point and at this time
*  point, and then I'm out. I don't have any more to say about this. I'm not an expert on COVID. I'm
*  not an expert on the safety of mRNA vaccines. If something changes so as to become newsworthy,
*  then maybe I'll do a podcast. I just did a podcast on the lab leak. I was never skeptical
*  of the lab leak hypothesis. Brett was very early on saying this is a lab leak
*  at a point where my only position was who cares if it's a lab leak. The thing we have to get
*  straight is what do we do given the nature of this pandemic?
*  But also we should say that you've actually stated that it is a possibility.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You just said it doesn't quite matter.
*  I mean, the time to figure that out. Now, I've actually, I have had my podcast guest
*  on this topic changed my view of this because one of the guests, Alina Chan, made the point that
*  actually the best time to figure out the origin of this is immediately, right? Because then you
*  lose touch with the evidence. And I hadn't really been thinking about that. If you come back after a
*  year, there are certain facts you might not be able to get in hand. But I've always felt
*  that it didn't matter for two reasons. One is we had the genome of the virus and we could design,
*  we were very quickly designed, immediately designing vaccines against that genome.
*  And that's what we had to do. And then we had to figure out how to vaccinate and to
*  mitigate and to develop treatments and all of that. So the origin story didn't matter.
*  Generically speaking, either origin story was politically inflammatory
*  and made the Chinese look bad, right? And the Chinese response to this looked bad,
*  whatever the origin story, right? They're not cooperating. They're stopping their domestic
*  flights but letting their international flights go. I mean, it's just they were bad actors and they
*  should be treated as such regardless of the origin, right? And I would argue that the wet
*  market origin is even more politically invidious than the lab leak origin.
*  Why do you think?
*  Because lab leak, to my eye, the lab leak could happen to anyone, right? All these advanced
*  countries are running these dangerous labs. That's a practice that we should be worried about.
*  In general, we know lab leaks are a problem. There have been multiple lab leaks, even worse
*  things that haven't gotten out of hand in this way, but worse pathogens.
*  We're wise to be worried about this. And on some level, it could happen to anyone, right?
*  The wet market makes them look like barbarians living in another century.
*  You've got to clean up those wet markets. What are you doing putting a bat on top of a pangolin,
*  on top of a duck? It's like, get your shit together. So if anything, the wet market makes
*  them look worse in my view. Now, I'm sure what they actually did to conceal a lab leak, if it
*  was a lab leak, all of that is going to look odious.
*  Do you think we'll ever get to the bottom of that? I mean, one of the big negative,
*  I would say, failures of Anthony Fauci and so on is to be transparent and clear. And it's just a
*  good communicator about gain and functional research. The dangers of that, why it's a useful
*  way of research, but it's also dangerous. Just being transparent about that, as opposed to
*  just coming off really shady. Of course, the conspiracy theorists and the politicians are
*  not helping, but this just created a giant mess.
*  Yeah, no, I would agree. So that exchange with Fauci and Rand Paul that went viral,
*  yeah, I would agree that Fauci looked like he was taking refuge in very lawyered language
*  and not giving a straightforward account of what we do and why we do it. And so yeah,
*  I think it looked shady, it played shady, and it probably was shady. I don't know how personally
*  entangled he is with any of this, but yeah, the gain of function research is something that
*  I think we're wise to be worried about. And so far as I judge myself adequate to have an opinion on
*  this, I think it should be banned. Probably a podcast I'll do if you or somebody else
*  doesn't do it in the meantime. I would like a virologist to defend it against a virologist
*  who would criticize it. Forget about just the gain of function research.
*  I don't even understand virus hunting at this point. It's like, I don't even know why you need
*  to go into a cave to find this next virus that could be circulating among bats that may jump
*  zoonotically to us. Why do that when we can make, when we can sequence in a day and make vaccines
*  in a weekend? What kind of head start do you think you're getting?
*  That's a surprising new thing, how quickly you can develop a vaccine.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, that's really interesting. But the shadiness around lab leak.
*  I think the point I didn't make about Brett's style of engaging in this issue is people are
*  using the fact that he was early on lab leak to suggest that he was right about ivermectin and
*  about mRNA vaccines and all the rest. No, none of that connects. And it was possible to be
*  falsely confident. You shouldn't have been confident about lab. No one should have been
*  confident about lab leak early, even if it turns out to be lab leak. It was always plausible.
*  It was never definite. It still isn't definite. Zoonotic is also quite plausible. It certainly
*  was super plausible then. Both are politically uncomfortable. Both at the time were inflammatory
*  to be banging on about when we were trying to secure some kind of cooperation from the Chinese.
*  So there's a time for these things and it's possible to be right by accident.
*  The style of reasoning matters whether you're right or not.
*  Because your style of reasoning is dictating what you're going to do on the next topic.
*  AC It's really difficult to know what's right on COVID given all the uncertainty, all the chaos,
*  especially when you step outside the pure biology, virology of it, and you start getting to policy.
*  It's just trade-offs. AC Like transmissibility of the virus.
*  Just knowing if 65% of the population gets vaccinated, what effect would that have?
*  Just even knowing those things, just modeling all those things.
*  Given all the other incentives, Pfizer, I don't know what to think.
*  AC You had the CEO of Pfizer on your podcast. Did you leave that conversation feeling like
*  this is a person who is consciously
*  reaping windfall profits on a dangerous vaccine and putting everyone at intolerable risk? Or
*  do you think this person was making a good-faith attempt to save lives and had no
*  taint of bad incentives or something? AC The thing I sensed and I felt in part
*  it was a failure on my part, but I sensed that I was talking to a politician. So it's not
*  thinking of there was malevolence there or benevolence. He put on a suit and I was talking
*  to a suit, not a human being. Now he said that his son was a big fan of the podcast,
*  which is why he wanted to do it. So I thought I would be talking to a human being.
*  I asked challenging questions, what I thought the internet thinks otherwise. Every single question
*  in that interview was a challenging one, but it wasn't grilling, which is what people seem to want
*  to do with pharmaceutical companies. There's a deep distrust of pharmaceutical companies.
*  AC What was the alternative? I totally get that windfall profits at a time of public health
*  emergency looks bad. It is a bad look. How do we reward and return capital to risk takers who will
*  spend a billion dollars to design a new drug for a disease that maybe only harms a single digit
*  percentage of the population? What do we want to encourage and who do we want to get rich?
*  The person who cures cancer, do we want that person to get rich or not? We want the person who
*  gave us the iPhone to get rich, but we don't want the person who cures cancer to get rich.
*  AC I think it's a very gray area. What we want is the person who declares that they have a cure
*  for cancer to have authenticity and transparency. I think we're good now as a population smelling
*  bullshit. There is something about the Pfizer CEO, for example, just CEO of the pharmaceutical
*  companies in general, just because they're so lured up, so much marketing PR people,
*  that they are, you just smell bullshit. You're not talking to a real human. It just feels like
*  none of it is transparent to us as a public. This whole talking point that Pfizer is only
*  interested in helping people just doesn't ring true, even though it very well could be true.
*  It's the same thing with Bill Gates, who seems to be at scale helping a huge amount of people in
*  the world. And yet there's something about the way he delivers that message where people like,
*  this seems suspicious. What's happening underneath this? There's certain kinds of
*  communication styles that seem to be more, serve as better catalysts for conspiracy theories.
*  And I'm not sure what that is because I don't think there's an alternative for capitalism
*  in delivering drugs that help people. But also at the same time, there seems to need to be more
*  transparency and plus regulation that actually makes sense versus it seems like pharmaceutical
*  companies are susceptible to corruption. Yeah, I worry about all that. But I also do
*  think that most of the people going into those fields and most of the people going into government,
*  they want to do good, doing it for good. And they're non psychopaths trying to get
*  good things done and trying to solve hard problems. And they're not trying to get rich.
*  I mean, many of the people are, it's like bad incentives or something. Again, I've
*  uttered that phrase 30 times on this podcast, but it's just almost everywhere it explains
*  normal people creating terrible harm. It's not that there are that many bad people. And
*  yes, it makes the truly bad people that much more remarkable and worth paying attention to. But
*  the bad incentives and the bad and the power of bad ideas do much more harm. Because I mean,
*  that's what gets good people running in the wrong direction or
*  doing things that are clearly creating unnecessary suffering.
*  You've had and I hope still have a friendship with Elon Musk, especially over the topic of AI.
*  You have a lot of interesting ideas that you both share, concerns you both share.
*  Well, let me first ask, what do you admire most about Elon?
*  Well, I had a lot of fun with Elon. I like Elon a lot. I mean, Elon I knew as a friend, I like
*  a lot. And it's not going to surprise anyone. I mean, he's done and he's continuing to do
*  amazing things. And I think he's, I think many of his aspirations are realized, the world will be a
*  much better place. I think it's just, it's amazing to see what he's built and what he's attempted to
*  build and what he may yet build. So with Tesla, with SpaceX, with...
*  Yeah, I'm a fan of almost all of that. I mean, there are wrinkles to a lot of that, or some of
*  that. All humans are full of wrinkles. There's something very trumping about how he's acting
*  on Twitter. I mean, Twitter, I think Twitter, he doesn't, he thinks Twitter is great. He bought
*  the place because he thinks it's so great. I think Twitter is driving him crazy. I think he's needlessly
*  complicating his life and harming his reputation and creating a lot of noise and harming a lot of
*  other people. I mean, so like he, the thing that I objected to with him on Twitter is not that he
*  bought it and made changes to it. I mean, that was not, again, I remain agnostic as to whether
*  or not he can improve the platform. It was how he was personally behaving on Twitter, not just
*  toward me, but toward the world. I think when you forward an article about Nancy Pelosi's husband
*  being attacked, not as he was by some lunatic, but that it's just some gay, trist gonerai,
*  that's not what it seems, and you link to a website that previously claimed that
*  Hillary Clinton was dead and that a body double was campaigning in her place,
*  that thing was exploding in Trumpistan as a conspiracy theory. And it was having its effect.
*  It matters that he was signal boosting it in front of 130 million people. And so it is with
*  saying that your former employee, Yoel Roth, is a pedophile. I mean, that has real consequences.
*  It appeared to be complete bullshit. And now this guy's getting inundated with death threats. And
*  Elon, all of that's totally predictable. And so he's behaving quite recklessly. And there's a
*  long list of things like that that he's done on Twitter. It's not ethical. It's not good for him.
*  It's not good for the world. It's not serious. It's a very adolescent relationship to real
*  problems in our society. And so my problem with how he's behaved is that he's purported to touch
*  real issues by turns. Like, okay, do I give the satellites to Ukraine or not? Do I minimize their
*  use of them or not? Should I publicly worry about World War III or not? He's doing this
*  shit on Twitter, right? And at the same moment, he's doing these other very impulsive,
*  ill-considered things. And he's not showing any willingness to really clean up the mess he makes.
*  He brings Kanye on knowing he's an anti-Semite who's got mental health problems and then kicks
*  him off for a swastika, which I probably wouldn't have kicked him off for a swastika.
*  That's even like, can you really kick people off for swastikas? Is that something that
*  are you a free speech absolutist if you can't let a swastika show up? I'm not even sure that's
*  an enforceable terms of service, right? There are moments to use swastikas that are not conveying
*  hate and not raising the risk of violence. Clip that.
*  But so much of what he's doing, given that he's, again, scale matters. He's doing this in front
*  of 130 million people. That's very different than a million people, and that's very different than
*  100,000 people. And so when I went off the tracks with Elon, he was doing this about COVID. And
*  again, this was a situation where I tried to privately mitigate a friend's behavior,
*  and it didn't work out very well. Did you try to correct him highlighting things he might be
*  wrong on? Or did you use the Lex Powell love method? I should write a pamphlet for Sam Harris.
*  Well, no, but it was totally coming from a place of love because I was concerned about his reputation.
*  There was a twofold concern. I could see what was happening with the tweet. He had this original
*  tweet that was, I think it was, panic over COVID is dumb or something like that. This is in early
*  March, 2020. Oh, super early days.
*  Super early. When nobody knew anything, but we knew we saw what was happening in Italy. It was
*  totally kicking off. God, that was a wild time. That's when the toilet paper-
*  Wild. It was totally wild. But that became the most influential tweet on Twitter for that week.
*  It had more engagement than any other tweet, more than any crazy thing Trump was tweeting. It went
*  off. Again, it was just a nuclear bomb of information. I could see that people were responding
*  to it like, wait a minute. Here's this genius technologist who must have inside information
*  about everything. Surely he knows something that is not on the surface about this pandemic.
*  They were reading into it a lot of information that I knew wasn't there.
*  At the time, I didn't think he had any reason to be suggesting that. I think he was just firing
*  off a tweet. I reached out to him in private. Because it was a private text conversation,
*  I won't talk about the details, but I'm just saying that's a case. Among the many cases of
*  friends who have public platforms and who did something that I thought was dangerous and
*  ill-considered, this was a case where I reached out in private and tried to
*  help, genuinely help. I thought it was harmful in every sense because it was being misinterpreted.
*  And it was like, okay, you can say that panic over anything is dumb, fine. But this was not
*  how this was landing. This was like non-issue conspiracy. There's going to be no COVID in the
*  U.S. It's going to peter out. It's just going to become a cold. That's how this was getting
*  received. Whereas at that moment, it was absolutely obvious how big a deal this was going to be,
*  or that it was going to at minimum going to be a big deal.
*  I don't know if it was obvious, but it was obvious there was a significant probability
*  that it could be a big deal. I remember it wasn't unclear. There were still stories of it. It's
*  probably going to the big concern, the hospitals might overfill, but it's going to die out in two
*  months or something. Yeah, but there was no way we weren't going to have
*  tens of thousands of deaths at a minimum at that point. It was totally rational to be worried
*  about hundreds of thousands. When Nicholas Christakis came on my podcast very early,
*  he predicted quite confidently that we would have about a million people dead in the U.S.
*  And that didn't seem, I think, appropriately hedged, but it was still just like, okay,
*  it's just going to look at the... We're just kind of riding this exponential and it'd be very
*  surprising not to have that order of magnitude and not something much less. So anyway, again,
*  to close the story on Elon, I could see how this was being received and I tried to get him
*  to walk that back. And then we had a fairly long and detailed exchange on this issue.
*  And so that intervention didn't work and it was not done. I was not an asshole. I was just concerned
*  for him, for the world. And then there are other relationships where I didn't take the... But again,
*  that's an example where taking the time didn't work privately. There are other relations where
*  I thought, okay, this is just going to be more trouble than it's worth. And so I just ignored it.
*  There's a lot of that. And again, I'm not comfortable with how this is all netted out
*  because I don't know if... And frankly, I'm not comfortable with how much time in this conversation
*  we've spent talking about these specific people. What good is it for me to talk about Elon or Brett?
*  I think there's a lot of good because those friendships... Listen, as a fan,
*  these are the conversations that I loved, love as a fan. And it feels like COVID has robbed the
*  world of these conversations because you were exchanging back and forth on Twitter. But that's
*  not what I mean by conversations, like long form discussions, like a debate about COVID, like a
*  normal debate. But there's no... Elon and I shouldn't be debating COVID. You should be.
*  Here's the thing with humility, basically saying, we don't really know, the Rogan method,
*  we're just a bunch of idiots. One is an engineer, you're a neuroscientist, but it just kind of...
*  Okay, here's the evidence. And be like normal people. That's what everybody was doing.
*  The whole world was trying to figure out what the hell... Yeah, but the issue was that at that... So
*  at the moment I had this collision with Elon, certain things were not debatable. It was just...
*  It was absolutely clear where this was going. It wasn't clear how far it was going to go or how
*  quickly we would mitigate it, but it was absolutely clear that it was going to be an issue. The train
*  had come off the tracks in Italy. We knew we weren't going to seal our borders. There were already
*  people who... There are already cases known to many of us personally in the US at that point.
*  He was operating by a very different logic that I couldn't engage with.
*  Sure, but that logic represents a part of the population and there's a lot of interesting
*  topics that have a lot of uncertainty around them, like the effectiveness of masks.
*  But where things broke down was not at the point of, oh, there's a lot to talk about,
*  a lot to debate. This is all very interesting and who knows what's what. It broke down very early at
*  this is... There's nothing to talk about here. Either there's a water bottle on the table or
*  there isn't. Well, technically there's only one fourth of a water bottle. So what defines
*  a water bottle? Is it the water inside the water bottle or is it the water bottle?
*  Well, I'm giving you an example of it's worth a conversation.
*  This is difficult because we had an exchange in private and I want to honor not exposing
*  the details of it, but the details convinced me that there was not a follow-up conversation
*  on that topic. On this topic. That said, I hope and I hope to be part of helping that happen,
*  that the friendship is rekindled because one of the topics I care a lot about, artificial
*  intelligence, you've had great public and private conversations about this topic.
*  And Elon was very formative in my taking that issue seriously. He and I went to that initial
*  conference in Puerto Rico together and it was only because he was going and I found out about
*  it through him and I just wrote his coattails to it that I got dropped in that side of the pool
*  to hear about these concerns at that point. It would be interesting to hear how has your
*  concern evolved with the coming out of Chad GPT and these new large language models that are fine
*  tuned with reinforcement learning and seemingly to be able to do some incredible human-like things.
*  There's two questions. One, how has your concern in terms of AGI and super intelligence evolved
*  and how impressed are you with Chad GPT as a student of the human mind and mind in general?
*  Well, my concern about AGI is unchanged. I've spoken about it a bunch on my podcast,
*  but I did a TED talk in 2016 which was the summary of what that conference and various
*  conversations I had after that did to my brain on this topic.
*  Basically, that once super intelligence is achieved, there's a takeoff, it becomes
*  exponentially smarter and in a matter of time, there's just we're ants and they're gods.
*  Well, yeah, unless we find some way of permanently tethering
*  a super intelligent self-improving AI to our value system. I don't believe anyone has figured out how
*  to do that or whether that's even possible in principle. I know people like Stuart Russell,
*  who I just had on my podcast. Oh, really? Have you released it yet?
*  Haven't released it yet. He's been on previous podcasts, but we just recorded this week.
*  Because you haven't done an AI podcast in a while, so it's great. He's a good person to
*  talk about alignment with. Yeah, so Stuart, I mean, Stuart has been
*  probably more than anyone my guru on this topic. I mean, you're just reading his book and doing,
*  I think I've done two podcasts with him at this point.
*  I think it's called The Control Problem or something like that.
*  His book is human compatible. Human compatible.
*  He talks about the control problem. And yeah, so I just think the idea that we can define a value
*  function in advance that permanently tethers a self-improving super intelligent AI to our values
*  as we continue to discover them, refine them, extrapolate them in an open-ended way.
*  I think that's a tall order and I think there are many more ways, there must be many more ways of
*  designing super intelligence that is not aligned in that way and is not ever approximating our
*  values in that way. So Stuart's idea to put it in a very simple way is that he thinks you don't want
*  to specify the value function upfront. You don't want to imagine you could ever write the code
*  right the code in such a way as to admit of no loophole. You want to make the AI uncertain
*  as to what human values are and perpetually uncertain and always trying to ameliorate that
*  uncertainty by by hewing more and more closely to what our professed values are. So like just
*  it's always interested in us saying, oh no, no, that's not what we want. That's not what we intend.
*  Stop doing that. No matter how smart it gets, all it wants to do is more perfectly approximate
*  human values. I think there are a lot of problems with that at a high level. I'm not a computer
*  scientist so I'm sure there are many problems at a low level that I don't understand.
*  Or like how to force a human into the loop always no matter what.
*  There's that and like what humans get a vote and just what do humans value and
*  what is the difference between what we say we value and our revealed preferences which
*  if you just if you were a super intelligent AI that could look at
*  humanity now, I think you could be forgiven for concluding that what we value is
*  driving ourselves crazy with Twitter and living perpetually on the brink of nuclear war and
*  just watching hot girls in yoga pants on TikTok again and again and again.
*  It's like what you're saying that is not.
*  This is all revealed preference and it's what is an AI to make of that and what should it optimize?
*  This is also Stuart's observation that one of the insidious things about like the YouTube algorithm
*  is it's not that it just caters to our preferences. It actually begins to change
*  us in ways so as to make us more predictable. It finds ways to make us a better reporter of our
*  preferences and to trim our preferences down so that it can further train to that signal.
*  So the main concern is that most of the people in the field seem not to be taking
*  intelligence seriously. As they design more and more intelligent machines and as they profess
*  to want to design true AGI, they're not again they're not spending the time that Stuart is
*  spending trying to figure out how to do this safely above all. They're just assuming that
*  these problems are going to solve themselves as we make that final stride into the end zone
*  or they're saying very, you know, Pollyannaish things like an AI would never form a motive to
*  harm human. Why would it ever form a motive to be malicious toward humanity unless we put that motive
*  in there? And that's not the concern. The concern is that in the presence of
*  vast disparities in competence and certainly in a condition where the machines are improving
*  themselves, they're improving their own code, they could be developing instrumental goals
*  that are antithetical to our well-being without any intent to harm us. It's analogous to what we do to
*  every other species on earth. I mean, you and I don't consciously form the intention to harm
*  insects on a daily basis, but there are many things we could intend to do that would in fact
*  harm insects because, you know, you decide to repave your driveway or whatever you're doing.
*  You're just not taking the interest of insects into account because they're so far beneath you
*  beneath you in terms of your cognitive horizons. And so the real challenge here is that
*  if you believe that intelligence scales up on a continuum toward heights that we can only dimly
*  imagine, and I think there's every reason to believe that. There's no reason to believe that
*  we're near the summit of intelligence. And you can define, you know, maybe there's some forms
*  of intelligence for which this is not true, but for many relevant forms, you know, like the top
*  hundred things we care about cognitively, I think there's every reason to believe that many of those
*  things, most of those things are a lot like chess or Go where once the machines get better than we
*  are, they're going to stay better than we are. Although I don't know if you caught the recent
*  thing with Go where this actually came out of Stuart's lab. Yeah. Yeah. One time a human beat
*  a machine. Yeah, they found a hack for that. But anyway, ultimately, there's going to be no
*  looking back. And then the question is, what do we do in relationship to these systems that are
*  more competent than we are in every relevant respect? Because it will be a relationship.
*  It's not like the people who think we're just going to figure this all out, you know, without
*  thinking about it in advance, it's just going to the solutions are just going to find themselves
*  seem not to be taking the prospect of really creating autonomous super intelligence seriously.
*  Like, what does that mean? It's every bit as independent and ungovernable ultimately,
*  as us having create. I mean, just imagine if we created a race of people that were 10 times
*  smarter than all of us, like, how would we live with those people? They're 10 times smarter than
*  us, right? Like, they begin to talk about things we don't understand, they begin to want things
*  we don't understand, they begin to view us as obstacles to them. They're solving those problems
*  or gratifying those desires. We become the chickens or the monkeys in their presence. And
*  I think that it's, but for some amazing solution of the sort that Stewart is imagining that we
*  could somehow anchor their reward function permanently, no matter how intelligent scales,
*  I think it's really worth worrying about this. I do by the, you know, the sci fi
*  notion that this is an existential risk if we don't do it well.
*  I worry that we don't notice it. I'm deeply impressed with TraGPT and I'm worried that it will
*  become super intelligent. These language models have become super intelligent because they're
*  basically trained in the collective intelligence of the human species. And then it will start
*  controlling our behavior if they're integrated into our algorithms, the recommender systems.
*  Well, I think that's true even before, far before super intelligence, even before general
*  intelligence. I mean, I think just the narrow intelligence of these algorithms and of what
*  something like, you know, TraGPT can do, I think, is a very important part of the
*  super intelligence. I mean, it's just far short of it developing its own goals that are at cross
*  purposes with ours. Just the unintended consequences of using it in the ways we're going to be
*  incentivized to use it and, you know, the money to be made from scaling this thing and what it
*  does to our information space and our sense of just being able to get to ground truth on any facts.
*  It's, yeah, it's super scary and it was, it's- Do you think it's a giant leap in terms of
*  development towards AGI, TraGPT, or we still, is this just an impressive little toolbox? So,
*  when do you think the singularity is coming? Or is it to you it doesn't matter?
*  Yeah, I've got- It's eventually-
*  I have no intuitions on that front apart from the fact that if we continue to make progress,
*  it will come. Right? So it's just, you just have to assume we continue to make progress.
*  There's only two assumptions. You have to assume substrate independence. So there's no reason why
*  this can't be done in silico. It's just we can build arbitrarily intelligent machines.
*  There's nothing magical about having this done in the wetware of our own brains. I think that is
*  true and I think that's scientifically parsimonious to think that that's true. And then you just have
*  to assume we're going to keep making progress. It doesn't have to be any special rate of progress,
*  doesn't have to be Moore's law. It can just be- We just keep going. At a certain point,
*  we're going to be in relationship to minds. Leaving consciousness aside, I don't have any
*  reason to believe that they'll necessarily be conscious by virtue of being super intelligent
*  and that's its own interesting ethical question. But leaving consciousness aside, they're going to
*  be more competent than we are. And then that's like the aliens have landed. That's an encounter
*  with, again, leaving aside the possibility that something like Stuart's path is actually available
*  to us. But it is hard to picture if what we mean by intelligence, all things considered,
*  and it's truly general, if that scales and begins to build upon itself how you maintain
*  that perfect slavish devotion until the end of time in those systems.
*  The tether to humans?
*  Yeah.
*  I think my gut says that tether is not- There's a lot of ways to do it. So it's not this increasingly
*  impossible problem.
*  Right. So I have no- As you know, I'm not a computer scientist. I have no intuitions about
*  algorithmically how you would approach that and what's possible.
*  My main intuition is maybe deeply flawed, but the main intuition is based on the fact that most of
*  the learning is currently happening on human knowledge. So even Chad GPT is just trained on
*  human data. I don't see where the takeoff happens where you completely go above human wisdom.
*  The current impressive aspect of Chad GPT is that's using collective intelligence of all of us.
*  From what I glean, again, from people who know much more about this than I do,
*  I think we have reason to be skeptical that these techniques of deep learning
*  are actually going to be sufficient to push us into AGI.
*  They're not generalizing in the way they need to. They're certainly not learning like human
*  children. So there's brittle and strange ways. It's not to say that the human path is the only path.
*  Maybe we might learn better lessons by ignoring the way brains work, but
*  we know that they don't generalize and use abstraction the way we do.
*  They have strange holes in their competence.
*  But the size of the holes is shrinking every time. So the intuition starts to slowly fall apart.
*  You know, the intuition is like, surely it can't be this simple to achieve super intelligence.
*  But it's becoming simpler and simpler. So I don't know. The progress is quite incredible.
*  I've been extremely impressed with Chad GPT and the new models. And there's a lot of financial
*  incentive to make progress in this regard. So we're going to be living through some very interesting
*  times. In raising a question that I'm going to be talking to you, a lot of people brought up this
*  topic, probably because Eric Weinstein talked to Joe Rogan recently and said that he and you were
*  contacted by folks about UFOs. Can you clarify the nature of this contact?
*  I've got very little to say on this. He has much more to say. I think he went down this rabbit hole
*  further than I did, which wouldn't surprise anyone. He's got much more of a taste for this
*  sort of thing than I do. But I think we were contacted by the same person.
*  It wasn't clear to me who this person was or how this person got my cell phone number.
*  It didn't seem like we were getting punked. I mean, the person seemed credible to me.
*  And they were talking to you about the release of different videos on UFOs.
*  This is when there was a flurry of activity around this. There was a big New Yorker
*  article on UFOs and there was rumors of congressional hearings, I think, coming.
*  There were the videos that were being debunked or not.
*  This person contacted both of us, I think, around the same time. I think he might have contacted
*  Rogan or other people. Eric is just the only person I've spoken to about it, I think,
*  who I know was contacted. What happened is the person kept writing a check that he didn't
*  cash. He kept saying, okay, next week, I understand this is sounding spooky and you have no reason to
*  really trust me, but next week, I'm going to put you on a Zoom call with people who you will
*  recognize and they're going to be former heads of the CIA and people who just... Within five seconds
*  of being on the Zoom call, you'll know this is not a hoax. I said, great, just let me know. Just send
*  me the Zoom link. That happened maybe three times. There was just one phone conversation and then
*  it was just texts. There's just a bunch of texts. I think Eric spent more time with this person
*  and I haven't spoken to him about it. I know he's spoke about it publicly.
*  It's not that my bullshit detector ever really went off in a big way. It's just the thing never
*  happened and so I lost interest. You made a comment which is interesting,
*  you ran the... Which I really appreciate. You ran the thought experiment of saying,
*  okay, maybe we do have alien spacecraft or just the thought experiment that aliens did visit.
*  This is very nihilistic, sad thought that it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't affect your life.
*  Can you explain that? I think many people
*  noticed this. This was a sign of how crazy the news cycle was at that point. We had COVID and
*  we had Trump and I forget when the UFO thing was really kicking off, but it just seemed like no one
*  had the bandwidth to even be interested in this. I was amazed to notice in myself
*  that I wasn't more interested in figuring out what was going on. I considered, okay, wait a minute,
*  okay, wait a minute. If this is true, this is the biggest story in anyone's lifetime.
*  Contact with alien intelligence is by definition the biggest story in anyone's lifetime,
*  in human history. Why isn't this just totally captivating? Not only was it not totally
*  captivating, it was just barely rising to the level of my being able to pay attention to it.
*  I view that one as to some degree an understandable defense mechanism against the
*  bogus claims that have been made about this kind of thing in the past.
*  The general sense is probably bullshit or it probably has some explanation that is
*  purely terrestrial and not surprising. There is somebody who, what's his name? Mick West,
*  is it a YouTuber? Yeah, Mick West. He debunks stuff.
*  Yeah. I have since seen some of those videos. This is going back still at least a year, but
*  some of those videos seem like fairly credible debunkings of some of the optical evidence.
*  I'm surprised we haven't seen more of that. There was a fairly credulous 60 minutes piece
*  that came out around that time looking at some of that video and it was the very video that he was
*  debunking on YouTube and his video only had 50,000 views on it or whatever. Again, it seemed like a
*  fairly credible debunking. I haven't seen debunkings of his debunkings.
*  I think there is, but he's basically saying that there is possible explanations for it.
*  Usually in these kinds of contexts, if there's a possible explanation, even if it seems unlikely,
*  it's going to be more likely than an alien civilization visiting us.
*  Yeah. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence principle, which I think is generally
*  true. Well, with aliens, I think generally, I think there should be some humility about what
*  they would look like when they show up. I tend to think they're already here.
*  The amazing thing about this AI conversation though is that we're talking about a circumstance where
*  we would be designing the aliens and there's every reason to believe that eventually this is
*  going to happen. I'm not at all skeptical about the coming reality of the aliens and we're going
*  to build them. Now, here's the thing. Does this apply to when super intelligence shows up?
*  Will this be trending on Twitter for a day and then we'll go on to complain about
*  something Sam Harris once again said on his podcast the next day?
*  You tend to trend on Twitter even though you're not on Twitter, which is great.
*  Yeah. I haven't noticed. I did notice when I was on, but-
*  Do you have this concern about AGI basically, the same kind of thing that we would just look
*  the other way? Is there something about this time where even like World War III, which has been
*  thrown around very casually, concerningly so, even that, the new cycle wipes that away?
*  Yeah. I think we have this general problem that we can't make certain information, even
*  unequivocally certain information, emotionally salient. We respond quite readily to certain
*  things. As we talked about, we respond to the little girl who fell down a well. That gets 100%
*  of our emotional resources, but the abstract probability of nuclear war, even a high probability,
*  even an intolerable probability, even if we put it at 30%. That's a Russian roulette with a gun
*  with three chambers. It's aimed at the heads, not only your head, but your kid's head and
*  everyone's kid's head. It's just 24 hours a day. I think people who, this pre-Ukraine, I think the
*  people who have made it their business professionally to think about the risk of nuclear war and to
*  mitigate it, people like Graham Allison or William Perry. I think they were putting
*  the ongoing risk, the risk that we're going to have a proper nuclear war at some point in the
*  next generation, people were putting it at something like 50%. They were living with this
*  sword of Damocles over our heads. Now, you might wonder whether anyone can have reliable intuitions
*  about the probability of that kind of thing, but the status quo is truly alarming. We've got
*  ICBMs on, I mean, leave aside smaller exchanges and tactical nukes and how we could have a world war
*  based on incremental changes. We've got
*  the biggest bombs aimed at the biggest cities in both directions and it's old technology,
*  right? It's vulnerable to some lunatic deciding to launch or misreading bad data. We know we've
*  been saved from nuclear war, I think at least twice by Soviet submarine commanders deciding,
*  I'm not going to pass this up the chain of command, right? It's like this is
*  almost certainly an error and it turns out it was an error. We need people to,
*  I mean, in that particular case, he saw, I think it was five, what seemed like five missiles launched
*  from the US to Russia and he reasoned if America was going to engage in a first strike, they'd
*  launch more than five missiles, right? This has to be fictional and then he waited long enough to
*  decide that it was fictional, but the probability of a nuclear war happening by mistake or some
*  other species of inadvertence, misunderstanding, technical malfunction, that's intolerable.
*  Forget about the intentional use of it by people who are driven crazy by some ideology.
*  And more and more technologies enable that kind of scale of destruction.
*  And misinformation plays into this picture in a way that is especially scary. I mean,
*  once you can get a deep fake of any current president of the United States claiming to
*  have launched a first strike and just send that everywhere.
*  But they could change the nature of truth and then that might change the
*  engine we have for skepticism, sharpen it. The more you have deep fakes.
*  And we might have AI and digital watermarks that help us. Maybe we'll not trust any information
*  that hasn't come through specific channels, right? I mean, so in my world, it's like,
*  I no longer feel the need to respond to anything other than what I put out in my channels of
*  information. There's so many people who have clipped stuff of me that shows the opposite
*  of what I was actually saying in context. I mean, the people have like re-edited my podcast audio
*  to make it seem like I said the opposite of what I was saying. It's like, unless I put it out,
*  you can't be sure that I actually said it. I mean, it's just, but I don't know what it's like to
*  live like that for all forms of information. And I mean, strangely, I think it may require a
*  greater siloing of information in the end. It's like we're living through this sort of wild west
*  period where everyone's got a newsletter and everyone's got a blog and everyone's got an
*  opinion. But once you can fake everything- There might be a greater value for expertise
*  for experts, but a more rigorous system for identifying who the experts are.
*  Yeah, or just knowing that it's going to be an arms race to authenticate information. So it's
*  like, if you can never trust a photograph unless it has been vetted by Getty images,
*  it has been vetted by Getty images because only Getty images has the resources to authenticate
*  the provenance of that photograph and a test that hasn't been meddled with by AI. And again,
*  I don't even know if that's technically possible. And maybe whatever the tools
*  available for this will be commodified and the cost will be driven to zero so quickly that
*  everyone will be able to do it. It could be like encryption, but-
*  And it will be proven and tested most effectively first, of course, as always in porn,
*  which is where most of human innovation technology happens first.
*  Well, I have to ask because Ron Howard, the director, asked us on Twitter,
*  since we're talking about the threat of nuclear war and otherwise, he asked,
*  I'd be interested in both your expectations for human society if, when we move beyond Mars,
*  will those societies be industrial based? How will it be governed? How will criminal
*  infractions be dealt with? When you read or watch sci-fi, what comes closest to sounding logical?
*  Do you think about our society beyond Earth? If we colonize Mars, if we colonize space?
*  Yeah. Well, I think I have a pretty humbling picture of that. Because we're still going to
*  be the apes that we are. So when you imagine colonizing Mars, you have to imagine a first
*  fist fight on Mars. You have to imagine a first murder on Mars.
*  Or also infidelity.
*  Yeah, extramarital affairs on Mars. So it's going to get really homely and boring really fast,
*  I think. It's like only the spacesuits or the other exigencies of just living in that atmosphere
*  or lack thereof will limit how badly we can behave on Mars.
*  But do you think most of the interaction will be still in meat space versus digital?
*  Do you think we're living through a transformation of a kind where we're going to be doing more and
*  more interaction than digital space? Like everything we've been complaining about Twitter,
*  is it possible that Twitter is just the early days of a broken system that's actually
*  giving birth to a better working system that's ultimately digital?
*  I think we're going to experience a pendulum swing back into the real world. I think many of us are
*  experiencing that now anyway. Just wanting to have face-to-face encounters and spend less time on our
*  phones and less time online. I think maybe everyone isn't going in that direction, but
*  I do notice it myself. Once I got off Twitter, then I noticed the people who were never on Twitter.
*  I have a lot of friends who are never on Twitter. They actually never understood
*  what I was doing on Twitter. It wasn't that they were seeing it and then reacting to it,
*  they just didn't know. It's like I'm not on Reddit either, but I don't spend any time thinking about
*  not being on Reddit. I'm just not on Reddit. Do you think the pursuit of human happiness
*  is better achieved and more effectively achieved outside of Twitter world?
*  Well, I think all we have is our attention in the end. We just have to notice what these various
*  tools are doing to it. It became very clear to me that it was an unrewarding use of my attention.
*  Now, it's not to say there isn't some digital platform that's conceivable that would be
*  useful and rewarding, but yeah, our life has doled out to us in moments. We're continually
*  solving this riddle of what is going to suffice to make this moment engaging and meaningful and
*  aligned with who I want to be now and how I want the future to look. We have this tension between
*  being in the present and becoming in the future. It's a seeming paradox. Again, it's not really a
*  paradox, but I do think the ground truth for personal wellbeing is to find a mode of being
*  where you can pay attention to the present moment, and this is meditation by another name.
*  You can pay attention to the present moment with sufficient gravity that you recognize that
*  just consciousness itself in the present moment, no matter what's happening, is already a
*  circumstance of freedom and contentment and tranquility. You can be happy now before anything
*  happens, before this next desire gets gratified, before this next problem gets solved. There's
*  this ground truth that you're free, that consciousness is free and open and unencumbered
*  by really any problem until you get lost in thought about all the problems that may yet
*  be real for you. The ability to catch and observe consciousness, that in itself is a source of
*  happiness. Without being lost in thought. This happens haphazardly for people who don't meditate
*  because they find something in their life that's so captivating, it's so pleasurable, it's so
*  thrilling. It can even be scary, but it can be even being scared is captivating. It gets
*  their attention, whatever it is. Sebastian Junger wrote a great book about people's experience in
*  war here. Strangely, it can be the best experience anyone's ever had because everything, it's like
*  only the moment matters. The bullet is whizzing by your head. You're not thinking about your 401k
*  or that thing that you didn't say last week to the person you shouldn't have been talking about.
*  You're not thinking about Twitter. It's like you're just fully immersed in the present moment.
*  Meditation is the only way, I mean that word can mean many things to many people, but
*  what I mean by meditation is simply the discovery that there is a way to
*  engage the present moment directly, regardless of what's happening. You don't need to be in a war,
*  you don't need to be having sex, you don't need to be on drugs, you don't need to be surfing.
*  It doesn't have to be a peak experience. It can be completely ordinary, but you can recognize that
*  in some basic sense, there's only this and everything else is something you're thinking.
*  You're thinking about the past, you're thinking about the future, and thoughts themselves
*  have no substance. It's fundamentally mysterious that any thought ever really commandeers
*  your sense of who you are and makes you anxious or afraid or angry or whatever it is.
*  The more you discover that, the half-life of all these negative emotions that blow all of us around
*  get much, much shorter. The anger that would have kept you angry for hours or days
*  lasts four seconds because the moment it arises, you recognize it and you can get off.
*  At minimum, you can decide whether it's useful to stay angry at that moment.
*  Obviously, it usually isn't. The illusion of free will is one of those thoughts.
*  Yeah. It's all just happening. Even the mindful and meditative response to this is just happening.
*  Even the moments where you recognize or not recognize is just happening.
*  This does open up a degree of freedom for a person, but it's not a freedom that gives
*  any motivation to the notion of free will. It's just a new way of being in the world.
*  Is there a difference between intellectually knowing free will as an illusion and
*  really experiencing it? What's the longest you've been able to experience,
*  the escape, the illusion of free will?
*  Well, it's always obvious to me when I pay attention. Whenever I'm mindful,
*  the term of jargon in the Buddhist and increasingly outside the Buddhist context is
*  mindfulness. There are different levels of mindfulness and there's different
*  degrees of insight into this. What I'm calling evidence of lack of free will and lack of the
*  self, I've got two sides of the same coin. There's a sense of being a subject in the middle of
*  experience to whom all experience refers, a sense of I, a sense of me. That's almost everybody's
*  starting point when they start to meditate and that's almost always the place people live
*  most of their lives from. I do think that gets interrupted in ways that get unrecognized. I
*  think people are constantly losing the sense of I. They're losing the sense of subject, object,
*  distance, but they're not recognizing it. Meditation is the mode in which you can
*  recognize. You can both consciously precipitate it, you can look for the self and fail to find it and
*  then recognize its absence. That's just the flip side of the coin of free will.
*  The feeling of having free will is what it feels like to feel like a self
*  who's thinking his thoughts and doing his actions and intending his intentions.
*  The man in the middle of the boat who's rowing, that's the false starting point. When you find
*  that there's no one in the middle of the boat, in fact, there's no boat, there's just the river,
*  there's just the flow of experience and there's no center to it and there's no place from which
*  you would control it. Again, even when you're doing things, this does not negate the difference
*  between voluntary and involuntary behavior. It's like I can voluntarily reach for this,
*  but when I'm paying attention, I'm aware that everything is just happening. The intention to
*  move is just arising. I'm in no position to know why it didn't arise a moment before or a moment
*  later or a moment or 50% stronger or weaker or so as to be ineffective or to be doubly effective,
*  where I lurched for it versus I move slow. I can never run the counterfactuals.
*  All of this opens the door to an even more disconcerting picture along the same lines,
*  which subsumes this conversation about free will and it's the question of whether
*  anything is ever possible. This is a question I haven't thought a lot about it, but
*  it's been a few years I've been kicking this question around.
*  What if only the actual is possible? We live with this feeling of possibility. We live with a sense
*  that I have two daughters. I could have had a third child. What does it mean to say that I
*  could have had a third child? You don't have kids, I don't think.
*  Not that I know of. The possibility might be there.
*  What do we mean when we say you could have had a child or you might have a child in the future?
*  What's the relationship between possibility and actuality and reality? Is there a reality in which
*  non-actual things are nonetheless real? We have other categories of non-concrete things. We have
*  things that don't have spatial temporal dimension, but they nonetheless exist. The integers, so
*  numbers. There's an abstract reality to numbers and it's philosophically interesting to think
*  about these things. In some sense, they're real and they're not merely invented by us. They're
*  discovered because they have structure that we can't impose upon them. They're not fictional
*  characters like Hamlet and Superman also exist in some sense, but they exist at the level of our own
*  fiction and abstraction. They're true and false statements you can make about Hamlet.
*  They're true and false statements you can make about Superman because the fictional worlds we've
*  created have a certain kind of structure. Again, this is all abstract. It's all abstractable from
*  any of its concrete instantiations. It's not just in the comic books and just in the movies.
*  It's in our ongoing ideas about these characters. Natural numbers or the integers don't
*  function quite that way. They're similar, but they also have a structure that's purely a matter
*  of discovery. You can't just make up whether numbers are prime. If you give me two integers
*  of a certain size, you mentioned two enormous integers. If I were to say, okay, well, between
*  those two integers, they're exactly 11 prime numbers. That's a very specific claim about which
*  I can be right or wrong, whether or not anyone knows I'm right or wrong. There's a domain of
*  facts there, but it's an abstract reality that relates in some way that's philosophically
*  interesting, metaphysically interesting to what we call real reality, the spatial temporal order,
*  the physics of things. Possibility, at least in my view, occupies a different space.
*  This is something, again, my thoughts on this are pretty inchoate. I think I need to talk to
*  a philosopher of physics and or a physicist about how this may interact with things like
*  the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. That's an interesting right.
*  Exactly. I wonder if discoveries in physics, like further proof or more concrete proof that
*  many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics has some validity if that completely starts to
*  change things. That's just more actuality. If I took that seriously, that's a case of,
*  and truth is that happens even if the many worlds interpretation isn't true, but we just imagine we
*  have a physically infinite universe, the implication of infinity is such that things will begin to
*  repeat themselves the farther you go in space. If you just head out in one direction, eventually
*  you're going to meet two people just like us having a conversation just like this, and you're going
*  to meet them an infinite number of times in every infinite variety of permutations slightly different
*  from this conversation. Infinity is just so big that our intuitions of probability completely
*  break down. But what I'm suggesting is maybe probability isn't a thing. Maybe there's only
*  actuality. Maybe there's only what happens. At every point along the way, our notion of what
*  could have happened or what might have happened is just that. It's just a thought about what could
*  have happened or might have happened. So it's a fundamentally different thing. If you can imagine
*  a thing that doesn't make it real. That's where that possibility exists, is in your imagination.
*  Possibility itself is a kind of spooky idea because it too has a sort of structure.
*  If I'm going to say, you could have had a daughter last year.
*  So we're saying that's possible but not actual.
*  There are things that are true and not true about that daughter. It has a kind of structure.
*  It's like- I feel like there's a lot of fog around the possibility. It feels like almost
*  like a useful narrative. But what does it mean? If we say,
*  you know, I just did that but it's conceivable that I wouldn't have done that. It's possible
*  that I just threw this cap but I might not have done that. So you're taking it very temporarily
*  close to the original, what appears a decision. Whenever we're saying something is possible
*  but not actual. This thing just happened but it's conceivable that it wouldn't have happened or
*  that it would have happened differently. In what does that possibility consist? Where is that?
*  For that to be real, for the possibility to be real, what claim are we making about
*  the universe? Well, isn't that an extension of the idea that free will is an illusion?
*  That all we have is actuality? That the possibility is an illusion?
*  Yeah, I'm just extending it beyond human action. This goes to the physics of things. This is just
*  everything. We're always telling ourselves a story that includes possibility.
*  Possibility is really compelling for some reason.
*  Well, yeah. This could sound just academic but every backward looking regret or disappointment
*  and every forward looking worry is completely dependent on this notion of possibility.
*  Every regret is based on the sense that I could have done something else. Something else could
*  have happened. Every disposition to worry about the future is based on the feeling that there's
*  this range of possibilities. It could go either way. Whether or not there's such a thing as
*  possibility, I'm convinced that worry is almost never psychologically appropriate because the
*  reality is in any given moment, either you can do something to solve the problem you're worried
*  about or not. If you can do something, just do it. If you can't, your worrying is just causing
*  you to suffer twice over. You're going to get the medical procedure next week anyway.
*  How much time between now and next week do you want to spend worrying about it?
*  It's going to ... The worry doesn't accomplish anything.
*  How much do physicists think about possibility?
*  Well, they think about it in terms of probability more often. But probability just describes ...
*  And again, this is a place where I might be out of my depth and need to talk to somebody to debunk
*  this. But the- Do therapy with a physicist.
*  Yeah. But probability, it seems, just describes a pattern of actuality that we've observed.
*  I mean, there are certain things we observe and those are the actual things that have happened.
*  We have this additional story about probability. We have the frequency with which things have
*  happened in the past. I can flip a fair coin and I know in the abstract that I have a belief that
*  in the limit, those flips, those tosses should converge on 50% heads and 50% tails. I have a
*  story as to why it's not going to be exactly 50% within any arbitrary timeframe.
*  But in reality, all we ever have are the observed tosses.
*  And then we have an additional story that, oh, it came up heads, but it could have come up tails.
*  Why do we think that about that last toss? And what are we claiming is true
*  about the physics of things if we say it could have been otherwise?
*  I think we're claiming that probability is true. That it allows us to have a nice model about the
*  world. It gives us hope about the world. Yeah. It seems that possibility has to
*  be somewhere to be effective. It's a little bit like what's happening with the laws of nature.
*  There's something metaphysically interesting about the laws of nature too, because
*  the laws of nature impose their work on the world. We see their evidence, but they're not reducible
*  to any specific set of instances. So there's some structure there, but the structure isn't
*  just a matter of the actual things. We have the actual billiard balls that are banging into each
*  other. All of that actuality can be explained by what actual things are actually doing.
*  But then we have this notion that in addition to that, we have the laws of nature that are
*  explaining this act. But how are the laws of nature an additional thing in addition to just
*  the actual things that actually affect causally? And if they are an additional thing, how are they
*  effective if they're not among the actual things that are just actually banging around?
*  Yeah. And so to some degree-
*  I see. Possibly has to be hiding somewhere for the laws of nature to be-
*  Possible. For anything to be possible, it has to be-
*  It has to have- It's a closet somewhere, I'm sure,
*  where all the possibility goes. It has to be attached to something.
*  You don't think Many Worlds is that? Because Many Worlds still exists.
*  We're in this strand of that multiverse. So still you have just a local instance of what is actual.
*  And then if it proliferates elsewhere where you can't be affected by it,
*  Many Worlds says you can't really connect with the other.
*  So Many Worlds is just a statement of basically everything that can happen, happens somewhere.
*  Maybe that's not an entirely kosher formulation of it, but it seems pretty close. But there's
*  whatever happens. In fact, relativistically, there's a- Einstein's original notion of a block
*  universe seems to suggest this. And it's been a while since I've been in a conversation with
*  a physicist where I've gotten a chance to ask about the standing of this concept in physics
*  currently. I don't hear it discussed much, but the idea of a block universe is that space-time
*  exists as a totality. And our sense that we are traveling through space-time,
*  where there's a real difference between the past and the future, that that's an illusion of just
*  the weird slice we're taking of this larger object. But on some level, it's like you're
*  reading a novel. The last page of the novel exists just as much as the first page.
*  It would be when you're in the middle of it and they're just- if we're living in anything
*  like that, then there's no such thing as possibility. It would seem there's just what is actual.
*  So as a matter of our experience, moment to moment, I think it's totally compatible with
*  that being true, that there is only what is actual. And that sounds to the naive ear,
*  that sounds like it would be depressing and disempowering and confining, but it's anything
*  but. It's actually a circumstance of pure discovery. You have no idea what's going to happen next.
*  You don't know who you're going to be tomorrow. You're only by tendency
*  seeming to resemble yourself from yesterday. There's way more freedom in all of that than
*  then it seems true to many people. And yet the basic insight is that you're not-
*  the real freedom is the recognition that you're not in control of anything.
*  Everything is just happening, including your thoughts and intentions and moves.
*  So life is a process of continuous discovery.
*  You're part of the universe. It's the miracle that the universe is illuminated to itself,
*  as itself, where you sit. And you're continually discovering what your life is. And then you have
*  this layer at which you're telling yourself a story that you already know what your life is.
*  And you know exactly who you should be and what's about to happen, or you're struggling to
*  form a confident opinion about all of that. And yet there is this fundamental
*  mystery to everything, even the most familiar experience.
*  We're all NPCs in a most marvelous video game.
*  Maybe, although my sense of gaming does not run as deep as to know what I'm committing to there.
*  It's a non-playing character.
*  You're more of a Mario Kart guy.
*  I was an original video gamer, but it's been a long time since I was there for Pong.
*  I remember when I saw the first Pong in a restaurant. I think it was
*  like Benny Hanna's or something. They had a Pong table.
*  And that was an amazing moment.
*  When you Sam Harris might live from Pong to the invention and deployment of a super intelligent
*  system.
*  Yeah. Well, that happened fast if it happens anytime in my lifetime.
*  From Pong to AGI, what kind of things do you do purely for fun that others might consider
*  a waste of time? Purely for fun.
*  Cause meditation doesn't count. Cause most people would say that's not a waste of time.
*  Is there something like Pong? That's a deeply embarrassing thing you would never admit.
*  I don't think, well, I mean, once or twice a year, I will play a round of golf,
*  which many people would find embarrassing. They might even find my play embarrassing,
*  but it's fun.
*  Do you find it embarrassing?
*  No. I mean, I love golf just takes way too much time. So I can only squander a certain
*  amount of time on it. I do love it. It's a lot of fun.
*  But you have no control over your actual performance. You're ever discovering.
*  I have control over my mediocre performance, but I don't have enough control as to make it
*  really good. But happily I don't, I, I'm in the perfect spot because I don't invest enough
*  time in it to care how I play. So I just have fun when I play.
*  Well, I hope there'll be a day where you play around golf with the former president,
*  Donald Trump. And I would love to be.
*  I would bet on him if we played golf, I'm sure he's some better golfer.
*  I miss the chaos of human civilization in modern times. As we've talked about,
*  what gives you hope about this world in the coming year, in the coming decade,
*  in the coming hundred years, maybe a thousand years, what's the source of hope for you?
*  Well, it comes back to a few of the things we've talked about. I think I'm,
*  I'm hopeful. I know that most people are good and are mostly converging on the same
*  core values, right? It's like we're not surrounded by psychopaths. And
*  the thing that finally convinced me to get off Twitter was how different life was seeming
*  through the lens of Twitter. It's like, I just got the sense that there's way more psychopaths
*  are effective psychopaths than I realized. And then I thought, okay, that's, this isn't real.
*  This is either a strange context in which actually decent people are behaving like psychopaths,
*  or it's a bot army or something that I don't have to take seriously. So yeah, I just think
*  most people, if we can get the incentives right, I think there's no reason why we can't
*  really thrive collectively. There's enough wealth to go around. There's enough,
*  there's no effective limit. I mean, again, within the limits of what's physically possible,
*  but we're nowhere near the limit on abundance. On this, forget about going to Mars, on this,
*  the one rock, right? It's like we could make this place incredibly beautiful and stable if we just
*  did enough work to solve some rather longstanding political problems.
*  The problem of incentives. So to you, the basic characteristics of human nature such that
*  will be okay if the incentives are okay. We'll do pretty good.
*  I'm worried about the asymmetries that it's easier to break things than to fix them. It's easier to
*  light a fire than to put it out. And I do worry that as technology gets more and more powerful,
*  it becomes easier for the minority who wants to screw things up to effectively screw things up
*  for everybody. So it's easier. It's like a thousand years ago, it was simply impossible for one person
*  to derange the lives of millions, much less billions. Now that's getting to be possible.
*  So on the assumption that we're always going to have a sufficient number of crazy individuals or
*  malevolent individuals, we have to figure out that asymmetry somehow. And so there's some
*  cautious exploration of emergent technology that we need to get our heads screwed on straight
*  about. So gain-of-function research. Just how much do we want to democratize all the relevant
*  technologies there? Do we really want to give everyone the ability to order
*  nucleotides in the mail and give them the blueprints for viruses online because of,
*  you're a free speech absolutist and you think all PDFs need to be exportable everywhere.
*  So this is where, yeah, so there are limits to, many people are confused about my take on free
*  speech because I've come down on a lot of different things. I've come down on the
*  unpopular side of some of these questions, but it's been, my overriding concern is that in many
*  cases I'm worried about the free speech of the individual businesses or individual platforms or
*  individual media people to decide that they don't want to be associated with certain things. So
*  like if you own Twitter, I think you should be able to kick off the Nazi you don't want to be
*  associated with because it's your platform, you own it. That's your free speech. And so
*  I think that's the side of my free speech concern for Twitter. It's not that every Nazi has the
*  right to algorithmic speech on Twitter. I think if you own Twitter, you should be, you or whether
*  it's just Elon or in the world where it wasn't Elon, just the people who own Twitter and the
*  board and the shareholders and the employees, these people should be free to decide what they
*  want to promote or not. I view them as publishers more than as a platform.
*  More than as platforms in the end and that has other implications. But I do worry about this
*  problem of misinformation and algorithmically and otherwise supercharged misinformation.
*  I do think we're at a bottleneck now. I guess it could be the hubris of every present generation
*  to think that their moment is especially important. But I do think with the emergence
*  of these technologies, we're some kind of bottleneck where we really have to figure out
*  how to get this right. And if we do get this right, if we figure out how to not drive ourselves crazy
*  by giving people access to all possible information and misinformation at all times,
*  I think, yeah, there's no limit to how happily we could collaborate with billions of creative,
*  fulfilled people. It's just- And trillions of robots, some of them sex robots, but that's
*  another topic. Robots that are running the right algorithm, whatever that algorithm is.
*  Whatever you need in your life to make you happy. Sam, the first time we talked is one of the huge
*  honors of my life. I've been a fan of yours for a long time. The few times you were respectful
*  but critical to me means the world. And thank you so much for helping me and caring enough
*  and caring enough about the world and for everything you do. But I should say that the
*  few of us that try to put love in the world on Twitter miss you on Twitter. Well, enjoy yourselves.
*  Yeah. Have a good party without me. Thanks so much. I'm very happy to do this. Thanks for the
*  invitation. Thank you. Great to see you again. Thanks for listening to this conversation with
*  Sam Harris. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Martin Luther King Jr.
*  Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.
*  Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
