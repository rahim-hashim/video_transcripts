# Jed Buchwald: Isaac Newton and the Philosophy of Science | Lex Fridman Podcast #214
**Lex Fridman:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRdL6ZzWBS0)
*  The following is a conversation with Jed Buckwald, a professor of history and a philosopher of science at Caltech,
*  interested especially in the development of scientific concepts and the instruments used to create and explore new effects and ideas in science.
*  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Jed Buckwald.
*  Does science progress via paradigm shifts and revolutions as philosopher Thomas Kuhn said or does it progress gradually? What do you think?
*  Well, I got into this field because I was Tom Kuhn's research assistant 50 years ago, 52 years ago.
*  He pulled me into it out of physics instead.
*  So I know his work pretty well and in the years when I was at MIT running an institute,
*  he was then in the philosophy department, used to come over all the time to the talks we held and so on.
*  So what would I say about that? He of course developed his ideas a lot over the years.
*  The thing that he's famous for, the structure of scientific revolutions, came out in 62.
*  And as you just said, it offered an outline for what he called a paradigmatic structure, namely the notion that
*  you have to look at what scientists do as forming a community of investigators
*  and that they're trying to solve various puzzles, as he would put it, that crop up,
*  figuring out how this works, how that works and so on.
*  And of course they don't do it out of the blue, they do it within a certain framework. The framework can be pretty vague.
*  He called it a paradigm
*  and his notion was that eventually they run into troubles or what he called anomalies, that kind of cracks things.
*  Somebody new comes along with a different way of doing it, etc. Do I think things work that way? No, not really.
*  Tom and I used to have lengthy discussions about that over the years.
*  I do think there is a common structure
*  that formulates both theoretical and experimental practices.
*  And historians nowadays of science like to refer to scientific work as what scientists practice. It's almost craftsman-like.
*  They can usually adapt in various ways.
*  And I can give you all kinds of examples of that. I
*  once wrote a book on the origins of wave theory of light and that is one of the
*  paradigmatic examples that Tom used, only it didn't work that way
*  exactly because he thought that what happened was that the
*  wave theory ran into trouble with a certain phenomenon, which it couldn't crack.
*  Well, it turned out that in fact historically that phenomenon was actually
*  not relevant later on to the wave theory and when the wave theory came in
*  the alternative to it, which had prevailed, which was Newton's views of light as particles,
*  that it seemed couldn't explain what the wave theory could explain. Again, not true.
*  Not true. Much more complex than that. The wave theory offered the opportunity to deploy
*  novel experimental and mathematical structures, which gave younger
*  scientists, mathematicians and others, the opportunity to
*  effect, manufacture, make new sorts of devices.
*  It's not that the alternative couldn't sort of explain these things, but it never was able to generate them
*  de novo as novelties. In other words, if you think of it as something scientists wanted
*  to progress in the sense of finding new stuff to solve,
*  then I think what often happens is that it's not so much that the prevailing view can't crack something
*  as that it doesn't give you the opportunity to do new stuff.
*  When you say new stuff, are we referring to experimental science here or new stuff in the space of new theories?
*  Could be both. Could be both, actually. So how does that, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the story of the wave
*  view? Sure.
*  The prevailing view of light,
*  at least in France, where the wave theory really first took off, although it had been introduced
*  in England by Thomas Young, the prevailing theory dates back to Newton, that light is a stream of particles,
*  and that refraction and reflection involve sort of repulsive and attractive forces
*  that deflect and bend the paths of these particles.
*  Newton was not able successfully to deal with the phenomenon of
*  what happens when light goes past a knife's edge or a sharp edge, what we now call diffraction.
*  He had
*  cooked up something about it that no mathematical structure could be applied.
*  Thomas Young first, but really this guy named Augustin Fresnel in France,
*  deployed,
*  in Fresnel's case, rather advanced calculus forms
*  of mathematics which enabled computations to be done and
*  observations to be melded with these computations
*  in a way that you could not do or see how to do with Newton. Did that mean that the Newtonian explanation of what goes on in
*  diffraction fails?
*  Not really. You can actually
*  make it work, but you can't generate anything new out of it. Whereas,
*  using the mathematics of wave optics in respect to a particular phenomenon called polarization,
*  which ironically was discovered by partisans of Newton's way of doing things,
*  you were able to generate devices
*  which reflect light in crystals, do various things, that the Newtonian way
*  could accommodate only after the fact. They couldn't generate it from the beginning. And so if you want to be
*  somebody who is working a novel vein,
*  which increasingly becomes the case with
*  people who become what we now call physicists in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s in particular,
*  then that's the direction you're going to go. But there were holdouts until the 1850s.
*  I want to try to elaborate on the nature of the disagreement you have with Thomas Kuhn.
*  So do you still believe in paradigm shifts? Do you still see that there is ideas that really have a transformational effect on science?
*  The nature of the disagreement has to do with how those
*  paradigm shifts come to be?
*  How they come to be and how they change. I certainly think they exist.
*  How strong they may be at any given time is maybe not quite as powerful as Tom
*  thought in general, although towards the end of his life he was beginning to develop different
*  modifications of his original way of thinking. But I don't think that the changes happen quite so
*  neatly, if you will, in reaction to novel experimental observations. They can be much more complex than that.
*  In terms of neatness,
*  how much of science progresses by individual lone geniuses,
*  and how much by the messy collaboration of competing and
*  cooperating humans.
*  I don't think you can cut that
*  with a knife to say it's this percent and that percent.
*  It's
*  almost always the case that there are one or two or maybe three
*  individuals
*  who are sort of central to what goes on when things begin to shift.
*  Are they inevitably and solely responsible for what then begins to happen
*  in a major way? I think not. It depends. You can go
*  very far back with this,
*  even into antiquity to see what goes on.
*  The
*  major locus we always talk about from the beginning is if you're talking about Galileo's work on motion, for example,
*  were there ways of accommodating it that others could adapt to without buying into the whole scheme? Yes.
*  Did it eventually evolve and start convincing people because you could also do other things with it that you couldn't otherwise do?
*  Also, yes. Let me give you an example. The great French mathematician philosopher Descartes,
*  who was a mechanical philosopher. He believed the world was
*  matter in motion. He never thought much of what Galileo had done in respect to motion
*  because he thought, well, at best it's some sort of approximative scheme or something like that.
*  But one of his
*  initial,
*  I wouldn't call him a disciple, but follower who then broke with him in a number of ways,
*  was a man named Christian Huygens, who was, along with Newton, one of the two greatest
*  scientists of the 17th century.
*  Huygens is older than Newton. Huygens
*  nicely deployed Galilean
*  relationships in respect to motion to develop all sorts of things, including the first pendulum governed
*  clock
*  and even figured out how to build one which keeps perfect time, except it didn't work.
*  But he had the mathematical structure for it. How well known is Huygens? Oh, very well known. Should I know him well?
*  Yes, you should.
*  Interesting. You should definitely know him well. No, no, no, no. Can we define should here?
*  Because I don't. Right.
*  So is this should like
*  a
*  yeah, can you define should?
*  Should means this.
*  If you had taken up to a second year of physics courses, you should, you would have heard his name
*  because one of the fundamental principles in optics is called Huygens principle.
*  Okay. Yeah, so I have and I have heard his name. There you go. No, but I don't remember. But you don't remember.
*  So, I mean there's there's a very different thing
*  between
*  names attached to principles and laws and so on that you sometimes let go of. You just remember the
*  equations of the principles themselves and the personalities of science. And there's certain personalities, certain human beings that stand out.
*  And that's why there's a sense to which
*  the lone inventor, the lone scientist is the way
*  I personally, I mean, I think a lot of people think about the history of science is these lone geniuses.
*  Without them the sense is if you remove Newton from the picture, if you remove Galileo from the picture,
*  then science would
*  there's almost a feeling like it would just have stopped there.
*  Or at the very least
*  there's a feeling like it would take much longer to develop the things that were developed. Is that a silly way to look at the history?
*  That's not entirely
*  incorrect, I suppose.
*  I
*  find it difficult to believe that had Galileo not existed that eventually someone like Huygens, for instance,
*  given the context of the time,
*  what was floating around
*  in the belief structure concerning the nature of the world and so on, the developments in mathematics and whatnot,
*  that sooner or later,
*  whether it would have been exactly the same or not, I cannot say.
*  But would things have evolved? Yes.
*  If we look at the long arc of history of science from back when we were in the caves,
*  trying to knock two rocks together or maybe make a basic tool to
*  a long time from now, many centuries from now, when human civilization finally destroys itself,
*  if we look at that history
*  and imagine you're a historian at the end, like with the fire of the apocalypse coming upon us,
*  and you look back at this time in the 21st century,
*  how far along are we on that arc?
*  Do you sense? Have we invented and discovered everything that's to be discovered or are we at like below 1%?
*  Well, you're gonna get a lot of absurd questions today. I apologize. It's a lugubrious picture you're
*  painting there. I don't even know what the word lugubrious means, but I love it.
*  Lugubrious. Well,
*  let me try and separate the question of whether we're all going to die in an apocalypse in several hundred years or not
*  from the question of where science may be sitting. Take that as an assumption.
*  Okay.
*  I find that hard to say, and I find it hard to say
*  because
*  in the deepest sense of the term,
*  as it's usually deployed by philosophers of science today, I'm not
*  fundamentally a realist. That is to say, I think our access
*  to the inner workings
*  of nature is inevitably mediated
*  by what we can do
*  with
*  the materials
*  and factors around us. We can probe things in various ways. Does that mean that I don't think that the
*  standard model in quantum electrodynamics is in... Of course not.
*  I wouldn't even dream of saying such a thing. It can do a lot,
*  especially when it comes to figuring out what's happening in very large expensive
*  particle accelerators
*  and applying results in cosmology and so on as well.
*  Do I think that we have inevitably
*  probed the depths of reality through this? I do not agree with Steven Weinberg, who thinks we have
*  about such things.
*  Do I, on the other hand, think that
*  the way in which science has been moving for the last hundred years, physics in particular is what I have in mind,
*  will continue on the same course?
*  In that sense, I don't because we're not going to be building bigger and bigger and more and more expensive
*  machines to rip apart particles in various ways.
*  In which case, what are physicists going to do? They'll turn their attention to other things.
*  Other aspects. There are all sorts of things we've never explained
*  about the material world. We don't have theories that go beyond a certain point for all sorts of things.
*  Can we, for example, start with the standard model and work our way up all the way to chemical
*  transformations? You can make an argument about it,
*  and you can justify things, but that's in chemistry. That's not the way people work.
*  They work with much higher level quantum mechanical relationships and so on.
*  So this notion of the deep theory to explain everything
*  is
*  a long-standing belief,
*  which goes back pretty far, although I think it only takes its fullest form
*  sometime in towards the end of the 19th century. So maybe we just speak to that. You're referring to
*  a hope, a dream, a reality of coming up with a theory of everything that explains everything.
*  So there's a very specific thing that that currently means in physics. There's the unification of the laws of physics.
*  But
*  I'm sure in antiquity or before it meant maybe something else, or is it always about physics?
*  Because I mean, I think as you've kind of implied,
*  in physics, there's a sense once you get to the theory of everything, you've understood everything.
*  But there's a very deep sense in which you've actually understood not very much at all.
*  You've understood at that particular level how things work,
*  but you don't understand how the abstractions on top of abstractions form
*  all the way to the chemistry, to the human mind, and the human societies, and all those kinds of things.
*  So maybe you can speak to the theory of everything in its history
*  and comment on what the heck does that even mean, the theory of everything.
*  Well, I don't think you can go back that far with something like that, maybe to the, at best to the 17th century.
*  If you go back all the way in antiquity, there are of course discussions about
*  the nature of the world.
*  But first of all, you have to
*  recognize
*  that
*  you have to recognize
*  that the manipulative character of physics and chemistry, the probing of,
*  let me put it this way,
*  we assume, and have assumed for a long time,
*  I'll come back to when in a moment,
*  that if I take
*  a little device, which is really complicatedly made out of all kinds of things,
*  and I put a piece of some material in it,
*  and I monkey around with it and do all kinds of unnatural things to it, things that wouldn't happen naturally,
*  and I find out how it behaves and whatnot, and then I try and make an argument about how that really applies,
*  even in the natural world without any
*  artificial structures and so on. That's not a belief that was widely held
*  by pretty much anyone until sometime maybe in the 1500s.
*  And when it was first held, it was held by people we now call alchemists.
*  So alchemy was the first, the early days of the theory of everything, of a dream of a theory of everything.
*  I would put it a little differently. I think it's more along the way a dream
*  that by probing nature in
*  artificially constructed ways,
*  we can find out what's going on deep down there.
*  So that was that's distinct from science being an observing thing, where you observe nature and you study nature.
*  You're talking about probing, like messing with nature to understand it.
*  Indeed I am, but that of course is the very essence of experimental science.
*  You have to
*  you have to manipulate nature to find out things about it, and then you have to convince
*  others
*  that you haven't so manipulated it that what you've done is to produce what amounts to
*  fake
*  artifactual behavior that doesn't really hold
*  purely naturally.
*  So where are we today in your sense to jump around a little bit with the theory of everything?
*  Maybe a quick kind of
*  sense you have about the journey in the world of physics that we're taking towards the theory of everything.
*  Well, I'm of course not a practicing physicist. I mean I was trained in physics at Princeton
*  a long time ago. Until Thomas Kuhn stole you away.
*  More or less. I was taking graduate courses in those days in general relativity.
*  I was an undergraduate, but I moved up and then I took a course with him.
*  Well, you made the mistake of being compelled by charismatic philosophers and never looked back.
*  I suppose so in a way.
*  From what I understand, talking especially to my friends at Caltech,
*  like Kip Thorne and others, the
*  the
*  fundamental notion is that actually the laws that even at the deepest level we can
*  sort of divine and work with in the universe that we inhabit are perhaps quite unique
*  to this particular universe as it formed at the Big Bang.
*  The question is
*  how deep does it go?
*  If you are very mathematically inclined, the prevailing notion for several decades now has been what's called string theory,
*  but that has not been able to figure a way to generate
*  probative experimental evidence, although it's pretty good apparently at accommodating things.
*  And
*  then the question is, you know, what's before the Big Bang? Or actually the word before doesn't mean anything given the nature of time, but
*  but
*  why do we have the laws that prevail in our universe?
*  Well, there is a notion that those laws prevail in our universe
*  because if they didn't, we wouldn't be here.
*  That's a bit of a cyclical, but nevertheless a compelling definition. And there's all kinds of things like
*  the
*  it seems like the unification of those laws could be discovered by looking inside of a black hole because you get both the general
*  relativity and the quantum mechanics, quantum field theory in there.
*  Experimentally, of course, there's a lot of interesting ideas. We can't really look close to the Big Bang. We can't look that far back.
*  There's Caltech and MIT will lie go, look in gravitational ways, perhaps allows us to march backwards and so on.
*  Yeah, it's really exciting space. And there's of course
*  the theory of everything
*  like with a lot of things in science
*  captivates the dreams of those who are perhaps completely outside of science.
*  It's the dream of discovering the key to how the, you know, the nature of
*  how everything works.
*  And that feels
*  that feels deeply human.
*  That's perhaps the thing the the basic elements of what makes up a scientist in the end is that curiosity,
*  that longing to understand.
*  Let me ask, you mentioned a disagreement with Weinberg on reality.
*  Could you elaborate a little bit?
*  Well, I obviously I don't disagree with Steve Weinberg on physics itself. I wouldn't know enough to even begin to do that.
*  And clearly, you know, he's one of the founders of the standard model and so on and it works
*  to a level of accuracy that no physical theory has ever worked at before.
*  I suppose the question in my mind is
*  something that
*  in one way could go back to the philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th century, namely
*  can we really ever
*  convince ourselves
*  that we have
*  come to grips
*  with something that is
*  not in itself
*  knowable to us
*  by our senses
*  or even
*  except in the most remote way through the complex instruments that we make
*  as to what it is that underlies everything. Can we corral it
*  with mathematics and experimental structures? Yes.
*  Do I think that a particular way of corralling nature
*  will inevitably play itself out?
*  I don't know.
*  It always has.
*  I'll put it to you that way.
*  So the basic question is
*  can we
*  know
*  reality?
*  Is that the the con question? Is that the Weinberg question?
*  We humans, okay with our brains, right? Can we
*  comprehend reality?
*  Sounds like a very trippy question because a lot of it rests on definitions of uh, no and comprehend and reality but
*  get to the bottom of it
*  Like it's it's turtles on top of turtles. Can we get to the bottom turtle?
*  Well, I say hello, maybe I can
*  put it to you this way in
*  a way that I we often I often begin discussions in a class on
*  the history of
*  science and so on
*  and say I'm looking at you. Yes
*  Um, you are in fact a figment of my imagination
*  You have a messed up imagination, yes. Well, what do I mean by that?
*  Um, if I were a dragonfly
*  Looking at you
*  whatever my
*  nervous system would form
*  by way of
*  a perceptual structure would is clearly be utterly different
*  from what
*  my brain
*  And perceptual system altogether is forming when I look at you
*  Who's right
*  Is it me or the dragonfly
*  Well, the dragonfly is certainly very impressive so I don't know but yes, it's uh the observer matters
*  So
*  Well, how does what is that supposed to tell us about objective reality?
*  Well, I think it means that it's very difficult to get beyond
*  the constructs
*  that our perceptual system is leading us to when we make
*  apparatus and devices and so on we're still making things
*  Uh the results of which or the outputs of which we process perceptually in various ways
*  And and an analogy I like to use with the students sometimes is this
*  All right. They all have their laptops open in front of them, of course, okay
*  and um, i've sent them
*  something to read
*  And I say, okay click on it and open it up. So pdf opens up. I said what are you looking at?
*  I said, well i'm looking at you know, the paper that you sent me
*  I said, no, you're not
*  What you're looking at is a stream of light coming off leds or lcds
*  Coming off a screen
*  And and I said what happens when you use your mouse and move that?
*  Fake piece of paper on the screen around what are you doing? You're not moving a piece of paper around are you?
*  You're moving a construct around
*  A construct that's being processed so that our perceptual system can interact with it in the way we interact with
*  Pieces of paper, but it's not real
*  So are there things outside of the reach of science
*  Can you maybe as an example talk about consciousness? I'm asking for a friend trying to figure this thing out
*  Well, boy, I mean I
*  I read a fair bit about that, but I certainly don't can't really say much about it
*  I'm a materialist
*  In the deepest sense of the term. I don't think there is anything out there
*  except material structures which interact
*  In various ways do I think for example that this bottle of water is conscious?
*  No, I do not
*  Although how would I know I can't talk to it
*  Yeah, but so what do it's a hypothesis you have it's an opinion an educated opinion that may be very wrong
*  Well, I know that you're conscious because I can interact directly with you, but am I?
*  Well, unless you're a figment of my imagination, of course nor or i'm a robot that's able to generate the illusion
*  Uh, yes the illusion of consciousness
*  Is effectively enough to facilitate a good conversation because we humans do want to pretend that we're talking to other conscious beings
*  That's how we respect them if it's not conscious. We don't respect them. We're not going to talk into robots
*  That's true. Of course, we generalize from our own inner sense, which is the kind of thing decart said
*  from the beginning and we generalize from that, but I do think that um
*  consciousness must be
*  Something whatever it is that occurs as a result of some particular organizational structure of
*  Material elements
*  Does materialism mean that it's all within within the reach of science?
*  My sense would be that especially as
*  Neuroscience
*  Progresses more and more and at caltech. We just built a whole neuroscience
*  arena and so on and as
*  more knowledge is gained about the ways in which
*  animals
*  When they behave what patterns show up at various parts of the brain and nervous system
*  And perhaps extending it to humans
*  eventually as well
*  We'll get more of a handle
*  on
*  What brain activity is associated?
*  with
*  Experiences that
*  We have as humans. Can we move from the brain activity to the experiences?
*  In terms of our person. No, you can't
*  perception is perception
*  That's a hypothesis once again, maybe maybe the
*  Maybe consciousness is just one of the laws of physics that's yet to be discovered
*  Maybe it permeates all matter
*  Maybe it's
*  maybe it's as simple as trying to plug it in and
*  Plug into the ability to generate and control that kind of law physics that would crack open
*  Or we would understand that the water that the bottled water is in fact conscious just much less conscious than us humans
*  And then we would be able to then generate
*  beings that are more conscious
*  Well, that'll be unfortunate. I'd have to stop drinking the water after
*  After that, sorry every time you take a take a sip. There's a little bit of a suffering going on, right?
*  what to use the
*  most
*  Interesting beautiful moments in the history of science what stands out
*  And then we can pull at that thread
*  Right
*  Well, I like to think of
*  events that have
*  A major impact and involve both beautiful
*  Conceptual
*  Mathematical if we're talking physical structures work and are associated as well with probing
*  experimental situations
*  so
*  Among my favorites is one of the most famous
*  Which was the young Isaac Newton's
*  Work with the colors produced when you pass sunlight through a prism
*  And why do I like that
*  It's not
*  Profoundly mathematical in one sense doesn't need it initially it needs the following though
*  Which begins to show you I think a little bit about what gets involved when you've got a smart individual
*  Who's trying to monkey around with stuff and finds new things about it?
*  First, let me say that the the notion the prevailing notion going back to antiquity was that
*  Colors are produced in a sense by modifying or tinting white light that they're
*  Modifications of white light in other words the colors are not in the sunlight in any way
*  Okay
*  Now what Newton did following experiments done by Descartes before him who came to very different conclusions
*  He took a prism
*  You might ask where do you get prisms in the you know 1660s
*  County fairs they were very popular
*  They were pretty crude with bubbles in them and everything but they produced colors so you could buy them at county fairs and things
*  Very popular. So they were modifying the white light well to create colors. They were creating colors from it. Well known
*  And what he did was the following he was by this time, even though he's very young a
*  very good mathematician and he could use the
*  Then known laws for how light behaves when it goes through glass to calculate what should happen
*  If you took light from the sun passed it from a hole through a little hole
*  Then hit the prism
*  Goes out of the prism goes strikes a wall a long distance away and makes a splash of light
*  Never mind the colors for a moment makes a splash of light there. He was very smart
*  first of all
*  He abstracts from the colors themselves, even though that's what everybody's paying attention to initially
*  And because what he knows is this he knows that if you take this prism
*  And you turn it to a certain particular angle that he knew
*  What it should be because he could calculate things
*  Very few other people in europe at the time could calculate things like he could
*  That if you turn the prism to that particular angle then the sun which is of course a circle
*  When its light passes through this little hole and then into the prism on the far distant wall
*  Should still make a circle
*  But it doesn't
*  It makes a very long image
*  Okay, and this led him to a very different conception of light
*  Indicating that there are different types of light in the sunlight now
*  To go beyond that what's particularly interesting. I think is the following when he published
*  This paper which got him into a controversy
*  He really didn't describe at all what he did. He just gave you some numbers
*  Now I just told you that you had to set this prism at a certain angle, right?
*  You would think because we do have his notes and so on
*  Um, you would think that he took some kind of complicated
*  Measuring device to set the prism. He didn't he held it in his hand
*  That's all
*  And he twiddled it around
*  And what was he doing?
*  It turns out that when you twiddle the prism around at the point where you should get a circle from a circle
*  It also is the place where the image does not move very fast
*  So if you want to get close to there you just twiddle it this is manipulative experimentation
*  Taking advantage through his mathematical knowledge
*  of the inherent
*  inaccuracies that label let you come to exact conclusions
*  Regardless of the built-in
*  Problematics of measurement. He's the only one I know of doing anything like that at the time
*  Yeah
*  Well, even still there's very few people that are able to have to calculate as well as he did to be a theoretician
*  and
*  An experimentalist like in the same moment
*  right, it's it's true, although until
*  uh the um, really the
*  Well into the 20th century
*  Maybe the beginning of the 20th century really, um, most of the most
*  significant experimental results
*  produced in the 1800s
*  Which laid the foundations for light electricity
*  Electrodynamics and so on
*  even
*  Hydrodynamics and whatnot were also produced by people who are both excellent
*  calculators
*  Very talented mathematicians and good with their hands experimentally
*  And then that led to the 21st century with enrico fermi that uh,
*  one of the one of the last people that was able to do that
*  both of those things very well and that uh
*  He built a little device called an atomic bomb
*  That has some positives and negatives
*  Well, right, of course that actually did involve some pretty large-scale elaborate equipment to yeah
*  Well holding a lot of prism in your hands same thing, right?
*  No, what's the controversy that you'd gotten into with that paper when he published it?
*  well, I
*  In a number of ways. Um, it's a complicated story. There was a
*  very talented character
*  Known as a mechanic mechanic means somebody who was a craftsman who could build and make really good stuff
*  And he was very talented. His name was robert hook
*  Talented his name was robert hook and he was the guy who?
*  At the weekly meetings of the royal society in london and newton's not in london, you know, he's at cambridge
*  He's a young guy
*  He would demonstrate new things and he was very clever
*  And he had written a book in fact called the micrographia which by the way he used a
*  microscope
*  to
*  Make the first depictions of things like a fly's eye
*  The structure of you know had a big influence and in there he also talked about light
*  And so he had a different view of light and when he read what newton was
*  Wrote he had a double reaction on the one hand. He said anything in there that is correct
*  I already knew and anything that I didn't already know is probably not right anyway
*  Uh gotta love egos, okay
*  Can you uh, can we just step back can you say who was isaac newton?
*  What are the things he contributed to this world in the space of ideas?
*  Wow
*  Who was he he was born in
*  1642
*  In and near the small town of grantham in england
*  In fact the house he was born in and that his mother died in is still there and can be visited
*  His father died before he was born
*  Uh, and his mother eventually remarried
*  Uh a man named reverend smith whom newton did not like
*  at all
*  uh
*  Because reverend smith took his mother away to live with him a few miles away
*  Leaving newton to be brought up more or less by his grandmother
*  Over there and he had huge resentment about that his
*  whole life
*  I think that gives you a little inkling that
*  Uh a little bit of trauma in childhood. Maybe a complicated father-son relationship can be useful to create a good scientist
*  Could be although this case it would be right the you know
*  Absent father non-father relationships so to speak. He was known as a kid little that we do know for
*  uh being very clever about uh, flying kites and
*  I there are stories about him putting candles and putting
*  flying kites and scaring the living devil out of people at night by doing that and things like that making things most of the
*  uh
*  Physicists and natural philosophers i've dealt with actually
*  Uh as children were very fond of making and playing with things
*  I can't think of one. I know of who wasn't
*  Actually, they're very good with their hands and whatnot
*  uh, he uh
*  Was uh, his mother wanted him to take over the manor it was a kind of farming manor they were
*  The class of what are known as yeomans
*  There are stories that he wasn't very good at that
*  One day one of the stories is he's sitting out in the field and the cows come home without him
*  And he doesn't know what's going anyway
*  uh add relatives and
*  He manages to get to cambridge sent to cambridge because he's known to be smart
*  He's read books that he got from local dignitaries and some relatives
*  Uh, and he goes there as what's known as a subsizer. What does that mean?
*  Well, it's not too pleasant. Basically a subsizer was a student who had to clean the bedpans of the richer kids
*  Okay, right
*  That didn't last too long
*  He makes his way
*  And he becomes absorbed
*  In some of the new ways of thinking that are being talked about
*  On the parts of decart and others as well. There's also the traditional curriculum which he follows and we have his notes
*  We have his student notebooks and so on we can see gradually this young man's mind
*  focusing and coming to grips with
*  deeper questions of the nature of the world and perception even and how we know things and also
*  probing and learning
*  Mathematical structures to such an extent that he builds on
*  some of the investigations that had been done in the
*  Period before him to create the foundations of a way of investigating
*  processes that happen and change
*  Continuously instead of by leaps and bounds and so on forming the foundation of what we now call the calculus. Yeah
*  so
*  Can you maybe just paint a little bit of a picture you've already started?
*  of
*  What were the things that bothered him the most
*  That stood out to him
*  The most about the traditional curriculum
*  About the way people saw the world you mentioned discrete versus continuous
*  Is there something where he began thinking in a revolutionary way because it's fascinating most of us go to college
*  Uh cambridge or otherwise
*  And we just kind of take what we hear
*  as gospel
*  right like not gospel but
*  As like facts you don't begin to sort of
*  See, how can I expand on this aggressively or how can I challenge everything?
*  That I hear like rigorously mathematically
*  Through the I mean, I don't even know how how rigorous the mathematics was at that point. I'm sure it was
*  Geometry and so on no calculus, huh?
*  There are elements of what turned into the calculus that
*  Predate newton, but how much how much rigor was there? How much uh, well rigor? No, and then of course no scientific method
*  Not really. I mean somewhat like I mean appreciation of data
*  Ah, that is a separate question from a question of method
*  Appreciation of data is a significant question as to what you do with data. There's lots of things you're asking
*  I apologize
*  So maybe let's backtrack and the first question is was there something that was bothering him that he especially
*  Thought he could contribute or work on
*  Well, of course, we can't go back and talk to him, but we do have these student notebooks
*  There's two of them one's called the philosophical questions and the other is called the waste book
*  the philosophical questions has discussions of the nature of reality and
*  Various issues concerning it and the waste book has things that have to do with motion in various ways what happens in
*  collisions and things of that sort
*  And it's a complicated story
*  But what's among the things that I think are interesting is he took notes in the philosophical questions on stuff that was
*  traditionally
*  Given to you in the curriculums going back several hundred years namely on
*  What scholars refer to as scholastic or neo scholastic ways of thinking about the world?
*  Dating back to the reformulation of aristotle in the middle ages by thomas equinas
*  In the church, this is a totally different way of thinking about things which actually connects to something we were saying a moment ago
*  for instance
*  Um, so i'm wearing a blue shirt
*  And I will sometimes ask students. Where is the blue?
*  And they'll usually say what's in your shirt?
*  And then some of them get clear and they say well, no, you know light is striking it photons are re-emitted
*  They strike the back of your retina and etc. Etc
*  And I said yes you what that means is that the blue?
*  is actually
*  an artifact of our perceptual system considered as
*  The percept of blue
*  It's not out there. It's in here. Yeah, right
*  That's not how things were thought about
*  Well into the 16th century the general notion
*  Dating back even to aristotelian antiquity and formalized by the 12th century
*  At the paris
*  Oxford and elsewhere is that qualities are there in the world?
*  They're not in us
*  We have senses and our senses can be wrong
*  You know, you could go blind things like that
*  But if they're working properly you get the actual qualities of the world now that break
*  which is
*  occurring
*  Towards the end of the 16th century and is most visible in decart
*  Uh is the break between conceiving that the qualities of the world are very different
*  From the qualities that we perceive
*  that in fact the qualities of the world consist almost entirely in shapes of various kinds and
*  maybe hard particles or whatever but
*  Not colors not sounds
*  not smells
*  Not softness and hardness. They're not in the world. They're in us
*  That break newton is picking up as he reads decart he's going to disagree with a lot in decart
*  but that break he is
*  Among other things picking up very strongly and that underlies a lot
*  Of the way he works later on when he becomes skeptical of the evidence provided by the senses
*  Yeah, that's that's actually I don't know the way you're describing is so powerful
*  It just makes makes me realize how liberating that is as a
*  As a scientist as somebody who's trying to understand reality
*  That our senses is just
*  Our senses are not to be trusted that reality is to be investigated through tools that are beyond our senses. Yes
*  Or that improve our senses improve our senses
*  in some ways
*  That's pretty powerful for I mean that is uh
*  for a human being
*  That's like einstein level
*  For for a human being to realize you can't I can't trust my own senses at that time
*  That's pretty trippy
*  All right, it's coming in it's coming in and I think it um, it arises probably, you know
*  a fair number of decades before that
*  Perhaps in part with all chemical experimentation and manipulations
*  That you have to go through elaborate structures to produce things
*  Uh and ways you think about it
*  But let me give you an example that you know
*  I think you might find interesting because it's from it involves that guy named hook that newton had an argument with
*  And um, he had lots of arguments with hook although hook
*  Was a very clever guy and gave him some things that stimulated him later anyway
*  Hook who was argumentative?
*  And he really was convinced that the only way to gain real knowledge
*  Of nature is through carefully constructed
*  Devices and he was an expert
*  Mechanic if you will at building such things
*  now there was a um
*  It was a rather wealthy man
*  In uh danzig
*  By the name of hevelius latinized name. He was a brewer in town
*  And he had become fascinated with the telescope
*  this is
*  30 years or so 20 or 30 years after the telescope had moved out and become more common
*  And he built a large observatory on the top of his
*  brewery
*  actually
*  And working with his wife
*  they they
*  used these very
*  elaborately constructed grass and metal instruments to make observations of positions of the stars and he published a whole new
*  Catalog of where the stars are
*  And he claimed it was incredibly accurate
*  He claimed it was so accurate that nothing had ever come close to it hook reads this and he says wait a minute
*  You didn't use a telescope here of any kind because what's the point?
*  Unless you do something to the telescope all you see are dots with stars you just use your eye your eyes can't be that good
*  It's impossible
*  So what did hook do to prove this?
*  He said what you should have done is you should have put a little device in the telescope that lets you measure distances between
*  These dots you didn't do that and because you didn't there's no way you could have been that good
*  At two successive meetings of the royal society
*  He hauls the members out into the courtyard
*  And he takes a card and he makes successive black and white stripes on the card
*  And he pastes the card up on a wall and he takes them one by one. He says now move back looking at it
*  Presumably with one eye until you can't tell the the black ones from the white stripes
*  He says that I can then measure the distance I can see the angles I can give a number
*  Then for what is the best possible?
*  What we would call perceptual acuity of human vision
*  And it turned out he thought to be something like 10 or more times worse
*  Than this guy have alias had claimed so obviously says hook of alias
*  Well years ago I calculated have alias's numbers and so on using modern
*  Tables from nasa and so on and they are even more accurate than have alias claimed and worse than that
*  The royal society sent a young astronomer named halley
*  Over to dunsig to work with him and halley writes back and he says I couldn't believe it
*  But I could he taught me how to do it and I could do it
*  But I could he taught me how to do it and I could get just as good as he how is it possible
*  Well here and this shows you something very interesting about experiments perception and everything else hook was right, but he was also wrong
*  He was wrong for the right reasons and he was right for the wrong reasons. And what do I mean by that?
*  What he actually found was the number for what we now call 2020 vision
*  He was right. You can't tell except a few people much better than that
*  Yeah, uh-huh, but he was observing the wrong thing. Yes
*  What have alias was observing was a bright dot
*  Um a star moving past a pointer
*  Our eyes are rather similar to frogs eyes
*  You know, i'm sure you've heard the story if I hold a dead
*  Fly on a string in front of a frog and don't move it the frog pays no attention
*  as soon as I
*  Move the fly the frog immediately tongue lights out because the visual system of the frog responds to motion
*  So does ours and our
*  Acuity for distinguishing motion from statics
*  Five or more times better. Yeah, that's fascinating
*  Damn, uh, and of course
*  I mean, I maybe you couldn't comment on
*  Their understanding
*  Of the human perceptual system at the time was probably really terrible
*  Like yeah, like i've recently been working with just almost as a fun side thing with vision scientists and peripheral vision
*  It's a it's a beautiful complex mess that whole thing
*  We still don't understand all the weird ways that human perception works and they were probably
*  Terrible at it
*  they probably didn't have any conceptual peripheral vision or or the fovea or
*  Or I mean basically anything
*  They had some I mean because actually was newton himself who probed a lot of this for instance
*  Uh newton the young newton trying to work his way around what's going on with colors?
*  Wanted to try and distinguish
*  Colors that occur through natural processes out there
*  And colors that are a result of our eyes not operating rights, you know what he did? It's a famous thing. He took a stick
*  And he stuck that stick under his lower eyelid and pushed up on his eyeball
*  And what that did would produce colored circles?
*  At diametrically opposite positions of the stick in the eyeball and he moved it around to see how they moved
*  trying to distinguish legit
*  right, I always have to tell my students don't do this but
*  Or do it if you want to be great
*  And remembered by human history that's that there's a lot of equivalent to sticking sticking to your eye in modern day that
*  May pay off in the end
*  Okay
*  As a small aside is the newton and the apple story true? No
*  Was it a different fruit?
*  As a colleague of mine named simon schaffer in england once said on a nova program that we were both on
*  The role of fruit in the history of science has been vastly exaggerated
*  Okay, so was there any I mean to to zoom out moments of epiphany
*  Is is there something to moments of epiphany or again this is the paradigm shift versus the gradualism
*  There is a shift. Um, it's a much more complex one than that and we
*  I'm
*  As it happens a colleague of mine and I are writing a paper right now
*  On one of the aspects of these things based on the work that many of our colleagues have done over the last
*  30 and 40 years
*  Let me try and see if I could put it to you this way
*  uh newton until the
*  early 1670s
*  Uh, and probably really until a fair time after that
*  First of all was not very interested in questions of motion
*  He was working actually
*  In all chemical relationships or what is called by historians chemistry a kind of early modern chemical structure
*  Uh colleagues of ours at indiana have even reproduced the amalgams that
*  anyway, um
*  His way of thinking about motion involved a certain
*  set of relationships
*  which
*  was not
*  conducive to
*  any application that would yield
*  computationally direct results
*  Uh for things like planetary motions, which he wasn't terribly interested in anyway
*  He enters a correspondence with his
*  Original nemesis robert hook and hook says well
*  Have you ever thought about and then hook tells him a certain way you might think about it? And when newton hears that
*  He recognizes that there is a way to inject time that would enable him to solve certain problems
*  Uh, it's not that he
*  That there was anything he thought before that was contrary to that way of thinking. It's just that that particular
*  Technical insight
*  was not something that
*  For a lot of reasons that are complex had never occurred to him
*  At all and that sent him a different way of thinking
*  But to answer your question about the apple business, which is always about you know gravity and the moon and all of that
*  No
*  The the the reason there is that the idea
*  that
*  What goes on here in the neighborhood of the earth?
*  And what goes on at the moon?
*  Let us say remind the sun and the planet
*  Can be due to a direct relationship
*  Between the earth let's say and the moon
*  is contrary
*  to fundamental
*  Beliefs held by many of the mechanical philosophers as they're called at the time in which everything has to involve
*  At least a sequence of direct contacts has to be something between here and there. Yes, that's involved
*  and
*  hook
*  Probably not thinking terribly deeply about it based on what he said along with others like the architect and mathematician christopher ran
*  A hearken back to the notion that well, maybe there is a kind of magnetic
*  relationship between the moon and maybe the planets and the earth and gravity and so on vague but establishing a direct
*  Connection somehow however, it's happening forget about it
*  Newton wouldn't have cared about that if that's all they said but it was when hook
*  Mentioned this different way of thinking about the motion
*  A way he could certainly have thought of because it does not contradict anything
*  Newton is a brilliant mathematician and he could see that you could suddenly start to do things with that
*  That you otherwise wouldn't connect this led eventually to another controversy with hook in which hook said well after newton published his great
*  Principia I gave him how to do this and then newton of course got ticked off about that and said well
*  Listen to this I did everything and because he had a picayune little idea. He thinks he can take credit for it
*  Okay
*  So his ability to play with his ideas mathematically is what solidified the initial intuition
*  That you could have was that the first time he was born the idea that you have action at a distance that you can have
*  Forces without contact which is another revolutionary idea
*  I would say that in the sense of dealing with
*  the mechanics of
*  Force-like effects considered to act at some distance
*  It is novel
*  With both hook and newton
*  At the time the notion that two things might interact at a distance with one another without direct contact that goes back to antiquity
*  Only there it would thought of more as a sympathetic reaction
*  You know to a magnet and and a piece of iron they have a kind of mutual sympathy
*  for one another
*  Like what love what are we talking about? Actually they do sometimes talk like that
*  That is love that I'm
*  I see now I talk like that all the time. I think love is somehow
*  In consciousness are forces of physics that yet to be discovered. Okay
*  now there's the
*  The other side of things which is calculus that you began to to talk about
*  So newton brought a lot of things to this world one of them is calculus
*  What is calculus?
*  and uh, what was role what was newton's role in bringing it
*  To life. What was it like? What was the story of bringing calculus to this world?
*  well
*  since the publication starting
*  many decades ago by
*  Tom white's side who's now deceased of newton's mathematical papers and we know a lot about
*  How he was pushing things and how he was developing things. It's a complex question to to to say what calculus is calculus
*  Is the set of mathematical techniques that enable you to investigate?
*  What we now call functions mathematical functions which are continuous
*  That is that are not formed out of a discrete
*  sets like the counting numbers
*  for instance
*  Newton there were already
*  Procedures for
*  Solving problems involving such things as finding areas
*  To under curves and tangents to to curves by using geometrical structures
*  But only for certain limited
*  types
*  Of curves if you will
*  Newton as a young man the
*  We know this is what happened is looking at
*  A formula which involves an expansion
*  in separate terms polynomial terms as we say for certain functions
*  I know I don't want to get complicated here about this but and he realizes it could be generalized
*  And he tries the generalization and that leads him to a an expansion formula called the binomial theorem
*  that
*  Enables him to move ahead with the notion that if I take something
*  That has a certain value
*  And I add a little bit to it and I use this binomial theorem and expand things out
*  I can begin to do new things
*  And the new things that he begins to do leads him to a recognition
*  that the calculations of areas and the calculations of tangents to curves
*  Are reciprocal to one another
*  and the
*  Procedures that he develops is a particular form of the calculus
*  In which he considers small increments and then continuous flows
*  and changes of curves
*  and so on and
*  We have relics of it in physics today the notation in which you put a dot over a variable
*  Indicating the rate of change of the variable that's newton's original type of notation the dot. Yeah
*  the dot notation
*  Possibly independently of newton
*  Because he didn't publish this thing. Although he became quite well known as quite a brilliant young man in part because
*  People heard about his work and so on
*  When another young man by the name of gottfried leibniz visited london
*  And he heard about these things
*  It is said that he independently
*  develops
*  His form of the calculus which is actually the form we use today both in notation and perhaps in certain
*  fundamental ways of thinking
*  It has remained a controversial point as to where exactly
*  And how much independently leibniz did it leibniz aficionados think
*  And continue to maintain he did it completely independently newton when he became president of the royal society
*  Put together a group to go on the attack
*  Saying no, he must have taken everything we don't know
*  But I will tell you this
*  about
*  25 or so years ago
*  A scholar who's a professor at indiana now
*  I named domenico melly
*  got his hands on
*  A leibniz manuscript called the ten tamin which was leibniz's attempt to produce an alternative to newton's mechanics
*  And it comes to some conclusions that you have in the newton's mechanics
*  Well, he published that but melly got the manuscript and what melly found out was that leibniz
*  Reverse engineered the principia and cooked it
*  Backwards
*  So that he could get the results he wanted now those were the mechanics
*  So that means his mind allows for that kind of thing some people
*  You're breaking some news today. You're starting some drama. Some people think so
*  I think most historians of mathematics do not agree with that
*  uh a
*  Friend of mine rather well-known physicist unfortunately died a couple years ago named mike nowenberg at uc santa cruz
*  Had some evidence along those lines didn't pass muster
*  With many of my friends who are historians of math. In fact, I edit with a historian of math a technical journal and
*  We were unable to publish it in there because we couldn't get it through any of our colleagues
*  But I am I remain suspicious
*  What is it about those tense relationships
*  And that kind of drama einstein doesn't appear to have much of that drama
*  Nobody claimed I haven't heard claims that they've
*  perhaps because
*  such crazy ideas of any of his major, uh
*  inventions major ideas
*  being those that are
*  Basically, I came up with it first or independently. There's not
*  As far as i'm aware not many people talk about general relativity
*  Especially in those terms, but with newton that was the case. I mean
*  Is that just the natural outgrowth of how science works is there's going to be personalities that
*  i'm not saying this about lens, but maybe I am that there's people who uh steal ideas for the
*  You know
*  Because of ego because of all those kinds of things. I don't think it's all that common frankly
*  um the newton
*  Hook leibniz contra thompson so on
*  Well, you know you're at the beginnings of a lot of things there and so on these
*  Are difficult and complex times as well. These are times in which
*  science as an activity
*  pursued by other than let us say
*  Interested aristocrats
*  Is becoming something somewhat different. It's not a professional community of investigators
*  In the same way, it's also a period in which
*  Procedures and rules are practice are being developed to avoid
*  Attacking one another directly and pulling out a sword to cut off the other guy's head if he disagrees with you
*  And so on
*  So it's a very different period
*  Controversies happen people get angry. I can think of a number of others
*  Including in the development of optics in the 19th century and so on
*  And it can get hot under the collar
*  Sometimes one character who's worked an area
*  extensively whether they've come up with something terribly novel or not and somebody else kind of moves in and
*  Does completely different novel things the first guy gets upset about it because
*  He's sort of muscled into what I thought was my area
*  Yeah, you find that sort of stuff. But do you have examples of cases where it worked out well like
*  That competition is good for the progress of science. Yeah, it almost always is good in that sense
*  It's just painful for the individuals involved. It can be yeah, it doesn't have to be, you know nasty
*  Although sometimes it is so on the space like for the example of the optics could you comment on that one?
*  Well, yeah, sure. Let me there's several but I could give you
*  All right, so i'll give you this example that probably is the most pertinent
*  The first
*  Polytechnic school like mit or caltech was actually founded in france during the french revolution it exists today
*  It's the a called polytechnique
*  right
*  And two people who were there?
*  Uh were two young men in the 90s 1790s
*  Named on the one hand françois aragot and the other jean baptiste bio. They both lived a long time
*  well into the 1850s
*  aragot became a major administrator of science and bio
*  His career started to peter out after about the late teens now
*  They are sent on an expedition
*  Which was one of the expeditions involving measuring things to start the metric system
*  There's a lot more to that story. Anyway, they come back
*  Aragot gets separated
*  He's captured
*  By pirates actually
*  Wounds up in
*  Tangier
*  Escapes is captured again. Everybody thinks he's dead. He gets back to paris and so on
*  He's greeted as a hero and whatnot in the meantime
*  Bio has pretty much published some of the stuff that he's done and aragot doesn't get much credit for it
*  And aragot starts to get very angry and bio is known for this kind of thing
*  So aragot anyway
*  Bio
*  Starts investigating a new phenomenon in optics involving something called polarization
*  And he writes all kinds of stuff on it aragot
*  Looks into this
*  And decides to write some things as well and actually
*  Bio gets mostly interested in it when he finds out that aragot is doing stuff
*  Now bio is actually the better scientist in a lot of ways, but aragot is furious about this
*  So furious that he actually demands and forces the leader of french science laplace the marquis de laplace
*  And cohorts to write a note in the published journal saying oh, excuse us
*  Actually aragot etc, etc. Yeah blah blah so
*  aragot continues to just hold this
*  antipathy and
*  Fear of bio. So what happens?
*  1815
*  Napoleon is finished at waterloo
*  right a young frenchman by the name of augustin fernel
*  Was in the army
*  Is going back to his home on the north coast of france in normandy passes through paris
*  aragot is friends with
*  fernel's uncle
*  Uh, who's the head of the ecole des beaux-arts at the time?
*  anyway
*  Frenel is already interested in certain things in light and he talks to aragot aragot tells him a few things fernel goes home
*  fernel is a
*  brilliant
*  experimenter
*  He observes things and he's a very good mathematician calculates things
*  He writes something up. He sends it to aragot aragot looks at it and aragot says to himself
*  I can use this to get back at bio
*  He brings fernel to paris sets him up in
*  A room at the observatory where aragot is for fernel to continue his work
*  Paper after paper comes out
*  Undercutting
*  Everything bio had done
*  What is it about jealousy and?
*  Just envy that could be an engine of creativity and and productivity
*  I don't know which one is better. I guess it depends on the personality both are useful engines and science
*  Well in this particular story, it's um
*  Maybe even more interesting because fernel himself the young guy
*  He knew what aragot was doing with him and he didn't like it
*  Yeah, he didn't want to get with he wrote his brother said I you know, I don't want to get in an argument with bio
*  I just want to do my stuff
*  Ego is beautiful. Okay, but back to uh newton
*  There's a bunch of things I want to ask but sort of
*  Let's say since we're on the leibniz and the topic of drama. Let me ask another drama question
*  What is the drama question?
*  What is the drama question?
*  What is the drama question?
*  What is the drama question?
*  What is the drama question?
*  What is the drama question?
*  Leibniz and the the topic of drama, let me ask another drama question. Why was newton a complicated man?
*  We're breaking news today this is like uh, right what was complicated
*  His brain structure was different. I don't know why he had a complicated young life as we've said
*  um
*  He had always been
*  very
*  Self-contained and solitary he had acquaintances and friends
*  And when he moved to london eventually he had quite a career
*  A career for instance that led him when he was famous by then the 1690s
*  He moves to london. He becomes first
*  Warden of the mint the mint is what produces coins and coinage was a complicated thing because there was counterfeiting going on
*  And he becomes master of the mint to the extent
*  And a guy at mit wrote a book about this a little bit we wrote something on it, too
*  I forget his name was levin
*  that newton sent
*  Investigators out to catch these guys and sent at least one of them a famous one named chaloner to the gallows
*  So he was
*  He and and one of the reasons he probably was so particularly angry at chaloner
*  Was chaloner had apparently said some nasty things about newton in front of parliament at some point
*  Fair enough. Yeah, that was apparently not a good idea. Well, he had a bit of a temper son. You had a bit of a clearly
*  Okay, clearly
*  but he um
*  He even as a young man at cambridge though. He doesn't come from wealth. He attracts
*  People who recognize his smarts
*  He there's a young fellow named humphrey newton
*  Shared his rooms, you know these students always shared rooms with one another
*  became his kind of
*  Emanuenses to write down what newton was doing
*  And so on
*  And there were others over time
*  Who he befriended in various ways and so on he was solitary
*  Uh
*  He had as far as we know no relationships with either women or men in anything other than a
*  formal way
*  Uh, the only those get in the way relationships, right? Well, I mean he was he he was
*  I don't know if he was close to his mother. I mean she passed away everything left him he went
*  To be with her after she died. He was close to his niece
*  Katherine barton who basically came to run his household
*  When he moved to london and so on and she married, uh a man named conduit who became one of the
*  People who controlled newton's legacy
*  Later on and so on
*  So he and and and you can even see the house that the townhouse that newton lived in in those days still there
*  All right, so there's the the story of newton coming up with quite a few ideas, uh during a pandemic
*  We're on the outskirts of a pandemic ourselves
*  Right and a lot of people use that example as motivation for everybody while they're in lockdown to get stuff done
*  Uh, so what's that about? Can you tell the story of that?
*  Well, I can let me first say that of course we've been teaching over zoom
*  Lately and there was no zoom back then
*  There was no zoom back then
*  Although it wouldn't have made much difference because the story was newton was so complicated in his lectures that at one point
*  To humphrey newton actually said that he might as well have just been lecturing to the walls because nobody was there
*  Yeah, to listen to it. So what difference but uh, also not a great teacher, huh?
*  Uh, if you look at his optical notes, if that's what he's reading from. Oh boy. Okay
*  No
*  So what uh, what can you say about that whole journey through the pandemic?
*  That uh that resulted in so much innovation. It's a short amount of time. Well, I mean there's two
*  Times that he goes home
*  Would he have been able to do it and do do it if he'd stayed at cambridge? I think he would have
*  I don't think it really uh, although I do like to tell my advanced students when I lecture on the history of physics to the
*  Physics and chemistry students
*  Especially we've been doing it over zoom in the last year when we get to newton and so on because these kids are you know
*  21 22 I like to say well, you know when newton was your age
*  And he had to go home
*  During an epidemic. Do you know what he produced?
*  So can you actually summarize this for people who don't know how old was newton and what did he produce?
*  Well newton goes up to cambridge as it said when he's 18 years old in 1660
*  and the so-called
*  Miraculous year the annus mirabilis where you get the
*  Development in the calculus and in optical discoveries, especially is 1666
*  Right, so he's what 24 years old?
*  uh at the time but
*  Judging from his the notebooks that I mentioned he's already before that come to an awful lot of
*  developments
*  Over the previous couple of years
*  uh
*  Doesn't have much to do with the fact that he twice went home
*  It is true
*  That the optical experiments that we talked of a while ago with the light on the wall moving up and down
*  We're done at home. In fact, you can visit the very room. He did it in to this day
*  Yeah, it's very cool. And if you look through the window in that room, there is an apple tree
*  Out there in the garden. So you might be wrong about this. I thought you were lying to me
*  Maybe there's an apple involved after all. Well, it's not the same apple tree, but it's cuttings. How do you know?
*  They don't last that long, but it's 400 years ago. Oh not this
*  Oh, wow, I continue with the dumbest questions. Okay, so you're saying that perhaps going home was not
*  It may have given him an opportunity
*  To work things through and after all he did make use of that room and he could do things like put a
*  You know a shade over the window move things around cut holes in it and do do stuff
*  Probably in his rooms at cambridge. He maybe not although
*  When he stayed at cambridge
*  Subsequently became a fellow and then the first actually the second lucasian professor there
*  he was actually really the first one because
*  Isaac barrow
*  Who was the mathematician professor of optics who recognized newton's genius gave up what would have been his position?
*  Because he recognized
*  Not newton may not have learned too much from him, although they did interact
*  And and so newton was the first lucasian professor really the one that steven hawking held
*  Till he died
*  And we know that the rooms that he had there at cambridge
*  Subsequently, those rooms are still there. He built an all-chemical furnace outside did all sorts of stuff in those rooms
*  uh, and
*  Don't forget you didn't have to do too much
*  As a lucasian professor every so often you had to go give these lectures whether anybody was there or not and deposit the notes
*  Uh, you know for the future, which is how we have all those things
*  Oh, they were stored and and now we have them and now we know just how terrible of a teacher newton was
*  Yeah, but we know how brilliant these notes are. In fact the second volume of newton's
*  Of the notes really on the great book that he published the optics which he published in 1704 that has just been
*  Finished with full annotations and analysis by the greatest
*  Analyst of newton's optics alan shapiro who?
*  Retired a few years ago at the university of minnesota and been working on newton's optics
*  Ever since I knew him and before and i've known him since
*  1976
*  is there
*  Something you could say broadly about what either that work on optics or principia itself as a
*  Something that i've never actually looked at as a piece of work
*  Is it
*  Powerful in itself or is it just an important?
*  moment in history in terms of the amount of inventions that are within
*  Amount of ideas that are within or is it a really powerful work in itself?
*  Well, it is a powerful work in itself. You can see
*  this
*  this guy
*  Coming to grips with and pushing through
*  And working his way around
*  Complicated and difficult issues melding
*  Experimental situations which nobody had worked with before even discovering new things trying to figure out ways of putting this together with mathematical structures
*  Succeeding and failing at the same time and we can see him doing that
*  I mean what is
*  What is contained within principia? I don't even know in terms of the scope
*  Of the work. All right. Is it the entirety of the body of work of uh, of newton? No, no, no, no the principia
*  Mathematica is a calculus
*  Well, he all right, so
*  The principia is divided into three books excellent
*  Book one contains his version of the laws of motion
*  And the application of those laws to figure out when a body moves in certain curves
*  And is forced to move in those curves by forces directed to certain fixed points
*  What is the nature of the mathematical formula for those forces?
*  That's all that book one is about and it contains not the kind of version of the calculus
*  that uses algebra of the sort that I was trying to explain before
*  but is done in terms of
*  ratios between
*  Geometric line segments when one of the line segments goes very very small
*  It's called a kind of limiting procedure which is calculus, but it's a geometrically structured
*  Although it's clearly got algebraic elements in it as well
*  And that makes the principia's mathematical structure rather hard for people who aren't studying it today to
*  Go back to
*  book two
*  Contains his
*  Work on what we now call hydrostatics and a little bit about hydrodynamics
*  hydrodynamics a fuller development of the concept of pressure
*  Which is a complicated concept and book three
*  Applies what he did in book one to the solar system
*  And it is successful
*  partially
*  Because
*  The only way that you can exactly solve the only types of problems you can exactly solve
*  in terms of the interactions of
*  Two particles governed by gravitational force between them is for only two bodies
*  If there's more than two
*  Let's say it's a b and c a x on b b x on c c x on a
*  You can cannot solve it exactly
*  You have to develop techniques the fullest sets of techniques are really only developed
*  About 30 or 40 years after newton's death by french
*  Mathematicians like laplace
*  newton
*  Tried to apply his structure to the
*  sun earth moon because the moon's motion is very complicated
*  the moon for instance
*  Exactly repeats its observable position among the stars
*  only every 19 years
*  That is if you look up where the moon is among the stars at certain times and it changes it's it's complicated
*  That's by the way that was discovered
*  That was discovered by the babelonians
*  That fact the 19 years thousands of years ago
*  Yes, and then you have to look that little piece of data and how do you make sense of it?
*  Let me that that is data and you have to and it's complicated
*  So newton actually kind of reverse engineered a technique that had been developed by a man named horrocks
*  Using certain laws of kepler's to try and get around this thing and newton then sort of
*  My understanding i've never studied this has reverse
*  Sort of reversed it and fit it together with his force calculations by way of an approximation
*  and uh
*  Was able to construct a model to make some predictions
*  It fit things backwards pretty well
*  Okay, where does data fit into this we kind of earlier in the discussion
*  Mentioned data as part of the scientific method
*  How important was data to newton?
*  Okay, so like you mentioned uh prizm and playing with it and looking at stuff and then coming up with calculations and so on
*  Where does data fit into any of his ideas?
*  All right. Well, let me say two things first one
*  We rarely use the phrase scientific method anymore because there is no one
*  easily
*  Describable such method in a certain I mean humans have been playing around with the world and learning how to repetitively do things
*  And make things happen ever since you know humans became humans
*  Um, do you have a preferred definition of the scientific method?
*  What are the various? Uh, no, I don't I prefer to talk about
*  The considered
*  manipulation of artificial structures to produce results that can be
*  worked together with schemes to construct other devices and make uh
*  Predictions if you will about the way such things will work
*  So ultimately it's about producing other devices. It's like leads you down. Uh, I think so principally
*  Uh, I mean you may have data if you will like astronomical data
*  Obtained otherwise and so on but yes
*  And but but but number two here is this question of data. What is data?
*  In that sense see when we talk about data today
*  We have
*  a kind of complex notion which
*  Reverts to even issues of statistics
*  and measurement procedures and so on so
*  Let me put it to you this way. So
*  Let's say I had a ruler in front of me go on and it's marked off in little black marks
*  separated by let's say distances
*  Called a millimeter
*  Okay. Now I make a mark on this piece of paper here. So I made a nice black mark, right?
*  Nice black mark and I ask you I want you to measure that and tell me how long it is
*  You're going to take the ruler
*  You're going to put it next to it
*  And you're going to look
*  And it's not going to sit even if you put one end as close as you can on one black mark
*  The other end probably isn't going to be exactly on a black mark
*  Well, you'll say it's closer to this or that you'll write down a number and I say, okay
*  Take the ruler away a minute. I take this away come back in five minutes put the piece of paper down do it again
*  You're going to probably come up with a different number
*  And you're going to do that a lot of times
*  And then if I tell you I want you to give me your best estimate of what the actual length of that thing is
*  What are you going to do?
*  You're going to average all of these numbers
*  Why?
*  Statistics
*  Well, yes
*  Statistics there's lots of ways of going around it
*  But the average is the best estimate on the basis of what's called the central limit theorem
*  A statistical thing we're talking about things
*  That were not really developed until the 1750s 60s and 70s newton died in 1727
*  The intuition perhaps was there not really i'll tell you what people did include
*  Newton although newton is partially the one exception
*  We talked a while ago about this guy chris chan huygens
*  He measured lots of things and he was a good
*  A mechanic himself he and his brother ground lenses huygens. I told you developed the first pendulum mechanism pendulum driven
*  Clock with a mechanism and so on also
*  A spring watch where he got into a controversy with hook over that by the way
*  What's these mechanics and the controversy? Yeah
*  Well, we also have
*  Huygens's notes
*  They're preserved at the at leiden university in holland. He's dutch
*  For his work in optics, which was extensive. We don't have time to go into that except the following
*  A number of years ago. I went through those things because in this optical theory that he had
*  There are four numbers that you've got to be able to get good numbers on to be able to predict other things
*  So what would we do today? What in fact was done at the end of the 18th century when somebody went back to this?
*  You do what you just I told you to do with the ruler you make a lot of measurements and average results
*  We have huygens's notes. He did make a lot of measurements
*  One after the other after the other
*  But when he came to use the numbers for calculations
*  And indeed when he published things
*  at the end of his life
*  He gives you one number and it's not the average of any of them. It's just one of them
*  Which one was it the one that he thought?
*  He got
*  so good at
*  Working by practice that he put down
*  At
*  Working by practice that he put down the one he was most confident in
*  That was the general procedure
*  At the time you wouldn't publish a paper in which you wrote down
*  Six numbers and said well, I measured this six times. Let me put them together. None of them is really
*  They would have said the right number
*  But i'll put them together and give you
*  A good number. No, you would have been thought of that, you know, you don't know what you're doing. Yeah
*  By the way, there's just an inkling of value to that approach
*  Just an inkling
*  We sometimes use statistics as like a thing that like oh that solves all the problems
*  We'll just do a lot of it and we'll take the average or whatever it is as many excellent books on mathematics have highlighted
*  the flaws
*  in our
*  approach to certain sciences
*  That rely heavily on statistics, okay, let me ask you again for a friend about uh, this alchemy thing
*  You know, it'd be nice to create gold but it also seems to uh
*  Come into play quite a bit throughout the history of science
*  Perhaps in positive ways in terms of its impact. Can you say something to the history of alchemy?
*  A little bit and its impact sure
*  It used to be thought
*  Two things one that alchemy
*  Which dates certainly back to the islamic period in islam
*  You're talking, you know
*  11th 12th 13th centuries
*  among islamic natural philosophers and experimenters
*  But it used to be thought that
*  alchemy which picked up strikingly in the 15th 16th century 1500s and thereabouts
*  Uh was a sort of mystical procedure
*  involving all sorts of strange notions and so on and
*  That's not entirely untrue
*  But it is substantially untrue in that alchemists were engaged in what?
*  Was known as chryso-poia. That is looking for ways to transform
*  Invaluable materials into valuable ones
*  but in the process of doing so or attempting to do so
*  they
*  learned how to
*  create
*  Complex amalgams of various kinds. They used very elaborate apparatus glass
*  Olympics in which they would use heat to produce chemical
*  Decompositions they would write down and observe these compositions and many of the so-called really
*  Strange looking alchemical formulas and statements where they'll say something like I I can't produce it
*  But it'll be the soul of mars will
*  Combine with the this etc, etc. These
*  It has been shown are almost all actual formulas for how to engage in the production of complex amalgams
*  And what to do?
*  and by the time of newton
*  newton was reading the works of a
*  Fellow by the name of starkey. It was actually it came from harvard
*  Shortly before
*  in which
*  Things had progressed if you will to the point where the procedure turns into what historians call chryso-poia
*  Which basically runs into the notion of thinking that may these things are made out of particles
*  This is the mechanical philosophy can we engage in processes chemical processes to rearrange these things
*  Which is not so stupid after all. I mean we do it except we happen to do it in reactors not in chemical processes
*  Unless of course it had happened that cold fusion had worked, which it didn't
*  Not yet. Well, right, but
*  So that's the way they're thinking about these things
*  They're thinking about these things. There's a kind of mix and newton engages extensively
*  in those sorts of manipulations in fact
*  more in that than almost anything else
*  Except for his optical investigations if you look through the latter parts of the 1670s
*  The last five six seven years or so of that there's more on that than there is on anything else
*  He's not working on mechanics. He's pretty much
*  Gone pretty far in optics. He'll turn back to optics later on so optics and alchemy
*  So what you're saying is isaac newton liked shiny things
*  Well, actually if you go online and look at what bill newman the professor at indiana
*  Uh at bloomington indiana has produced you'll find the very shiny thing called the star regulus
*  Which newton describes as having produced according to a particular way
*  Which newman figured out and was able to do it and it's very shiny
*  There you go proves the theorem
*  Uh, can I ask you about god religion and its role in newton's life?
*  Was there
*  Helpful
*  Constructive or destructive influences of religion in his work and in his life
*  Well there you begin to touch on a complex question, um
*  The role that god played would be an interesting question to answer
*  Should one go and be able to speak with this invisible character who doesn't exist but putting that aside for the moment
*  Yeah, we don't like to talk about others while they're not here. So right
*  newton is
*  A deeply religious man not unusually. So of course for the assignment
*  and um
*  Clearly
*  his upbringing
*  and perhaps his early experiences have
*  Exacerbated that in a number of ways that he takes a lot of things personally and and he finds perhaps solace
*  in thinking about a sort of governing
*  abstract
*  rulemaking
*  exacting
*  deity
*  I think there is little question
*  that his
*  Conviction that you can figure things out
*  has a fair bit to do
*  with his profound belief that this rulemaker
*  Doesn't do things arbitrarily
*  Newton does not think that miracles have happened
*  Since maybe the time of christ if then and not in the same way he was for instance an anti-trinitarian
*  He did not hold that christ had a divine being
*  But was rather endowed with certain powers by the rulemaker and whatnot
*  and um
*  he did not think that some of the
*  Um
*  Tales of the old testament with various miracles and so on occurred in anything like that way some may have some may not have
*  um, like everybody else, of course, he did think that creation had happened about
*  6 000 years ago
*  Wait, really? Oh, yeah, sure
*  Well biblical chronology can give you a little bit about that's a little controversial, but sure
*  Interesting
*  Wow, the deity created
*  The universe
*  6000 years ago and that didn't interfere with his
*  Uh playing around with the sun and the moon and the oh no because he's figuring out he's he's watching the brilliant
*  construction that this
*  Perfect entity did 6000 years ago
*  Yeah has produced plus or minus a few years. Well, if you go with bishop usher, it's 4004 bce
*  I
*  Want to be precise about it we always and this this is a serious program we always want to be precise
*  Uh, okay. Let me ask another ridiculous question if uh,
*  If newt nor to travel forward in time
*  and uh visit with einstein
*  And have a discussion about
*  um
*  Space time and general relativity that conception of time that conception of gravity. What do you think that discussion will go?
*  like
*  Uh put that way. I think newton would sit there in shock and say I have no idea what you're talking about
*  If on the other hand
*  There's a time machine you go back and bring a somewhat younger newton
*  Not a man my age say I mean he lived a long time
*  Uh, you know into his mid 80s
*  But take him when he's in his 40s, let's say
*  Bring him forward and don't immediately introduce him to einstein. Let's take him for a ride on a railroad
*  Let him experience the railroad. Oh, that's right
*  Take him around and um show him
*  uh
*  a sparking machine
*  He knows about sparks sending off sparks
*  Uh show him wires
*  Have him touch the wires and get a little shock show him a clicking telegraph
*  Machine of the kind then let him hear the clicks in a telephone receiver and so on do that
*  For a couple of months
*  Let him get accustomed to things
*  Then take him into not einstein yet. Let's say we're taking him into the 1890s
*  Einstein is young man. Then we take him into some of the laboratories
*  Stories
*  We show him some of the equipment the devices not the most elaborate ones
*  We show him certain things we educate him bit by bit on the optics maybe focus on that certainly
*  You begin to show him things. He's a brilliant human being
*  I think bit by bit
*  He would begin to see what's going on
*  But if you just dumped him in front of einstein he'd sit there his eyes would glaze over
*  I mean this uh, I guess it's it's almost a question
*  Of how big of a leap
*  How many leaps have been taken in science that go from newton to einstein?
*  We sometimes in a compressed version of history think that
*  Not much
*  Oh
*  Oh, that's totally wrong a lot
*  huge amounts in
*  multifarious ways
*  Involving fundamental conceptions mathematical structures the evolution of novel experimentation and devices the organization
*  everything
*  everything I mean to a point where I wonder even if newton was
*  Uh
*  Like you said 40 but even like 30
*  So he's very like if you would be able to catch up with the conception of everything. I wonder as a scientist
*  How much you load in from age five?
*  About this world in order to be able to conceive of the world
*  Of ideas that uh that push that science forward
*  I mean you mentioned the railroad and all those kinds of things that that we might that might be fundamental to our ability to invent
*  Even when it doesn't directly obviously seem relevant
*  Well
*  Yes, um
*  I mean the railroad the steam engine
*  The watt engine etc. I mean that was really the watt engine, you know was developed pretty although watt knew
*  Joseph black a chemist scientist so on did stuff on heat was developed pretty much independently of
*  The developing thoughts about heat
*  at the time but what it's not independent of
*  is the evolution of practice in the
*  manufacture and construction of devices which can do things in
*  extraordinarily novel ways and the premium being gradually placed on
*  Calculating how you can make them more efficient
*  That is of a piece
*  with a way of thinking about the world in which you're controlling things and
*  Working it. It's something that you know humans have been doing for a long time
*  But in this more concerted and
*  Structured way
*  I think you really don't find it in the fullest sense until
*  uh
*  Well into the 1500s and really not fully until the 17th century later on
*  So newton had this uh year of miracles
*  I
*  Wonder if I could ask you briefly about einstein and his year of miracles. I've been reading
*  I'm rereading revisiting
*  the brilliance of
*  The papers that einstein published in year 1905
*  One of which one of the noble prize the photoelectric effect, but also brony in motion special
*  theory of relativity
*  and of course the uh
*  The old e equals mc squared
*  Is there um
*  Does that make sense to you that uh, these two figures had such productive years?
*  That there's this moment of genius. Maybe maybe if we zoom out
*  I mean I my work is very much in artificial intelligence sort of
*  wondering about the nature of intelligence like how did we
*  How did evolution on earth produce?
*  genius
*  That could come up with so much in so little time to me that gives me hope that one person
*  Can change the world
*  In such a small amount of time. Well, of course there are
*  Precedents for
*  in both newton's and einstein's cases for elements of what we're finding there it's
*  You know and so on
*  Well, I have no idea, you know, i'm sure you must have read it was a kind of a famous story that um
*  After einstein died he donated his brain
*  And they sliced it up to see if they could find something unusual there nothing unusual visually
*  in there so I have
*  Clearly
*  There are people who for various reasons
*  maybe both intrinsic and
*  Extrinsic in the sense of experience and so on are capable of coming up with these extraordinary
*  Results many years ago when I was a student
*  Friend of mine came in and said did you read about did you read this? I forget what anyway?
*  There was a story in the paper
*  It was about I think it was a young woman
*  who um
*  was
*  She couldn't speak
*  And she she was somewhere on the autism spectrum. She could not
*  read
*  other people's affect
*  in any ways
*  But she could sit down at a piano
*  and
*  Having heard it once and then run variations on the most complex
*  Pianistic works of chopin and others right now how
*  How
*  Some aspect of our mind is able to tune in in some aspect of reality and become a master of it
*  And every once in a while that means
*  Coming up with breakthrough ideas in physics
*  Yep
