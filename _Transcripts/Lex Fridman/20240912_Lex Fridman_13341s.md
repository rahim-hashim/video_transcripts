# Gregory Aldrete The Roman Empire - Rise and Fall of Ancient Rome  Lex Fridman Podcast #443
**Lex Fridman:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY)
*  So Rome always wins because even if they lose battles, they go to the Italian allies and half
*  citizens and raise new armies. So how do you beat them? He can never raise that many troops himself.
*  Hannibal, I think, correctly figures out the one way to maybe defeat Rome is to cut them away from
*  their allies. Well, how do you do this? Hannibal's plan is, I'm not going to wait and fight the Romans
*  in Spain or North Africa. I'm going to invade Italy. So I'm going to strike at the heart of
*  this growing Roman Empire. And my hope is that if I can win a couple big battles against Rome in Italy,
*  the Italians will want their freedom back and they'll rebel from Rome and maybe even join me
*  because most people who have been conquered want their freedom back. So this is a reasonable plan.
*  So Hannibal famously crosses the Alps with elephants, dramatic stuff. Nobody expects him
*  to do this. Nobody thinks you can do this. Shows up in Northern Italy. Romans send an army. Hannibal
*  massacres them. He is a military genius. Rome takes a year, raises a second army. We know this story,
*  sends it against Hannibal. Hannibal wipes him out. Rome gets clever this time. They say,
*  okay, Hannibal's different. We're going to take two years, raise two armies, and send them both out
*  at the same time against Hannibal. So they do this. And this is the Battle of Cannae,
*  which is one of the most famous battles in history. Hannibal is facing this army of 80,000
*  Romans about. And he comes up with a strategy called double envelopment. I mean, we can go into
*  it later if you want, but it's this famous strategy where he basically kind of sucks the Romans in,
*  surrounds them on all sides. And then one afternoon at the Battle of Cannae, Hannibal kills
*  about 60,000 Romans. Now, just to put that in perspective, that's more Romans
*  hacked to death in one afternoon with swords than Americans died in 20 years in Vietnam.
*  The following is a conversation with Gregory Aldrete, a historian specializing in ancient Rome
*  and military history. This is the Lex Freedom podcast. To support it, please check out our
*  sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Gregory Aldrete.
*  What do you think is the big difference between the ancient world and the modern world?
*  Well, the easy answer, the one you often get is technology. And obviously, there's huge
*  differences in technology between the ancient world and today. But I think some of the more
*  interesting stuff is a little bit more amorphous things, more structural things. So I would say,
*  first of all, childhood mortality. In the ancient world, and this is true of Greeks,
*  Romans, Egyptians, really anybody up until about the Industrial Revolution,
*  about 30 to 40% of kids died before they hit puberty. So I mean, put yourself in the place
*  of an average inhabitant in the ancient world. If you were an ancient person, three or four of your
*  kids probably would have died. You would have buried your children. And nowadays, we think of
*  that as an unusual thing. And just psychologically, that's a huge thing. You would have seen multiple
*  of your siblings die. If you're a woman, for example, if you were lucky enough to make it to,
*  let's say, age 13, you probably would have to give birth four or five times in order just to
*  keep the population from dying out. So those kind of grim mortality statistics, I think,
*  are a huge difference psychologically between the ancient world and the modern.
*  But fundamentally, do you think human nature changed much? Do you think this is the same
*  elements of what we see today, fear, greed, love, hope, optimism and the cynicism,
*  the underlying forces that result in war, all of that permeates human history?
*  Crude answer, yes. I think human nature is roughly constant. And for me, as an ancient historian,
*  the kind of documents that I really like dealing with are not the traditional literary sources,
*  but they're the things that give us those little glimpse into everyday life. So stuff like tombstones
*  or graffiti or just something that survives on a scrap of parchment that records a financial
*  transaction. And whenever I read some of those, I'll have this moment of feeling, oh, I know
*  exactly how that person felt. Here across 2000 years of time, completely different cultures,
*  I have this spark of sympathy with someone from antiquity. And I think as a historian,
*  the way you begin to understand an alien, a foreign culture, which is what these cultures are,
*  is to look for those little moments of sympathy. But on the other hand, there's ways in which
*  ancient cultures are wildly different from us. So you also look for those moments where you just
*  think, how the hell could these people have done that? I just don't understand how they could have
*  thought or acted in this way. And it's lining up those moments of sympathy and kind of disconnection
*  that I think is when you begin to start to understand a foreign culture or an ancient
*  culture. I love the idea of assembling the big picture from the details and the little pieces,
*  because that is the thing that makes up life. The big picture is nothing without the details.
*  CB Yep. And those details would bring it to life. I mean, it's not the grand sweep of things. It's
*  seeing those little hopes and fears. Another thing that I think is a huge difference between
*  the modern world and the ancient is just basically everybody's a farmer. Everybody's a small family
*  farmer. And we forget this. I was just writing a lecture for my next great courses course,
*  and I was writing about farming in the ancient world. And I was really thinking,
*  if we were to write a realistic textbook of let's say the Roman Empire, nine out of 10 chapters
*  should be details of what it was like to be a small time family farmer, because that's what 90%
*  of the people in the ancient world did. They weren't soldiers. They weren't priests. They weren't
*  kings. They weren't authors. They weren't artists. They were small town family farmers. And they lived
*  in a little village. They never traveled 20 miles from that village. They were born there.
*  They married somebody from there. They raised kids. They mucked around in the dirt for a couple
*  decades and they died. They never saw battle. They never saw a work of art. They never saw
*  a philosopher. They never took part in any of the things we define as being history. So that's what
*  life should be. And that's representative. RG Nevertheless, it is the emperors and the philosophers
*  and the artists and the warriors who carve history. And it is the important stuff. So I mean,
*  that's true. There's a reason we focus on that. That's a good reminder though, if we want to truly
*  empathize and understand what life was like, we have to represent it fully. And I would say,
*  let's not forget them. So let's not forget what life was like for 80, 90% of the people in the
*  ancient world, the ones we don't talk about, because that's important too. So the Roman Empire
*  there is widely considered to be the most powerful, influential and impactful empire
*  in human history. What are some reasons for that? Yeah. I mean, Rome has been hugely influential,
*  I think, just because of the image. I mean, there's all these practical ways. I mean,
*  the words I'm using to speak with you today, 30% are direct from Latin, another 30% are from
*  Latin descended languages. Our law codes, I mean, our habits, our holidays, everything comes fairly
*  directly from the ancient world. But the image of Rome, at least again in Western civilization,
*  has really been the dominant image of a successful empire. And I think that's what gives it a lot of
*  its fascination, this idea that, oh, it was this great, powerful, culturally influential empire.
*  And there's a lot of other empires. I mean, we could talk about ancient China, which arguably was
*  just as big as Rome, just as culturally sophisticated, lasted about the same amount of time. But at least
*  in Western civilization, Rome is the paradigm. But Rome is a little schizophrenic in that it's both
*  the empire when it was ruled by emperors, which is one kind of model, and it's the Roman Republic
*  when it was a pseudo democracy, which is a different model. And it's interesting how some
*  later civilizations tend to either focus on one or the other of those. So the United States,
*  Revolutionary France, they were very obsessed with the Roman Republic as a model. But other people,
*  Mussolini, Hitler, Napoleon, they were very obsessed with the empire, Victorian Britain
*  as a model. So Rome itself has different aspects. Well, what I think is actually another big
*  difference between the modern world and the ancient is our relationship with the past.
*  So one of the keys to understanding all of Roman history is to understand that this was a people
*  who were obsessed with the past and for whom the past had power, not just as something inspirational,
*  but it actually dictated what you would do in your daily life. And today, especially in the
*  United States, we don't have much of a relationship with the past. We see ourselves as free agents,
*  just floating along, not tethered to what came before. And the classical story that I sometimes
*  tell my classes to illustrate this is Rome started out as a monarchy. They had kings. They were kind
*  of unhappy with their kings. Around 500 BC, they held a revolution and they kicked out the kings.
*  And one of the guys who played a key role in this was a man named Lucius Junius Brutus.
*  Okay. 500 years later, 500 years down the road, a guy comes along, Julius Caesar,
*  who starts to act like a king. So if you have trouble with kings in Roman society,
*  who are you going to call somebody named Brutus? Now, as it happens, there is a guy named Brutus
*  in Roman society at this time who is one of Julius Caesar's best friends, Marcus Junius Brutus.
*  Now, before I go further with the story, and I think you probably know where it ends,
*  I just have to talk about how important your ancestors are in Roman culture.
*  I mean, if you went to an aristocratic Roman's house and opened the front door and walked in,
*  the first thing you would see would be a big wooden cabinet. And if you opened that up,
*  what you would see would be row after row of wax death masks. So when a Roman aristocrat died,
*  they literally put hot wax on his face and made an impression of his face at that moment.
*  And they hung these in a big cabinet right inside the front door. So every time you entered your
*  house, you were literally staring at the faces of your ancestors. And every child in that family
*  would have obsessively memorized every accomplishment of every one of those ancestors.
*  He would have known their career, what offices they held, what battles they fought in, what they
*  did. When somebody new in the family died, there would be a big funeral, and they would talk about
*  all the things their ancestors had did. The kids in the family would literally take out those masks,
*  tie them onto their own faces, and wear them in the funeral procession. So you were like wearing
*  the face of your ancestors. So you as an individual weren't important. You were just the latest
*  iteration of that family. And there was enormous weight, huge weight to live up to the deeds of
*  your ancestors. So the Romans were absolutely obsessed with the past, especially with your own
*  family. Every Roman kid who was, let's say, in a aristocratic family could tell you every one of
*  his ancestors back centuries. I can't go beyond my grandparents. I don't even know. But that's,
*  you know, maybe a hundred years. So it's a completely different attitude towards the past.
*  And the level of celebration that we have now of the ancestors, even the ones we can name,
*  is not as intense as it was in Roman times. No, no. I mean, it was obsessive and oppressive.
*  It determined what you did. Oh, yes. Because there's that weight for you to act like your
*  ancestors did. Do you think, not to speak sort of philosophically, but do you think it was limiting
*  to the way the society develops to be deeply constrained by the limiting in a good way or a
*  bad way, you think? Well, you know, like everything, it's a little of both. But the bad, so on the one
*  hand, it gives them enormous strength and it gives them this enormous connection. It gives them
*  guidance. But the negatives, what's interesting, is it makes the Romans extremely traditional
*  minded and extremely conservative. And I mean, conservative in the sense of resistant to change.
*  So in the late Republic, which we'll probably talk about later, Rome desperately needed to change
*  certain things, but it was a society that did things the way the ancestors did it. And they
*  didn't make some obvious changes, which might've saved their Republic. So that's the downside is
*  that it locks you into something and you can't change. But to get us back to the Brutus's, so
*  500 years after that first Brutus got rid of kings, Julius Caesar Shartz act like a king. One of his
*  best friends is Marcus Junius Brutus. And literally in the middle of the night, people go to Brutus's
*  house and write graffiti on it that says, remember your ancestor. And another one is I think,
*  you're no real Brutus. And at that point, he really has no choice. He forms a conspiracy and
*  on the Ides of March 44 BC, he and 23 other senators take daggers, stick them in Julius
*  Caesar and kill him for acting like a king. So the way I always pose this to my students is,
*  how many of you would stick a knife in your best friend because of what your great-great-great-great-
*  great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather did?
*  That's commitment.
*  That's the power of the past. That's a society where the past isn't just influential,
*  but it dictates what you do. And that concept, I think, is very alien to us today. We can't imagine
*  murdering our best friend because of what some incredibly distant ancestor did 500 years ago.
*  But to Brutus, there is no choice. You have to do that. And a lot of societies have this power of
*  the past. Today, not so much, but some still do. About a decade ago, I was in Serbia and I was
*  talking to some of the people there about the breakup of Yugoslavia and some of the wars that
*  had taken place where people turned against their neighbors, basically murdered people they had lived
*  next to for decades. And when I was talking to them, some of them actually brought up things like,
*  oh, well, it was justified because in this battle in 12 whatever, they did this. And I was thinking,
*  wow, you're citing something from 800 years ago to justify your actions today.
*  That's a modern person who still understands the power of the past or maybe is crippled by it,
*  is another way to view it.
*  05 So this is an interesting point and an interesting perspective to remember about the
*  way the Romans thought, especially in the context of how power is transferred, whether it's
*  hereditary or not, which changes throughout Roman history. So it's interesting. It's interesting
*  to remember that the value of the ancestors.
*  06 Yep. And just the weight of tradition.
*  07 The weight of tradition.
*  06 For the Romans, the most maiorum is this Latin term, which means the way the ancestors did it.
*  And it's kind of their word for tradition. So for them, tradition is what your forefathers
*  and mothers did. And you have to follow that example and you have to live up to that.
*  08 Does that mean that class mobility was difficult? So if your ancestors were farmers,
*  there was a major constraint on remaining a farmer, essentially.
*  09 I mean, the Romans all like to think themselves as farmers, even filthy, rich Romans. It was just
*  their national identity is the citizen soldier farmer thing. But it did among the aristocrats,
*  the people who kind of ran things. Yeah, it was hard to break into that if you didn't have famous
*  ancestors. And it was such a big deal that there was a specific term called a novus homo, a new man
*  for someone who was the first person in their family to get elected to a major office in the
*  Roman government, because that was a weird and different and new thing. So you actually
*  designated them by this special term. So yeah, you're absolutely right.
*  09 So if we may let us zoom out, it would help me maybe I'll help the audience to look at the
*  different periods that we've been talking about. So you mentioned the Republic, you mentioned maybe
*  when it took a form of empire, maybe there's the age of kings. What are the different periods of
*  this Roman? Let's call it what the big Roman history, Roman history. And a lot of people
*  just call that whole period Roman Empire loosely, right? So maybe can you speak to the different
*  periods? Absolutely. So conventionally, Roman history is divided into three chronological
*  periods. The first of those is from 773 BC to 509 BC, which is called the monarchy. So all the
*  periods get their names from the form of government. So this is the earliest phase of Roman history.
*  It's when Rome is mostly just a fairly undistinguished little collection of mud
*  huts, honestly, just like dozens of other cities of little mud huts in Italy. So that early phase
*  about 750 to around 500 BC is the monarchy. They're ruled by kings. Then there's this revolution,
*  they kick out the kings, they become a republic. That lasts from 500 BC roughly to about either
*  31 or 27 BC, depending what date you pick is most important, but about 500 years. And the Republic
*  is when they have a Republican form of government. Some people idealize this as Rome's greatest
*  period. And the big thing in that period is Rome first expands to conquer all of Italy in the first
*  250 years of that 500 year stretch. And then the second 250 years, they conquer all the Mediterranean
*  basin roughly. So this is this time of enormous successful Roman conquest and expansion. And then
*  you have another switch up and they become ruled by emperors. So back to the idea of one guy in
*  charge, though the Romans try to pretend it's not like a king, it's something else. Anyway,
*  we can get into that, but they're very touchy about kings. So they have emperors, Roman Empire,
*  the first emperor is Augustus, starts off as Octavius, which is named Augustus when he becomes
*  emperor. He sets the model for what happens. And then how long does the Roman Empire last?
*  That's one of those great questions. The conventional answer is usually sometime in the
*  fifth century, so the 400 AD, so about another 500 years, let's say. So a nice even division,
*  500 years of Republic, 500 years of Empire. But you can make very good cases for lots of other
*  dates for the end of the Roman Empire. I actually think it goes all the way through the end of the
*  Byzantine Empire in 1453, so another 1500 years, but that's a whole nother discussion. So that's
*  your three phases of Roman history. And it's some fundamental way it still persists today, given
*  how much of its ideas define our modern life, especially in the Western world.
*  Can you speak to the relationship between Ancient Greece and Roman Empire, both in the chronological
*  sense and in the influence sense? Well, Ancient Greece comes,
*  the classical era of Greek civilization is around the 500s BC. That's when you have the
*  great achievements of Athens, it becomes the first sort of true democracy, they defeat the
*  Persian invasions, a lot of the famous stuff happens around in the 400s, let's say. So that
*  is contemporaneous with Rome, but the Greek civilization is peaking earlier. And one of the
*  things that happens is that Greece ends up being conquered by Rome in that second half of the Roman
*  Republic between 250 and about 30 BC. And so Greece falls under the control of Rome, and Rome is very
*  heavily influenced by Greek culture. They themselves see the Greeks as a superior civilization,
*  culturally more sophisticated, great art, great philosophy, all this. And another thing about the
*  Romans is they're super competitive. So one of the things that, one of the engines that drives
*  Romans is this public competitiveness, especially among the upper classes. They care more about
*  their status and standing among their peers than they do about money or even their own life.
*  So there's this intense competition. And when they conquer Greece,
*  Greek culture just becomes one more arena of competition. So Romans will start to learn
*  Greek, they'll start to memorize Homer, they'll start to see who can quote more passages of Homer
*  in Greek in their letters to one another because that increases their status. So Rome kind of
*  absorbs Greek civilization and then the two get fused together. The other thing I should mention
*  in terms of influences that's really huge on Rome is the Etruscans. And this is one that comes along
*  before the Greeks. So the Etruscans were this kind of mysterious culture that flourished in northern
*  Italy before the Romans, so way back 800 BC. They were much more powerful than the Romans.
*  They were kind of a loose confederation of states. For a while the Romans even seemed to have been
*  under Etruscan control. The last of the Roman kings was really an Etruscan guy pretty clearly.
*  But the Etruscans end up giving to Rome or you could say Romans up stealing perhaps
*  a lot of elements of Etruscan culture. And many of the things that we today think of as
*  distinctively Roman, that was our cliches of what a Roman is, actually aren't truly Roman.
*  They're stuff they stole from the Etruscans. So just a couple examples, the toga. What do you
*  think of a Roman? It's a guy wearing a toga and the toga is the mark of Roman citizen. Well,
*  that's what Etruscan kings wore probably. Gladiator games, we associate those very intensely with the
*  Romans. Well, they probably stole that from the Etruscans. A lot of Roman religion, Jupiter is a
*  thunder god, all sorts of divination. The Romans love to chop open animals and look at their livers
*  and predict the future. That comes from the Etruscans. Watching the flight of birds to
*  predict the future, that comes from the Etruscans. So there's a lot of central elements of what we
*  think of as Roman civilization, which actually are borrowings, let's say, from these older,
*  slightly mysterious Etruscans. I mean, that's a really powerful thing.
*  That's a powerful aspect of a civilization to be able to, we can call it stealing,
*  which is a negative connotation, but you can also see it as integration, basically.
*  Yes, steal the best stuff from the peoples you conquer or the peoples
*  that you interact with. Not every empire does that. There's a lot of nations and empires that,
*  when they conquer, they annihilate versus integrate. And so it's an interesting thing to be able to
*  culturally, like the form that the competitiveness takes is that you want to compete in the realm of
*  ideas and culture versus compete strictly in the realm of military conquest.
*  Yeah. And I think you've exactly put your finger on one of the, let's say, secrets of Rome's success,
*  which is that they're very good at integrating non-Romans or non-Roman ideas and absorbing them.
*  So one of the things that's absolutely crucial early in Roman history, when they're just one of
*  these tiny little mud hut villages fighting dozens of other mud hut villages in Italy,
*  why does Rome emerge as the dominant one? Well, one of the things they do is when they do
*  finally succeed in conquering somebody else, let's say another Italianate people,
*  they do something very unusual because the normal procedure in the ancient world is you conquer
*  another city. You often kill most of the men, enslave the women and children, steal all the
*  stuff, right? The Romans, at least with the Italians, conquer the other city and sometimes
*  do that, but sometimes they'll also then say, all right, we're going to now leave you alone and we're
*  going to share with you a degree of Roman citizenship. Sometimes they'd make them full
*  citizens more often than make them something we call half citizens, which is kind of what
*  sounds like you get some of the privileges of citizenship, but not all of them. Sometimes they
*  would just make them allies, but they would sort of incorporate them into the Roman project.
*  And they wouldn't necessarily ask for money or taxes, which is weird too,
*  but instead the one thing they would always, always demand from the conquered cities in Italy
*  is that they provide troops to the Roman army. So the army becomes this mechanism of Romanization
*  where you pull in foreigners, you make them like you, and then they end up fighting for you.
*  And early on, the secret to Rome's military success is not that they have better generals,
*  it's not that they have better equipment, it's not that they have better strategy or tactics,
*  it's that they have limitless manpower relatively speaking. So they lose a war and they just come
*  back and fight again and they lose again and they come back and they fight again. And eventually,
*  they just wear down their enemies because their key thing of their policy is we incorporate the
*  conquered people. And the great moment that just exemplifies this is pretty late in this process.
*  So they've been doing this for 250 years just about, and they've gotten down to the toe of Italy,
*  they're conquering the very last cities down there. And one of the last cities is actually
*  a Greek city, it's a Greek colony. It's a wealthy city and so when the Romans show up on the doorstep
*  and are about to attack them, they do what any rich Greek colony or city does, they go out and
*  hire the best mercenaries they can. And they hire this guy who thinks of himself as the new Alexander
*  the Great, a man named Pyrrhus of Apir. So he's a mercenary, he's actually related to Alexander
*  distantly. He has a terrific army, top-notch army, he's got elephants, he's got all the latest
*  military technology. The Romans come and fight a battle against him and Pyrrhus knows what he's
*  doing, he wipes out the Romans. He thinks, okay, now we'll have a peace treaty, we'll negotiate
*  something, I can go home. But the Romans won't even talk, they go to their Italian allies and
*  half-citizens, they raise a second army, they send it against Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus says, okay,
*  these guys are slow learners, fine. He fights them again, wipes them out. He thinks, now we'll have
*  a peace treaty. But the Romans go back to the allies, raise a third army and send it after Pyrrhus.
*  And when he sees that third army coming, he says, I can't afford to win another battle. I win these
*  battles, but each time I lose some of my troops and I can't replace them. And the Romans just keep
*  sprouting new armies. So he gives up and goes home. So Rome loses every battle, but wins the war.
*  And Pyrrhus, one of his officers has a great line as they're going back to Greece, he says,
*  fighting the Romans is like fighting a hydra. And a hydra is this mythological monster that when you
*  cut off one head, two more grow in its place. So you can just never win.
*  That's fascinating.
*  So that's the secret to Rome's early success.
*  That's not the military strategy. It's not some technological asymmetry of power. It's literally
*  just manpower.
*  Early on. And later, the Romans get very good when we're into the empire phase now. So once they have
*  emperors into the AD era of kind of doing the same thing by drawing in the best and the brightest and
*  the most ambitious and the most talented local leaders of the people they conquer. So when they
*  go someplace, let's say they conquer a tribe of what to them is barbarians, they'll often take the
*  sons of the barbarian chiefs, bring them to Rome and raise them as Romans. And so it's that whole
*  way of kind of turning your enemies into your own strength. And the Romans start giving citizenship
*  to areas they conquer. So once they move out of Italy, they aren't as free with the citizenship,
*  but eventually they do. So they make Spain, lost cities in Spain, they make all citizens in other
*  places. And soon enough, the Roman emperors and the Roman senators are not Italians. They're
*  coming from Spain or North Africa or Germany or wherever. So as early as the second century AD of
*  the Roman empire. So the first set of emperors, the first hundred years were all Italians.
*  But right away at the beginning of the second century AD, you have Trajan who's from Spain.
*  And the next guy Hadrian's from Spain. And then a century later, you have Septimius Severus,
*  who's from North Africa. You would later get guys from Syria. So I mean, the actual leaders
*  of the Roman empire are coming from the provinces. And it's that openness to incorporating foreigners,
*  making them work for you, making them want to be part of your empire that I think is one of
*  this Rome's strengths. Yeah. Taking the sons is a brilliant idea and bringing them to Rome
*  because it's a kind of generational integration. And the Roman military later in the empire is
*  this giant machine of half a million people that takes in foreigners and churns out Romans.
*  So the army is composed of two groups. You have the Roman legionaries who are all citizens.
*  But then you have another group that's just as large, about 250,000 of each, 250,000 legionaries,
*  250,000 of the second group called auxiliaries. And auxiliaries tend to be newly conquered warlike
*  people that the Romans enlist as auxiliaries to fight with them. And they serve side by side with
*  the Roman legions for 25 years. And at the end of that time, when they're discharged, what do they
*  get? They get Roman citizenship. And their kids then tend to become Roman legionaries. So again,
*  you're taking the most warlike and potentially dangerous of your enemies, kind of absorbing them,
*  putting through this thing for 25 years where they learn Latin, they learn Roman customs,
*  they maybe marry someone who's already a Roman or a Latin woman. They have kids within the system,
*  their kids become Roman legionaries, and you've thoroughly integrated what could have been your
*  biggest enemies, right? Your greatest threat. That's just brilliant, brilliant process of
*  integration. Is that what explains the rapid expansion during the late Republic?
*  No. So there it's more the indigenous Italians who are in the army at that point. They haven't
*  really expanded the auxiliaries yet. That's more something that happens in the empire.
*  So yeah, so back it up. So we have that first 250 years of the Roman Republic. So from about
*  500, let's say 250 BC. And in that period, they gradually expand throughout Italy,
*  conquered the other Italian cities who are pretty much like them. So they're people who already
*  speak similar languages or the same language, have the same gods. It's easy to integrate them.
*  That's the ones they make the half citizens and allies. Then in the second half, that period from
*  about 250 to let's say 30 BC, Rome goes outside of Italy. And this is a new world because now
*  they're encountering people who are really fundamentally different. So true others, they
*  do not have the same gods. They don't speak the same language. They have fundamentally different
*  systems of economy, everything. And Rome first expands in the Western Mediterranean. And there,
*  their big rival is the city state of Carthage, which is another city founded almost the same
*  time as Rome that has also been a young, vigorously expanding, aggressive empire.
*  So in the Western empire at this time, you have two sort of rival groups. And they're very different
*  because the Romans are these citizen soldier farmers. So the Romans are all these small farmers.
*  That's the basis of their economy. And it's the Romans who serve in the army. So the person who
*  is a citizen is also really by main profession of farmer. And then in times of war, he becomes a
*  soldier. Carthage is an oligarchy of merchants. So it's a very small citizen body. They make their
*  money through maritime trade. So they have ships that go all over the Mediterranean. They don't
*  have a large army of Carthaginians. Instead, they hire mercenaries mostly to fight for them.
*  So it's almost these two rival systems. It's different philosophies, different economies,
*  everything. Rome is strong on land. Carthage is strong at sea. So there's this dichotomy.
*  But they're both looking to expand. And they repeatedly come into conflict as they expand.
*  So Carthage is on the coast of North Africa. Rome's in central Italy. What's right between them? The
*  island of Sicily. So the first big war is fought purely dictated by geography. Who gets Sicily?
*  Rome or Carthage? And Rome wins in the end. They get it. But Carthage is still strong. They're not
*  weakened. So Carthage is now looking to expand. The next place to go is Spain. So they go and take
*  Spain. Rome, meanwhile, is moving along the coast of what today is France. Where are they going to
*  meet up? On the border of Spain and France. And there's a city at that point in time called
*  Saguntum. The second big war between Rome and Carthage is over. Who gets Saguntum? So you can
*  just look at a map and see this stuff coming. Sometimes geography is inevitability. And I think
*  in the course of the wars between Rome and Carthage called the Punic Wars, there is this
*  geographic inevitability to them. Can you speak to the Punic Wars? Why was, there's so many levels
*  on which we can talk about this, but why was Rome victorious? Well, the Punic Wars really almost
*  always comes down to the second Punic War. There's three. There's three Punic Wars. The first is over
*  Sicily, Rome wins. The second is the big one. And it's the big one because Carthage at this
*  point in time, just by sheer luck, coughs up one of the greatest military geniuses in all of history,
*  this guy Hannibal Barca. He was actually the son of the Carthaginian general who fought Rome for
*  Sicily. Hamilcar was his father. But Hannibal is this just genius, just absolute military genius.
*  He goes to Spain. He's the one who kind of organizes stuff there. And now he knows the second war with
*  Rome is inevitable. And so the question is, how do you take down Rome? He's smart. He's seen Rome's
*  strength. He knows it's the Italian allies. So Rome always wins because even if they lose battles,
*  they go to the Italian allies and half citizens and raise new armies. So how do you beat them?
*  He can never raise that many troops himself. And Hannibal, I think, correctly figures out
*  the one way to maybe defeat Rome is to cut them away from their allies. Well, how do you do this?
*  Hannibal's plan is I'm not going to wait and fight the Romans in Spain or North Africa. I'm going to
*  invade Italy. So I'm going to strike at the heart of this growing Roman empire. And my hope is
*  that if I can win a couple big battles against Rome in Italy, the Italians will want their
*  freedom back and they'll rebel from Rome and maybe even join me because most people who have
*  been conquered want their freedom back. So this is a reasonable plan. So Hannibal famously crosses
*  the Alps with elephants, dramatic stuff. Nobody expects him to do this. Nobody thinks you can do
*  this. Shows up in Northern Italy. Romans send an army. Hannibal massacres them. He is a military
*  genius. Rome takes a year, raises a second army. We know this story, sends it against Hannibal.
*  Hannibal wipes him out. Rome gets clever this time. They say, okay, Hannibal's different.
*  We're going to take two years, raise two armies and send them both out at the same time against
*  Hannibal. So they do this. And this is the Battle of Cannae, which is one of the most famous battles
*  in history. Hannibal is facing this army of 80,000 Romans about. And he comes up with a strategy
*  called double envelopment. I mean, we can go into it later if you want, but it's this famous strategy
*  where he basically kind of sucks the Romans in, surrounds them on all sides. And in one afternoon
*  at the Battle of Cannae, Hannibal kills about 60,000 Romans. Now, just to put that in perspective,
*  that's more Romans hacked to death in one afternoon with swords than Americans died in 20 years in
*  Vietnam. I mean, the Battle of Gettysburg, which lasted three days and was one of the bloodiest
*  battles of civil war, I think the actual deaths at that were maybe like 15,000. So this is a blood
*  shed of an almost unimaginable scale. It's also brutal. Yes. I mean, it's just mind-boggling to
*  think of that. So now this is Rome's darkest hour. This is why the Second Punic War is important
*  because there's that Nietzsche phrase, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
*  This is the closest Rome comes to death in the history of the Republic. Hannibal almost
*  kills Rome. But no, it's not much of a spoiler. Rome's going to survive. And from this point on,
*  they're going to be unbeatable. But this is the crisis. This is the crucible. This is the furnace
*  that Rome passes through that is the dividing point between when they're one more up and coming
*  empire and when they're clearly the dominant power in the Mediterranean. So what do they do
*  about Hannibal? Well, they're smart. We're not going to fight Hannibal. We're not going to give
*  Hannibal the chance to kill more Romans. So they adopt a strategy that they'll follow Hannibal,
*  or they raise a couple more armies, follow Hannibal around. But whenever Hannibal turns
*  and tries to attack them, the Romans just back off. No, thank you. We're not going to give you a
*  chance. Meanwhile, though, they're not scared of other Carthaginians. So they raise a couple more
*  armies and they send these to Spain, for example, and start attacking the Carthaginian holdings
*  there. And by luck or necessity, Rome comes up with its own brilliant commander at this point,
*  a guy named Scipio. And he wins victories in Spain, conquers Spain. Then he crosses into North
*  Africa and starts to conquer that and ends up threatening Carthage directly. And poor Hannibal,
*  undefeated in Italy, has now been walking up and down Italy or marching up and down Italy for 12
*  years looking for another fight and the Romans won't give it to him. They've been attacking all
*  these other areas and chipping away at Carthaginian power. So finally, after more than a decade in
*  Italy, Hannibal is called back to defend the homeland, defend Carthage from Scipio. The two
*  meet in a big battle. This should be one of the great battles of all times, the Battle of Zama,
*  but Hannibal's guys are kind of old by this point. Scipio has all the advantages. He wins,
*  Carthage is defeated. So that's pretty much the end of Carthage. The city survives and then 50
*  years later, the Romans wipe it out, but that's not much of a war. But from this moment on,
*  from the Second Punic War, which ends in 201 BC, Rome is undisputably the most powerful force,
*  nation in the Mediterranean world. Having conquered the West, they're now going to turn
*  to the East, which is the Greek world. The Greek world is older, it's richer, it's the rich part,
*  half of the Mediterranean, it's culturally more sophisticated. It's the world left by Alexander
*  the Great that's ruled by the descendants of his generals. The Greeks kind of view themselves as
*  superior to the Romans. I mean, to the Greeks, the Romans are these uncouth, sort of savage
*  barbarians, but they're going to get a real shock because the Roman army now has gotten really good
*  to beat Hannibal. And when they go East, they're going to just defeat the Greeks relatively easily
*  one after the other. And there's a famous historian named Polybius who is a Greek whose city was
*  captured by the Romans. He later up becomes a friend to the Scipio family. He actually teaches
*  some of the Scipio children about Greek culture. And he writes a history of Rome. And his motivation
*  for writing this is he says at the beginning of this book, he says, surely there can be no one so
*  incurious as to not want to understand how the Romans could have conquered the entire Greek world
*  in 53 years, because that seems unimaginable to him. So he's writing this entire history as a way
*  to try and understand how did the Romans do it. We were these wonderful, superior people,
*  and they came around in 50 years, bang, that's the end of us. So that's his motivation.
*  05.00 Could you maybe speak to any interesting details of the military genius of Hannibal or
*  Scipio? At that time, what are some interesting aspects of this double envelopment idea?
*  05.00 I mean, Hannibal is good because he understood how to use different troop types
*  and to play to their strengths and how to use terrain. So I mean, this is basic military stuff,
*  but he did it really well. So one of his victories against the Romans, for example,
*  is when the Romans are marching along the edge of a lake and their army is strung out in marching
*  formations. They're not kind of in combat formation, but they're strung out along the edge of this lake.
*  It's misty, there's not good visibility, and he ambushes them along this lakeside, so Lake Tricimene.
*  And it's just using the terrain, understanding this. Again, Hannibal is very much outnumbered,
*  but he's able to use the terrain and to take the enemy by surprise.
*  At Cannae, he's working against the expectations. So the traditional thing you do in the ancient
*  world is the two armies would line up on opposite sides of a field. You'd put your best troops in
*  the middle, you'd put your cavalry on the sides, you put your lightly armed skirmishers beyond those.
*  And then the two sides kind of smack together and the good troops fight the good troops and you see
*  who wins. Now, Hannibal is hugely outnumbered by this giant phalanx of heavy infantry, which is what
*  the Romans specialized in. They're very good at sort of heavily armed foot soldiers. So he knows,
*  I don't want to go up against that. I don't have that many of that troop type. My guys aren't as
*  good as the Romans anyway. So he lines up some of his less good troops in the center against the big
*  menacing Roman phalanx and he tells them, okay, when the Romans come, you're not really trying to
*  win. Just hold them up, just delay them. And even tells them you can give ground so you can retreat
*  and sort of let the line form a big kind of C-shaped crescents. Let the Romans sort of advance
*  into you, but just hold that line. And meanwhile, he puts his cavalry and his good troops on the
*  side. And so on the sides, those good troops defeat the Romans and then they kind of circle
*  in behind the Romans and attack that big menacing Roman phalanx from the rear where it's very
*  vulnerable. And so Hannibal catches the Romans in this sort of giant cauldron just with people
*  closing in from both sides. And they get pressed together. They can't fight properly. They panic
*  and they're all slaughtered. And that strategy of double envelopment of sort of going around
*  both sides becomes the model for all kinds of military strategies throughout the rest of
*  history. I mean, the Germans use this and their blitzkrieg in World War II, a lot of it was kind
*  of that, you know, go around the sides and envelop the enemy. On the Eastern front, they had a bunch
*  of these sort of cauldron battles where they would go around and try to encircle huge chunks of the
*  Soviet, the Russian army and do the same thing. Supposedly even in the Gulf War, it was part of
*  the US strategy for the invasion of Iraq to do this kind of double envelopment maneuver.
*  So it's something that for the rest of military history has been an inspiration to other armies.
*  Can you speak to them maybe the difference between heavy infantry and cavalry,
*  the usefulness of it in the ancient world? The ancient world sort of from the Greeks through
*  the Romans, there's this consistent line of focusing on heavy infantry. So going back to
*  Greece when they're fighting, let's say Persia, which at the time was the superpower of the ancient
*  world and vastly richer, vastly larger than ancient Greece, you know, tons more men. But the
*  Persians tended to be archers, tended to be light horsemen, tended to be light infantry,
*  whereas the Greeks specialized in what are called hoplites, which is a kind of infantrymen with very
*  heavy body armor, a helmet, a spear and a really big heavy shield. And they would get in that
*  formation where you kind of make the shields overlap and just form the solid mass bristling
*  with spear points and just slowly kind of march forward and grind up your enemy in front of you.
*  And so that's that sort of block of heavy infantry. The advantages head on against other things,
*  they tend to win. The disadvantages, it's slow moving, it's vulnerable from the sides and the
*  rear, so you've got to protect those. But if you can keep frontally faced, it's pretty much invincible.
*  And that's taken even further by Alexander the Great who comes up with the idea, well, what if
*  we even give them a longer spear? So Greek spears were six to eight feet long. Alexander the Great
*  arms his armies with the Sarissa, which is this 15 foot, almost a pike, this extra long spear.
*  And so when the spear is that long, you don't even hardly need the shields anymore. So it's just this
*  incredibly powerful thing in frontal attack. And that's what he uses to make himself ruler
*  of the known world. He goes and conquers the Persian Empire and makes himself the Persian
*  King of Kings with this phalanx of troops armed with the Sarissa. So that's very powerful.
*  The Romans go a little bit different route. They have heavy infantry, but they focus more on
*  fighting with short swords. So it's get up close and kind of stab. And the other thing the Romans
*  do is they focus on flexibility and subdividing their army. So Alexander's phalanx was a mass of,
*  let's say, 5,000 guys and it was one unit. The Roman army is organized in an ever decreasing
*  number of subunits. So you have a group of eight guys who are a contubernia, the men who share a
*  tent. You take 10 of those and they form a century of 80 men. You take a bunch of those and you form
*  a cohort. If we get a bunch of those, you form a legion. So the Romans are able to subdivide their
*  army. And the big sticking point comes at 197 BC at the Battle of Cynoscephali when the Roman legion
*  goes up against one of the descendants of Alexander the Great who's using his military system.
*  So this is their new Roman system with flexibility versus the old invincible Alexander system with
*  the heavily armed Sarissa with those long 15-foot poles. And the key moment in the battle is where
*  they lock together and in a head-on clash, the Macedonians are going to win. But the Romans have
*  the flexibility to break off a little section of their army, run around to the side and attack
*  that formation from the side and they win the battle. So they prove tactically superior because
*  of their flexibility. So it's always development and counterdevelopment in military history.
*  A fascinating, brutal testing ground of tactics and technology.
*  Adaptation. You have to keep adapting. That's, I think, the key thing.
*  One of the fascinating things about your work, you study Roman life, life in the ancient world,
*  but also the details, like we mentioned, you are an expert in armor. So what kind of,
*  maybe you could speak to weapons and most importantly armor that were used by the
*  Romans or by people in the ancient world. I do military history. So I mean, the Romans
*  specialized in, I mean, early on they have pretty random armor and it's not standardized. I mean,
*  remember there's no factories in the ancient world. So nobody's cranking out 10,000 units
*  of exactly the same armor. Each one is handmade. Now there can be a degree of standardization,
*  even as early as Alexander, there was a certain amount of standardization, but each one is still
*  handmade and that's important to keep in mind, each weapon, each piece of armor.
*  Armor develops over time to fit the tactics. So the Greek hoplites are very heavy armor.
*  The Roman infantrymen early in the Republic is lighter. Eventually they get this typical sort of
*  chain mail shirt, helmet shield. The classic sort of Roman legionary, I would say, is the one of the
*  first and second centuries AD, so the early Roman empire. And this is the guy who wore bands of
*  steel arranged in sort of bands around their body. So it looks almost like a lobster's shell, right?
*  And this is a thing called the lorica segmentata. So it's solid steel, which is very good protection,
*  but it's flexible because it has these individual bands that provide a lot of movement.
*  And then you have a helmet, you have a square shield that's kind of curved, and you have the
*  short sword, the Roman gladius, and that's kind of the classic Roman legionary. Later more things
*  develop. My personal sort of relationship with armor is I got really by accident involved in
*  this project to try to reconstruct this mysterious type of armor that was used, especially by the
*  Greeks and Alexander the Great called the line of thorax, which apparently was made only out of
*  linen and glue. So this seems a little odd that that's not the sort of material once you want
*  metal or something, but we had clear literary references that people, including Alexander,
*  in the most famous image of Alexander is this Alexander mosaic found at Pompeii that shows
*  him wearing one of these funny types of armor. The catch is none survived. It's organic materials.
*  So we don't have any of them. And archaeologists like to study things that survive. So we have nice
*  typologies of Greek armor made of bronze, Roman armor made of steel or sort of proto steel.
*  But this thing, this line of thorax was a mystery. And one of my undergraduate students,
*  a guy named Scott Bartel had a real, well, an Alexander obsession.
*  He really loved Alexander.
*  As one should.
*  He had Alexandros tattooed on his arm in Greek. And he was a smart student. He was really smart.
*  And so he one summer made himself an imitation of this thing of Alexander's just for fun.
*  And he said, can you give me some articles so I could do a better job? So I used some scholarly
*  articles about this armor and with typical sort of academic arrogance, I said, well, Scott,
*  of course I will. I'll give you some references. I went and looked and there weren't any.
*  So at that point I was like, huh, tell you what, why don't you and I look into this and try to
*  do a reconstruction using only the materials they would have had in the ancient world.
*  And little did I know at the time, I thought maybe I'll get an article out of this.
*  I mean, it ended up being a 10 year project involving, you know, 150 students, a couple dozen
*  other faculty members, you know, ended up having three documentaries made out of it. And Scott and
*  I ended up writing a scholarly book on this. So this is how, you know, you never know where
*  your next project's going to come from. So it started with this undergraduate turned into this
*  huge thing, but it's what we did. We first said, all right, what are all the sources for this armor?
*  And in the end, we found 65 accounts of it in ancient literature by 40 different authors. So
*  we have literary descriptions and then we looked at ancient art and we were able to identify about
*  a thousand images in ancient art in vase paintings, pottery, bronze sculpture, tomb paintings,
*  all these different things showing this armor. And then using those two things, we tried to
*  backwards engineer a pattern to say, well, if this is what the end product looked like, what does it
*  have to look like when you make it? And then we tried to reconstruct one of these things using
*  only the glue and materials. So we had to use, you know, animal glues, rabbit glue. We had to
*  end up sort of making our own linen, which comes from the flax plant. So we had to grow flax,
*  harvest it using only techniques in the ancient world. So modern flax goes through chemical
*  processes. No, we had to do this the old fashioned way, spin it into threads. So the thread into
*  fabric, glue it all together. And then the fun part was once we made these things, we subjected
*  them to ballistics testing. So we shot them with arrows, which again were wooden reconstruction
*  arrows using bronze arrowheads that were based on arrowheads found on ancient battlefields
*  to determine how good protection would this thing have been. And of course, the kind of fun one
*  that everyone always likes and that the documentaries always want is at one point they're like, well,
*  can you put Scott in one of these and shoot him? And we're like, okay. I mean, at that point,
*  we've done about a thousand test shots. I grew up shooting bows and arrows. I knew exactly how far
*  that was going to go. So it's one of these, don't do this at home kids. So there's a million
*  questions to ask here, but in general, how well in terms of ballistics does it work? Can it withstand
*  arrows or direct strikes from swords and axes and stuff like that?
*  Bottom line is a one centimeter thick line of thorax. So laminated or even sewn, it doesn't
*  have to be laminated, a layer of linen is about as good protection as two millimeters of bronze,
*  which was the thickest comparable body armor of bronze at the time. And we're talking
*  fourth century, fifth century BC here. So classical and Hellenistic Greece. And that would
*  have protected you from, let's say random arrow strikes on the battlefield. So you could have
*  gotten hit by arrows and they simply wouldn't have gone through. What are the benefits? So is there a
*  major weight difference? Yes. So the benefits of this are it's much lighter than metal armor. So
*  the line of thorax is about 11 pounds. A bronze queer ass of comparable protection would have been
*  about 24 to six pounds. A chain mail shirt would be about 28, 27 pounds. It's cooler. I mean,
*  the Mediterranean's a hot place with the hot sun. Even today, a linen shirt is something you wear
*  when you want to be cool. So it's much lighter. That gives your troops greater endurance on the
*  battlefield. They can run farther, fight longer. It's cheaper. You don't need a blacksmith who's
*  a specialist to make it. In fact, probably this interesting, any woman in the ancient world could
*  have made one of these because they were the ones who spun thread and sewed it into fabric.
*  So I can easily see in a household, a mother making this for her son, a wife making it for
*  her husband. So it's a form of armor you could have made domestically that would have been maybe
*  not the greatest armor, but pretty good, pretty comparable to bronze armor. And it's amazing that
*  you used all the materials they had at the time and none of the modern techniques. But I should
*  probably say, maybe you can speak to that. They were probably much better at doing that than you
*  are, right? Because again, generational, it's a skill. And it's a skill that probably is practiced
*  across decades, across centuries. I mean, in terms of producing the fabric, I'm sure they could do it
*  10 times faster than we could. Just that's a speed thing. But it's still incredibly labor intensive.
*  Where I think there's a big difference between our reconstruction and ancient ones is in the glue.
*  So we ended up using a kind of least common denominator glue. We used rabbit glue
*  because it would have been available anywhere and it's cheap. But in the ancient world, they did have
*  basically the equivalent of super glues. I mean, we found, for example, helmets that were fished
*  out of a river in Germany that had metal parts glued together that after 2000 years of immersion
*  in water were still glued together. So they had some great glues. We just don't know what the
*  recipes for them were. So we went the opposite tack and said, well, we're just going to make
*  something that we know they could have made. So it was at least this good. You know what I'm saying?
*  But actually, this is a materials thing. But I think glue, aside from helping glue things together,
*  it can also be a thing that serves as armor. So like if you glue things correctly, the way it
*  permeates the material that is gluing can strengthen the material, the integrity of the
*  material. That's an art and a science probably that they understood deeply. The process of
*  lamination did add something. So there's actually a huge debate among scholars and actually a sort
*  of amateur archaeologist that was this line of thorax thing glued together or was it simply
*  sewn together? Was it composite, partially linen, partially leather or other materials?
*  And my honest answer is I think it's all of the above because again, every piece of armor in the
*  ancient world was an individual creation. So I think if you had some spare leather, you put that
*  in. If you wanted to make one that was just sewn together or even quilted, stuffed with stuff,
*  you'd do that. Maybe you were good at gluing stuff, you use that. So I think there's no one answer.
*  We investigated one possibility because we just had limited time and money and resources.
*  But I think all these other things existed at the same time and were variants of it.
*  Just as a small aside, I just think this is a fascinating journey you went on. I love it.
*  Sort of answering really important questions about in this case, armor, about military equipment
*  and technology that archaeologists can't answer by using all the sources you can to understand
*  what it looked like, what were the materials, using the materials at the time and actually
*  doing ballistic testing. It's really cool. It's really cool that you see that there's a hole in
*  the literature. Nobody studied it and going hard and doing it the right way to sort of uncover this,
*  I don't know. I think it's an amazing mystery about the ancient world.
*  I mean, shifting from just sort of Roman history in general to my research that I've done as a
*  scholar, the theme that runs throughout my scholarship is practical stuff. I'm interested,
*  how did this actually work in the ancient world? So there's people who are much more theoretical,
*  who look at the symbolic meaning of something. I'm simpler. I just want to know how did this work?
*  Almost all of my books that I've written have started with some just how did something work?
*  I'm trying to just figure out that aspect of it and that's just maybe it's a personality thing.
*  I also have kind of a sciencey background, so I think I've used a lot of that. Even though I'm a
*  humanist and a historian, I use a lot of kind of hard science in my work. I did a book on floods
*  where I had to get really heavy into vectors of disease and hydraulics and engineering and
*  all that stuff. I think again, having that sort of hard science combined with a humanist background
*  helps with those sorts of projects. Well, like you said, I think the details
*  help you understand deeply the big picture of history. I mean, Alexander the Great wore this
*  thing. Yeah. I should say by the way, it does drop out of use around Roman times. I think what's
*  going on there is technology. With bronze, it's hard to keep a sharp edge on things,
*  but once you get into metals which approximate steel, you can get sharper. A key factor to
*  penetrating fabric is the edge on the arrowhead. As soon as you start to get something more like
*  a razor edge, it's going to go through it more easily. Also, there's changes in the bows that
*  are being used. You start to get sort of Eastern horse archers showing up with composite bows,
*  which are much more powerful. It just becomes outdated as frontline military equipment.
*  What's interesting is by the Roman period, people are still wearing it, but it's now things like
*  when I go hunting, if I'm hunting lions, I wear this. There's an actual source that says,
*  it's really good for hunting dangerous big cats because it catches their teeth and
*  stops them from penetrating. One emperor wears one of these under his toga. It's kind of like a
*  bulletproof vest, but stabproof vest. Again, it's not to fight in the front line of the
*  legions, but it'll protect him from somebody trying to assassinate him. It still has those
*  uses where you're not up against top line military equipment. To honor the aforementioned
*  undergraduate student who loves Alexander the Great, we must absolutely talk about Alexander
*  the Great for a little bit. Why was he successful, do you think, as a conqueror? Probably one of the
*  greatest conquerors in the history of humanity. Yeah. Is he one of the greatest heroes or one
*  of the greatest villains in humanity too? It's like Julius Caesar. He's famous for conquering
*  Gaul. Well, about a million people were killed, a million enslaved in that. Does it make him a
*  horrible person or one of our heroes? Alexander is a combination of two things. One is he really
*  just was a skilled individual. He was one of those guys who had it all. He was smart, he was athletic,
*  and he was supremely charismatic. It's obviously one of these people that would walk into a room
*  and everyone just kind of gravitates to him. He had that magic that made him an effective leader.
*  Secondly, he was lucky because it wasn't all him. He inherited a system created by his father,
*  Philip II. He was in the right time at the right place and had this instrument placed in his hands,
*  and then he had the intelligence and the charisma to go use it. It's one of these coming together
*  of different things. Often, his father's contribution I think is not recognized as much
*  as it is. It's his father who reformed the Macedonian army, who came up with that system
*  of equipping them with the serissa, this extra long spear that made them really effective,
*  created the mixed army. One of the keys to Alexander's success in a tactical sense is that
*  his army was composed of different elements, heavy cavalry, light cavalry, heavy infantry,
*  light infantry, missile troops. He understand that he can use these in different and flexible
*  ways on the battlefield, whereas a lot of warfare before then had just been you line up, two sides
*  smashed together. He did clever things with this army that was a better tool than others did.
*  Then he was just supremely ambitious. I mean, he cared about his fame, which I guess is ego,
*  but he clearly cared about that more than he did about things like money. He was indifferent to
*  that. He did have a grand vision. He did have this vision of trying to unite the world both
*  politically under his control, but also culturally. This is an interesting thing. He was very open,
*  in fact, insistent of trying to meld together the best elements of all the different cultures.
*  He himself was a Macedonian, but he admired Greek culture, so he pretty much adopted Greek
*  culture as his own. When he conquers Persia, he starts adapting elements of Persian culture.
*  He dresses in Persian clothing. He marries a Persian woman. He forces thousands of his troops
*  to marry local women. He appoints Persians to positions of power. He integrates Persian units
*  into his military. He really wanted to fuse all these things together. Some people see this as a
*  very enlightened vision that, oh, he's not just, I want to conquer people and now they're my slaves,
*  that he was really trying to create this one culture that was the best of everything.
*  Others see it, of course, as a form of cultural imperialism. You're destroying other cultures
*  and trying to warp or twist them into something. But what I think is interesting is that this
*  vision he had of uniting cultures creates very problematic tensions among his own followers
*  because the Macedonians, his original troops, did not like this on the whole. They wanted the old
*  model where we conquer you, you're our slaves. We don't want to share stuff with you. We don't
*  want you joining us in the army. We don't want you appointed to positions of power. We're your
*  conquerors and that's it. Alexander had to deal with a lot of friction from his own oldest,
*  most loyal elements at the way he was being, in their eyes, too generous to the conquered.
*  So, Alexander is one of these interesting personalities because every generation sees
*  him in a new light and focuses on different things. So, for some, he's this enlightened visionary
*  who was taught by Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, and they said, well, this influenced him.
*  Others see him as an egomaniacal warmonger, just I'm out to kill and gain glory. There was a book
*  a couple of decades ago that says, oh, he's just an alcoholic, which he probably was. Yeah. So,
*  you get all these competing images and the great thing is we don't really know what the true
*  Alexander was or what his motivations were. It's a mixed message.
*  AC Why do you think the Roman Empire lasted while the Greek Empire, as the
*  Alexander expanded, did not?
*  That's a clear answer. So, Alexander's empire fragmented the moment he died. And so, his empire
*  was all about personal loyalty. It was his charisma holding it together, his personality,
*  and he completely failed to create a structure so that it would continue after his death. And of
*  course, he died young. He didn't think he would die when he did, but still, you should put something
*  in place. So, his was a flash in the pan. It was, he had this spectacular conquest in 10 years,
*  he conquered what was then most of the known world, but he had no permanent structure in place.
*  He didn't really deal with the issue of succession. It fell apart instantly.
*  The Romans are much more about building a structure. So, I mean, as we talked about a little,
*  they were very good about incorporating the people they conquered into the Roman project.
*  I mean, they're oppressive. They're imperialistic as well. Let's not whitewash them. I mean,
*  they had moments when they would just wipe out entire cities. But on the whole,
*  they were much more about trying to bring people into the Roman world. And I think that was one
*  of their strengths is that they were open to integration and bringing in different people
*  to keep rejuvenating themselves. One of the most influential developments
*  from the Roman Republic was their legal system. And as you mentioned, it's one of the things that
*  still lasted to this day in many of its elements. So, it started with the 12 tables in 451 BC. Can
*  you just speak to this legal system and the 12 tables?
*  Yeah. I mean, Roman law is one of their most significant, maybe the most significant legacy
*  they have on the modern world. So, I mean, just to start at that end of it, something like 90%
*  of the world uses a legal system, which is either directly or indirectly derived from the Roman one.
*  So, even countries that you wouldn't think are really using Roman law kind of are because all
*  the terminology, all that comes from Roman law. And the Romans, their first law code was this
*  thing, the 12 tables. So, this is way back in the middle Republic and it was a typical early law
*  code. So, most of the stuff it concerns are agricultural concerns. So, if I have a tree
*  and its fruit drops onto your property, who owns the fruit? If my cow wanders into your field and
*  eats your grain, am I responsible? I mean, I love these early law codes that are all about this
*  farmer problems. But law codes are hugely important because you need a law code to enable
*  people to live in groups. So, they're the transitional thing that lets human beings live
*  together without just resorting to anarchy. And most of the early law codes are agricultural,
*  like Hammurabi's code in Mesopotamia. Most of them are retaliatory, meaning eye for an eye type
*  justice. So, you do something to me, it gets done to you. But they're this necessary precondition
*  for civilization, I would say. And the 12 tables is that. It's a crude law code. It has a lot of
*  goofy stuff in it. It has things about, if you use magic, this is the punishment. But it's that basic
*  agrarian society law code. Now, that's typical of many societies. Where the Romans are different is
*  they keep going. They keep developing their law code. And by the late Republic, the Romans just
*  get kind of really into legal stuff. I don't know why, but ‚Äì and the Romans were very methodical,
*  organized people, so maybe this has something to do with it. But their law code just keeps getting
*  more and more complicated and keeps expanding to different areas. And they start to get jurists who
*  write sort of theoretical things about Roman law. And eventually it becomes this huge body, both of
*  cases and comments on those cases and of actual laws. And in the 6th century AD, so the 500s,
*  the Roman Emperor Justinian, who is an emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire by this point,
*  the Byzantine Empire, compiles all this together into something that today we just kind of loosely
*  call Justinian's Code of Roman Law, and that survives. And so that becomes the basis for almost
*  all the legal systems around the world, and it's very complicated. And Roman law, I think,
*  is really fun because on the one hand, it's really dry, but it also preserves these wonderful little
*  vignettes of daily life. So you get these great just kind of entertaining law cases.
*  One of my favorite ‚Äì and this may not even be a real case, this might be a hypothetical that they
*  would use to train Roman law students ‚Äì is one day a man sends his slave to the barber to get
*  a shave. And the barber shop is adjacent to an athletic field, and two guys are on the athletic
*  field throwing a ball back and forth. And one of them throws the ball badly. The other guy fails
*  to catch it. The ball flies into the barber shop, hits the hand of the barber, cuts the slave's
*  throat. He dies. Who's liable under Roman law? Is it the athlete one who threw the ball badly?
*  Is it athlete two who failed to catch it? Is the barber who actually cut the slave's throat?
*  Is it the owner of the slave for being stupid enough to send his slave to get a shave in a
*  place adjacent to a playing field? Or is it the Roman state rezoning a barber shop next to an
*  athletic field? What do you think? Well, do they resolve the complexity of that with the right
*  answer? We don't have the answer. We don't have the answer. It's a case without the answer. So we
*  have various jurists commenting on this one, but we don't have what was actually ruled.
*  But it's just a great little sort of vignette. And that's how complicated Roman law got,
*  that it was dealing with these weird esoteric questions. There's another one where a cow gets
*  loose and runs into an apartment building, goes up onto the roof, and crashes down three stories
*  into a bar on the ground floor and kicks open the taps to the wine jug, and all the wine flows out.
*  Who's at fault? I mean, this seems to have happened, as crazy as it sounds.
*  And Roman testamentary law is great. I mean, something like 20% of Roman law has to do with
*  wills and what you do with the will and what makes a will valid. You have to have seven witnesses,
*  and you have to have a guy named a Libra Prens to witness it. And the witnesses have to be adult men
*  who can't be blind and all this other stuff. So it's just great. I mean, it's fun to mess around
*  in this, but it always contains these little nuggets about what happens. I mentioned I wrote
*  a book on floods. And there were all these law cases about if a flood strikes the city and picks
*  up my piece of furniture in my apartment building and carries it out the door and deposits it in
*  another apartment building, does that guy now own my furniture? Because it's now legally within
*  his apartment, or can I go in there and repossess it because the flood took it out of my apartment?
*  This is the stuff laws handle. And that's how sophisticated Roman law got.
*  Did kind of corrupt unfair things seep into the law?
*  Oh yeah. I mean, it's biased in favor of the wealthy, obviously. And I mean,
*  Roman law cases are interesting because they became linked to politics. So one of the way that
*  politicians, up and coming politicians, aspiring politicians could sort of make their name or
*  become famous was by either prosecuting or defending people in Roman law courts. And
*  especially during the late Roman Republic, you get a lot of really sensational, what today we'd
*  call celebrity law cases. So this is where some of the biggest politicians were accused of very
*  melodramatic kinds of things. And I mean, the most famous Roman order of all time, Cicero,
*  is a guy who made his entire career in the law courts. And that's how he made his reputation,
*  was able to parlay that into political power, and eventually was elected to the highest office in
*  the Roman government. But it's purely because of his skill, his facility at using words,
*  at giving speeches in public.
*  So they loved the puzzle and the game of law, the sort of untangling really complicated legal
*  situations and coming up with new laws that help you tangle and untangle the situations.
*  Yes. And law cases, again, especially in the late Republic, also became a form of public spectacle.
*  So Rome did not have law courts in a building locked away. A lot of these cases were held in
*  the Roman forum in the open, and audiences would just come to be entertained. And the people
*  presenting the speeches there were playing as much to this audience as they were to, let's say,
*  the jury or a judge. And that became a big part of the cases. So that's all tied up in Roman order.
*  We're talking a bit about the details of the laws. Is there some big picture laws
*  that are new innovations or profound things like all Roman citizens are equal before the law,
*  founding fathers type of in the United States, in the Western world, these big legal ideas?
*  I think maybe one of the things that was really stressed in Roman law early on,
*  even as early as the 12 tables, is the notion of Roman citizenship.
*  So if you were a Roman citizen, it came with a set of both privileges and obligations.
*  So the obligations were you're supposed to fight in the army, you were supposed to vote in elections.
*  The privileges were you had the protection of Roman law, and at least in theory, if not in practice,
*  everybody was equal under that law. Now, of course, keep in mind, we're talking about men here.
*  And even at the height of the Roman Empire, so let's say second century AD,
*  there were about 50 million human beings living within the boundaries of the Roman Empire.
*  Maybe 6 million were actual citizens. So we tend to go, oh, it's so great. If you're a
*  citizen, you have all these things. Well, adult free men who are not slaves, who are not resident
*  foreigners, they have this great stuff. And that's always a tiny minority of all the human beings who
*  existed in this society. But still, the notion of citizenship is huge. And citizens, for example,
*  early on, you had to be tried at Rome if you were accused of something. And there's this very famous
*  moment in Sicily where an abusive governor who's corrupt is punishing a citizen arbitrarily.
*  And this person cries out, chiuiis romanis sum, meaning I am a Roman citizen.
*  And it really was this hugely loaded statement that that gives me protections. It is wrong for
*  you to do this to me. It's wrong for you to beat me because I am a citizen and that gives me certain
*  protections. So that notion of citizenship is something that I think the Romans really
*  emphasize and becomes a legacy to a lot of civilizations today where citizenship means
*  something. It's a special status. So you mentioned slaves, slavery. That's something that is common
*  throughout human history. What do we know about their relationship with slavery? Well, Roman
*  slavery, a couple of just reminders at the beginning. First of all, it's not racial slavery.
*  So for people in the United States, you tend to think of slavery through this kind of racial lens.
*  So slaves in ancient Roman society could be any color, ethnicity, gender, origin, whatever. It's
*  an economic status. Now, having said that, slavery is fundamentally horrific to human dignity because
*  it is defining a human being as an object. And very famously, a Roman agricultural writer who's
*  writing about farms, just as a kind of aside says, on your farm, you have three types of tools.
*  You have dumb tools, and by dummy means can't speak. So that's like shovels, picks, things like this,
*  wagons. You have semi-articulate tools, which are animals, and you have articulate tools,
*  which are human beings, slaves. And for him, these are all just categories of tools.
*  It's so intensely dehumanizing to view people in that way. So Roman slavery is odd in that it
*  doesn't have this racial component. It's horrible in the way all slavery is horrible. But the other
*  thing about it is it's not a hard line. It's a permeable membrane, and many people move back
*  and forth across it. So you have many people in the Roman world who were born a slave who
*  gained their freedom through one means or another. And you have many others who were born free and
*  become slaves. And you have some who go back and forth. There's a great Roman tombstone of this guy
*  who says, I was born a free man in Parthia. I was enslaved. Then I gained my freedom,
*  and I became a teacher or something, and I had a life, and now I'm a Roman citizen.
*  So it's this whole back and forth across all these boundaries multiple times.
*  Oh, so there's probably a process, like an economic transaction.
*  The most common source of slaves in the Roman world was war. So wherever the Roman army went,
*  in its wake would be literally a train of slave traders. So you're in war, you capture an enemy
*  city, you whack the people over the head, and you turn around if you're a soldier, and you sell them
*  to one of these slave traders that's following the army around, literally. So that's probably the
*  biggest source of slaves. Another big source is just children of slaves or slaves. And some people
*  could literally sell either themselves or their children into slavery due to economic
*  necessity or privation or something. So as terrible as that sounds, a father could sell a child
*  if he needed money. Once you were a slave though, the experience of slavery varied a lot because
*  a lot of the slaves were agricultural slaves. So they would work like in the American South,
*  big plantations. They might be chained, they were probably abused. That's very similar to slaves.
*  We think of it in let's say the Caribbean South America or the United States prior to the Civil
*  War, that kind of slavery. But a lot of Roman slaves were also some of the more skilled people.
*  And this seems a little weird. So if you're a rich person, you have slaves, it's actually a good
*  investment for you to train your slaves in a profession. So a lot of Roman doctors, scribes,
*  accountants, all this sort of thing, barbers were slaves. Because if you train this person,
*  and then they produce a lot of money for you, you get that money. And those slaves would sometimes
*  be given an incentive to work hard where they could, and this is just sort of agreement between
*  the master and the slave. If they earned a certain amount of money, X amount of money,
*  they could then buy their own freedom from the master. So this was your incentive to work harder
*  if you were trained, let's say as a doctor, I worked really hard, I can buy myself out of slavery.
*  Or a lot of masters would free their slaves and their wills. So when they died, they would say,
*  I manumit this slave and that slave. So it was a weird institution in that elements were just
*  as horrible as what we think of as slavery and just as exploitative. And like I say,
*  the overall notion of slavery is intensely dehumanizing. But yet there was this wide
*  range of types of slaves. And the odd thing is in the city of Rome, many of the worst jobs,
*  so if you're just a laborer hauling crap around, the docks or things like that,
*  you might well be a free person and a slave would hold a skilled job. And that seems a little
*  strange or counterintuitive to us, but you see how in the Roman economy it sort of works.
*  And that could be one of the things that would be surprising to us coming from the modern day to the
*  ancient world is just the number of slaves. So you mentioned one of the things we don't think about
*  is that most of the people are farmers. And then the other thing is just the number of slaves.
*  And there's a big debate, how many slaves were there? What percentage of the populace,
*  let's say in the city of Rome were slaves? And this is something historians like to argue about
*  a lot. And we keep coming back to this theme of sometimes it's the little things that illustrate
*  stuff well. And for slaves, the one that always gets me is some slaves, and these would be sort
*  of the more abused slaves, they would literally put little bronze collars on them with a tag
*  that said, hi, my name is Felix. I'm the slave of so-and-so. I've run away. If you catch me,
*  return me to the temple of so-and-so and you'll get a reward. So it's a dog tag, right? Except
*  this is a human being. And you can see these in museums. I mean, you can go to a museum today and
*  see this little bronze collar with a tag on it that's talking about a human being as if they're
*  this kind of animal that's run away. And this is very telling too. We're talking about Roman law.
*  Under Roman law, technically when a slave runs away, the crime that he's committing is theft
*  because he's stolen himself from his master. So again, it's this very dehumanizing view of it.
*  And just a reminder to people in America thinking about this, we have a certain
*  view and picture to what slavery is. A reminder that all of human history, most of human history
*  has had slaves of all colors, of all religions. That's within us to select a group of people,
*  call them the other, use them as objects, abuse them. And I would say as a person who believes
*  the line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man, all of us, every person
*  listening to this is capable of being owner of a slave if they're put in the position of capable
*  of hating the other, of forming the other, of othering other people. And we should be very careful
*  not to look ourselves in the mirror and remind ourselves that we're human. It's easy to think,
*  okay, well, there's these slaves and slave owners through history and I would have never been one
*  of those. But just like as we would be farmers, we could be both, if we went back into history,
*  we could be both slaves and slave owners. And all of those are humans.
*  I mean, just to build on that, I'd say the othering of others is a
*  morally corrosive thing to do. So this fascinating transition between
*  the Republic to the Empire, can we talk about that? How does the Republic fall?
*  Oh boy. Okay. So the Roman Republic on the one hand is incredibly successful,
*  right? In a short period of time, it's expanded wildly, it's conquered the Mediterranean world,
*  it's gained tons of wealth. The contradiction here is that Rome's very success has made almost
*  every group within Roman society deeply unhappy and boiling with resentment. So this is the
*  contradiction. Enormous success on the surface, you end up with this boiling pot of resentment
*  and unhappiness. So let's break this down. Who's unhappy? Well, the people fighting Rome's wars,
*  the common farmers who went off to fight, they joined the army, they went and fought,
*  they've come back, they've seen Rome get wealthy, they've seen their generals get wealthy,
*  they've conquered all these areas, all this money and stuff is flowing back to Rome. But when they're
*  discharged from the army, they don't get that much. So they feel like I spent the best years of my
*  life fighting for my country, I deserve a reward, I haven't gotten it. So you have a lot of veterans
*  who are now unemployed or underemployed, many of them have sold their small family farms when they
*  went off to join the army and now they don't have them. So that group's unhappy, the veterans.
*  You have the aristocrats who on the surface, the ones who are doing well, they're the politicians
*  and the generals. But as time goes on, the ones who get the plum appointments, who get the good
*  generalships starts coming from a smaller and smaller subset of the aristocrats, the Scipios,
*  and their friends start to dominate. So you end up where most of the aristocratic class is feeling,
*  hey, I'm left out, I didn't get what I deserved. What about the half citizens and the allies,
*  the Italians who have fought for Rome, who stayed loyal when Hannibal invaded, they didn't go over
*  to his side? Well, they feel rightfully, we stayed loyal to Rome, we fought for them, we deserve our
*  reward, we should be full citizens. But the Romans are traditional, they're conservative, they don't
*  like change, they don't give them that. What about all the slaves? Well, they've conquered
*  all these foreigners, they've sold them, now many of them are working these plantations,
*  big plantations owned by rich people that used to be little family farms. The slaves are obviously
*  unhappy. So you end up with a society where it's incredibly successful by about 100 BC,
*  but almost every group that composes it feels like I haven't shared in the benefits of what's
*  happened or I've been exploited by it. So they all end up intensely unhappy. And the next 100
*  year period from 133 to 31 BC is called the late Roman Republic. And it's a time of nearly constant
*  internal strife, ultimately culminating in multiple rounds of civil war. So Roman society
*  literally breaks apart, turns on itself, and goes to war with itself over not equitably sharing the
*  benefits of conquest and of empire. So it's a less about not sharing the benefits of something
*  in a society, but concentrating it in one little group. And the other thing that happens is among
*  the aristocrats, they start to get more and more ambitious. So in the past, there was a lot of
*  ideology of the state is more important than the person. If you were a little Roman kid, you would
*  have been told these stories of Roman heroes, and they're all about self-sacrifice, putting the state
*  before you, about modesty, about these sort of values. Well, by the late Republic, you have a
*  succession of strong men. And it is a chain. So it goes, Marius, Sully, Pompey, Julius Caesar,
*  where each one pushes the boundaries of the Roman Republic a little bit, pushes at the structures of
*  the institutions of the Republic, and they're motivated by personal gain. They're putting
*  themselves above the state. So at the same time, you have lots of groups unhappy in society,
*  and you get these strong men who are now undermining the institutions, chipping away at
*  the things that have been shared, things holding the state together. And in the end, they just
*  become so ambitious. They're like, I don't care about the state. I'm going to try and make myself
*  ruler of Rome. So I mean, this is going to culminate obviously in Julius Caesar, who does
*  succeed in making himself dictator for life of the Roman Republic, which is tantamount to king,
*  and he gets assassinated for it. But he's the endpoint of this progression of people who
*  really undermine the institutions of the Republic through their own personal greed.
*  So the resentment boils and boils and boils, and there's this person that puts themselves-
*  And they exploit it. They're demagogues. They exploit it.
*  But Caesar puts himself above the state, and that, I guess, the Roman people also hate.
*  Well, I mean, it's a love hate because Caesar is very successful at playing to the Roman people.
*  So he becomes their hero where he says, I'll be your champion against the state who doesn't care
*  about you. So Caesar will do things where he'll put on big shows for the people, and it's cynical.
*  I mean, he's doing this to further his own political power, but he's presenting himself
*  as a populist in essence, even though he aspires to be a dictator, right? But it's a way of winning
*  the people's support because that's a tool for him and his struggle with other aristocrats.
*  So a dictator in populist clothing. Yes.
*  So but he gets- When convenient. Other times he'll play to the aristocracy.
*  And when he gets assassinated, another civil war explodes?
*  That's an interesting moment because all these things have been leading up to Caesar,
*  and it really is a chain of men. So it starts with this guy, Marius, who is one of the first
*  to start making armies loyal to him rather than to the state. That's a step in the wrong direction,
*  right? The army should be loyal to the state, not to an individual general. They shouldn't look for
*  him to rewards. Marius kind of breaks that, makes a precedent. One of his protegees is a guy named
*  Sulla. Sulla comes along and he ends up marching on Rome with his army and taking it over. And he
*  says, well, I'm just doing it for the good of the state, but that's another precedent. Now you've
*  had someone attacking their own capital city, even if they say they're doing it for the right reasons.
*  Then Pompey comes along and Pompey just breaks all kinds of things. He starts holding offices when
*  he's too young to do so. He raises personal armies from his own wealth. He disobeys commands. He
*  manipulates commands. He does all kinds of stuff. But in the end, he sides with the Senate when
*  sort of forced. And finally, Caesar comes along and Caesar's just shamelessly, no, it's about me.
*  I'm going to push it. And he is the one who wins a civil war against the state. And Pompey takes
*  over Rome and says, now I'm going to be dictator. And dictator is a traditional office in the Roman
*  state, but dictators were limited to no more than six months in power. And Caesar says, well, I'll
*  be dictator for life, which of course is king. He gets killed for it. So Caesar succeeded in taking
*  over the state as one man, but he couldn't solve the problem. How do you rule Rome as one person
*  and not get killed for looking like a king? That's the dilemma, the riddle that Caesar
*  leaves behind him. He did it. He sees power as one guy, but how do you stay alive? How do you come up
*  with something that the people will accept? And Caesar did some other things which were bad. He
*  was arrogant. He didn't even pretend that the Senate were his equals. He just kind of railroaded
*  them around. He didn't respect them. He named a month after himself, July, Julius. He did
*  egotistical things. So that pissed people off. They didn't like it. And when Caesar dies,
*  it's this interesting moment. The Republic is sort of dead by then. You're going to have a hard time
*  reviving it. You've broken too many precedents, but there's a power vacuum now. Caesar's gone.
*  What's going to happen next? And you have a whole group of people who want to be the next Caesar.
*  So the most obvious is Mark Antony, who is Caesar's right-hand man, his lieutenant. He's a very good
*  general. He's very charismatic. Everybody kind of expects Mark Antony to just become the next Caesar.
*  But there's also another of Caesar's lieutenants, a guy named Lepidus, sort of like Antony, but not
*  quite as great as him. There's the Senate itself, which wants to reassert its power, kind of become
*  the dominant force in Rome again. There's the assassins who killed Caesar, led by Brutus and
*  another guy Cassius. They now want to seize control. And finally, there's a really weird
*  dark horse candidate to fill this power vacuum, and that's Julius Caesar's grand nephew,
*  who at the time is a 17-year-old kid named Octavian. Who cares? He's nobody, absolutely nobody.
*  But when Caesar's will is opened after his death, so posthumously red, in his will, Caesar posthumously,
*  and this is a little weird, posthumously adopts Octavian as his son. Now again, who cares? Antony
*  gets the troops. Antony gets the money. The other people get everything. What does Octavian get?
*  He gets to now rename himself Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus. Who cares? Well, around the
*  Mediterranean, there's about 12 legions full of hardened soldiers who are just kind of used to
*  following a guy named Gaius Julius Caesar. And even though it's not quite logical,
*  this 18-year-old kid inherits an army overnight. So he becomes a player in this game for power.
*  And the next 30, 40 years is going to be those groups all vying with one another. There's another
*  candidate to Pompey's son. Pompey was Caesar's great rival. He has a couple sons, and one of them,
*  a guy named Sextus Pompey, basically becomes a warlord who seizes control of Sicily, one of
*  the richest provinces, has a whole navy. He's vying to be one of these successors too.
*  So for the next 40 years, it's, as you said, another civil war to see which guy emerges.
*  Is it going to be the Senate? Is it going to be the assassins? Is it going to be Antony? Is
*  it going to be Lepidus? Is it going to be Sextus Pompey? Is it going to be Octavian?
*  So now looking back at all that history, it just feels like history turns on so many
*  interesting accidents because Octavian, later renamed Augustus, turned out to be actually,
*  depends how you define good, but a good king slash emperor, different than Caesar in terms
*  of humility, at least being able to play, not to piss off everybody. But it could have been
*  so many other people. That could have been the fall of Rome. So it's a fascinating little turn
*  of history. Maybe Caesar saw something in this individual. It's not an accident that he was in
*  the will. Yeah. I mean, Caesar clearly did see something in him. And Octavian, I mean, to cut
*  to the end, is the one who emerges from all that is the victor. We can talk about how he does it,
*  but he's the one who sort of ends up in the same position as Caesar. It takes him 30 years, but he
*  defeats all the foes. He's the sole guy. He now faces Caesar's riddle. How do you rule Rome as one
*  guy and not get killed? And Octavian's, what makes him stand out, what makes him fascinating to me,
*  is he wasn't a good general. In fact, he was a terrible general. He lost almost every badly
*  commanded. But what he is, is he's politically savvy and he's very good at what today we would
*  call manipulation of your public image and propaganda. So he basically defeats Mark Antony
*  partially by waging a propaganda war against him. I mean, Antony starts out as a legitimate rival,
*  and there are two Romans vying for power. At the end of this war, propaganda war, Octavian has
*  managed to portray Antony as a foreign aggressor allied with an enemy king or queen, in this case,
*  Cleopatra, and who is an official enemy of the Roman state. And that's all propaganda.
*  So he takes what's a civil war and makes it look like a war against a foreign enemy.
*  And when Octavian becomes the sole ruler, he looks at what Caesar did wrong and he very carefully
*  avoids the same mistakes. So the first thing is just how he lives his life. He's very modest.
*  He lives in an ordinary house like other aristocrats. He wears just a plain toga,
*  nothing fancy. He's respectful to the Senate. He treats them with respect. He eats simple foods.
*  He's someone who cared about the reality of power, not the external trappings. Clearly,
*  there are some rulers who love, I want to dress in fancy clothes. I want to be surrounded by gold,
*  everything. This is what makes me feel good. Octavian's the opposite. He doesn't care about
*  any of that. He wants real power. And then the other thing is how is he going to rule Rome without
*  looking like a king? And his solution to this is brilliant. He basically pretends to resign from
*  all his public offices. Not pretends, he does. So he holds no official office. But what he does is
*  he manipulates so that the Roman Senate votes him the powers of the key Roman offices, but not the
*  office itself. So the highest office in the Roman state is the consul. Consuls have the power to
*  command armies, do all sorts of things, run meetings of the Senate. Octavian gets voted the
*  powers of a consul so he can command armies, control meetings of the Senate, do all this.
*  But he's not one of the two consuls elected for every year. So he's just kind of floating or
*  drifting off to the side of the Roman government. He gets the power of a tribune, which has all
*  sorts of powers. He can veto anything he wants, but he's not one of the tribunes elected for any one
*  year. So the state, the Republic, appears to continue as it always has. Each year, they hold
*  the same elections, they elect the same number of people. Notionally, those people are in charge.
*  But floating off to the side, you have this guy Octavian who has equivalent power, not just to any
*  one magistrate or official, but to all of them. So at any moment, he can just sort of pop up and say,
*  no, let's not do this. Let's do something else. And he also keeps the army under his personal
*  control. Isn't this a fascinating story? What do you think is the psychology of Augustus of Octavian?
*  Yeah. And he later changed his name to Augustus when he sort of becomes First Emperor. And the
*  other thing he does is he hides his power behind all these different names. So, you know,
*  the Caesar called himself dictator for life, right? So everybody knew what he was. Octavian,
*  we even have a source that talks about it. He says he wondered what to call himself. Do I call myself
*  king? No, he can't do that. Dictator for life? No way. Maybe I'll call myself Romulus. That was
*  the founder of him. No, no, Romulus was a king. And finally, his solution is he takes a bunch of
*  titles, which are all ambiguous. And no one of them sounds that impressive, but collectively
*  they are. So for example, one of the titles he gets is Augustus, which is something tied to
*  Roman religion. Something that is Augustus in Latin has two possible meanings. One is someone
*  who is Augustus is very pious. They respect the gods deeply. Well, that sounds nice, doesn't it?
*  Well, on the other hand, an alternative meaning for Augustus is something that is itself divine.
*  So is he just a deeply religious pious person or is he himself sacred? There's that ambiguity.
*  He calls himself prinkeps, which means first citizen. Okay. What the hell does that mean?
*  Am I a citizen just like everybody else or am I the first citizen, which means I'm superior to
*  all the others? So every title he takes has this weird ambiguity. He calls himself imperator,
*  which is traditionally something that soldiers shout at a victorious general who's won a battle.
*  And now he takes this as a permanent title. So it implies he's a good general. And by the way,
*  it's from imperator that we get the word emperor and empire. So originally it's a military title,
*  a spontaneous military acclamation. It's just fascinating that he figured out a way through
*  public image, through branding to gain power, maintain power, and still pacify the boiling
*  turmoil that led to the civil wars. Well, two things I think work in his favor as well.
*  One is he brings peace and stability. So by this point, the Romans have experienced a hundred
*  years almost of civil war and chaos. So at that point, maybe you've had family members die in
*  these wars or been prescribed, your property has been confiscated, who knows what. And here's a guy
*  who brings peace and stability and doesn't seem oppressive or cruel or whatever. So you're like,
*  okay, fine. I don't care. Maybe he's killed the Republic, but at least we're not dying in the
*  streets anymore. So that's a big thing he does. And secondly, even though Augustus always
*  seemed kind of sickly, his constitution, he lives forever. He rules for like 50 years.
*  And by the time he dies, there's no one literally almost left alive who can remember the Republic.
*  So at that point, by the time he dies, this is the only system we know.
*  That's another just fascinating accident of history. Because as we talked about with Alexander the
*  Great, who knows if he lived for another 40 years. If over time the people that hate the
*  new thing die off and then their sons come into power, that could be a very different story.
*  Maybe we'll be talking about the Greek Empire. That's a fluke of fate, but it's hugely influenced
*  on history. You mentioned Cleopatra. If we go back to that, what role did she play?
*  Another fascinating human being.
*  **Matt Stauffer** Cleopatra is interesting. I mean, she was a direct descendant of one of
*  Alexander the Great's generals, Ptolemy. When Alexander's empire had broken up,
*  Ptolemy, this general had seized control of Egypt, made it his kingdom. And she,
*  10 generations later, is a descendant of this Macedonian general. So Egypt had been ruled by,
*  in essence, foreigners, these Macedonian dynasty of kings. Often they literally were ruled by
*  the same dynasty because they had a habit of marrying brothers to sisters. Cleopatra is,
*  in fact, originally married to her younger brother. But despite that, she seems to have
*  intensely identified with Egypt. In fact, she seems to have been the first one of all these
*  Ptolemy kings who actually bothered to learn to speak Egyptian. So she seemed to really have
*  cared about Egypt as well. And she was clearly very smart, very clever. And so she's living at
*  a time during the late Republic when Rome is having all these civil wars and Egypt is really
*  the last big independent kingdom left around the shores of the Mediterranean. Everything else has
*  been conquered by Rome. So she is in this very precarious position where clearly she wants to
*  maintain Egyptian independence, but Rome is this juggernaut that's rolling over everything.
*  And she ends up meeting Julius Caesar when Caesar comes to Egypt chasing Pompey, his great rival.
*  After he defeats Pompey, Pompey runs to Egypt thinking he'll find sanctuary there,
*  and the Egyptians kill him and chop off his head. And when Caesar lands, they hand it to him and say,
*  here, have a present. And she, of course, famously ends up having a love affair with Caesar.
*  Was that a genuine love or was she just sort of using this as a way to try and keep Egypt
*  independent to give it some status? We don't know. She does have several kids with Caesar.
*  After Caesar is assassinated and the Roman world is having another civil war between Octavian and
*  Mark Antony. Mark Antony is basing himself in the East. He meets Cleopatra and he has a big love
*  affair with her. And this one seems pretty genuine. Antony and Cleopatra, there's a lot of stories
*  about them kind of partying together. They like to sort of a cosplay and dress up as different gods.
*  So Cleopatra would dress up as the goddess Isis and Antony would dress up as the god Dionysus and
*  a leopard skin and they'd have these big parties and stuff. And they end up together fighting
*  against Octavian. And in the end, they're defeated by Octavian and Antony commits suicide. Cleopatra,
*  there's differing accounts of her death. She may have also killed herself or she may actually
*  have been killed by Octavian to just get her out of the way. But she's an interesting figure because
*  she was clearly a very smart woman who managed to keep Egypt alive as an independent state. She
*  seemed to have actually cared about Egypt and identified with it and succeeded at a time with
*  all these famous people in being a real kind of mover and shaker and a force in events.
*  She's probably one of the most influential women in human history.
*  She's certainly, again, she's someone that her image is incredibly important. And I mean,
*  one of the interesting things, the whole question of gender in the Roman world,
*  this gets into Roman sources, but of course, it's a heavily male dominated history.
*  And men and women did not have equality in ancient Rome. It's a male dominated society.
*  It's misogynist in many ways. But what I'm constantly struck by is when you start again
*  delving into the sources, you always hear, okay, well, there was this one woman who was a
*  philosopher and she's an exception to the rule. And yeah, okay, she's fine. And then you start
*  looking at, oh, and there's also 60 other female philosophers. Well, is that so much an exception
*  anymore? Or Cleopatra is the one queen, she's this strong queen. And then you're looking, well,
*  there was this other queen here, there was this queen here, there was this queen here who led
*  armies and here's another one who led armies. And again, it's like, well, are they exceptions to the
*  rule or is just the history that was written, which is written by men, a little bit selective
*  in how it portrays them because the sources are all these male elites who have very definite ideas
*  about women. The conventional notion has always been that business in the Roman Empire was a male
*  field. Well, but then there's this woman, Umachia in Pompeii, who actually had the largest building
*  in Pompeii right on the forum named after her with a giant statue of her. And she was a patron to a
*  bunch of the most important guilds in Pompeii. Okay, she's the exception to the rule. Oh, but then
*  there's these other four women we have from Pompeii who also were patrons of guilds. And
*  there's this woman, Plonkia Magna in this other place. And she was the most important patron in
*  the town and put up all these statues. So at some point, when you start to say, well, maybe
*  women did play more of a role, but they just haven't been recorded in the sources in the
*  way that maybe they deserve to be. Yeah, that's a fascinating question. Is it the bias of society
*  or is it the bias of the historian? The bias of the society that historians writing about it
*  or the bias of the actual history? And the bias of the historians who have written history up
*  to this point. I was just writing a lecture, which was about this woman, Musa, who is a crazy story.
*  And she ties into Augustus actually. Augustus, his biggest diplomatic triumph that he boasted
*  about constantly was that about 50 years before him, the Romans had sent an expedition into
*  Parthia, this neighboring kingdom led by Crassus, and they'd gotten wiped out. So it was this big
*  disaster, military disaster. And the standards of the Roman legions, the eagles that each Roman
*  legion carried had been captured by the Parthians. And this is the most humiliating thing that can
*  happen to a Roman legion, to have its eagles captured. And Augustus desperately wanted to
*  negotiate with the Parthians to get these eagles returned. Okay, this was his big diplomatic thing.
*  So he was constantly sending these embassies to Parthia. On one of these embassies, he sent along
*  as a gift to the Parthian king, a slave woman named Musa. Musa seems to have pleased the king
*  of Parthia because she becomes one of his concubines. And then she gives birth to a son
*  by the king, and eventually she becomes upgraded to the level of wife. And Musa eventually
*  murders the Parthian king, arranges it so that her son becomes the king of Parthia. And she's really
*  ruling the whole empire behind the scenes as his mother. So this is a literal rags to riches story
*  of a slave, someone who starts out a slave and becomes the queen of an empire almost as large
*  and powerful as Rome. Okay? But yet how often do we hear about Musa? And when you look in traditional
*  histories of Roman Parthian relations, and I went and looked at this because I was just writing this
*  lecture, most of those histories didn't even mention her. They just talked about her son,
*  like he had just come out of nowhere and become the new heir to the Parthian throne when it was
*  all her doing, clearly. Now that's selective editing of history by historians to downplay
*  the role that this woman played. And there's a lot of examples like that.
*  That's fascinating.
*  She got overthrown after a few years. There was a revolution against her and we don't know
*  what happened to her then, but she's a really interesting figure. Oh, and by the way, Augustus
*  did negotiate the return of the Parthian standards and got them back. And he was so proud of this,
*  that this is what he constantly boasted about. And the most famous statue of Augustus, the
*  Augustus from Prima Porta, which is in the Vatican today, he's wearing a breastplate and on the
*  breastplate right in the middle of the stomach is a Parthian handing over a golden eagle legionary
*  standard to a Roman. So this is what Augustus thought of as his greatest achievement. And
*  that embassy that arranged that was the one that sent Musa to Parthia.
*  So Augustus marks the start of the Roman Empire. You've written that Octavian Augustus would become
*  Rome's first emperor and the political system that he created would endure for the next half
*  a millennium. This system would become the template for countless later empires up through
*  the present day. And he would become the model emperor against whom all subsequent ones would
*  be measured. The culture and history of the Mediterranean basin, the Western world,
*  and even global history itself were all profoundly shaped and influenced by the actions and legacy
*  of Octavian. He was the founder of the Roman Empire and we still live today in the world that
*  he created. So what on the political side of things and maybe beyond, what is the political
*  system that he created? Well, I mean, I think Octavian slash Augustus is the same guy.
*  He is one of the most influential people in history because he did found the Roman Empire.
*  So he's the one who oversaw this transition from Republic to Empire and he sets the template,
*  which every future emperor follows. So just in the most obvious way for the next either 500 or
*  1500 years, depending how long you think the Roman Empire lasted for, everyone is trying to be
*  Augustus. They all take on the same titles. Every Roman emperor after him is Caesar Augustus,
*  Imperator, Potter, Potrere, all these titles he has, they take too. So he's hugely influential
*  for Western civilization and all this. But beyond just that literal thing, which is already 500
*  years, 1500 years, he becomes the paradigm of the good ruler. So of an absolute ruler who is
*  nevertheless sort of just does good things, builds public works, is popular. So if we jump ahead,
*  let's say to the Middle Ages, the most significant ruler of the early Middle Ages is Charlemagne,
*  right? He's the guy who unites most of Europe. He becomes the paradigm for all medieval kings
*  after him. Well, what is the title that the Pope gives to Charlemagne? Because there's this famous
*  moment when the Pope acknowledges Charlemagne as the preeminent European king and crowns him on
*  Christmas day of the year 800. And the title that the Pope gives to Charlemagne is Charles,
*  that's Charlemagne, Augustus, Emperor of the Romans. He's giving him the title of Augustus,
*  because that's the nicest thing he can think of to say to Charlemagne, is to say,
*  you're the new Augustus, you're Emperor of the Romans. So that image is hugely powerful.
*  And that persists on and on. I mean, even the literal names of most rulers afterwards come
*  from this. In Russia, the czars are Caesars, that's where czar comes from. Prince comes from
*  prinkeps, first citizen, one of the titles. Emperor comes from imperator, one of the titles
*  of Augustus. When Napoleon becomes emperor, what does he call himself? First consul, which is kind
*  of like prinkeps. And then he calls himself emperor. I mean, everybody wants to be this kind of ruler.
*  So he's the paradigm of this for the rest of history. And you can see that is both a positive
*  and a negative legacy. It's kind of like Alexander. I mean, everybody wants to be the next Alexander.
*  Now, nobody does become the next Alexander. Nobody's as successful as him, but a lot of
*  people try. And you can see that either is, oh, inspirational or awful, because lots of people
*  killed lots of other people and started lots of wars trying to be the next Alexander.
*  At least Augustus has this notion of good rulership, that you're not just a great,
*  powerful person, but you're a good ruler somehow. Can you speak to the kind of political system he
*  created? How did he consolidate power, as you spoke to a bit already? And what role did the
*  Senate now play? How were the laws? Who was the executive? How was power allocated?
*  And so on. Yeah. So once the empire begins, let's say 27 BC. So in 31 BC, Octavian defeats Antony at
*  the Battle of Actium. So that's kind of the moment he becomes the sole ruler. And then in 27 BC,
*  a couple of years later, he settles the Roman Republic, is how it's referred to, which basically
*  sets up his system. And in this system, on the surface, it all looks the same. You still have
*  a Senate. Each year, there's elections. All the Roman citizens vote. They elect magistrates who
*  notionally are in charge of Rome. But as I mentioned, off to the side, you now have this
*  figure of Augustus, who sort of controls everything behind the scenes. And that continues. So this
*  political system he establishes continues. And in reality, I would say Augustus at that point is
*  again a king. It really is one man controlling the state, even if notionally, it's still continuing
*  as a republic. They are electing magistrates, but the magistrates only do what the emperor tells
*  them, right? But it's this sort of formal versus informal power. The formal structure is a republic.
*  The way things really work informally is it's a monarchy. Now, if you asked Augustus, what did
*  he do? Did you become a king? He said, and he says this explicitly, no, no, no. What I did is I
*  refounded the Roman Republic. That's how he phrases it.
*  Yeah, this guy is good at framing.
*  He's so good at propaganda. I'll give you one more example that I love. Augustus actually writes his
*  own autobiography, which is very rare and survives. So here we have the autobiography of one of the
*  pivotal figures in history. And if you had conquered the world, let's say, starting at the age of 18,
*  what would you call your autobiography? It'd be something like, how I conquered the world, right?
*  Augustus calls his the race guesti, which the best sort of literal translation is stuff I did.
*  I mean, it's the most modest title for someone who could have given the most grandiose title.
*  And the first line of it is, at the age of 18, when the liberty of the republic was oppressed
*  by a faction, I defended it. Now, the way I might phrase that sense is, at the age of 18,
*  I fought a civil war against another Roman and conquered the Roman state. But no, he defended
*  the liberty of the republic when it was oppressed by the tyranny of a faction. That's propaganda.
*  And it works.
*  It is propaganda, but is there a degree to which he also lived it, that kind of humility,
*  establishing that humility is a standard of the way government operates. So it's not like a literal
*  direct balance of power, but it's sort of a cultural balance of power where the emperor is
*  not supposed to be a bully and a dictator. I would really like to know what Romans of his time
*  thought. Like if you were alive at that moment, would you honestly believe, oh, okay, we've got
*  this guy Augustus, but he's brought peace. He's just kind of keeping in charge for a while till
*  things settle down. We've just had a hundred years of civil war. I think we still have a republic.
*  Or would you say, nah, we have a king now. And I don't know what the answer to that is.
*  I will tell you that it takes 200 years before we have the first Roman source that bluntly calls
*  Augustus a king. So 200 years. It takes the Romans 200 years to admit to themselves.
*  That's a guy who comes along 200 years later and says, hey, Augustus, he looks like a king. He acts
*  like a king. Let's just call him a king because he had every aspect of a king except the paltry
*  title. Maybe I'm buying his propaganda and maybe I'm a sucker for humility, but I suspect that the
*  Romans bought it. And I also suspect he himself believed it. I mean, there is such a thing as
*  good kings. There's kings that understand the downside, the dark side of absolute power
*  and can wield that power properly. And to give both sides here, Augustus wasn't all nice. I mean,
*  there were moments where he was extremely cruel. So early in his career, when he's still fighting
*  for power, he goes all in on prescriptions, which is where he and Ante and other people basically
*  post lists of their enemies and say it's legal for anyone to kill these people.
*  And so hundreds are massacred there, including Cicero, the great order is prescribed and killed.
*  There's moments when he's really cruel. One slave once gets him angry and he has him
*  tortured in a particularly sort of cruel manner. So I mean, on the one hand, he had this clemency.
*  On the other hand, he could be really hard-nosed and hard-edged. I think he was a very calculating
*  person. So the thing I would love to know is what he was actually like behind the mask.
*  Yes. I mean, that to me is one of those, like, if you could invite a historical person to dinner
*  or whatever, I want to know what the real Augustus was, what he really thought he was doing,
*  because he's an enigma. And he has this great moment when he dies, right? What's his dying
*  lines on his deathbed? He says, if I've played my part well, dismiss me from the stage with applause.
*  So he's seeing himself as an actor, that his whole life was acting this role, which is again,
*  all that manipulation and public image. He was brilliant at that, but who's the real guy?
*  What was behind that image? And by the way, as long as we're talking about brutality,
*  I think you've mentioned in a few places that there's a lot of brutality going on at the time.
*  Caesar just killing very large numbers of people brutally.
*  I mean, Caesar, his campaigns in Gaul are interesting because for a long time they were
*  held up as, oh, genius general, look at the amazing things he did. But another way to view it is he
*  provoked and he truly provoked a war with people who were not that interested in fighting Rome
*  and just repeatedly attacked different tribes for the sole purpose of building up his career,
*  his prestige, his status, gaining territory, making himself wealthier. And he basically
*  conquers all of modern France and Belgium and some of Switzerland. So this is a big chunk of Europe
*  gets conquered, hundreds of thousands of people killed, hundreds of thousands of people enslaved
*  to further one guy's career. I mean, if you wanted, could call Caesar a war criminal.
*  And I think that wouldn't be unfair. But on the other hand, some people see him as a great hero.
*  I mean, to talk about history and its reception, it's quite interesting to see how
*  Caesar has been viewed by different generations. So at different points in time, the sort of
*  received wisdom on Caesar is very different. So back in the, let's say the 1920s or 30s,
*  there were a number of scholarly things written, which kind of looked at Caesar as
*  an admirable figure. He's a strong man who knows what Rome needed and was going to give it to them.
*  And of course, that's the era when fascism was kind of trendy and was seen as a positive thing.
*  And then you get Hitler and World War II and all of a sudden fascism is not so favored anymore.
*  And then in that post-war generation, all of a sudden, Caesar's terrible. He's a dictator,
*  he's destroying the Republic. So often histories that are written tell you a lot more about the
*  time they're written than they do about the subject they're written about.
*  Do we know what Hitler or Stalin think about the Roman Empire?
*  I mean, certainly they borrow a lot of the trappings. I mean, Nazi Germany borrows a lot
*  of iconography from ancient Rome. I mean, they carried around little military standards with
*  eagles on them, just like the Romans. But then everybody does that. I mean, the US has eagles
*  as their standards. Mussolini had them. Napoleon had eagle standards for his military. So a lot
*  of people like that imagery. You mentioned Cicero. He's a fascinating figure. On the topic of Roman
*  oratory, who was Cicero? Cicero was a new man. So he's someone who
*  didn't have famous ancestors. So he was a disadvantage. And I think Cicero is really
*  interesting for a couple of reasons. One is he wrote an incredible amount. I think we have almost
*  more words from Cicero than any other author that survived. And it's all kinds of stuff. It's
*  philosophical treatises, it's books about how to be a good public speaker. He published volume
*  after volume of his personal letters to his friends. He published these things. So there's
*  tons of stuff from him. And secondly, he's interesting because he lived at this incredibly
*  important time in the late Republic when things were falling apart. But he seems to have been born
*  with none of the natural advantages that all these other people had. So he was a lousy general. He
*  didn't come from a wealthy family. He didn't come from a famous aristocratic family. He didn't have
*  a lot of these advantages. But yet he ended up being right at the center of things, rose to the
*  highest elected office in the Roman state on the basis of one skill. And that was his ability with
*  words, his ability to get up in front of a crowd and persuade them of what he wanted them to believe.
*  And oratory, public speaking, was absolutely central to life at Rome. There were just all
*  these events where people had to get up and give speeches. So in courtrooms, at funerals,
*  in the Senate, to the people of Rome, at games, just constantly there were these opportunities
*  for giving speeches. So if you were good at this, that was a huge advantage in your political career.
*  And Cicero was the best. He was arguably the best public speaker of all time, some people claim.
*  And he lived right in this era. And he parlayed that skill with words into this very successful
*  political career. He was one of the guys involved with all this stuff with Caesar and Pompey and
*  all the other things going on, Octavian, Marc Antony. And you've written, which is fascinating.
*  It's fascinating when the echoes of people from a distant past are seen today. The same stuff is
*  seen today. Not just like some of the beautiful legal stuff that we've been talking about, but
*  the tricks, the, you know, let's say the shitty stuff we see in politics. So many of the rhetorical
*  tricks you wrote, such as mudslinging, exaggeration, guilt by association, ad hominem attacks,
*  name calling, fear mongering, us versus them, rhyme, and so on and so forth. So I'm guessing
*  it worked given that we still have those today. Yeah. I mean, one of the things Cicero did is he
*  wrote at least three of these sort of handbooks about how to be a good public speaker. So we
*  know a lot about that. We have his own speeches that survive. And then we have later people after
*  Cicero who wrote about what Cicero did too. So we know a lot about what he did. And the key
*  to Cicero's whole enterprise about persuading an audience, let's say either in a speech to the
*  people or in the courtroom, is Cicero believed that people are fundamentally ruled by emotion.
*  So if you can touch their emotions, all sorts of other things become less important. If you can get
*  a jury emotionally worked up and fear, anger, are particularly powerful there, then the facts might
*  not matter. The truth might not matter. Evidence might not matter. Reason might not matter.
*  Emotion is the key to everything. So Cicero used what I would arguably call a lot of tricks
*  to get his audiences emotionally riled up. And you can just go through these. And they're all
*  the stuff you were saying, name calling, mudslinging, us versus them arguments, ad hominem attacks.
*  I mean, incredibly sophisticated. All this stuff that we think of today is, oh, very sophisticated
*  techniques for propaganda and persuasion. It's not new. People aren't coming up with that much
*  that's new outside the realm of technology. Human nature is the same. Cicero understood human
*  psychology. He knew how to play on people. He knew how to play on their emotions. And he would do
*  just ‚Äì I mean, I want to say hilarious, but they're sort of depressingly hilarious things.
*  He thought it's important to use props. So he said, people are visual. They will respond
*  emotionally to visual things in a way that just words alone won't work. So he says, in order is
*  just like an actor. And like an actor, he has to prepare his stage and use props and things as
*  visual cues to stir up the audience. So for example, once he was defending a man in a court
*  case who had just had a new baby born to him, and Cicero literally delivered the defense oration
*  for this guy while cradling his newborn son in his arms. You can imagine, oh, cute little baby,
*  jury, how could you find him guilty and leave this cute baby without a father to take care of him?
*  Another time, he was defending a guy who had a photogenic son, a kind of a young boy,
*  and Cicero literally propped up the kid behind him while he was giving the speech and again said,
*  look at his eyes brimming with tears, thinking about his father being punished. How could you
*  leave this wonderful boy without a father to care for him? Another time, someone didn't have
*  photogenic kids, so he propped up his old parents in the courtroom and said, look at this nice old
*  couple. You won't want to take their son away. That kind of stuff. I mean, it's manipulative.
*  Cicero, by the way, should say also had philosophical beliefs about defending the
*  republic and such, but he wasn't above using these things. Even though he may have had
*  altruistic or high notions of what he was doing, he also wasn't above using these kind of rhetorical
*  tricks. Also, you mentioned to me that you studied the gestures they used. This is one of those on
*  the theme of extremely interesting details of life. This was actually my dissertation,
*  and it was my first book as well. That's amazing.
*  That's amazing. Again, I tell you, I like practical stuff. This all started with,
*  I kept reading about people like Cicero giving speeches in ancient Rome, lots of speeches.
*  They would give a speech in the forum with 10, 20,000 people. The thought occurred to me, well,
*  in ancient Rome, you don't have microphones. You don't have loudspeakers. How does someone give a
*  speech outdoors in a windy place, not acoustically sound to 20,000 people? They just can't hear you.
*  The answer, part of the answer turns out, well, part of it's rhetorical training. You learn how
*  to project your voice, but some of it too is that the Romans actually had this system of gestures
*  that orders like Cicero would use to accompany their speeches. What I ended up doing is combining
*  two types of evidence again. I looked at the rhetorical handbooks like Cicero's, and also
*  there's this guy Quintilian who lived about 100 years after Cicero who wrote this long thing
*  called the Institutia Oratoria, which has a description of all types of rhetorical stuff,
*  including about 40 pages on gestures. He actually says, when you put your fingers like this,
*  it means such and such. It turns out Roman orders had a system of sign language that they would use
*  to augment their speeches. But here's the fun part. It wasn't like modern American sign language
*  where a gesture means the same thing as a word. Instead, and this goes back to Cicero, a certain
*  gesture would indicate a certain emotion that you were meant to feel when you heard the words.
*  It's like your body is adding an emotional gloss to your speech. You're saying words,
*  and then you're indicating how you think those words should make you feel. Even more fun,
*  the Romans believed that if I make certain hand gestures, you will almost involuntarily
*  feel certain emotions. If you're skilled, you can manipulate your audience by playing on their
*  emotions. This might sound kind of weird or improbable, but the metaphor that Cicero himself
*  uses is he says, think about music. Everybody knows that certain musical tones will make you
*  feel a certain way. Think of movies today. In a horror movie, they're going to play strident,
*  tense music. In a romantic scene, you're going to have strings, and it'll make you feel a certain
*  way. When you hear the Jaws theme, you feel tense, right? Cicero said the order's body is like a
*  liar. A liar is a musical instrument, and you have to learn to play on your own body as a musical
*  instrument to affect the emotions of your audience. I think he might be onto something,
*  especially given how central public speaking was in Roman culture.
*  A lot of the Roman oratorical gestures, I could probably do some, and you could probably guess
*  what emotion they're meant to be. For example, there's one where you hold up your hands to the
*  side and kind of push like this. This is the gesture, and what that means is mild aversion.
*  I don't like something. Now, if I couple this with turning my face to the side, that, so pushing off
*  to one side, turning my face away, it's a stronger aversion. That's like fear or something.
*  If I clench my fist and press it to my chest, that's anger or grief. If I slap my thigh,
*  again, that's an indication of anger. A lot of these make sense. They're kind of natural gestures.
*  Now, some are really weird and artificial. One of my favorite of these is if you hold your hand up
*  open and then curl the fingers in one by one and then flip it out, so this sort of thing.
*  That, to the Romans, meant wonder, which you sort of see. Again, if you've been raised in a societal
*  context where you're used to the notion that this gesture means this emotion, when someone does it,
*  you're probably going to feel that emotion. It's like memes today. If it becomes viral,
*  you know what it's supposed to mean and has that effect.
*  It has power. It's actually interesting that we don't use gestures as much in modern day.
*  For me, I just love analyzing modern political figures in terms of their body language because
*  how you deliver a speech is often more important than what you say. In fact, in the ancient world,
*  the most famous Greek orator was a guy named Demosthenes. Once a guy came up to Demosthenes
*  and said, Demosthenes, tell me, what are the three most important things in giving a speech?
*  And Demosthenes said, well, they are delivery, delivery, and delivery. That even the most
*  brilliant speech, if accompanied by a boring delivery, is going to be less effective than
*  a terrible speech given in an engaging and exciting or funny way.
*  Speaking of modern day and gestures, what do you think of Donald Trump who has these very
*  unique kind of gestures? I don't know to a degree that it's true, but he uses his handshakes when
*  he pulls people in, that kind of stuff. What do you make of that?
*  Trump gesticulates a lot, but it's a fairly narrow set of gestures. If you watch him for a bit,
*  he has the same small set of gestures. They're not natural in that they're not illustrating what he's
*  saying. It's more just punctuation points. I think of his as more kind of these punctuation
*  points for just going along with what he's saying. There are speakers who truly can use their hands
*  and arms and faces creatively, and you watch them, and it's really enhancing the speech.
*  Just historically, Martin Luther King, he's famous for a lot of good speeches content. He was a good
*  gesticulator too. He knew how to use his body. On the other hand, Adolf Hitler was a phenomenal
*  gesticulator. If you watch some of his speeches, even just turn off the sound and watch them,
*  he's doing all kinds of stuff, and he's really emphasizing his points in a very creative way.
*  This is what's fascinating about oratory and public speaking is it's this two-edged sword.
*  You can use these techniques for good or you can absolutely use them for evil.
*  The very same techniques in the hands of MLK, you say, this is wonderful. This is fantastic.
*  In the hands of Hitler, you say, this is awful. Look, he's persuading a nation to commit atrocities.
*  I encourage people to watch the speeches of Hitler, the oratory skill there, to be able to channel
*  the resentment and the frustration of a people and control it and direct it any direction he wants
*  through speaking alone. It's incredible.
*  It's the visual embodiment of the words where he's talking about Weimar Germany being taken
*  advantage of supposedly and all this stuff. You're right, he's channeling the resentment
*  of the people and using that to his personal advantage and for cynical evil purposes.
*  Oratory is like that. The question I always end up asking my students is after studying Cicero and
*  all these techniques, I say, okay, this is great oratory, but do you like this? Is this good that
*  this works on human beings? I remember Noam Chomsky once was asked,
*  why do you speak in such a monotone way? He said, well, I want the truth of my statement,
*  the contents of my statements to speak that I don't want you to get deluded by me because I'm
*  such a charismatic and eloquent speaker. The more monotone I speak, the more you will listen to the
*  content of the words. I want you just focusing on the content and not being distracted. I'll tell
*  you also with Cicero, one of the things that he and other people who write about Roman oratory do
*  is to say, and you can do this stuff badly, in which case it backfires horribly. You can have
*  people who attempt to gesticulate. Again, modern politicians, you'll see this sometime where they
*  feel like I'm supposed to be making hand gestures and they're terrible at it and it undercuts it.
*  Cicero and Quintinling get some very amusing examples from ancient Rome. Like he says,
*  there was this one guy who when he spoke, looked like he was trying to swat away flies because
*  there were just these awkward gestures or another who looked like he was trying to balance in a boat
*  choppy seas. My favorite is there was one order who supposedly was prone to making, I guess,
*  kind of languid supple motions. They actually named a dance after this guy and his name was
*  Tidius. Romans could do the Tidius, which is this dance that was imitating this order who had these
*  comically bad gesticulation. Not enough gesticulation is a problem. Too much gesticulation
*  is a problem. You have to hit the sweet spot. It has to seem natural. It has to seem varied.
*  It has to conform to the meaning of the words, not distract from it.
*  Yeah, natural to your authentic to who you are, which is when people try to copy the gestures
*  of another person, it usually doesn't go well. You have to interpret, integrate into your own
*  personality and so on. But gestures is a really fun.
*  It's fascinating. I enjoyed my dissertation a lot doing that because what I was trying to do there
*  was to literally reconstruct them. So to say what were the actual gestures and I did that by
*  comparing the literary accounts of the handbooks with again, Roman art, looking at statues of
*  Romans and things and just trying to say, okay, what were some of the gestures they actually used
*  here? In that way, the people from that time come to life in your mind and your work,
*  which is fascinating.
*  Well, again, it's this pragmatic thing. I want to know, okay, how does this work?
*  Could we talk about the role of religion in the Roman Empire? What's the story there?
*  I mean, religion's interesting because in my mind, the rise to dominance in a lot of the world of
*  monotheistic religions is one of the huge turning points because it's just such a different
*  mentality. I mean, it's very, very different where you say there's one god and it's my god
*  versus, okay, I believe in this god, but there's an infinite number of legitimate gods.
*  Nowadays, particularly in the West, we tend to view the monotheistic perspective as the norm.
*  But for more than half of human history, it was not. It used to be the notion in a lot of Roman
*  history up until about 300 AD. The idea was, well, there's just a ton of gods floating around and
*  you know, maybe you worship that one and I worship these two that I like and the guy across the street
*  worships the oak tree in his backyard and it's all good. They're all legitimate things versus,
*  oh, no, no, no, now there is one god and only one god that's the correct answer.
*  And as soon as you do that, religion becomes foregrounded in your decision-making much more.
*  I mean, the Romans had religion, but it wasn't really driving anything, if you know what I mean.
*  It was auxiliary to things rather than a central force. So for a lot of Roman history, you had
*  a standard kind of, you know, I guess pagan polytheism where there's a bunch of gods,
*  there's certain gods who are associated with the Roman state, and there would be prayer said to
*  those gods on behalf of the Roman state, but it wasn't really, you know, you weren't trying to
*  execute the will of Zeus or something or Jupiter or Mars or anybody else.
*  And in your private life, it was the same thing. You might ask certain gods for help, but it wasn't
*  as much of a dominant thing in your own existence. So I think that's a real transition point where
*  religion started to become so foregrounded. And as soon as you get the monotheistic religions,
*  Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in particular, it really shifts how people start to think about
*  themselves and relationship to the world around them.
*  Pete So, Jesus was born during the rule of Emperor Augustus.
*  Pete Yep. Which is kind of neat that, you know,
*  really influential people in the realm of political events and religious events co-existed.
*  Pete What are the odds?
*  Pete I mean, yeah, there's certain moments in history where just a lot of interesting,
*  powerful people come together and make history. So, and he was crucified under Emperor Tiberius
*  rule. Why were the ideas of Jesus seen as a threat by the Emperor?
*  Pete The thing that causes conflicts between the Romans and Christians is a little bit strange.
*  It's all with this where the Romans had a tradition of on the Emperor's birthday,
*  sort of saying a prayer, basically wishing him good luck. Okay, but technically, it's in the
*  form of sacrificing to that part of the Emperor that might become divine after his death. So,
*  to the Romans, this is the equivalent of a patriotism act, saying, you know, the pledge
*  of allegiance or something to the country. But of course, to Christians, this is worshiping another
*  God. And I think there's almost a failure of communication here, that the Romans just,
*  at least initially, didn't quite understand this is really problematic for these people,
*  because they're coming from a polytheistic perspective where, yeah, everybody has different
*  gods, so what? This isn't a religious problem. This is a political one. Why won't you send good
*  wishes to the Emperor? If you're a loyal Roman, this is something you should want to do.
*  And many of the early Christians, I think, would have been fine with that, but it took the form of
*  what they were asked to be do was to basically worship another God. And that was the sticking
*  point. And this is where I think movies have kind of warped some of our images of Roman history,
*  that Hollywood loves to depict very early Christians, and I'm talking like first 200
*  years here after the ministry of Christ, as a group that all the Romans were obsessed with,
*  that they were constantly trying to persecute and all this. And honestly, I think the Romans,
*  at that point, were more just sort of indifferent or didn't know what was going on. And if you look
*  at some of the primary sources at that time, I mean, there's this very famous letter by a guy
*  named Pliny who was a Roman governor of a province in the East, and he has the habit of writing
*  letters to the Roman Emperor at the time who was Trajan every time he had a problem with being
*  governor. And so this is great. This is the two highest governmental officials in the Roman world
*  sort of hammering out policy between them, right? The Emperor and one of his governors.
*  And so this is about 100 years, 100 AD about, and Pliny says,
*  hey, Emperor, I had this issue. I had these people come before me called Christians. I don't quite
*  know what to do with them. What should my policy be? And here's what I know about them. And what
*  he knows is almost nothing. I mean, it's this almost comic like garbling and, you know, they
*  have this weird thing where they get together on some day of the week and they sort of swear oaths
*  to one another not to do bad stuff, which is, of course, his garbled understanding of the Ten
*  Commandments, you know? And then they have breakfast together and they eat food and this
*  is communion, but he doesn't get that that's what's going on. And so he's really ignorant.
*  But I think that the broader point is, okay, this is one of the best educated, best traveled Romans
*  who has the most experience in the empire, has been all over the empire. And what does he know
*  about Christianity? Basically nothing. So if one of the best educated, most widely traveled guys
*  really doesn't know much about them, that kind of suggests that not many people did at this point
*  in time. At this time was a fringe movement that-
*  Yeah, very fringe. I mean, it was one of, you know, hundreds of little mystery religions,
*  the Romans sort of thought of that. And these are, you know, religions that have some sort
*  of revealed knowledge and that appealed, make more personal appeals to people.
*  Now, stepping back from this in a broad way, I think you can say that Christianity really was
*  different in some ways and had some things that maybe the Romans should rightfully have
*  viewed as a threat. I mean, you know, the Romans are people very focused on this world,
*  right? Citizenship, what you do. Christianity in essence has a focus on the next world.
*  So this world isn't as important as what you're setting yourself up for.
*  And even worse from a Roman perspective, I'm kind of saying, okay, if I were a Roman,
*  Romans are all about making distinctions between people. Citizen, non-citizen, man, woman, free,
*  slave. Christianity comes along and says, in God's eyes, you're all equal. Now that's a pretty
*  problematic idea if you're deeply invested in Roman hierarchy. And I think it is no surprise
*  that among the earliest converts to Christianity are women and slaves, and in particular,
*  female slaves. Now, who are they? They're the people at the rock bottom of the Roman hierarchy
*  of status, right? Which the Romans are obsessed with status, but here's a religion that says,
*  that doesn't matter. And in that same letter to Pliny, Pliny says, okay, in this group of
*  Christians I've heard about, their leaders are two female slaves they call deaconesses.
*  Now, this is really early. This is before the church exists, right? There's no church structure
*  yet. And who is leading the local congregation of Christians? Two slave women. So that's an
*  interesting moment, you know, and that's not necessarily the image we get of early Christianity,
*  but you can see how for people in this social structure, that would be very appealing to them.
*  And in some ways, yeah, it is sort of a threat to the Roman system because they're challenging it.
*  Now, the irony is, of course, 300 years after the life of Christ, the emperor converts to
*  Christianity, and another 100 years later under Theodosius, it becomes the official religion of
*  the Roman Empire. So all of a sudden you have this flip flop where now the state itself is not just
*  converted to Christianity, but actively promoting it and now persecuting pagans.
*  And the reason the emperors do that is one of the biggest problems for emperors at that point
*  in time is legitimacy. That there's tons of civil wars where you have lots of different people
*  saying, I'm emperor. So lots of generals declaring themselves emperor. Now, under a polytheistic
*  religion, that's just, you're all just fighting, it doesn't matter. But if you say there is only
*  one God, then if that God picks someone to be his emperor, they're the only legitimate emperor,
*  right? So there is a real advantage to emperors now becoming Christian because if they can say,
*  we're now a Christian empire and there's only one God and I'm the guy that God picked to be emperor,
*  that means all these other people claiming to be emperors are illegitimate.
*  Do you think that or is there other factors that explain why Christianity was able to spread?
*  Well, I mean, that's why it's appealing to the emperors. And we're talking here,
*  I mean, the religious answer is people see the light, right? It's a faith-based thing.
*  I'm looking at this as a historian. So putting aside religious feeling and saying, okay,
*  if I'm doing an analysis of this as a social phenomenon, what would be appealing to people?
*  And there is that very compelling reason for emperors to want to go to Christianity because
*  it helps them with their biggest problem, which is legitimacy. Now, if you're an ordinary person,
*  what is the appeal of Christianity? Well, we already looked at a couple of them. One of them
*  is that it promises you a reward in the afterlife. I mean, the Roman and Greek notions of the
*  afterlife aren't that appealing. Either you just sort of turn into dust or at best you turn into
*  this kind of ghost thing that floats around something that looks like a Greek gymnasium,
*  which is like a bunch of grassy fields. It's not so hot. So here you're offered the idea of like,
*  oh, you go to paradise forever. That sounds really good. And secondly, for a lot of people
*  in Roman society, that notion of here's something that says I'm valuable as a human being.
*  It doesn't matter whether I'm free or slave. It doesn't matter whether I'm Roman or non-Roman.
*  It doesn't matter if I'm a man or woman. Here's something that says I have equal value. That's
*  enormously appealing. And finally, early Christians, I mean, they honestly, a lot of them do good works.
*  They take care of the sick. They feed the poor. I mean, if you look at Jesus in the Sermon on the
*  Mount, that's the stuff he really hammers. If we look at the words of Jesus when he says,
*  what do you do to be a Christian? A lot of it is take care of the unfortunate. Take care of people
*  who are sick. Take care of people who are starving. And a lot of the early Christians really take that
*  seriously. So they are helping people out. So that's appealing.
*  ‚Äì They're the good kind of populist and populist messages spread.
*  Let me ask you about gladiators.
*  ‚Äì I switch a pace here.
*  ‚Äì What role do they play in Roman society?
*  ‚Äì I mean, okay, gladiator games obviously become a popular form of entertainment. And
*  they're one of the ones that's captured people's imaginations for all sorts of reasons. I mean,
*  it's dramatic. But also, I think it's that apparent contradiction that in so many ways,
*  Roman society seems familiar to us. In so many ways, it seems sophisticated and appealing.
*  Law is wonderful, all this. But yet, for fun, they watched people fight to the death.
*  So how do you reconcile these things?
*  Gladiators, I find very interesting because they're an example of what historians call
*  status dissonance. So it's someone who in society has high status in some ways and very
*  low or despised status in another. So gladiators, most of them were slaves, the lowest of the low
*  in Roman society. Also, they're fighting for other people's pleasure and dying sometimes for
*  other people's pleasure. And the Romans had a real thing about this, like your body being used
*  for other's pleasure. Even a humble working person who hired themselves out for labor,
*  the Romans thought that was innately demeaning because you're using your body for someone else's
*  benefit or pleasure. So they didn't have this notion of the dignity of hard labor or something.
*  They thought the only noble profession was farming because there you generate something
*  and you're producing it for yourself. But if you work for someone else, you're demeaning yourself.
*  And gladiators are the worst of the worst. You're performing for someone else's pleasure.
*  So on the one hand, they're very low status. But on the other hand, successful gladiators get famous.
*  People admire them. Women find them attractive. They're celebrities. And so this is the status
*  dissonance. You have these people who on the one hand, formally are very low status in society,
*  but yet are very popular on the other hand. Another kind of myth about gladiators is that
*  they were just dying all the time. I mean, you watch movies and again, they'll always throw a
*  bunch of gladiators and they all die. I think some scholars did a study of there's like a hundred
*  fights we know of where we know some details. And I think 10% of those ended in the death of one of
*  the people. So gladiators are a lot more like boxing matches where you're watching a display
*  of skill between two people who are more or less evenly matched in terms of their abilities.
*  And probably they'll survive, though there's a chance that one of them might get injured.
*  In fact, one might die. Having said all that, in the end, you really are having people fight
*  and potentially die for the pleasure of an audience. And anthropologists and Roman historians
*  like to speculate why did the Romans do this? The Romans address it. I mean, there's a famous
*  thing where a Roman says, we Romans were a violent people, we're warlike people. And so it's fitting
*  that we should be accustomed to the site of death and violence. Kind of works. There's a more
*  symbolic interpretation that says the amphitheater is an expression of Roman dominance, a symbolic
*  expression, because what you have are all segments of Roman society gathered together to control the
*  fate of others. So you have foreigners, you have wild animals, you have criminals, you have other
*  people. And we are symbolically asserting our dominance over those groups by determining,
*  do you live or do you die? And that kind of works too. And the cynical one is humans like violence.
*  I mean, when people watch a hockey game, what gets the most excited? The fight. When people watch car
*  racing, there's a crash. What's going to be shown on the news? It's the crash. So there's something
*  dark in human nature sometimes that likes violence. And maybe the Romans are just being more honest
*  about it than we are. I think Dan Carlin has a really great episode called Painful Tainment.
*  And I think in that episode, he suggests the hypothetical that if we did something like a
*  gladiator games today to the death, that like the whole world would tune in. Especially if it was
*  anonymous, right? We have a kind of like thin veil of civility underneath which we probably would
*  still be something deep within us would be attracted to that violence.
*  05.00 No. I mean, yeah, there are always, is it human nature? Why do people slow down when there's
*  a car wreck and try and see what's happening? On the other hand, to be fair, I mean, there were
*  Romans at the time who morally objected to them and said, this is morally degenerate to take pleasure
*  in this and that's wrong. So I think in all eras, you have a diversity of opinions. There's no
*  unanimous take on what this is or what this means.
*  06.00 So who usually wore the gladiators? Was it slaves? Was it?
*  06.00 Well, the most common source again is prisoners of war. So if you conquer some people
*  and they seem to be warlike, you might well consign some of them to fight in the arena.
*  And the other thing about gladiators is they were highly trained professionals. So the gladiator
*  schools who train them were spending a lot of money to train these people. And it wasn't just
*  we take some guy and throw him into the arena like you see in movies all the time. These were
*  people that you'd invested a lot of money in. That's why you don't really want to see them killed.
*  But yeah, mostly they're prisoners of war. I mean, in very rare instances, you might have a
*  free person volunteering or even selling themselves to fight as gladiators, but much more common was
*  that. And what's interesting is some people wouldn't do it. I mean, there's a lot of instances of
*  gladiators refusing to fight and committing suicide, which you don't hear. So there was one
*  German who was supposed to fight as a gladiator and instead he stuck his head between the spokes of
*  a wagon that was spinning and snapped his own neck. There were a group of 29 Germans who all
*  sort of said, we're not going to fight for the Roman's pleasure. And they strangled one another
*  the night before they were supposed to fight. So I mean, you have people sort of objecting to being
*  complicit in this kind of performance as well. And they also had interest in animals.
*  Yes. So humans fought animals, exotic animals. And animals fought animals.
*  The Romans were a little weird with their animal thing. They loved exotic animals,
*  but mostly they liked to see the exotic animals die. So I mean, there was an enormous industry
*  collecting wild beasts, transporting them to Rome, which is no easy matter to transport
*  elephants and giraffes and rhinos, particularly in this era of technology. But they were like
*  draining Africa and bringing lions and all these things and sacrificing them.
*  And what about the different venues? I mean, there's the legendary Colosseum.
*  What is the importance of this place? Well, the Colosseum, its real name is the
*  Flavian Amphitheater. It's interesting because for a long time, Rome always had a chariot racing
*  arena, the Circus Maximus, but it didn't have a permanent gladiatorial venue until relatively
*  late, till about 80 AD, so during the reign of the emperor Vespasian. And he built this thing.
*  So he built the Flavian Amphitheater. He was from the Flavian family of emperors.
*  And he did it as a deliberate act of propaganda. So before him had been Nero, who was seen as a
*  crazy or bad emperor. And one of Nero's indulgences is he had built this enormous
*  palace for himself called the Golden House. So it was kind of this pleasure palace with 50
*  dining rooms and all this stuff. And it was basically wasting a ton of money on him.
*  Right? So right on the site where Nero had his Golden House, Vespasian says,
*  I'm going to erect a new building on top of it that's going to be for the pleasure of the people.
*  So it was very much a political statement that my dynasty is going to be about serving Romans,
*  not serving ourselves. And so that's why he builds the Flavian Amphitheater. And the funds he uses
*  from it is basically from looting Jerusalem, because the other thing he had done just before
*  this is he had sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the temple there, in fact. He and his son Titus.
*  And so this is what he now builds in Rome, is his gift to the people of Rome.
*  05 But it's interesting to think about that place, to think about their relationship with violence
*  across centuries for spectacle, watching people fight. And like you said, only like 10% of the
*  time it led to the death. But I read that still a lot of people died. A lot of gladiators were
*  killed. There's numbers, it's crazy. I read 400,000 dead. So this includes gladiators, slaves,
*  convicts, prisoners, and so on. That's a lot of people.
*  06 The Flavian Amphitheater is really interesting too, just as a piece of technology and as
*  influence on later world. I mean, almost every sporting arena today owes something to the
*  Flavian Amphitheater, the Colosseum in terms of construction. And it was amazingly sophisticated
*  building. I mean, it had retractable awnings and elevators and ramps that things could just pop
*  up into the arena from below. And it had very well designed passages where everybody could file in
*  and file out very efficiently, and they were all numbered. So I mean, it's one of, I think,
*  the most influential buildings in history just because of the way that all these buildings we
*  go to today, they're all kind of variants on it and using some of the ideas from it.
*  07 And the Romans took their construction seriously.
*  08 Oh yeah, they were good at that. So they were excellent engineers. And the Romans were
*  excellent engineers, especially when it came to what you might think of as humble stuff. I mean,
*  today we tend to think of, oh, a Roman building is shining white marble, right? Well, the core
*  of that building was probably concrete, and the marble is just a superficial facade. And if you
*  think about the Colosseum in Rome today, all the marble has been stripped off that building. And
*  what you see is the concrete core, the structural core that's left. And the Romans, I mean, they
*  didn't invent concrete, but they just used it more creatively than anyone had before. And if you look
*  at buildings like the Greeks built, they're all rectilinear. They're all rectangles or squares,
*  and they always have a lot of columns because you need to hold the roof up. The Romans,
*  because of their use of concrete, could build wooden frames. They could have curves,
*  they could have domes, they could have all kinds of stuff. And it just explodes the architectural
*  possibilities. They also made a lot of use of the vault. So if you cut rocks and arrange them so
*  that they form a curve, you could have big vaulted spaces. And they were just brilliant with their
*  mix of things. I mean, the Pantheon is the best preserved Roman building, and it's another
*  brilliant building, incredibly influential. I mean, every capitol building in the world or museum
*  is an imitation of the Pantheon. The capitol in Washington, D.C., the capitol in Madison,
*  where I'm from, Wisconsin, Austin, where we are now, they're all Pantheons. It's a big dome with
*  a triangular pediment and some columns on the front. So it's just amazingly influential building,
*  but it's brilliant because the way it's constructed is the concrete at the bottom of the
*  dome is both thicker and has a denser formulation. So it's heavier where it needs to bear the weight.
*  And then as you get further up the dome, it gets narrower and narrower and they mix in different
*  types of rock. So at the top, you're using pumice, that very light volcanic stone. So where you want
*  it to be light, it's light. And it's here 2,000 years later. I mean, look around you. How many
*  buildings that we're building now do you think are going to be here in 2,000 years? I suspect
*  not many. And it's not only that they lasted, but they were beautiful, or at least in our
*  current conception of beauty. Yeah. I mean, Vitruvius, his principles are things should be
*  functional and they should be aesthetically pleasing. So that's a winning combination,
*  I think. Yeah, they pulled that off pretty well. If you could talk about the long line of emperors
*  they made up the Roman Empire, how were they selected? Oh boy. We've been talking about
*  Augustus's great achievements and how clever he was with propaganda and all. This is his great
*  failure. So his great failure is that he did not solve what's the problem of succession.
*  How do you ensure that the next person who follows you is not just the best person,
*  but is qualified and he fails to do it. So the principle he settles on is heredity. So the
*  nearest blood relative. And he goes through all these people, all these young kids in his family
*  die. He keeps trying to make the heir and he ends up making his heir Tiberius who he never liked.
*  It was his stepson. He didn't like him, but he ends up inheriting it. And the next set of emperors,
*  the Julio-Claudians, which is the family that Augustus starts, they all basically are who is
*  the nearest male relative to the previous emperor. And that's how we get a lot of crazy emperors like
*  Caligula or Nero. And then the next family, the Flavians, the first guy is kind of an Augustus.
*  It's Vespasian, the one who builds the Flavian amphitheater. And then one of his sons takes over
*  Titus who was okay. And then the next son takes over Domitian who's nuts again. So heredity just
*  isn't working. And Rome fights a couple of civil wars and in 98 AD, we're 100 years now into the
*  empire. And they look back at this track record and say, okay, we've been picking our emperors
*  by heredity and it's been a, we've gotten some real duds here, some real problematic people.
*  Is there a way to fix this? And this is one of the few instances where the Romans, who I keep saying
*  are very traditional and resist change, I think actually make a change and realize we got to do
*  something different. And so the next guy looks around and says, okay, forget who's my nearest
*  male relative. Who's the best qualified to be emperor after me? I'll pick that person and then
*  I'll adopt him as my son. So they kind of stick with heredity, but now it's this fake adoption.
*  And you end up with a lot of old guys adopting middle-aged adults as their son, which is a
*  little strange, but it works. And so for the next 80 years, you have only five emperors and they're
*  often called the five good emperors. They're not related necessarily by blood. They sort of pick
*  the best qualified guy and they're all sound, competent, good emperors. And the second century
*  AD from Nerva to Marcus Aurelius is often regarded as the high point of the Roman empire.
*  And a lot of that comes from, you have political stability. You have a succession of decent guys
*  who rule relatively wisely, promote good policies. There's other things working to Rome's advantage,
*  but that's good. And then where it falls apart is where the last guy, Marcus Aurelius, looks around
*  and says, hmm, who's the best qualified guy to succeed me? Oh, what a coincidence. It's my own
*  dear son who turns out to be a psycho. And then it all goes downhill.
*  And some people place the collapse of the Roman empire there at the end of Marcus Aurelius' rule.
*  Yeah. So 180 AD is one common date for an early date for the end of the Roman empire. Because
*  from then on, it's a mixed bag of good and bad emperors.
*  At the very least, this period is when the Roman empire is at its height
*  on all different kinds of perspectives. Certainly geographically, I mean, at this
*  point stretches from Britain to Mesopotamia, from Egypt up to Germany. Like I said, probably about
*  50 million people within its boundaries. Within those boundaries, there's relative peace. So,
*  I mean, sometimes people talk about the Pax Romana. I mean, the Romans are fighting lots of people,
*  but within the boundaries, you have relative peace. There's relative economic prosperity.
*  I mean, nothing in the ancient world is that prosperous. It's just a different sort of economy,
*  but it's pretty stable. There's no huge disasters happening yet.
*  Some plagues start in Marcus Aurelius' reign. But yeah, this is pretty much seen as the high
*  point of the Roman empire. And I think it is. I think that there's truth to that.
*  Let me ask the ridiculously oversimplified question. But who do you think is the greatest
*  Roman emperor? Or maybe your top three? The greatest emperor?
*  I'll tell you what. I'll tell you my favorite Roman who wasn't an emperor, and that's Marcus
*  Agrippa, who was Augustus' right-hand man. So Agrippa is this interesting guy who is extremely
*  talented. He's a terrific general. He's a terrific admiral. He's a great builder. He is kind of like
*  the troubleshooter for Augustus. He's the guy who wins the Battle of Actium for Augustus. So
*  literally, Augustus would not have become the first emperor without Agrippa. When Augustus
*  rebuilds the city of Rome, it's Agrippa that he gives the job to. Agrippa rebuilds the campus
*  marshes. He builds the first version of the pantheon. He personally goes through the sewers
*  to clean them out. And he just has this great set of qualities that he's very self-effacing.
*  I think he likes power. He wants real power, but he realizes, I don't have that kind of clever
*  politician's ability to be the front guy. So I'll just serve my friend, Augustus, loyally. They were
*  childhood friends. I'll win the battles for Augustus. I'll let him take all the credit,
*  but I'll be his number two guy. And that's what I'm good at. And he realizes his limitations.
*  I mean, so many people don't. So many people are like, oh, I just want to keep grabbing for more
*  and more and more when it's not something they're good at. And I think Agrippa says,
*  I'm good to this point and I'll play that role and know more. And that'll give me a lot of power,
*  but I'm not going to press it. And yeah, he's just very hardworking. He's modest. He's self-effacing.
*  He's highly competent. I wonder how many people in history there are that are like the drivers,
*  the COO of the whole operation that you don't really think about or don't talk about enough
*  to where they're really the mastermind. Or the ones who make something possible.
*  I mean, even in this conversation today, you would not have Alexander the Great without his
*  father, Philip II, having built that army and handed it to Amos Silver Platter. Octavian would
*  never have become emperor without Agrippa. So they play central roles sometimes. But if I had to pick
*  an emperor, I'd probably pick Augustus just because of his influence. And because I admire
*  the thing Agrippa didn't have, his political savvy, his manipulation of image and propaganda,
*  all that I find very fascinating. Though I'm not sure he's a great human being,
*  but he's a really interesting figure. Whether he's good or bad, he was extremely influential
*  on defining just the entirety of human history that followed. Probably one of the most
*  influential humans ever. Nevertheless, if you ask in public who the most famous Roman emperor is,
*  would that be Marcus Aurelius potentially? I don't know. But he's a question, right?
*  He's real famous because he was a stoic philosopher and he wrote this book, The Meditations.
*  Interesting, Stoicism as a philosophical ideology had a role to play during that time.
*  The tragic fact that‚Ä¶ Did Nero murder Seneca?
*  Yes. Well, he drove him to suicide, let's say.
*  There's a lot of interesting questions there. But one is the role, especially when it's hereditary,
*  the role of the mentor, who advises who with Aristotle and Alexander the Great. That dance
*  of who influences and guides the person as they gain power is really interesting.
*  Well, one of the big questions with the Roman emperors, and we've been talking about some of
*  them, is why did so many seem to be either crazy or just sadists? I don't know that there's a good
*  answer to that. People have theories, oh, Caligula got a brain fever and changed after that or
*  something. But I think there's a lot of maybe truth in the notion that the ones who seem to
*  go craziest quite often are the ones who become emperor at a young age. There is something about
*  that old cliche that absolute power corrupts absolutely, especially if your own personality
*  isn't really fully formed yet. You know what I'm saying? I think take anybody when they're a
*  teenager. If you all of a sudden said, you have unlimited power, what would that do to you? How
*  would that warp your personality? I mean, look at all the, what do they always have to say,
*  the Disney stars who sort of go wrong or something because they get rich and famous at this very
*  young age. Yeah. Fame, power, and even money, if you get way too much of it at a young age.
*  I think we're egotistical, narcissistic, all that kind of stuff as babies. And then
*  when we clash with the world and we figure out the morality of the world, how to interact with
*  others, that other people suffer in all kinds of ways, understand the cruelty, the beauty of the
*  world, the fact that other people suffer in different ways, the fact that other people are
*  also human and have different perspectives, all of that in order to develop that you shouldn't be
*  blocked off from the world, which power and money and fame can do. And conversely, a lot of the
*  emperors we regard as quote, good emperors are the ones who become emperor at a middle-aged or
*  something where their personalities are fully formed, where they're not going to really become
*  different people. And so that works in that theory too. I mean, I don't think it's absolute. And of
*  course, the greatest exception is Octavian Augustus, who starts his rise to power as a teenager,
*  somehow doesn't seem to go nuts. Yeah, history is a lot of-
*  It's not an absolute, but it doesn't help to get that much power at a young age, I think.
*  What does it take to be a successful emperor, would you say?
*  So you say, what does it take to be a good Roman emperor? If you were going to draw up a job
*  description, seeking Roman emperor, what are the qualities and qualifications you would put on it?
*  Obviously, you would put responsible, a good understanding of military, economics,
*  whatever ability to delegate. But just to be fun, let's consider how much does it matter
*  whether the emperor is good or bad? Because in the ancient world, what does it affect, really,
*  if you're say a peasant in Spain, if the emperor is crazy Nero or good Vespasian?
*  I mean, how does that affect your day-to-day life? How does it affect you if you're a peasant in
*  Italy, which is the average inhabitant? I mean, the crazy emperors mostly affect the people within
*  the sound of their voice. So yeah, they go crazy, they murder senators, they murder their members,
*  their own family, they do wacky stuff. But a lot of that is constrained to the immediate
*  surroundings around them. And meanwhile, the mechanism of the Roman empire is just grinding
*  along as it would anyway. I mean, the governors are running their provinces, stuff's happening.
*  I guess an emperor can start a war, he can maybe raise taxes, but that would be the ways that he's
*  affecting the whole empire. And here we get into technology does matter. We're dealing with a world
*  where let's say you're in Rome and you're the emperor and you want to send a message to
*  a province far away, let's say Judea. That message might take one or two months to get there
*  and one or two months to get a reply. So how much influence as emperor are you really having
*  over that province? I mean, those people pretty much have to make their own decisions and then
*  kind of just say to you, this is what we did, I hope that's okay. Because otherwise nothing gets
*  done if they're waiting four months for a decision. Even in the realm of ideas, they can't get on TV
*  and on the radio and broadcasts. Yeah, communication is so slow and so uncertain in
*  ways that today with the ability to instantaneously talk to people across the world,
*  we can't even imagine. And the Roman Empire is huge. I mean, it is months to send a message
*  and get an answer. So here you have the emperor in Rome. Yeah, he affects who's around him and he can
*  affect even common people. I mean, there's crazy emperors who are at the games and they're bored
*  and they say, well, take that whole section of the crowd and throw them to the lions or something.
*  There you're being affected by the emperor. But if you're outside the range of his sight and voice,
*  do you care who the emperor is most of the time? That's a really important idea to remember.
*  Same with the US president, frankly, in terms of the grand arc of history,
*  what is the actual impact? But I would say the big one is probably starting wars,
*  major global wars or ending them in both directions. And then taxation too, as you said.
*  What was the taxation? What was the economic system? What was the role of taxation in Roman?
*  Romans are really weird with this. So in the Republic, once they started to acquire overseas
*  provinces, they had to decide, well, what are we going to do with these provinces?
*  And they in the end settled on this notion of, we'll put a Roman governor in charge,
*  we'll collect some sort of taxes. But they often didn't collect the taxes directly. Instead,
*  they would sell contracts to private businesses to collect taxes. So the private businesses would
*  bid and say, all right, if you give us the contract to collect taxes in Sicily, we'll give you X
*  number of money upfront. And then we go out and try to collect enough to make back that money
*  and make ourselves a profit. And this is a terrible system, because obviously they're going to go and
*  try and squeeze as much as they can out of Sicily. And these companies were called publicans,
*  publicani. And in the Bible, there's a phrase publicans and sinners, and that should give you
*  an idea how they're viewed. So everybody hated these tax collectors. And it was a really kind
*  of dumb system because the publicans were going out and squeezing way more than they should in an
*  unhealthy way from the provinces. And the Roman state was doing this kind of weird thing that
*  they should have been doing themselves. And over time, that shifts a bit and it becomes more like
*  your standard taxation. And a lot of the taxation ends up being in kind too. So it's like, okay,
*  we're taxing you, you pay it in wheat if you're a farmer or something, not necessarily in cash.
*  So in many ways, the Roman economy is underdeveloped. They didn't have a lot of
*  the sophisticated systems that we have today, and it probably held them back in some ways.
*  And again, they have that resistance to change. The Romans also had weird notions about
*  just business and profit making. At least originally, there was this notion that's
*  shameful. Again, the only thing that's a worthwhile profession is farming.
*  So rich Romans would get involved in what we would call business manufacturing, particularly
*  long distance trade with ships. But they would often do it through sort of front companies or
*  employees who did it on their behalf officially. And then they sort of funnel the profits to the
*  guy funding it because they don't want to be soiled with business which is beneath them.
*  So the Romans had a lot of weird attitudes about the economy that I think in some ways didn't help.
*  But nevertheless, they had many of the elements of the modern economic system with taxation,
*  the record keeping. They were good at record keeping. So the Romans, I mean, the census
*  is a Roman word. They're the ones that came up with that. So obviously the laws around everything.
*  So in certain ways, yes, they were extremely sophisticated. And of course, the biggest thing
*  about people in the ancient world in today is that they weren't stupider than us. I mean,
*  sometimes you get this assumption, oh, well, in the ancient world, they just weren't as smart
*  or something. No, no, no. They were fully as intelligent as we were. They didn't have access
*  to the same technology as we do. But that doesn't mean they were any less smart.
*  Can we talk about the crisis of the third century and the aforementioned
*  Western and Eastern Roman empires, how it split?
*  Yeah. So I mean, after Rome starts to go downhill as you enter the third century,
*  so the 200s, so we're moving out of the golden era now. I mean, a famous Roman historian,
*  Cassius Dio, who lived right at that moment, very famously wrote of the transition of Marcus Aurelius
*  to what follows, our kingdom now descends from one of gold to one of rust and iron. So even people
*  who were alive at the time had a distinct sense something is going downhill here. And that's
*  interesting because usually great historical moments are retroactive. And I mean, here's a guy
*  who said, oh, something's going wrong. Something's really going badly now. And a lot of it becomes
*  the secret is out. That what makes an emperor is who commands the most swords. And so you start
*  to get rebellions by various Roman generals, each declaring himself emperor. So you'd always had
*  this to a certain degree, but they had kept it in check during the second century AD. But in the
*  third century, you sometimes get three or four generals in different parts of the empire, all
*  declaring themselves emperor. And then they all rush off to Rome to fight a multi-way civil war.
*  And of course, while they're doing this, the borders are undefended. So barbarians start to
*  see opportunity and come across and start raiding. They start burning and pillaging farms.
*  The civil wars are destroying cities and farms. So the economy is kind of tanking.
*  Then there's less money coming in as taxes. So when one guy finally wins, he jacks up the tax
*  rate to try and make up for it. But now there's fewer people able to pay and it's all just a
*  vicious cycle. The Romans start to debase the coinage, which means you take in a gold coin,
*  you melt it down, mix it in with 10%, something less valuable, and then stamp it and say it's
*  worth the same. Well, people aren't stupid. They're going to know that's only 90% of that gold coin.
*  They invented inflation.
*  Inflation. And you get horrific inflation uncontrolled. So the economy goes downhill,
*  barbarians are raiding. You have internal instability. In one year, you have something
*  like eight or nine different guys go through as emperor in 238. So it's a mess. It looks like the
*  Roman Empire is going to fall in around the mid-third century. So this is the crisis.
*  Then the kind of shocking development is late in that third century, they actually stabilize the
*  empire. So you have a series of these kind of army emperors who are just good generals who
*  manage to push the barbarians out, reestablish the borders. It's actually a whole group of them,
*  but often they get clumped under the most successful, the last guy who's Diocletian
*  who comes in and he tries to stabilize the economy. One of the things he does is he issues a new solid
*  gold coin that he guarantees a solid gold and he calls it a solidus, a solid coin. He famously
*  issues a price edict where he says, this is the maximum it's legal to charge for any good or
*  service. So it's attempt to curb inflation and that's not going to work, but it helps.
*  Kind of amusingly on Diocletian's price edict, can you guess what the most expensive sort of item is?
*  Hiring a lawyer. So some things never change, right?
*  Oh, that's interesting. I mean, in that system, there's probably a huge amount of lawyers.
*  Even lawyers, and quite the right word, Romans didn't have true lawyers, but they had people you
*  would hire to do legal stuff or give you legal advice. But anyway, no, the price edict is
*  actually really fascinating because it's this long list of stuff and you can see a good pair of shoes,
*  a bad pair of shoes, how much each costs, and you can see the relative value of things.
*  What was food versus clothing? What was going to the barber versus hiring a doctor? All that kind
*  of stuff. So it's a really fun document to just mess around with. But anyway, so Diocletian
*  stabilizes basically the empire and these other guys as well and gives it a new lease on life.
*  So it seems by the end of the third century that Rome is going to continue. And then as we go into
*  the fourth century, you have the really dramatic thing where Constantine comes along and converts
*  to Christianity. And at the time he converts, the percentage of Christians in the empire
*  is small, 10% at most, something like that, who knows? But it's quite small. And all of a
*  sudden you have this weird thing where now the emperor belongs to this new religion. What does
*  this mean? You can debate a lot how sincere Constantine's conversion was. It's a little
*  bit of a weird thing where he clearly is using it as a way to fire up the troops before a crucial
*  battle to say, hey, I just had this dream and this God promised us victory if we put his magic symbol
*  on our shields. And this would be okay, except that he had done this a couple times before.
*  So one time it was Helios, the sun god, one time it was another god. Even after he converts,
*  he continues to mint coins and stuff with other gods on them. He continues to worship other gods.
*  But he also kind of seems sincere in his conversion. I think the question is how
*  much does he understand his new religion maybe more than is it sincere? But that's a real turning
*  point. So now as you go into the fourth century, we have this thing with Constantine, the new
*  religion. And the other thing that happens is the empire is really just too big to govern
*  effectively. It's that thing we're talking about. It's too large. The communication is too slow,
*  and it starts to naturally fragment. And at times they try systems where they split it into four.
*  So under Diocletian, he tries the tetrarchy where he splits the empire into four, and you actually
*  have four emperors working together as a team. More commonly, it just splits east-west. So from
*  that point on, you really start to have the history of the western empire going in one direction,
*  the eastern empire and the other. You tend to have two emperors, though there are moments
*  occasionally where they reunite. So that's a big development as well, and that's a turning point.
*  So the most common date that people say, maybe you can correct me on this, that the Roman Empire
*  fell is 476 AD. They're referring to the fall, quote unquote, of the western Roman Empire.
*  So why did the Roman Empire fall? Yeah, this is a real game. Pick your favorite
*  date for the fall of the Roman Empire. 476 is a very common one. And what happens in that year
*  is a barbarian king comes down into Italy and deposes a guy named Romulus Augustus,
*  which is an amazing name. It's combining the names of the founder of Rome, Romulus, with Augustus,
*  the second founder of Rome. And so some people say that's the end of the Roman Empire. Sure,
*  but others say it's 410 when Alaric sacks Rome for the first time. Others say it's 455 when
*  the Vandals come and sack Rome and do a much more thorough job of it this time. Some say it's 180
*  when Marcus Aurelius picks poorly in succession. Some say it's 31 when Octavian wins the Battle
*  of Actium and kills the Roman Republic. Or you can go past that date and say it's 1453 when the
*  Eastern Roman Empire finally falls. And I mean, the Eastern Empire is legitimately the Roman Empire.
*  If you would go and ask them, who are you, they wouldn't say, you know, we're the Byzantines,
*  we're the Eastern Roman Empire. They would just say, we're the Romans. And they have a completely
*  legitimate claim to do that. So this whole game of when does the empire fall is problematic.
*  And the other thing is all those dates about invasions that cluster around the 400s,
*  so 410, 455, 476, you have to ask yourself, who counts as a real Roman by that point?
*  Because for a while now, the Romans themselves are often coming from barbarians,
*  you know, are crossing that boundary, Roman generals, they might get raised as a hun,
*  then serve with the Roman army for a while, then not, or Visigoths, they're not. That's been going
*  on for a long time. So what makes someone a real Roman? How do you tell that the guy kicked out in
*  476 was a quote, real Roman and the barbarian king who took his place wasn't? That's a very
*  arbitrary decision. There's so many interesting things there. So of course you described really
*  eloquently the decline that started after Marcus Aurelius. And there's a lot of competing ideas
*  there and the tensions. Just to interrupt you, I hate wishy washy answers, which is what I kind
*  of said. So I will give you this. I think by the end of the fifth century AD, the Western Roman
*  Empire has transformed into something different. So I don't know what date I can pick for that,
*  but I can say by the end, by around 500, I don't know that we can call whatever exists there,
*  the Roman Empire anymore. And of course the barbarians make everything complicated because
*  they seem to be willing to fight on every side and they're like fluid, which they integrate fast and
*  it just makes the whole thing really tricky to say, yeah, who's a Roman, who is not,
*  and at which point did it like- And barbarians have been forming large parts of the Roman army
*  for centuries. Yeah, it's extremely fluid and not at all just clear sides here. So it's a mess.
*  From a military perspective, perhaps, what are some things that stand out to you on
*  the pressure from the barbarians, the conflicts, whether it's the Hans or the Visigoths?
*  Michael Soule There was a military strategist, a guy named Edward Lutvac, who wrote this book,
*  The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, which was basically about frontiers and how did the
*  Romans define their frontier. And everybody's jumped on this and argue about it and says it's
*  wrong and all, but started this debate among Roman historians about, yeah, what does frontier mean to
*  the Romans? Did they conceive of their empires having a border or was it always expanding or
*  what? And did they have a grand strategy? I mean, today, militaries have a strategy where we want
*  to achieve this, we want to exert force here, we want to protect these areas. Did the Romans even
*  visualize their empire in that sort of grand strategic way? And it's a real debate. I mean,
*  there's some things that suggest, oh, here they tried to rationalize the border and shorten it by
*  taking this territory, other people see it as just kind of random. So that's an interesting take is,
*  how did the Romans conceive of empire? I mean, if you look back at someone like Virgil at the time
*  of Augustus, he said, well, the gods granted Rome empire without end. So it's that open-ended thing.
*  But even under Augustus, he seems to be pulling back and saying, well, I'm going to kind of stop
*  at the Rhine, I'm going to kind of stop at the Danube. We don't need to keep expanding forever
*  in the way we've been doing. So I mean, that's an interesting concept of how do the Romans see
*  their empire? Does it have a boundary? What are those boundaries? What does that mean?
*  And then barbarians were very much making that boundary even more difficult to kind of define
*  it, even if you wanted to. Right. And again, the other fun debate is, were these invasions,
*  you know, when the Visigoths cross the Danube and come into the Roman Empire, is this an invasion,
*  as it was originally described, or is it a migration, as some scholars have started calling
*  it? Because the Visigoths were fleeing pressure from another Gothic group and they were fleeing
*  pressure from the Huns. And I mean, a lot of the early Gothic peoples who come into the Roman
*  Empire are basically seeking asylum. They're saying, will you give us a piece of territory
*  to live on within the boundaries of the empire? And in return, we will fight for you against
*  external enemies. And the Romans make these deals with some of the Goths. In fact, they made a
*  pretty good deal with the Goths, one group of Goths to do exactly that. Like you can settle
*  within the boundaries, we'll feed you, we'll give you a certain amount of stuff, and you fight for
*  us. And then the Romans treated them really badly. They kind of didn't supply what they had promised,
*  and so they turned against the Romans with good reason. So the Romans blundered in these things
*  too. So is it correct that the Visigoths fought on the side of the Romans against the
*  Attila the Hun? Some of them did. So again, there were various groups on both sides of those battles.
*  So Attila is the famous Hun, and he comes into the Roman Empire and seems to be heading right for
*  Rome to knock it off. And everybody is so scared of the Huns that this weird coalition comes together
*  of the Romans plus various barbarian groups against Attila and league with some other
*  barbarian groups, and they fight a huge battle, and it's more or less a stalemate. So Attila gets
*  stopped, and he says, all right, we're going to just rest up for a year. Next year, we'll go finish
*  off the Romans. Next year comes, he heads down into Italy, he's heading straight for Rome, and the pope
*  goes and meets Attila, and they have lunch together at this river. And at the end of the lunch,
*  Attila goes back and says, eh, I changed my mind. We're going to go back up to France,
*  hang around for another year. We'll finish off the Romans later. And Christian sources say,
*  saints appeared in the sky with flaming swords and scared away Attila. Some other sources say,
*  well, the pope gave Attila a huge bribe to go away for a while. Believe whichever you like.
*  But then Attila ends up dying on his wedding night before he comes back under mysterious circumstances,
*  and so that never materializes, and the Huns kind of fragment after his death.
*  So what was the definitive blow by the barbarians, by the Visigoths?
*  The barbarians are so many different groups. And weirdly, I think an important one that sometimes
*  people tend to focus on the Huns and the Goths, the Vandals end up going to Spain,
*  conquering Spain, and then crossing over into North Africa, and kind of conquering North Africa as well.
*  And Spain and North Africa were some of the main areas that food surpluses were collected from and
*  sent to Rome to feed the city of Rome. And it's after those Vandal invasions, the takeover of
*  those areas that the population of Rome plummets. So I think that's an interesting moment where,
*  you know, the city of Rome had always been this symbol, and already it was no longer the capital.
*  The emperors had moved to Ravenna, a little bit north, because it was surrounded by swamps,
*  so it was more defensible. But there is something important about that old symbolic capital now,
*  just collapsing in terms of population numbers, really no longer having importance because
*  literally its food supply is cut off by losing those areas of the empire. And of course, the capital
*  Constantine had founded a new second capital at what used to be Byzantium, a Greek city on the
*  Bosphorus, which becomes Constantinople. He names it not very modestly after himself.
*  And that now is really the dominant city for any of the Roman Empire's eastern or western.
*  **Jaren** So if you're actually living in that century, the 5th century,
*  it's kind of like the western Roman Empire dies with a whimper. It's not like a bunch of-
*  There's a lot of moments you can pick. There's an earlier one in the 300s when the Roman Empire,
*  the Romans lose a big battle to some barbarians that symbolically is important. But yeah,
*  I don't think there's one clear cut moment. And again, I don't know that it is the barbarians
*  that cause, quote, the fall of the Roman Empire. I mean, this is the other game,
*  as people like to say, when did the Roman Empire fall? The other big question is why?
*  Why did the Roman Empire fall if you define it as falling? And I mean,
*  barbarian invasions was the traditional answer. So there's a French historian who famously said,
*  the Roman Empire didn't fall, it was murdered. It was killed by barbarians. But I mean,
*  there's other explanations. I mean, some people say it was Christianity. Some say it was a
*  climate that the Roman Empire flourished during this moment of luck when just the climate was
*  good and then you get this sort of late Roman little ice age and everything goes downhill
*  and that's what caused it. There's some that say things like disease. There were a whole
*  series of waves of plague that started to hit under Marcus Aurelius and continued after him,
*  which seemed to have caused real serious death and economic disruption. I mean,
*  that's a decent explanation. Another popular one is moral decline, which I don't think really works
*  well. You can get the people saying, you know, lead poisoning, but that's not true because they
*  were drinking out the same pipes when the empire was expanding, right?
*  06 Yeah, that's fascinating. That's fascinating. But often we kind of agree
*  that's something that you've talked about quite a bit is the military perspective is the one that
*  defines the rise and fall of empires. You have a really great lecture series called the decisive
*  battles of world history, which is another fascinating perspective to look at world history.
*  07 Yeah.
*  07 What makes a battle decisive?
*  07 The easiest definition is it causes an immediate change in political structure. So who's
*  in charge? So the classic decisive political battle is Alexander beats King Darius III at the
*  battle of Gaugamela. And in that moment, we switch from the ruler of the entire huge Persian empire
*  being Darius to now being Alexander, from it being Persian to being controlled by the Macedonians.
*  So there is a one afternoon has this dramatic switch over a enormous geographic area, right?
*  So that's a decisive battle and that you see that immediate change. Other types of decisive
*  battles are ones that might have more unforeseen long-term effects. You may not realize this is
*  decisive at the time, but from a longer perspective it is. And often those are ones that either
*  allow some new people or idea or institution to either grow or have its growth curbed.
*  So at various points we have empires that were expanding and basically were stopped at some
*  battle. And so you say, well, if they hadn't been stopped there, they might have gone on to dominate
*  this whole area. Or conversely, you could say Rome, they were one place before the Second Punic War,
*  after the Second Punic War, they were its dominant force. So you could pick one of those battles.
*  And so that was decisive in setting them on this new path.
*  08 It's also an opportunity to demonstrate a new technology.
*  And if that technology is effective, it changes history because that was done either tactical
*  or literally the technology used. So how important is technology and that technological advantage in
*  war? 08
*  Huge. I mean, the history of warfare is basically the history of technological change often. So,
*  I mean, there's all the great moments of transition for a long time. We fought with hand to hand,
*  with metal weapons. Then you start to have the gunpowder revolution, which causes all sorts of
*  shifts there. There's big changes, planes, when they become a huge force. I mean, World War II is
*  this crazy time where planes go from literally biplanes, string and wood, to jets four years later.
*  So that's this moment of incredibly fast technological change. Going into World War II,
*  everybody thinks it's all about battleships. Who's got the biggest battleships? Four years later,
*  battleships are just junk. Let's just scrap them. It's all about aircraft carriers. And that's
*  everything war at sea. So you have these moments of particularly in warfare, almost accelerated
*  technological change where things happen very rapidly. And the civilization or the nation or
*  the army that adapts more quickly to the new technology will often be the one that wins.
*  And we've seen that story over and over and over again in history.
*  It's also interesting how much geography that you mentioned a few times affects wars. The result of
*  wars, the rise and fall of empires, all of it, as silly as it is. It's not the people or the
*  technology. It's like sometimes literally that there's rivers. I think there's a real geographic
*  determinism to civilization itself. If you look at where civilization arose, it's in Mesopotamia
*  and a swampy land between two rivers. It's in the Nile River Delta where the same situation.
*  It's in the Indus River where you have the same thing. And it's along the Yellow Rivers
*  and the Yangtze Rivers where it's the same thing. So that is geographically determined where those
*  great civilizations of Asia or Europe are going to arise. It's very much determined by that.
*  And often the course of history has that strong geographical determination. I mean,
*  you can argue that all of ancient Egyptian society is based around the cycle of the Nile flood
*  because it was so predictable and everything depended on it. And their whole religion actually
*  develops around that. And Mesopotamia, the same thing. The way their religion develops is a
*  reaction to the particular geographic environment that those people grew up in. So that's a very
*  profound influence on civilization. One of my professors once said to me,
*  the best map of the Roman Empire isn't any of these maps with political borders. It would be a map that
*  shows the zone in which it's possible to cultivate olives. So if you simply get a map and map onto it
*  where you could grow olives during this time, let's say first century AD, it corresponds exactly,
*  I mean really closely to the areas that are most heavily Romanized. Now I'm not going to say that,
*  but there is something to that where Roman culture spread successfully is where
*  people grow the same crops. And that's just one of those fundamental things.
*  Yeah. I mean, you so beautifully put that the perspective can change dramatically how you see
*  history. I mean, you could probably tell world history through what? Through olives, cinnamon,
*  and gold. Yeah, that's become really trendy is to look at history through objects. And I mean,
*  for the Romans, the diet is huge. I mean, probably 80% of the people in their own world ate
*  basically a diet of olive oil, wine, and wheat, right? That those three crops are the basic crops
*  that they subsisted on. And just the way you have to grow those crops, where you grow them,
*  that dictates so much about culture. And the Romans saw it that way. One of my favorite documents
*  from the ancient world, and they defined civilization that way. So the Romans civilized
*  people ate those crops and non-civilized people ate different food. So there's this letter from
*  a Greek who was serving as an administrator in the Roman government. And he gets posted to Germany,
*  okay? To the far North. And he writes these pathetic letters back home to his family saying,
*  the inhabitants here lead the most wretched existence of all mankind, for they cultivate
*  no olives and they grow no grapes. So to him, that was hell. Being posted to an area where they eat
*  these terrible foreign foods. And of course, the cliche for the Romans of what barbarians eat
*  is red meat, they're herders, so they're not farmers, but they follow herds of cow rounds,
*  which is a totally different lifestyle. They eat dairy products and they drink beer.
*  And I tell my students sometimes that if you were to stick a Roman in a time machine and send him
*  to where we live, which I teach in Wisconsin, Green Bay, Wisconsin, that Roman would step out,
*  look around, see all the beer, the brats and the cheese and say, I know who you guys are,
*  you're barbarians. Barbarians. That's another way to draw the boundary between olive oil,
*  wine, wheat and meat, dairy and beer. But it's more fundamental because it's different forms of life.
*  Because if you're a farmer, you grow certain crops. And if you're a farmer, you tend to stay in one
*  place, you tend to build cities. If you're following herds of cows around, you don't build
*  cities. You have a totally different lifestyle. So it's diet, but it's more fundamental underlying
*  things about your entire culture. And many of the barbarians were nomadic tribes.
*  Some of them were, yeah, definitely. Fascinating. I mean, this is just yet
*  another fascinating way to see slice people. But dietary determinism, geographic determinism,
*  yeah, these things are big. On the topic of war, it may be a ridiculous span of time and scale,
*  but how do you think the world wars of the 20th century compare to the wars that we've been
*  talking about of the Roman Empire, of Greece and so on? I mean, what's interesting about some of
*  the Roman civil wars, particularly, is that they are world wars of the time. So let's take the war
*  after the assassination of Julius Caesar. We've talked about that one a lot.
*  That was fought, there were battles there fought in Spain, in North Africa, in Greece, in Egypt,
*  in Italy. I mean, truly across the entire breadth of the Mediterranean involving at least seven or
*  eight different factions of Romans. And that was the world to them. I mean, that's very similar
*  in a way to our modern world wars, where this was a global conflict, at least as they envisioned
*  the world they knew of. And if we sort of somehow factor for transportation time,
*  I mean, I think you can argue that that was a bigger war than World War II. I mean, in World
*  War II, if you hopped on a plane, you could get from the US to China in a week or something,
*  right? In little hops. I mean, in the ancient world, if you wanted to go from Spain to Egypt,
*  it would take you a month. So they were fighting across a larger space time zone in terms of their
*  technology to move than World War II took place across.
*  So in some sense, World War II was quite contained.
*  I mean, if we adjust for that sort of factor. So that was a global war. I think that would be
*  very familiar. How do you think the atomic bomb nuclear weapons change war?
*  Yeah. I mean, now we can destroy the world and truly kind of destroy civilizations wholesale.
*  And that does seem to be a new thing. I mean, no matter what the Romans did, they didn't have that
*  choice, that ability to think, I can do something that will end life as we know it at least on the
*  planet. And that's a very different perspective. And I think we're at an interesting moment right
*  now. I mean, I'm getting way beyond ancient history here, but for a long time, we had this
*  stasis with the nuclear standoff with mutually assured destruction between the US block of nations
*  and the Soviet ones. And it worked. Now we're entering this kind of time when a lot more
*  countries are going to start becoming nuclear capable. We might have a resurgence of just
*  building new weapons platforms with China. It seems very eager to expand their nuclear arsenal
*  in all sorts of ways. So it's a unnerving time, let's say right now.
*  And it's a terrifying experiment to find out if nuclear weapons, when a lot of nations have nuclear
*  weapons, is that going to enforce civility and peace, or is it actually going to be destabilizing
*  and ultimately civilization destroying? Right. I mean, it was weirdly stable when it was a
*  bipolar world where you had just sort of those two blocks. Now with a multipolar world with access
*  to these weapons, I don't know. I mean, we're kind of jumping out of the ancient world,
*  but I'll tell you one thing that's always fascinated me in this sort of comparison of ancient and
*  modern is how people don't learn the lessons of the past in military history. And the very specific
*  example that in my lifetime I've seen play out twice is just certain places people make the same
*  mistakes over and over again. So a nice example is Afghanistan, or roughly that sort of northern
*  Pakistan slash into what is Afghanistan. I mean, that is a geographic region that over and over
*  again, the best, most sophisticated armies in the world have invaded and have met horrible failure.
*  And that goes all the way back to Alexander the Great tried to conquer that area. The Mongols
*  tried to do it. The Huns tried to do it. The Mughals tried to do it. Victorian Britain tried
*  to do it. The Russians tried to do it. The Americans tried to do it. And they made the
*  very same mistakes over and over and over again. And the two mistakes are not understanding the
*  terrain, that it's a rocky mountainous area that people can always hide in caves. And it's not
*  understanding the fundamentally tribal nature of that area, that that's where the real allegiance is,
*  is in these tribes. It's not in a centralized government. And that's the same error Alexander
*  made as, you know, the British made in the 19th century, as the Russians as the Americans.
*  And it's just, it's so depressing as a historian who studies history to see these things being
*  repeated over and over again. And you know exactly what's going to happen.
*  LW ‚Äì For leaders not to be learning lessons of history. You co-wrote a book precisely on this topic,
*  The Long Shadow of Antiquity. What have the Greeks and Romans done for us?
*  What are some key elements of antiquity that are reflected in the modern world?
*  JS ‚Äì Yeah, it's a book that my wife and I wrote together. And it is trying to
*  make people understand how deeply rooted our current actions in almost every way,
*  even things that we think are just truly unique parts of our culture, or things that we think are
*  just innate to human nature are actually rooted in the past. So this is another power of the past
*  thing. And this is just a long specific list of examples really. So I mean, we go through government
*  and education and intellectual stuff and art and architecture and, you know, a lot of things we've
*  been talking about today. Language, culture, medicine, but even things like, you know, habits,
*  the way we celebrate things, the way we get married. Our married rituals have all sorts
*  of things in common with Roman weddings. LW ‚Äì The calendar.
*  JS ‚Äì The calendar. The words. We're using Julius Caesar's calendar. I mean, Pope Gregory did one
*  tiny little twist, but Caesar's the one who basically came up with our current calendar with
*  365 days, 12 months, leap years, all that. You know, so we're living in law. There's just no
*  way to escape the power of the past. And what I believe very ardently is that you can't make
*  good decisions in the present, and you can't make good decisions about the future without
*  understanding the past. And that's not just true with your own life, but it's in understanding
*  others. So it's not only your own past you have to understand, but you have to understand other
*  people, what's influencing them. So you can't interact with others unless you understand where
*  they're coming from. And the answer to where they're coming from is where they came from,
*  and what shaped them, and what forces affect them. So I think it's absolutely vital to have some
*  understanding of the past in order to make competent decisions in the present.
*  LW ‚Äì What are some of the problems when we try to gain lessons from history and look back?
*  We've spoken about them a bit, the bias of the historian. Maybe what are the problems in studying
*  history and how do we avoid them? CB ‚Äì Probably the biggest problems are
*  the sources themselves, the incompleteness of them. And this gets more intense the farther back
*  we go with time. So if you say, I want to write a book about the 19th century,
*  there is more material available for almost any topic you want to pick than you could possibly
*  go through in your lifetime. If you say, I want to write a book about the Roman world,
*  this is a very different thing. In my office, I have a bookshelf that's, I don't know,
*  eight feet high, 10 feet wide, and it contains pretty much all the main surviving Greek and Roman
*  literary texts. One bookshelf, it's a big bookshelf, but that's what we use to interpret
*  this world. Now there's a lot of other types of texts. There's papyri, there's all sorts of
*  things, there's inscriptions, there's archaeological evidence, so there's other stuff. But honestly,
*  99% of things about the world I study are lost. So then you get into all the issues are,
*  you know, is what we have surviving a representative example? We know it's not.
*  For example, all the literary texts are written by one tiny group, elite males. So that's a
*  problem there. There's the problem of bias. We know that they're not necessarily telling us
*  the truth. They have an agenda. They're representing history in a certain way to achieve
*  certain things. Then there's the problem of transmission. I mean, all those texts are copies
*  of copies of copies of copies. Everybody knows that game where you whisper a sentence to someone
*  and then go around the room. Are you going to get that same sentence back? Well, every ancient text
*  we have has gone through that process. So this is a real problem, and that's just with the sources.
*  This is the historic era. When you move back just a little earlier to the prehistoric era or to
*  civilizations that don't have written sources surviving, and some of these are ancient
*  Mediterranean ones, anything goes. One of the jokes is that museums, archaeological museums,
*  are full of objects which are labeled cult object. It's some religious object. I think the honest
*  label that should be on that thing is we have no idea what the hell this is, but I want to believe
*  it's something important, so I'm going to say it's a religious object. But in reality, it's an ancient
*  toilet paper roll holder or something. It's a huge problem when you try to interpret
*  a civilization without written texts. My favorite little story that kind of illustrates this is
*  in the 19th century, this German who had gone to school in England, one of the best educated
*  guys of his time, goes to North Africa and is poking around in the desert. He finds this site
*  with these huge stone monoliths 10 feet tall in pairs. There's a lintel stone across the top,
*  so sort of like two posts with a stone across the top, and there's a big stone in front of them too.
*  He looks at this stuff and he says, well, what does this remind me of? It reminds me of Stonehenge.
*  There's even a site where there's multiple of these kind of in a square. He goes back and talks
*  about this, and an Englishman goes and studies them, and he finds a ton of these sites, and he
*  finds some of them where there's 17 of these pairs. So he goes back and he writes a whole book about
*  how clearly the Celtic peoples who once lived in Britain came originally from North Africa,
*  because he's found this site, and he reconstructs the religion where obviously they practiced
*  religious rituals here, and they had rites of passage where they squeezed between the things,
*  and the altar stones have this basin, so they had blood sacrifice and all this.
*  It seemed reasonable. Then you ask some locals, well, what's that stuff out in the desert there?
*  They mean, oh, the old Roman olive oil factory? Those are the remains of an olive press. We're
*  back to olives. I keep dwelling on olives. Olives don't grow in England or Germany.
*  This is cultural bias. If all you have is physical evidence, you're going to interpret that evidence
*  through your own cultural biases. If you're an Englishman and you see big stone uprights like
*  this, you're going to think Stonehenge. If you're from the Mediterranean, you're going to think olive
*  press. That's a salutatory example, I think, of the dangers of interpreting physical evidence
*  when you don't have written evidence to go along with it. Think today. If our civilization were to
*  blow up in a nuclear war and archaeologists were to dig this up, how might they misinterpret things?
*  If they were to dig up a college dorm, like where I work, and that's what you had for this
*  civilization, you'd probably go in the dorm rooms, you'd find all these little rooms, and maybe in
*  every room you'd find this mysterious plastic disk. Everybody has these, so it must be a cult object,
*  and it's round, so obviously they're sun worshipers. If you can decipher the inscription,
*  you'll see that obviously they all worship the great sun god, Whammo. It's like, what do you
*  find in every dorm room? A frisbee. That's the level of interpretation you have to beware of.
*  There's examples where we've done exactly this. We'll have to have intellectual humility when we
*  look back into the past, but hopefully if you have that without coming up with really strong
*  narratives, if you look at a large variety of evidence, you can start to construct a picture
*  that somewhat rhymes with the truth. Yes. As a professional historian, that's what you do.
*  You attempt to reconstruct an image of the past that is faithful to the evidence you have
*  as filtered through what you can perceive of both the biases and the problems of the source
*  material and your own biases. It's an interpretation. It's a reconstruction,
*  but it's a lot like science where you're in a process of constantly reevaluating it
*  and saying, okay, here's some new evidence. How do I work this into the picture? How do I now adjust
*  it? That's what's fun. It's a mystery. You're being a detective and trying to reconstruct and
*  understand a society. It's even more fun where you have to try to empathize. Empathy is a great
*  human thing, to empathize with people who are not yourself. We should do this all the time with just
*  the people we encounter, but this is what we're doing with ancient civilizations. As I talked
*  about earlier, sometimes you'll feel great sympathy there. Sometimes you'll feel incomprehension,
*  but by being aware of both of those, you can maybe begin to get some grasp, however tentative,
*  on the truth as you might perceive it. To ask a ridiculous question, when our time,
*  you and I, we together become ancient history, when historians, let's say,
*  two, three, 4,000 years from now look back at our time and like you try to look at the details and
*  reconstruct from that the big picture of what was going on, what do you think they'll say?
*  I would guess it'll be something that's actually more of a commentary on whatever's going on at
*  that point than on the reality of us because that's what we tend to do. I'll tell you what
*  I'd like to have them say is to say, in this civilization, I can detect progress, that they
*  have advanced in some way, whether in moral terms or in self-awareness or have learned from what's
*  come before. That's all you can try and do is do a little bit better than whatever came before you
*  to look back at what happened and try to do something.
*  Livy, one of the great Roman historians, the beginning of his work, A History of Rome,
*  which is this massive thing, he says, the utility and the purpose of history is this.
*  It provides you an infinite variety of experiences and models, noble things to imitate
*  and shameful things to avoid. I think he's right.
*  It would perhaps be better at highlighting which shameful things we started avoiding and
*  which noble things we started imitating. With the perspective of history, they'll be able to identify
*  or maybe with the bias of the historians of the time. In that grand perspective,
*  what gives you hope about our future as a humanity, as a civilization?
*  CB We have curiosity. I think curiosity is a great thing that you want to learn something new.
*  I think the human impulse to want to learn new stuff is one of our best characteristics.
*  At least up to this point, what makes us special is the ability to store up an accumulation of
*  knowledge and to pass that knowledge on to the next generation. That's really all we are.
*  The accumulation of the knowledge of infinite generations that have come before us.
*  Everything we do is based on that. Otherwise, we'd all just be starting at ground zero just
*  from the beginning. Our ability to store up knowledge and pass it on, I think, is our
*  special power as human beings. I think our curiosity is what keeps us going forward.
*  I agree. For that, I thank you for being one of the most wonderful examples of that,
*  of you yourself being a curious being and emanating that throughout and inspiring a lot of other
*  people to be curious by being out there in the world and teaching. Thank you for that.
*  Thank you for talking today.
*  No, I enjoyed it. It's fun. I obviously like talking about this stuff.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Gregory Aldrete. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, let me leave you with some words from Julius
*  Caesar. I came, I saw, I conquered. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
