# Charles Hoskinson: Cardano | Lex Fridman Podcast #192
**Lex Fridman:** [June 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKh8hjJNhWc)
*  The following is a conversation with Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, co-founder of
*  Ethereum, and a mathematician who is one of the most well-read and knowledgeable people on the
*  technical side of cryptocurrency that I've ever spoken to. Quick mention of our sponsors, Galala
*  Games, Allform, Indeed, ExpressVPN, and Asleep. Check them out in the description to support this
*  podcast. As a side note, let me say that Charles is not just a mathematician or cryptocurrency
*  innovator, but also a Colorado-based farmer of bison and mushrooms, a gamer, a fisherman,
*  and a world traveler. When I asked him if he has a nice professional picture of himself,
*  he sent me a picture of him in Mongolia with a hawk on his shoulder, meeting the Mongolian president.
*  That to me pretty much says it all, speaking to the humor and the intelligence of a man who is bold,
*  innovative, and does not shy away from a bit of fun and a bit of controversy, which makes him a
*  fascinating human being to explore ideas with. I do want to say in terms of ideas that, at least
*  to me, cryptocurrency is much bigger than just a way for a few Americans to make a quick buck
*  through meme-driven speculation. It is technology that enables freedom from oppression,
*  from suffering in the world, because money is power. Mongolia, for example, was a reminder of
*  that for me. Next day, after talking with Charles, I spoke with Naomi Park, who is a North Korean
*  defector and who spent time in Mongolia, as many defectors do, in her and their escape from North
*  Korea. Her story, the story of North Korea, the story of atrocities throughout the 20th century
*  committed by Hitler, Stalin, and others, is a reminder that the world is full of darkness,
*  but it is also full of beauty and love, and it is a world worth fighting for in every way we know
*  how. This is the Lux Freedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Charles Hoskinson.
*  Let's start with a fun question. If we're living in a simulation, what programming language do you
*  think it's written in? And maybe from a software engineering perspective, what do you think are
*  some of the design principles that it operates under? You know, there are a lot of really lovely
*  papers. Like one came out of MSR, the Autodidactic Universe. Did you have a chance to see that?
*  All you've got to read it. It's like April of 2021. It's just brand new. But basically,
*  the idea is that the universe is like some sort of giant self-learning system that can self-evolve,
*  almost like Gnomic. And then you have Wolfram running around saying, hey, we can come up with
*  these like very simple rules and we can reconstruct all of reality at some arbitrary point. So I have
*  absolutely no idea what's right. I look at it kind of like a formal system, and I say, well,
*  if you're stuck within the system, it's hard to actually understand that you're inside the system.
*  You know, it's kind of like an object language to a meta language. And, you know, there's this thing
*  that is outside of it, but because you're constrained and limited by the simulation,
*  you can't really understand the nature of the thing that's outside of it. It's almost like
*  Minecraft. You can build these redstone computers within Minecraft and simulate and emulate things
*  within it, but you really can't go outside of that environment. The people outside of it can
*  formally prove that it's correct or whatever, but the creatures inside of the system can't
*  hope to perfectly understand it and prove something about it. Well, also, the question is,
*  it's a computation question. You know, does P equal NP? Because you'd have to be able to emulate
*  all of these. How long will it take? Yeah, exactly. And so I have no clue what type of language you
*  would have to look like, but it would probably not be anything we're used to at the moment.
*  It'd have to be something else. And we'd have to have some more fundamental resolution of the
*  relationship of these formal systems and how they get extended. So that's like a 22nd century
*  question. It's like the 21st century. Do you like, do you find the Stephen Wolfram idea compelling?
*  It's a very different way of programming, which is you set some rules, you set some initial
*  conditions and let it run and see what happens. Yeah. And it's not a new concept. I mean, like the
*  Santa Fe Institute's been doing that for a long time and you can use it for economic modeling and
*  you can show that in certain cases, there's this concept of simple rules evolving into a complex
*  system is somewhat more predictive than trying to build a complex top-down model for things.
*  And I guess there's some analogies, these things in AI, where you start with some simple things
*  and then somehow it just figures stuff out in its environment over time and much better than
*  if you actually tried to model it with prologue or something like that. So that is exciting
*  because you get to just do a few things, let the thing run and then see what happens. And that's
*  a lot of fun. In fact, it got so exciting. Wolfram came to us and he said, hey, let's do an NFT
*  marketplace. So I said, what do you want to do? And he said, I got all these universes to sell.
*  Okay, well, that's going to be fun. So we're going to set up an auction system or something
*  like that with him. And I think maybe end of this month or next month, we'll figure out how to do
*  NFTs on Cardano with Wolfram universes. So as soon as we can sell one, I'll give you one and then
*  then we can all just claim that we're living in some sort of Wolfram simulation.
*  I don't know how much money I have, but I'm going to give everything I have to get rule 30,
*  which is one of his universes that he's created. One of the first ones where he discovered some
*  interesting complexities. I think world 30 is turning complete or is that 45? I can't
*  remember which one. You know your stuff. Yeah, actually, I'm not sure if they proved anything
*  about rule 30 in terms of whether it's turned complete or not. Okay. But there's fun competitions
*  on it, which is trying to predict something about rule 30, about the way it evolves. And so far,
*  nobody's been able to do it. Just like looking at the middle column, try to predict as the system
*  evolves, say anything like conclusive about the future of the system as it evolves. It's fascinating
*  it's both beautiful that simple rules can create that kind of complexity. And it's also sad that
*  we can't like make perfect sense of it, like perfectly predict the future. Even though it's
*  all simple and deterministic, we can't say something conclusive about like when the thing will end.
*  When will this little cellular automata like evolve in a certain way and then nuclear weapons
*  will be invented and blow each other up and then they'll just be this empty 1D cellular automata.
*  Well, doesn't that make it fun though? Yeah, it's fun. But when you're trying to create,
*  and we'll talk about something that operates the economy and the way humans transact and cooperate
*  and fall in love and work together, then you'd like to be a little bit more formal and try to
*  say something conclusive. If this entire universe is just cellular automata, then being conclusive
*  is kind of hopeless, generally speaking. And the hope is, I guess, that there will be pockets
*  of which of within the cellular automata where you could be predictive, where you can be where
*  you can formally show that something is true and then you can rely on that. You'll be resilient
*  and all those kinds of things, even though the rest of the thing is a giant mess that's
*  unpredictable. Didn't they call that Laplace's demon? Yes. I wonder what the demon is up to these
*  days. Okay, thank you for entertaining me with that. But sticking on philosophy, you've also
*  mentioned, among others, that Bertrand Russell and Saul Kripke are two of your favorite philosophers.
*  Maybe you can comment on what ideas of theirs you find insightful and also what to use the
*  difference because you're both an engineer and a thinker. So what to use the difference between
*  philosophy and computer science? Yeah, so yeah, there's both a deeply human element to both Russell
*  and Saul and then there's this, of course, amazing work that they did in the late 19th and 20th
*  century. And you can't really talk about Russell or Saul without also mentioning Wittgenstein and
*  Tarski. Because when you actually look at these guys and you put them together, what they were
*  attempting to do was increase the level of precision we had in analyzing both formal
*  languages and also language in general. And so Wittgenstein makes no sense at all to me. So
*  there's amazing people out there that somehow can parse that. But he doesn't make sense to himself
*  either. I think you're right about that. However, Kripke has Kripkenstein. He has his whole building
*  on that, right? And he built a whole higher. And at least there I have modal logic and I have the
*  little boxes and I have the diamonds and I can do a computation and I can kind of reason about
*  things that people are saying. But it really was all just about precision and the nature of truth,
*  precision and the nature of necessity and possibility. And the magic of these statements
*  is that you can then start getting a better understanding of basically how far formal language
*  can take you. And so that's the work of it. David Hilbert also did the same thing. And Russell,
*  he got his career started working with Alfred North Whitehead. He was a logician and there was
*  this whole desire in late 19th century mathematics to formalize mathematics in a completely new and
*  better way. And they started with geometry and Hilbert's geometry was like a complete system,
*  although recently we've discovered there's a few holes in that. But for the most part is complete
*  and the axioms are independent and they're consistent. And they said, oh, well now we can
*  do this for all of mathematics. And Russell and Whitehead wrote this huge set of books,
*  like two big books, Principia Mathematica, a thousand pages and the conclusion is one plus
*  one equals two. So they linked set theory and arithmetic and logic all in these beautiful ways.
*  Then little by little, as we entered the 20th century, logicians started chipping away at this
*  idea that you could actually construct a complete system of mathematics. First with Gödel and then
*  later with the work of Turing and Church and others, they said, oh, you're not complete,
*  you're not decidable. And so suddenly Russell was left in this really bad position where his
*  early life's work was basically forgotten. So he had to kind of reinvent himself. And so he
*  went into ethics and he went into different fields of philosophy. He became this titan in
*  analytic philosophy and he was also a great pacifist and he was just a phenomenal writer.
*  If you read Why I'm Not a Christian or any of his other attacks on metaphysics, he said, look,
*  I can only deal with the world I'm in in the senses that I have and if I can deduce it,
*  I believe it. If it's outside of that, I really can't make meaningful statements about it.
*  And he said it in a lovely English prose that you would expect of a man of his stature. Now,
*  Saul Cryptree, it was like the complete opposite. This guy's really down to earth, dude,
*  not aristocratic at all. And he was one of those guys that just could have done anything because
*  he's so brilliant. I guess he's still alive. I think he's 80 something.
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, he's getting up there, man. But I mean, literally when he was in high school,
*  he wrote these papers in Logic and Harvard contacted him and said, hey, could you teach
*  graduate courses at Harvard? And he said, no, I really would like to finish high school first
*  before I go and teach grad school at Harvard. And so this is just one of those guys that you
*  can see through his work that he can think deeply about anything. He's like the Galois of philosophy.
*  And he chose to try to clean up a lot of the messes that Tarski and others couldn't resolve.
*  He said, let's really get serious about the nature of truth. Let's really try to resolve paradoxes.
*  Let's really try to build things in such a way that the work that we leave behind can actually
*  be built upon and it's not thrown away every 50 years or 100 years. It was the same for Tarski.
*  He comes in, he says, we mathematicians love this concept of truth, but yet we've never really
*  created a nice rigorous definition that doesn't have paradoxes embedded inside of it. So he had
*  to invent metal languages and object languages, all these notions and so forth. So I really like
*  those four if you think about them. And there's a lot of great lessons. And where it's relevant
*  today is you have human beings and you have computers and they're trying to understand each
*  other. And computers live in the formal world and human beings live in the natural language world.
*  And those bridges between those two are still not completely clear. And so a lot of the work
*  that these guys were doing the 20th century, 19th century had nothing at all to do with that,
*  but gives you hope that perhaps a bridge can exist between those two worlds. And maybe there
*  are some nice tools for that bridge to be built upon. And maybe that in some way will allow
*  computers to better understand us. I mean, they've even created languages, natural spoken languages
*  that are completely ambiguity free like Lojban and things like that. What? Yeah, right? What?
*  L-O-J-B-A-N, Lojban, it's based on a language called Loglan and it's a spoken language that's
*  equivalent to first order predicate calculus. Oh, interesting. So no ambiguities, it's logically
*  consistent. Yeah, Lojban. But can you still have fun in it? Like, you can get very- Can you write
*  poetry or what? Yeah, you can. There's people who actually write poetry in Lojban. I'm going to
*  switch to that. I start tweeting in it. Yeah, there you go. So, you know, there's a lot there
*  and they're just fun to study and think about. And unfortunately, if you go down that rabbit hole,
*  it you'll spend way, way too much time and there's diminishing returns. Now, the second question you
*  asked was one on theoretical computer science to, I guess, engineering. Philosophy. No, no, no, no.
*  So first step, you said humans and computers. Right. So theoretical computer science is theory
*  of the computer and philosophy is the theory of the human. And then we can dissect different
*  stuff about the computer. But in terms of these two worlds of the theory of the human, which is
*  philosophy and the theory of the computer, which is computer science, what do you think is the
*  difference? Like, as we try to bridge that gap, as you mentioned, what is going to be the biggest
*  challenge? Like, can we formalize love? Can we formalize music, art, poetry, all that kind of
*  stuff? Or is that human nonsense that we need to get rid of? No, I don't think it's human nonsense
*  at all. I mean, there's even attempts to create algorithmically generated music. And, you know,
*  the question is, is love just strictly a chemical phenomena? Is there something like
*  metaphysical about it or transcendent of some sort of formal system? I mean, computer science is just
*  saying, hey, we have this notion of computing. We have this brain that we've constructed, this
*  formal system that we've built. And given that we have it, what can we do with it?
*  And so some people worry about the roots of the tree of knowledge, you know, the great Yigdrasil
*  of computer science. They worry about the roots and say, how far can we grow them? And let's keep
*  adding these new models of computation. And other people worry about the trunk of the tree. And some
*  people worry about the leaves of the tree. And the more advanced the field gets, the closer and closer
*  it gets to the people who constructed it, us. You know, we have better image processing. We have
*  better ways of handling speech to text. And we have better ways of computers kind of understanding
*  the intent of what a human being is saying. And then the question is, well, how will a computer
*  understand love or poetry or music? Well, it'll understand it the same way we understand it.
*  You have to get a computer to grow up to a point where it can learn the way we learn or as close
*  to it as possible. Then you just expose it to the things that we were exposed with. And then it's
*  some point the computer will start creating things. So the question is, well, how do you quantify
*  creativity? And I have no clue about that. But you make it into an NFT and see how much it sells for.
*  That's one way. Yeah. But basically, yeah, there's so much of it is subjective. And that's a fascinating
*  whole area of that. I'm fascinated with this human robot interaction is how do we create compelling
*  experiences that are subjectively compelling, whether it's art or just two humans talking or
*  two humans interacting in some kind of way to maximize the richness of the subjective experience.
*  And I think that could be an optimization problem that could be solved. We're solving it all the
*  time. Right. Human civilization is constantly trying to impress each other. When we're younger,
*  trying to get laid, whatever, fall in love, impress your boss at work by all the awesome stuff you do.
*  I mean, we're trying to optimize that problem that's purely, for the most part, is subjective.
*  Right. Did you ever watch Blade Runner 2049? Yes. Yeah. Did you remember the whole relationship
*  between Joy and Kay? And like, did she really love him, the hologram or not? Was it like fake
*  love or real love? Fake it till you make it is my view on love. No comment from Charles. So let's
*  go to the difference between theoretical computer science and software engineering.
*  Or I don't know if you draw a distinction, but if we look into this computer world now,
*  is there a difference between theory, things you can say formally, and the pragmatic implementation
*  of that theory into actual systems that people use? Yeah. Which I guess we'll call software
*  engineering. So, you know, the engineer, they're obsessed with the domain of, well, what do you
*  want to accomplish and who are you accomplishing it for? So they live in the world of people,
*  if they're good engineers. And they say, okay, what's the experience? You know, how are we going
*  to use this? Why are we going to do this? What's the commercial application? What's the non
*  commercial application? And you collect all these business requirements. And once you've done all
*  of that, the better job you do, the more self-evident it is of how do we apply the toys and tools of
*  computer science and other such things to actually resolve that. And the point of theoretical
*  computer science from the software engineering domain is it can tell you kind of where your
*  guardrails are. It won't make perfect programs and there's no such thing as that, but rather,
*  it can give you a good notion and sense that your program has some desirable properties.
*  Like maybe you can prove that it can terminate if you're dealing with total programs, or maybe you
*  can prove you'll never have a buffer overflow, or you know, you won't divide by zero somewhere,
*  or something like that. You know, some event won't occur that'll cause a catastrophic failure in your
*  system. But there's always this combinatorial explosion between what you can test and think
*  about and what you can actually code. So the stuff on the left-hand side lives in a different
*  cardinality, a different universe. There's something significantly larger there. And the tools on the
*  right-hand side, you know, we have property-based testing and these SAT solvers. We have all this
*  great stuff here in formal methods land and computer science theory land, but there's only
*  a small subset of things that they actually give you good answers about. So the balance of the two
*  things is basically saying, well, what do you care about and what are you okay throwing away?
*  That's the art of engineering and building these types of things. So, you know, cryptocurrencies,
*  we deal with these complex distributed systems that have cryptography and game theory and Byzantine
*  actors. So the balance there is saying, okay, what can't fail in that system? And that's the kind of
*  stuff that you want to apply as heavy a tool set as you can because when that stuff fails,
*  you either have the loss of billions of dollars, privacy, or potentially even life, depending on
*  how these systems get adopted. But then other things, you know, what can fail? Is it okay if
*  the block doesn't get made every now and then? Is it okay if your latency goes up or your network
*  suddenly becomes asynchronous and, you know, you disconnect from it, you have to restart the computer
*  or something like that? That's probably okay. It's an inconvenience and burden to the user.
*  And if you actually try to chase that tail, you'll end up spending 10 years chasing phantoms and
*  ghosts. And meanwhile, the whole world moves on. So it's really figuring out those balance of the
*  two. And what's really beautiful is that the formal methods tools have gotten so much better
*  over the last 20 years in particular, mostly because of incredibly high investments from
*  Microsoft and Google and big universities, because these guys are building these gargantuan
*  systems. If you look at the Googleplex or what Amazon has or others, and they have so much value,
*  so many users, so many things going on, and no person can keep that in their head. And so
*  you're talking about systems may have 10 million lines of code, 15 million lines of code, millions
*  of nodes connecting, faulty processes happening all the time, hackers breaking in on a regular
*  basis. So when you're trying to model all of that, trying to ask yourself, what formal guarantees
*  and properties can I get to simplify this system as much as possible? So instead of the applications
*  of formal methods slowing you down, in many cases, it actually massively reduces your debugging time
*  and your ability to find where errors occur. In some cases, you can't find where errors occur
*  inside these massive concurrent systems. And you say, well, where are cryptocurrencies going?
*  We're talking about just the same thing, but we're talking about a much more hostile operating
*  environment, where instead of it running in a pristine data center in California somewhere,
*  it's running on your cell phone, it's running on your mom's phone, it's running your dad's phone,
*  it's running on some computer in Mongolia that may have good internet on Tuesday, but not any other
*  day. So when you live in that kind of environment, you really do need to think carefully about a
*  whole new class of protocols. And then you need to think carefully about a whole new class of
*  tools and techniques to test the reliability of those systems. And you need to separate the world
*  and say, what is high assurance and cannot fail? Because if it fails, people lose money. And what
*  is low assurance? And it's okay if that falls apart. The other thing I'll mention is there are
*  perverse financial incentives in our industry. Because the reality is when something blows up,
*  the people who built those things that blow up usually get paid up front.
*  So what they're focusing on is time to market, speed to market, and getting tokens out and
*  getting them liquid. And then people come in, they buy it. But if there's a nascent bug in some DeFi
*  protocol, it'll probably be discovered six months later or something like that. It blows up who
*  suffers, the users. They already got the people that created that already got paid. Exactly. That's
*  why you pay the guy who makes the break software for your train last. And you make sure he writes
*  the train every day. So that's that you're basically describing the complexity of a distributed system
*  that's fundamentally game theoretic. And like, if we think about turtles all the way down,
*  humans all the way down. I mean, at the very bottom, it's still human nature. Is there something you
*  can say formally about human nature to try? You said you can't there's certain parts of the system
*  that can't fail. You know, some people talk about nuclear war in that same kind of way, that there's
*  this game theoretic construction of mutually assured destruction. That rhymes. See, I'm a poet,
*  that system can't fail because we're going to blow everyone up. But you can't formally say for
*  sure it's not going to fail. Right. So like, you're basically trying to chase, like statistically
*  reduce the probability that these particular critical aspects will fail. And then you test,
*  I guess, by deploying in the real world at small scale, right to see where things go wrong. Yeah,
*  it's a great question. And you know, the problem with game theory and mechanism design is that you
*  can develop this concept of a rational actor. And I don't think in my life I've ever met a
*  rational actor. You know, there's a rational actor on Tuesday, but you know, any other day of the
*  week, who the hell knows. And there's even I think there was a book Freakonomics. And there's a few
*  of these things where it just shows again and again, where people behave in ways that are against
*  their best interest. So then you have these protocol designers, and they say, well, we need
*  an honest majority for this thing to work. And they say, okay, well, we'll create this incentive
*  model and rational actors will behave with that incentive model. And say, well, the individual
*  won't do that, but the firm, the government, the entity will. The problem with that is we have a
*  lot of counter examples where the system was actually behaving in weird ways. Like we almost
*  completely eradicated the human population twice in the 20th century. Once during the Cuban missile
*  crisis, and again in the 1980s, there was a Russian colonel and they installed a new satellite
*  system and it said, hey, the Americans are launching missiles at us. You need to turn the
*  key and, you know, launch all the missiles in the silo. And he said, oh, that's not right. That
*  doesn't seem right. And he was reprimanded for not launching the missiles. So in both cases,
*  a single person stood against the systems of superpowers between us and nuclear annihilation.
*  So in general, we're really bad at building these types of things. So what you look for instead is
*  say, can the system be self-correcting? It's not about avoiding a problem. It's more about,
*  can the problem be resolved? And that's how nature engineers things. It gives you an immune system.
*  It gives you the ability to heal. If a rainforest has a fire or some catastrophic event,
*  the ecosystem will find a way to patch things up. So it's a better question of how do you align
*  the incentives over the long term of a system where all the actors within the system, when an
*  event occurs that disrupts it, have an incentive to push it back into a healthy, productive,
*  useful state? Which is going back kind of to that complexity theory stuff that we began with and a
*  little bit about, you know, how do you handle modern economics? Like, for example, we knew this
*  coming into the COVID crisis that there would be catastrophic economic disruption throughout the
*  entire world. In the developed world, it was print lots of money and hope to God it works.
*  In the developing world is try not to starve to death. Over 100 million people were pushed into
*  acute starvation. So acute hunger is a terrible situation. But every economist knew we were going
*  into that. So the question is, how do you restart the system? How do you realign the system and so
*  forth and make sure that it doesn't collapse at some point? So it's an imperfect, inexact science.
*  And that's actually one of the things that makes our industry so much fun is that these are kind of
*  micro experiments for the macro. In years past, you never got a chance to experiment with monetary
*  policy. I mean, it's like every 20 years, 30 years, you'd have some conference, usually in a cool
*  island like Jamaica, and be like, okay, let's go talk about monetary policy and amend the Bretton
*  Woods Agreement. And these would be nation states, invitation only. And now you have over 8,000
*  cryptocurrencies floating around all with their own monetary policy and their rules. And it's
*  very Darwinian. A lot are dying. Some are succeeding. Anomalies happen like Dogecoin.
*  And you say, God, is this temporary? Is this permanent? Why doesn't this horrible thing die?
*  And then other things you think would be absolutely successful and just take off and be in the top 10
*  don't really get as much traction. Like Al Grant is a great example of that. I mean, Silvio, he's
*  incredibly bright guy. Every time I go to MIT, we have dinner and his work is legendary. And it's
*  just beautiful and elegant. And he literally has all the people. He went and hired Tal Robyn. And
*  she gutted IBM research. And Craig Gentry, the guy did homomorphic encryption on her
*  Dambeau Nets there. There's all these amazing people on that team and they have money in the
*  VCs. So you'd say, okay, that's a contender. But if you look at market adoption, Ethereum Classic
*  sometimes is above it. And other things are above it. So it's-
*  And then there's this weird Darwinian evolution produced Dogecoin organism that's just like
*  stomping all around. Evolution doesn't make sense.
*  Exactly. But maybe it's worth the problem, not evolution, because the market's the market. And
*  you can scream and cry and pout and stamp your foot and say, this makes no sense. But
*  that's the way the world works. There's plenty of mountain climbers that didn't want gravity to
*  apply to them. And it's the same situation here. There's plenty of people in these
*  marketplaces that had the best of intentions, the best team, the best technology. And for
*  whatever reason, they didn't get that adoption. So the question isn't the local, it should be the
*  long-term. And will the system over time converge to a state that actually is useful and meaningful
*  to society and actually solve problems for it? And that's what we try to figure out is,
*  you know, how do we perturb these things in a way to kind of push them in that direction?
*  So before we go into this fascinating Darwinian evolution of cryptocurrencies,
*  let me ask you sort of a basic programming question. There's a fascinating aspect to
*  your work with Cardano that you use Haskell to build the infrastructure, but even stepping back
*  more looking at this landscape, another place where Darwinian evolution operates,
*  looking at this landscape of programming languages, you as an engineer, you as a philosopher,
*  both what programming languages do you think are interesting and more practically what
*  programming language is, if you were to advise like students today, should they learn?
*  Yeah. So there's the pedagogy of learning how to program and to express the theory of computer
*  science. Like you have to learn how to write algorithms. You have to learn what data
*  structures are. You have to be able to do analysis of these things. And that probably the, I think
*  the debate is over Python is probably the best language or JavaScript to get started with,
*  because they're very useful. The libraries are amazing. There's just tons of online materials.
*  Even MIT is now teaching their introduction to computer science and Python. And they used to do
*  Lisp. I mean, these guys were hardcore. I still love Lisp. Oh man, it's great. These are your
*  father's parentheses. They're elegant weapons from a time long ago. But you know, that's a great
*  starting point. And it's not about falling in love with the language. It's just falling in love
*  with computing. It's about falling in love with having a dialogue with a computer and thinking
*  about, well, how would I solve that? How would I interact with that? What does this need to look
*  like? Functional programming is what we've chosen to use for Cardano, mostly because we're living
*  in the academic world. We've written 105 papers. And the problem is you have to translate that work
*  into code. And the gap between an imperative language like a C++ or C and these academic
*  rigorous papers is extremely large. And so there's going to be a lot of semantical ambiguity between
*  those two. And what I mean by that is that you might end up implementing a wrong thing.
*  You might think that what you've built is the paper, but the computer's not going to tell you
*  that because the paper is written in prose and maybe typed up in LaTeX or something. But there's
*  no proof chain, evidence chain that you can show that there's no ambiguity. When you look at a
*  functional language, you're a little closer to math. And so as a consequence, the translation
*  of the papers that we spent so damn long writing and writing proofs about and so forth to code
*  is much smaller. Now, the downside is these functional languages tend to be a bit more
*  academic and they tend to have not necessarily the best Windows support and the libraries aren't so
*  good. And also they tend to be a little slower when compared as a whole on average to languages
*  like C, for example. So it's really a question of, okay, what are you designing for for version one?
*  Are you designing for performance and are you designing for developer accessibility?
*  Are you designing for correctness and are you designing for a high fidelity representation of
*  the protocol? Okay. So Haskell was chosen as kind of the version one because we knew that the kinds
*  of people who think about that are also the kinds of people that would have an easy time reading a
*  paper like Ouroboros and working their way through all of this. And they would do a pretty good job
*  writing a formal specification and then translating that into running code. Then once you have that,
*  you have a blueprint that you can actually reason about, maintain. And if you really wanted to,
*  you could then turn that into a Rust code base or into a Java code base. Going the other way around
*  would be kind of pointless and counterproductive. The other side of it is that
*  Haskell code or functional code tends to be significantly more concise. And I actually have
*  a real life example of that. So if you take a look at Mantis, we implemented a full Ethereum node in
*  Scala. It's only about 14 or 15,000 lines of code. And you compare that with like C++, Bitcoin,
*  I think that's 120,000, 150,000 lines of code. So it's almost 10 times smaller. And so less code,
*  less to read. And you tend to read code significantly more than you would read write code.
*  So it's always an advantage for maintenance, understandability, documentation, and other
*  sort of things when you have more concise code bases. And also it's a lot easier for you to apply
*  stronger tools to a functional code base, like static analysis or property-based testing or
*  these types of things than an imperative code base. But the thing is, it's almost like a religion,
*  it's like say, or language. It's like saying, what's French versus Russian versus English?
*  Everybody has their adherence. They say, oh, they have the best poetry here.
*  Or Russian, yeah.
*  Yeah. There you go, always, or Russian. Everybody has their favorite tools and their favorite
*  languages. But it just comes down to what problems are you trying to solve and what problem domain do
*  you live in? If you're inventing new protocols based on science, you're going to take the time
*  to write a paper, go through the peer review process, as you've done personally. And you know
*  how hard it can be to get into a conference and go through that and get your ass kicked.
*  Then you also have to apply the exact same level of care to the engineering side in terms of
*  implementation of that. Or else you will make a mistake, and that mistake will probably be an
*  exploit in the system that destroys the security properties of the system. So we really had no
*  choice but to go to some notion of functional. The question was, what's the Goldilocks language?
*  Do you use a hybrid language like Scala and F sharp or Closure, where you still have some
*  connection to understandable things like .NET or the JVM? Or do you go to an overly academic language
*  like Idris or Agda or Isabel? And there you can really dial up the correctness and write all kinds
*  of crazy proofs. But by the way, it's like the seven people who write your code, they go on vacation
*  a lot, you'll never get anything done. So Haskell kind of felt like a nice mill ground between those
*  two where we needed to pull into the left, we could. If you wanted to pull into the right,
*  you could as well. That said, it's really amazing to see what the hybrid languages have done. If I
*  was a new student in computer science and I said, learn any language to grow your career from,
*  Scala 3 is probably the language to go with. Yeah, it's great because it's like you want it to be
*  like Java, it's Java. And it looks kind of like a Java program. You want it to be like Python and
*  scripted and you reuse a REPL, you can do that. You want to go hardcore dot, you know, dependent
*  object types and do like weird proofs and stuff and the functional, you do all that. You have access
*  to all of these things and Martin Aderski is a brilliant guy. He's done some phenomenal work
*  basically because he was one guy who created the JVM and he's worked on compilers for over 20 years.
*  He did a lot of really hardcore work in trying to build a concise, nice, modern language that does a
*  little bit of everything. And it's got great applications in data science and in AI. And it's
*  also heavily used in modern companies like Netflix uses Scala for all of their microservice
*  architecture. Yeah, so that's a great language and it's easy to pick up and it's easy to hire
*  people into it. You just find these Eastern European guys who are Java programmers for 10 years,
*  15 years, and they got tired of making $20 an hour so they picked up Scala so they can make $35 an
*  hour and they're really good at it, you know. And that's a great gateway drug because you have
*  like QuickCheck and Haskell, you have Scala Check and Scala, you know. You can also do model checking.
*  You can also go and use a TLA spec and make it work with Scala and so forth. So it gets you a
*  little bit of everything and you can then move around that entire design space in a beautiful way.
*  So the recommendation is maybe if you want to go vanilla, you go Python and JavaScript.
*  When you're getting started. It's getting started. That'll get you everything. You can do web
*  scrapers and anything. It's just fun. Like all this experiment with drugs in undergrad, this was
*  where Scala 3 comes in, it's a gateway drug to then potentially more hardcore functional languages
*  like Haskell. Do you think C and C++ still has a role? No, I think Rust is completely the place
*  to need for them. Go and Rust, you know, those are the two twins of doom. I mean Google created Go
*  just to get rid of C. They hated C that much. And then Rust is just a phenomenal language as
*  well. Hate can be a great motivator. Let me ask a question from Reddit on this topic. We're going
*  depth first today. Sure. As a developer, why should I be incentivized to create Cardano-based
*  applications? What is on the Cardano developer roadmap? Any other language? I guess this is the
*  key question I want to ask. Any other language support other than Haskell? The example this
*  person gives us TypeScript, Go, Java, Python, etc. Also, have you considered a yearly conference
*  focused around developers? Yeah, we saw the Plutus Fest and we did the first one in 2018,
*  2019, I can't remember. And we were going to do one last year, but then COVID hit. So we'll bring
*  it back and we'll probably do it annually at the University of Wyoming for their hackathon there.
*  In fact, it just so happens that coincides with the Goguen Summit. So we're doing that, I think,
*  the third week of September. But yeah, it's great to do an annual conference. You can bring a lot of
*  cool people together and you can do hackathons and awards and so forth. But to the question in
*  particular, Plutus is like any other language. Plutus Core, you can compile things into it. So
*  it's entirely possible to write a Scala to Plutus Core compiler or TypeScript compiler or something
*  like that. But you know, I'm a big believer of separation of concerns. And we don't live in a
*  single chain model anymore. So you know, you have a situation where you probably want to have different
*  execution environments and different chains. So you have different virtual machines there. And
*  that's why we work so closely with the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,
*  Kogori Roshu's team at Runtime Verification. What they did is they said, let's start with
*  something very familiar, LLVM, which has been around for a really long time. And they happen
*  to have created it there with Apple. And let's take that and translate that into the blockchain
*  space. Okay. Then once you have it, then it's very easy to modify compilers of standard languages,
*  like the Cs and C++s and other such things that do compile to LLVM already and have them run there.
*  So that's a different execution model than what we tried to build for Plutus, which focuses on
*  correctness. Okay. So then all you have to really do is say, can both of these models coexist within
*  the same ecosystem? Because then you kind of, and I did a video, it was called like the island,
*  the ocean, the pond. And the basic idea was say, you have an island where everything's perfect.
*  Calypso lives there. Life is great. You know, people feed you grapes every day, but maybe you
*  can't do everything on the island, you know. And the ocean's big, it has everything, but the ocean's
*  got sea monsters and sharks and Bodie McBoatface and all kinds of crazy stuff. Right? So that's
*  what Yela is about. It's basically this, this will bring LLVM into our world. And at some point in
*  the next three to five year time horizon, we can bring modern programming languages in, but they're
*  going to come in with all their flaws and their warts and their problems. And then the pond was
*  the idea of the Ethereum virtual machine. There's some network effect around it and there's some
*  great tooling that's materialized and evolved. And it's not clear if that's the standard yet,
*  or if like MySpace or BlackBerry or all these other things, it'll fade away. Well, if it becomes the
*  standard, okay, don't fight nature, just support it. And the same thing that gives you the ability
*  to bolt on the LLVM will also give you the ability to bolt on the EVM. And they can run with their
*  own models and their encapsulated bulkheaded separated systems, but you can move ADA applications,
*  information between those two systems. And so your main chain will always stay somewhat conservative
*  and have the minimum viable amount of expressiveness required on it to do all kinds of interesting
*  things. And also for interoperability, be able to talk to all kinds of interesting things,
*  but it's not trying to be everything to everyone. There's never going to be an ice cream store
*  in the island. You'll have the grapes and the beautiful women, but no ice cream.
*  Now you're just like distracting me with the ice cream. So just for, because we'll throw around
*  a bunch of terms for the record, what is Plutus? So Plutus is a programming language. It's kind of
*  a DSL that we built on top of Haskell. And basically we wrote it after spending about three years
*  thinking about all smart contracts. We were trying to figure out like, what is the ideal language to
*  express a smart contract? And then we started thinking, well, what is a smart contract? Is it
*  the whole application or is it just like a sub module within an application? And usually it's
*  the latter more than the former. You can build a self-contained program like a script, but usually
*  what's happening is you'll have it like a video game, let's say World of Warcraft or something
*  like that. You say, hey, maybe I want to actually create gold in World of Warcraft that's actually
*  a currency. Okay, so I'm going to issue a token. Well, and then maybe I want to create some mechanics
*  behind how people are going to trade that amongst each other. So that would be like a smart contract
*  layer and issue an asset. So you have this centralized server running and proprietary software
*  controlled by a single company, but then you've opened your application up to a broader world.
*  And we've done now is added a blockchain layer and the blockchain handles the accounting of that asset
*  and the spending policy of that stuff. So that is a much smaller program than what Blizzard is doing
*  with World of Warcraft. So the point of Plutus was let's create a language where you can write
*  these small to mid-sized programs and have a high degree of confidence that they behave with
*  correctness. And also they give you deterministic results on the consumption of resources. You can
*  run things locally and you actually understand what it costs to run. And that doesn't change when you
*  deploy it on the system. If you dial up the expressiveness of the system and you're like
*  Ethereum does and these big mutable account systems, the problem is you have to have global
*  states. So whatever you test locally doesn't actually necessarily translate to what you've
*  deployed. So we spent a long time asking where's the Goldilocks zone? Bitcoin script was too
*  restrictive and every single time Satoshi tried to dial it up, it led to mega problems. There was
*  a beautiful thing called the value overflowing incident in 2010 which led to the creation of
*  billions of Bitcoin. They had to quickly clean that up and sweep it under the rug and pretend
*  like it didn't exist. But that was mostly because of an issue with how the scripting language was
*  implemented. And when you look at Ethereum, it's like this puric game of stomping down these
*  skirmishers where every update there's something they have to change or tune and then it's not
*  clear how you shard such a model. So we said let's build something that's in the middle of this and
*  that's what Plutus basically is. And it's really designed to play very nicely with off-chain
*  infrastructure as much as on-chain infrastructure. So you can look at all those different examples,
*  whether it's Wolfram wants to auction off their universes or Blizzard wants to
*  issue an in-game currency or your Uber and you want to start putting peer-to-peer dynamics
*  inside your system, you're going to gracefully connect to that on-chain code and it's very clear
*  how those two things connect together. Just so happens Haskell is really good for this.
*  They have template Haskell and it makes it very easy to embed domain specific languages and it
*  makes it very easy to wire your Haskell code onto off-chain infrastructure. So in the future,
*  you'll be able to have your off-chain run a node or the Java virtual machine or a .NET application
*  and there'll just be this beautiful interface and then it can talk to all your on-chain code and
*  that's written in that DSL and you have a high degree of assurance that it's right.
*  Is there like a Hello World program in Plutus that reveals the beauty of this balance that you're
*  referring to? Sort of simple but not too simple, the Einstein idea?
*  Yeah, so we did do our first Hello World program actually today.
*  Yeah, I heard about this.
*  Yeah, but there you'd want to have the whole round trip. So you'd like to have an interaction
*  and I think a video game would probably show it the best. If we could re-implement CryptoKitties
*  or something like that on it and you have this off-chain infrastructure and you have your GUI
*  and your front end, it's running on your phone or a browser and most of that lives off-chain.
*  But your CryptoKitties, they'd live on the blockchain. The whole round trip end-to-end
*  with relatively low fees and low latency and high availability of service, it never goes down.
*  That would probably be the best thing to do and we'll have something like that by August.
*  It's pretty easy to build this stuff.
*  So what kind of off-chain interactions are supported with Plutus? What are the
*  limits you want to put on the thing so it doesn't get chaotic?
*  That's the beautiful thing. When you have a less expressive model on-chain,
*  it means you can do anything you want off-chain.
*  So you started talking about smart contracts, but let's zoom back out and ask the big question
*  here is what is a blockchain and what is a cryptocurrency?
*  So a blockchain is just a ledger and really it has three nice properties. Your timestamps,
*  your immutable and auditable, either in a global or local sense. So there's all kinds of things
*  mankind has invented where it's really important that when you put some information down, it
*  doesn't change and other people can see it and that you know when it was put down.
*  For example, a property ledger. So when you buy land or you have rights associated with land,
*  mineral rights or water rights or these things, you'd like to transitively see how does it go
*  from Alice to Bob to Charlie to Jim and so forth and what was the state of these things as they
*  were transitioning. So how much did they pay? When did it occur? Etc. The metadata that follows that.
*  Normally these types of ledgers are so important that they're managed either by governments or
*  regulated entities. The issues are that while they can be efficient, they're generally brittle.
*  The political manipulation and they're brittle to geopolitical events. For example, when Syria fell
*  apart, the very first thing ISIS did is they started saying, hey, the ownership of the land,
*  it's going to fundamentally change. We've decided that this guy over here now owns all these things
*  and then when peace comes, how do you unwind all of that, put it all back together?
*  So the power of a blockchain is that it gives you a transnational way of sorting all these details
*  out and putting all together in a place that you know that even if it's inconvenient to a very
*  powerful actor, that it will still stay preserved. This is an asymmetry we haven't had as a society.
*  Usually kings and empires, they have the ability to decide what's true and then suddenly you have
*  this asymmetrical thing that is above them, kind of like a synthetic laws of physics and once
*  something goes in there, you know that that's there. Okay, so that's the first part of it.
*  The second part of it is that it's auditable, meaning that instead of saying only the high
*  cleric or the president or some very special club of people get to see what's going on,
*  suddenly now all the people can actually see who owns what where. Imagine a tax system where
*  the pro public just leaked the taxes of all these different billionaires and said well how
*  much they make and how much they pay. Imagine a tax system where that's just done by default
*  or other social systems where this type of information is put in by default.
*  So it's tremendously useful, this type of structure and all kinds of things, medical records,
*  supply chains, just a good thought experiment is I travel a lot, I've been to 52 countries in the
*  last five years. Imagine if I got sick in Zimbabwe, you know I get hit by a car or something
*  and I'm unconscious and a Zimbabwean doctor calls my doctor in Colorado and says hey you know I need
*  all of Charles's medical records, you know he's unconscious right now but I need it to treat him
*  because he's quite ill. They'd say who is this person in Zimbabwe? I don't know you, I can't
*  give you his records, I need his consent. Oh no, he's unconscious in the hospital, can't do it.
*  Well a broker system that would allow the movement of medical records would be an example of what a
*  blockchain could potentially do in the foreseeable future. Cryptocurrency is just an application
*  that runs on top of blockchain because it turns out that when you issue property you also can
*  issue tokens of value and then you could have a monetary policy, it could be inflationary or
*  deflationary, you know demurrage where it decays over time or whatever have you and the very same
*  mechanics that would ensure your property records are secure or your medical record access is secure
*  could also be applied for the ownership of the cryptocurrency and again you can either be
*  completely transparent and everybody can see what everybody owns and that's what bitcoin does
*  or you can be as opaque as you seek to be, that's what Zcash basically attempts to do, it says hey
*  let's keep these things as private as possible but they have relatively the same mechanics in
*  terms of those properties of auditability and time stamping and immutability, you know things
*  won't be reversed, you know that people aren't going to manipulate the time stamps and you can
*  audit at least enough to know that the ownership is right. But the way if you think about physics and
*  the universe, the universe has figured out a way to update the ledger of physics in a way where like
*  a lot of people can be updating it and it stays consistent. Is there something you can say about
*  the task of updating the ledger when a bunch of people are trying to do it or a bunch of entities
*  are trying to do it? Well yeah that's the whole point of a consensus algorithm so whatever ledger
*  you're running there has to be some mechanism to decide who's in charge and that's what proof of
*  work does and proof of stake does and all these other systems and you break them down in basically
*  three steps and so we'll use Eve for kind of step number one. Hi Eve how you doing? And we're going
*  to use Wally for step number two and I need the monkey, give me the monkey. What's the monkey's name?
*  Daisy. Daisy the monkey okay. I like Daisy. Daisy is a very confused monkey. It's pondering its own
*  mortality just right and so anyway the first step is all about basically deciding who's in charge
*  for that moment. So blockchain is just a sequence of events the heart has to beat, the metronome has
*  to click, so somebody has to be in charge and so generally you have this notion of a resource so
*  there's some pool of resource out there and it can be a token and in that case it's a plutocratic
*  system and that's what proof of stake does or it can be computation but there can be other resources
*  but computation is what proof of work does and so you make so many hashes and then eventually
*  somebody wins and that person who wins is now the person who basically gets to decide the order of
*  transactions and put them all together from their perspective in the system. Then once that person
*  wins they'll make the block that's step two and after it's made transmit it and it gets validated
*  and accepted. So actually it's quite fortuitous you have the magnifying glass because at this stage
*  people are trying to decide is what I'm looking at correct or not. Now there are other ways to
*  potentially conceive of this but this particular model gives you a kind of a way of thinking of
*  all consensus algorithms in one setting. You can be Algorand, you can be a classic BFT protocol,
*  you can be Paxos, you can be Raft, you can be proof of work, you can be proof of stake.
*  It's always the same idea. You have to find someone or some group to be in charge,
*  they'll reach a consensus on order, they have to then do some work, change the state of the system,
*  update it and then the network has to accept that that's valid. So even if this process were to be
*  works well this side will say oh you created a bitcoin out of thin air you're not allowed to
*  do that so that's rejected. So there's checks and balances and guards all the way through.
*  There's a meta question of fairness in all of this. So the proof of work people they're kind of a
*  cult and they say that this is the only truth and everything out here any other resource is not
*  legitimate or valid and there's not a lot of evidence to that but that's what they believe.
*  The proof of stake people the downside and weakness they have is it's a plutocratic model.
*  The more ownership of the system you have the more control you have over that system
*  and it suffers from the same thing the shareholder models suffer from whereas
*  you may maximize short-term gain over the long-term viability of the system.
*  So a really cool question is can you build systems that are multi-resource?
*  So instead of just pulling from one resource to select who wins this 25% of the time and maybe
*  this 25% you can do that. In fact the cryptocurrency space did that a long time ago. There was a
*  cryptocurrency called Peercoin in 2011 and it was a hybrid proof of work proof of stake.
*  So some of the blocks were made with the token ownership distribution and some of the blocks
*  were made with proof of work but you could keep adding. You could put in like hey I want hard disk
*  in my thing you put permacoin in or something like that to create incentive for hard drives and then
*  you can say oh no I want to do like a human system like a proof of merit. Oh my god now we're up to
*  four and you just keep adding and each of these pools will have different adherence and actors
*  and then you can actually balance out the whole thing. So as opposed to having one cult you have
*  many cults. Exactly. And they argue. And the cults argue with each other and we call that a government.
*  By the way not all cults are bad. Physics is a cult too. And it's sometimes bad. It's honest at least.
*  Nature is a cult. Nature is metal. Yes. Check out the Instagram. So that's really the the crux of it.
*  You have a ledger and the ledger is just all about saying hey we need to put some stuff in here and
*  once it's put in here you can't turn it back and you know when it was put in and everybody can see
*  it or some group can see it and then you need to pick somebody to modify that. So all this chaos
*  will happen. All these transactions are all around the world and our perception of them are different.
*  There's a beautiful paper from Lamport that kind of talks about this from the 70s. It's like one of
*  the most classic papers ever in computer science. I think it's been cited like 50,000 times or
*  something like that. It's a crazy paper. But basically you have to figure out okay well somebody
*  has to be in charge. Some group has to be in charge. You can do it with a meritocratic,
*  hashocratic computation thing. You can say well if you have coins 25% of supply, 25% of the time on
*  average you'll be selected to have the right to do this or give it to somebody else or you can
*  search for other resources. They can even be human resources like some notion of merit or social
*  benefit. Maybe you get a token for that and you can weight it with these other systems. And that's
*  where kind of where everything's going. We're getting to a point where we've really optimized
*  all the properties here. We've proven all these nice things about it and there's a lot of competition
*  to basically build the perfect proof of stake system whether you're Polkadot or Algorand or
*  any of these other guys. But now the next step is say well why don't we just have one? We should
*  have multiple resources and the point is each of these has different trade-off profiles and so they
*  balance each other and you end up building a much more resilient system so it's not winner take all
*  with one particular demand. Okay so there's a million questions that spring up right there
*  but first linger on this topic and say what is proof of work? What is proof of stake? Just zooming
*  in on each of those and what are the differences? Okay so they all have the same three properties of
*  pick someone in charge, do something, and validate it. The difference is that the picking mechanism
*  for proof of work is you have to solve a puzzle. So it's basically like buying lottery tickets and
*  you can buy a certain amount every second with your computing devices and some of them are ASIC
*  resistance. You run them on like a laptop or a GPU and some of them are you specialized hardware
*  that you have to either manufacture or buy from someone who sells it to you and that's just how
*  many tickets per second you can get and eventually you hit those magic numbers and when you do it
*  means you have the right to make the block and generally you bundle the block making with the
*  proof of work system. Now you can do this looking for a single or you can do this to actually shard
*  it and look for multiple block makers at the same time. So there are sharded proof of work
*  protocols like prism is an example of that and actually ethereum got started this way with
*  specter and ghost and phantom the obvious of these o'hars work and you know Tom some lapinski but the
*  basic idea is you pick some collection of people they make some collection of things and there's
*  some way to sort it all out serialize it and prevent double spends. Great proof of stake is
*  the same but it's a synthetic resource so instead of doing things they say well if you had 25% of
*  the hash power on average over a long period of time you'd probably win 25% of the time. Well why
*  don't we just introduce some randomness in from some source and then 25% of the time on average
*  over a long period of time you'll win so it's a synthetic resource but you still have to do the
*  other two things you still have to make the block and you still have to validate the block.
*  The big difference is this step in the proof of work world is horrendously expensive you use more
*  energy than the nation of Switzerland and the problem with that is that you have less resources
*  for the other two and the other problem with that is that if this is horrendously expensive you have
*  an economy of scale kick-hat so what ends up happening is the system becomes less decentralized
*  over time because you have these vertically integrated operations I mean not everybody can
*  go build a mining facility on a volcano in El Salvador not everybody can go to Mongolia and
*  set up a five gigawatt power plant and a huge data thing not everybody has access to the patented
*  ASICs that people produce because what if I don't sell it to you and I have the patent on it or what
*  if I control the supply chain for these things so you'll end up having centralization around maybe
*  10 or five major operations as we've seen historically with proof of work and that means
*  you end up having like a ruling class of a mining oligarchy in the system proof of stake if you
*  design the parameters correctly you actually get more decentralized over time because as the
*  currency goes up in value the distribution of the currency tends to get more more egalitarian
*  for example Bill Gates when he started Microsoft he has 64 percent of the shares now he has less
*  than five percent of the shares so this founder drift over time as the value goes up divestment
*  occurs you have more and more and more people coming in that means there's more people who can
*  participate in the consensus you can even tune economic parameters and this is what we did with
*  Cardano and Ouroboros we we created this concept of k in the system and it's just a parameter and
*  it's it's like a forcing factor that tends to accumulate a certain amount of stake pool so
*  you can set it to 200 and then 500 and a thousand and so forth but the basic idea is as the price
*  of ADA goes up you make a larger and then you end up in practical terms having a larger and larger
*  set of actors making blocks that are unique and distinct and the other good thing is this is a
*  virtual resource instead of a physical resource which means it's portable by the click of a button
*  so let's say China says mining is bad we're going to shut it all down it looks like they're moving
*  in that direction you have all these people in WeChat just like trying to sell miners or trying
*  to figure out how the hell do I move miners you know because they have these huge data centers
*  they've constructed you can't exactly go and grab a server and like take it with you it's huge it's
*  a lot of work and if the government sees it well it's their property now a virtual resource you can
*  click a button and redeploy it to a different jurisdiction so to me for a virtual asset it
*  makes a lot more sense to try to tie your security to something endogenous something within the system
*  because it's it's just like the asset it can move anywhere at a click of a button
*  and human beings have a much harder time attacking something like that well so people
*  maybe you could sort of play devil's advocate and say what is the strength of proof of work system
*  because some people would argue that proof of work has because it's outside the system
*  it's tied to physical resources it's more secure it's less prone to to attack by large groups of
*  people yeah it's a great question and the first question we had was could proof of stake actually
*  work or not so the problem was that the engineers kind of led when the science should have led and
*  so there were all these pos protocols that came out in the early 2010s like pure coin was the
*  first and then nxt and others came out and there they had suffered from things like the random
*  number generation wasn't good they had grinding attacks and nothing at stake and all these other
*  things and there's a lot of beautiful properties for proof of work from a theoretical sense we
*  even wrote a paper called gkl named after the authors juan gray nico leonardis and agalus
*  gasses our chief scientist it's got 1100 citations now and it's you know it was published in 2015
*  but basically all it did is just model the blockchain and created some security properties
*  for it and then it started talking about well what does proof of work actually do for you
*  and it turns out it does a lot it's an asynchronous system you can bootstrap from genesis so if eve
*  joins the network and wall-e joins the network and daisy join the network then you give them
*  some different chains like five or ten different chains they can run a calculation and they will
*  always pick the longest chain the heaviest chain inside the system that's a great property of proof
*  of work until we published orborous genesis in 2018 you actually needed to solve that and proof
*  of stake with a trusted checkpoint so some actor had to be observing watching the whole thing and
*  creating checkpoints and then when new people joined in they would only be able to distinguish
*  between a chain based upon a checkpoint telling them that so you have to do a lot of really
*  wonky crazy math to show and create this notion of like density to be able to show that that's
*  possible but there's a lot of properties of proof of work that were super hard to replicate and
*  emulate in the proof of stake world uh mccauley kind of revolutionized the whole vrfs thing
*  there was a group out of cornell that talked about better network conditions they wrote a paper
*  called sleepy we did genesis we also did the very first proofably secure protocol but that was six
*  years of work and like 12 papers and it's still not done there's still a few polishing things that
*  have to be cleaned up because you know it's this is a physical resource and there's there's something
*  there but there's a flaw to proof of work that is a little problematic it's a winner-take-all type
*  of a system so maximalism is kind of philosophically and computationally built into it let's say you
*  have two proof of work systems and they have roughly the same market cap and hash rate and
*  they use the same algorithm then the problem is if the miner comes in and let's say the miner has
*  enough resources to have 51 percent for any of these chains they actually have a perverse incentive
*  to come and destroy one chain and short sell the asset it's called a gold finger attack and then go
*  mine the other asset because they're not bound to that asset they're not loyal to it and they
*  can make just as much profit mining this as they can make mining the other system and the markets
*  allow them to profit from the destruction of a system so that's something that proof of stake
*  doesn't suffer from because the only way you can participate in a proof of stake system is you have
*  to actually own equity and you have to have ownership in that system so if you go and destroy
*  daisies chain they it would just be a net loss for the most part unless you have really messed up
*  markets or something like that so there's always trade-offs and all these things and this is why
*  i like this concept of going one to n and having multiple resources because why not have proof of
*  work and proof of stake together if the proof of work is useful not wasted computation and why not
*  add other things like create incentives for network relay right now there's no incentives in the
*  system for you to run peer-to-peer nodes and share data right now it's not a problem but if you're
*  running like amazon web services level of bandwidth it could cost you like five thousand dollars a
*  month in bandwidth just to run a full node or something like that no one would do it so then
*  your system will centralize along the weakest link whether it be the storage layer the computation
*  layer or the network layer of the system so if you can incentivize the resources differently
*  then you'll be in a beautiful position where you you end up having a resilient system that pays
*  its own bills so how does cardano solve the consensus problem do you tend to eventually
*  wanting to solve it in the hybrid approach of proof of stake and proof of work yeah this was
*  a philosophical difference between vitalik and myself you know the problem with the people in
*  the ether is really bright and these really bright people what they do is they try to do everything
*  all at once because they're really really smart and they keep going until they run up against the
*  wall and they realize the problem is a lot harder if you're more experienced and that's why we brought
*  in proper academics like agalus and others because they've been beaten up through life you know
*  agalus worked with david chom and these other there's really hard work with those guys and
*  they'd already been humiliated and yelled at had chalk thrown at them and all that stuff and so
*  they were humble enough to say i'm not smart enough to solve the big problem so don't even try what
*  you do is you decompose it and you say okay what's the first problem to solve in a chain of problems
*  that you can compose your way up to a working system and once you get far enough along you
*  have something that's pretty good and then you have an obvious path forward of how do you iterate
*  and improve that system that's why we started with gkl 15 because it was just saying we don't know
*  what a fucking blockchain is this is what is this thing right what's the security properties this
*  stuff like what what did we really mean then we did orboros classic the original orboros protocol
*  in 2017 and that protocol was like a synchronous system and it assumed the nodes were always on
*  it worked but it was useless because that's not real life then prowess came out and then suddenly
*  we relaxed things these are all by the way names for consensus algorithms yeah we have papers that
*  we published and they're all peer reviewed like gkl was euro crypt that's a very hard conference
*  to get into and orboros classic was crypto and prowess was euro crypt and genesis was ccs so
*  basically every step of the way was first an academic validation that there was some merit
*  to the work that was done second it solved a particular class of problems either showing the
*  feasibility of the entire problem because when i said let's do the model first because let's see
*  if we can do an flp thing let's see if we can get a possibility theorem that's great because you're
*  done it's like you know those those short math papers were like i found a counter example it's
*  like oh okay this whole thing has fallen apart because you you have a two-line proof thank you
*  so that's what we were looking for in the beginning of the agenda was let's either prove it's possible
*  in a straw man case or show that there exists an impossibility result in which case we can just
*  abandon the entire inquiry proof of stake is impossible and then once you've gotten past
*  that threshold it goes from theory to practicality what actual network conditions are you looking at
*  are you okay with living with an external clock or do you want to build time from within how are
*  you generating random numbers etc etc and every step of the way each paper you're solving one
*  particular class of problems with prism it said probably shouldn't know ahead of time who eve is
*  you know you probably shouldn't know who's making those blocks that should be something you know
*  after the fact but if you know ahead of time you can attack them you can dedos them you cause all
*  kinds of problems okay so you know adaptive security also we move from an mpc random number
*  generation which was great but very heavy and very slow and you can't scale to large amounts of people
*  to a vrf based system which is super fast but a little dirtier because al gran actually did some
*  great work there there was some good knowledge there what are the really hard problems that you
*  maybe if you just linger on a little bit what are some of the really hard problems you have to solve
*  along this chain of papers ideas the evolution of the consensus algorithm yeah it's not only are
*  they really hard problems they actually require different cryptographers because you're moving from
*  mathematician style cryptographers like the neil colblitz's and the adi shamir's and the people
*  that like start as proper mathematicians they really love theory and that's their thing and
*  the proofs are dense and they're thick and they're beautiful to practical applied work where you're
*  saying okay now this is something an engineer can look at and say i know how to build that
*  i know how to think about that so that transition from gkl to or of course classic to prowse
*  the the i'd say the biggest leap was classic to prowse because that was going from a system that
*  would only work in a consortium chain like fabric to a system that would actually work and is working
*  that's what's implementing cardano today you know 50 billion dollar cryptocurrency and all these people
*  that was a huge leap but that paper alone wasn't enough we also had to layer on the economic model
*  because we said well hang on a second here not everybody's going to be online all the time to
*  be available to make a block so you need some notion of delegation the many have notion of
*  delegation you have these stake pools what the hell does that mean and so this is a beautiful
*  kind of interdisciplinary notion that layers computer science and biology together
*  and minute that complexity starts going up you start seeing cell specialization
*  so you go from single cell organisms to organisms where you you know have eyeballs and brains and
*  hearts and each of these tissues do different things well analogously complex distributed
*  systems start getting specialization you move from the single cell thing bitcoin where everything's
*  a full node they all have the same rights and responsibilities a lot of homogeneity in that
*  system but you're only as good as your weakest link you're only as you're only as capable as
*  whatever the basic cell can do to a specialized system where you start having these actors in the
*  system that are actually a little different than the other actors so you introduce this concept of
*  the stake pool and suddenly now you have this actor where you're probably going to be online
*  24 7 you're probably going to have extra relay infrastructure there's a a trust relationship
*  where you don't own the ada but you have a right to use it for something and a person's made that
*  choice to endow you with that the minute that you introduce specialization though the system gets
*  more complicated the game theory gets more complicated and then you start having to think
*  really deeply and carefully about okay well can this now introduce a new attack vector that we
*  didn't have before so that leap from classic to prowse and adding in stake pools and figuring out
*  how to handle the game theory there was exceedingly hard it took two years to do that so stake pools
*  allows for multiple parties to delegate their staking capabilities to others can you describe
*  a little bit how this works oh it's kind of fascinating it's a super simple concept so you
*  register a pool and then the pool is there and they're basically they advertise and they're
*  actually registered on chain with a certificate and then in the wallet software itself you can see
*  all of the pools that have registered there's over 3 000 of them now inside the system and then you
*  can click a little tile and it shows you all the metadata that's in the certificate and says hey
*  you know i have my own pool it's called rats you know i'm king of the rats so you can see all the
*  stuff that's described there and pools have an operating fee because they're like a business
*  and they say well if you delegate to me i'll charge this much so if you get like a hundred
*  bucks in rewards i'll give you 90 and i'll take 10 or something like that and then you make your
*  decision and whichever one you select you click you know delegate push the button and then you
*  have now given your staking rights to them until revoked okay so it lives there and then the stake
*  pools weight in the system is proportional to the amount of stake that they have delegated to them
*  and then we have this other limiting factor k which says that you get diminishing returns with
*  the more stake you have so it's kind of like an s function so you kind of go up and up and then
*  eventually caps and then at some point you get no rewards beyond a certain threshold so there's an
*  incentive to split pools to different owners after some point yeah and so so that's a complex thing
*  and you have to actually model the game theory out to understand where those parameters should be set
*  and we didn't know how to do that so what we did is we we bought talent we went to oxford and we
*  hired this guy named alias casupis he's an algorithmic game theorist we said hey would you
*  like to do some game theory work in crypto and he's like that sounds fun so he spent a year and a
*  half we built all these beautiful models and we kind of figured out what those curves needed to
*  look like figure out like the s curve that would result in a nice distribution exactly of responsibility
*  so not everybody delegates to the king of the rats exactly how does it feel to be royalty by the way
*  it's not a very impressive kingdom but you're nevertheless a king i'll take it because i think
*  it's the kindest thing people call me in this space oh yeah people love you so okay so that
*  i mean so is that would you say a solved problem the game theory of stake pools no it's um the
*  starting and i was getting back to my original point is that you build things in iterations
*  every step if you've done it right is an invitation for 10 more sexy fascinating fun problems and this
*  is why we have such a great time building labs you know we started in enborough now we're at tokyo
*  tech and university of wyoming and athens and we're setting up more labs this year and all these
*  academics want to work with us a because we write a lot of really fascinating papers but b because
*  we're focused on all these really cool sexy interdisciplinary problems we're actually running
*  the problems where we don't even know where to publish the paper because you'll have this paper
*  where there's like these pl guys working with crypto guys working with systems guys working
*  with economists and you put all together and you have this frankenstein paper monster and we're
*  like where do we submit this you know where does this go nature yeah there we go nature or quanta
*  or something i don't know it'll write a nice so the the sexy problems multiply exponentially
*  exactly and you know and we've now gotten to a point where we're starting to work on
*  refinements to the system rather than fundamental things that are like if you don't solve it the
*  system just simply doesn't work for example you can run all this with ntp as your clock server
*  but you actually can create a notion of time within we wrote a paper called the world war's
*  chronos for that okay but that's not necessary for the system it's just a nice to have thing
*  it's a nice property optimization the random number generation is another example of that
*  you can run it with a heavier thing you just have more blockchain bloat and slower time and transition
*  we have this concept in an epic so you elect leaders to run the system every five days with
*  cardano but there's been derivative work we didn't even do this this work occurred at university of
*  illinois and that derivative work said well you don't actually need to do that you can do it on
*  a block by block basis it's like oh that's pretty cool so that's the other point about doing things
*  in a very rigorous way is that that way is creates a lingua franca for what you're trying to solve
*  with the totality of the academic community so suddenly people that you've never met you know
*  nothing about have read your papers cited your papers and start writing their own papers either
*  to try to attack and destroy things you've done or to build on top of the things that you've done so
*  people are trying to figure out ways to attack this exactly rigorous as as rigorous as you are
*  trying to and i don't have to pay them that's the beautiful thing it's fun yeah it's fun to try to
*  destroy and that's how we grow stronger and that's how you build your career too there's there's
*  plenty of people that they've gotten tenure just kicking the hell out of intel sgx you go to ccs
*  every year there's some guy there and he's having a hell of a time making intel cry
*  can we pull back historically speaking and in terms of the big picture of cryptocurrency real
*  quick and ask the question what is cardano we started talking about already the consensus
*  algorithm of cardano takes but maybe when you look at the history books you know sort of
*  uh hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and cardano have one sentence uh what's that one sentence
*  going to be and in general what's like division in the context of the history of cryptocurrency
*  you have like this whiteboard overview video that you talk about the three generations of
*  cryptocurrency where cardano is the third so that's a like five different questions way of
*  asking the exact same thing you can answer however the hell you want you know car i always term
*  cardano as like a fos a financial operating system and nobody likes it and everybody picks on me for
*  using that term but basically the idea is that you know the world runs on systems especially the
*  financial world you have you know the bis and swift and all this other stuff and these protocols
*  allow you to move value around and represent things like identity and uh and allow you to
*  express yourself in some way and those protocols for the most part work well for people in rich
*  countries and they don't work so well for people who aren't in rich countries and so the point of
*  what we do or at least what i do and what my company does is we think a lot about how do we
*  build a universal protocol that does all the stuff the legacy system has but just does it better
*  faster and cheaper for all everybody in the world and everybody has equal access to it you know so
*  it's the people's protocol you know you have a situation where the guy in senegal has the same
*  access that i do or pill gates does or someone else who's kind of higher on the the spectrum of
*  wealth and power and so uh that is what we seek to achieve but then the question is well is cardano
*  the solution you know is it that is that that thing and the answer is no because you need a lot
*  more evolution you need decades of evolution to kind of work your way there and in many ways the
*  work is never quite done but it's better than what came before why because you you have a
*  realization that first the control of the system needs to be more balanced and nuanced and it needs
*  to be more democratic so there's this sustainability component of what who's in charge and how do you pay
*  for things well the system can print its own money so it always has the ability to have a budget okay
*  so there's a treasury idea and then there's a voting thing well the same things that allow you
*  to move money around allow you to represent votes so you can do e-voting with the type of system okay
*  and you know if you played nomic in the 1980s or peter superfan or any of these things you can build
*  a self-evolving system you can actually create a game where the rules can be voted on and changed
*  in the game itself great okay so that exists there and then you say okay well but this thing
*  still has to touch the legacy world there has to be cash in and cash out and these types of things
*  so this is this interoperability thing that you need a wi-fi or a bluetooth moment for the industry
*  because nothing understands each other right now there are all these chains are blind deaf and dumb
*  to each other and then there's this thing that it has to work on a huge scale like billions of people
*  and we've done that but we've done that with large multinational trillion dollar companies with
*  centralized infrastructure we've never really done that with one master protocol that somehow does it
*  for everyone the closest approximation is probably bit torrent and there's you know there was it's a
*  cool protocol but it doesn't have all the umph necessary to necessary to do something like this
*  so cardano is just our first approximation and like any good system it's we wanted it to be
*  self-evolving so once you get the philosophy out of where's the target of what do you want to do
*  then you build a community now it's over a million people strong and that community keeps growing
*  and they keep pushing the system in that particular direction and what's nice about is
*  if you build the right philosophy within the system it doesn't need founders this is the great
*  leitian of satoshi it doesn't need founders to be able to get there so uh you know if you look at the
*  academic side that's very decentralized we have more than 30 different contributors for the 105
*  papers and that set keeps growing within the next five years it'll probably be two three four hundred
*  different scientists from all across the world some from russia and some from india some from
*  china and some from japan and america and africa and south america and the faces change the
*  languages change the cultures change but the process stays the same and that is a permanent
*  organ within what we have constructed as a system it's the same situation entering marketplaces like
*  we entered ethiopia what are we doing there we have five million people in ethiopia we're getting
*  them digital identity and we're dragging that digital identity into the system because that's
*  the most fundamental thing of a financial operating system you need to know who people are in order to
*  be able to do business with them give them credit be able to give them economic agency and stuff
*  the thing but once they're there they're going to grow up with that system they're going to
*  deploy applications on that system they're going to build on that system or use it every day for
*  getting a loan or payments and so forth and if they have pain points what they're going to do is
*  evolve that system to be able to mitigate manage those particular pain points to a point where the
*  system is competitive for it so my job is to be we have this tagline in our company cascading
*  disruption our my job is to be the first domino just kind of knock it over and watch the cascade
*  and it kind of blows and blows and blows up until eventually you know it gets to where we need to go
*  and what i was trying to think about with cardano was how do you build the minimum viable set of
*  tools and social processes that once we push the domino the system will just evolve to a point
*  where eventually it can grow to fill that need not out of charity but out of self-interest people
*  want things better faster cheaper you know people want to have economic agency especially when they
*  lack it nobody wants to grow up in a world where they're unbanked and they have no access to
*  marketplaces they're going to seek it look at mpasa it's the great example of that like cell
*  phone and it's they're using as a currency so that's where we're at and i say a few more years
*  i think we'll have that that right minimum viable set of dynamics inside the system and then it's
*  inevitable in my view that it'll kind of grow and consume and become this concept and what's really
*  cool is there's competition in the systems and concepts so china is trying to do the same thing
*  they're saying how do we de-dollarize the world and create a digital yuan so they have a very top
*  down notion of how to apply this technology and bring it in and they even have an identity system
*  they're building in parallel called social credit we have an identity system a tala prism that
*  we're putting in ours is bottom up and you own your own identity social credit you have no idea
*  you just have a number and some computer's given it to you but they're both trying to do the exact
*  same thing and it's going to be this clash of cultures at some point between the open fossas
*  and the top down authoritarian fossas and probably some hegelian dialectic actions will create you
*  know some sort of somewhat close somewhat authoritarian libertarian utopia yeah and i
*  most likely would be ai's battling in the space of fossas so i really like this idea financial
*  operating system but what this the letter f so financial is this just um a basic mechanism
*  with which you can have social interaction therefore therefore or all kinds of interactions
*  therefore have an identity like is f essential to this yeah because that's how people care you need
*  resources to survive and you know finances is kind of like this field of of managing your resources
*  in an intelligent way and you could call it sofi too social finance you know the the the
*  nomenclature hasn't exactly been settled for our industry and that's fun but basically the concept
*  is that you you you have something and you want to be able to store it transform it trade it and
*  use it to survive and the question is what rails do you do that on do you do those on centralized
*  controlled rails where there are these third parties that are you know basically able to to
*  live off those things become very fat and epitistic or do you want to do it on rails where there's no
*  middleman you have a direct relationship with whoever you're doing business and if you invite
*  more people into the transaction they're middlemen of value not necessity and that's really the i
*  would like to say the res and detra of our space that the reason we exist is to try to figure out
*  a way to kill the middleman and try to figure out a way that we can better quantify value and
*  transform it move it manipulate it and in many ways we've actually discovered some amazing things
*  in the last 10 years as an industry like we've kind of created the financial stem cell this idea
*  of a token can now is just as well be a national currency as a cbdc as it can represent a crypto
*  kitty you know the same architecture can do stuff at the nation scale can do stuff for a 12 year
*  old kid in texas it's pretty amazing to see that
*  but sort of in that whiteboard presentation you gave these three phases and you're kind of implying
*  that there'll be n phases to this whole evolution and cardano is just like the cutting edge but if
*  you look back to uh to bitcoin how would you compare cardano versus bitcoin sort of where we
*  are how we started and how it's going okay so what i did in that video and i've done in a lot
*  of media interviews because i think it really helps people understand where we're at in the clock
*  is is face things in terms of generations and so i said well the first generation is bitcoin and
*  really the problem bitcoin was trying to solve is saying every time we want to represent or move
*  value we need some sort of trusted third party to facilitate that so can we build some sort of system
*  where we can create some notion of value that can be teleported around the world and it doesn't
*  require a trusted third party that's it and it's done in a beautiful way because it didn't try to
*  be anything else it just was you only have bitcoin you can only do one type of thing you can only
*  push it you can do some things on the encumbrances of like you know multi-sig and other things but
*  that's a one-trick pony as a system and it wasn't really clear if that was going to work or not for
*  a long time it took several years to build up enough network effect and for bitcoins to actually
*  become valuable then i'd say the the inflection point was 2013 and at that point it became a
*  billion dollar market cap there were like silicon valley startups real exchanges were forming and it
*  got to a point where there was legitimacy behind the concept and people started getting this is a
*  really incredible idea because i can evade capital controls with it i can like move 10 billion dollars
*  of something from one country to another country in five minutes it's like i could never do that
*  before and you know some this is incredible okay the problem is the minute that people validate the
*  idea they they immediately want something they don't have so like the minute elan can land a
*  rocket you know there's the next big thing right you've landed the the falcon 9 now you're on the
*  starship similarly you say okay i want programmability with this thing it's kind of like when javascript
*  came to the web browser you went from these static perhaps pretty but ultimately static
*  non-interactive pages to youtube and google and facebook and these amazing rich incredible experiences
*  because now you can actually interact with the user you can program things stuff runs on their
*  side stuff runs on your side it's a beautiful two-way relationship so that's what ethereum
*  effectively did they bolted a programming language onto a blockchain and they went from a certain
*  use case to whatever your imagination can have you know like sunshine and rainbows and unicorns
*  and these types of things so what you're saying is bitcoin is html and ethereum is javascript
*  basically yeah it was like when javascript came and with like javascript it has all kinds of
*  problems and issues i wonder who's flash in this analogy well that's metaphor but let's not well
*  actually there were plenty of active x's and flashes nxt was an example of a fail to start
*  and bitshares was another example there were a lot of people who tried to add some notion of
*  programmability and or a different view of how these things should be done and they they were
*  not as competitive ethereum kind of came out at that javascript moment okay the minute you have
*  that then suddenly you have ico's and defy and stos and nfts and all these word salads of things
*  and then people start using to get frustrated why because it's too slow it's too expensive
*  it doesn't talk to the things they wanted to talk to and also it gets too big to manage itself when
*  you're small you have founders and you know foundations and you have trusted actors and core
*  developers and you can feed them with pizzas you know them you can meet them you can shake
*  their hands at conferences when you're a multi-billion person system you know you're too large to be able
*  to do that you know for example we had the shelly summit last year we invited vince serf to come to
*  the summit that's a brilliant guy and he's he created the internet with bob and the rest of
*  the gang and you know back in those days it was such a simple small system that you know one of
*  their students they said hey you need to test it you created a video game just to kind of test
*  the thing you could call the guy on the other side and say are you seeing this are you getting the
*  signal they used to have a actual address book for email addresses yeah so you'd open up the
*  books and look it up and now look at the internet it's like who's in charge of that it's this
*  gargantuan uh you know network and there's no group of people you can bring in and thus the
*  internet evolves very slowly you see and so that's the problem is that you have this situation where
*  you want to do lots of utility you want to do a lot of things you want to be a financial operating
*  system and you know be everything to everyone but then your rate of evolution slows down as
*  your rate of adoption speeds up so the so that's one of the other design goals of the third
*  generation it's not good enough just to do things better faster cheaper and have consistent cost
*  with your population growing or talk to everything your wi-fi moment you also need a system that can
*  govern itself at a scale of millions to billions of people who have divergent interests some cases
*  ice pick an eye divergent interest they really hate each other and they uh they don't get along
*  and so that's what we termed a third generation cryptocurrency and there's a lot of people
*  attempting to compete in that space you know there's tasos and algran icp and polkadot and so forth
*  and each and every one of them kind of brings a different blend of things that they value so is it
*  it's not completely equal between scalability interoperability and sustainability some people
*  were very focused on high throughput lots of transactions perspective other people very
*  focused on governance like tasos is is like the governance chain and they were one of the first
*  to do a self-amending ledger and other people are like aeon or polkadot they're really thinking
*  carefully about how do we build a nice interoperable ecosystem with cardinal we try to actually tackle
*  all three at the same time which was one of the reasons why we were a little slower out of the
*  gate we had to write a lot more protocols but we think we've kind of come up with a beautiful
*  interlocking design for all of them and again the point is not to get it perfect but rather get those
*  just right set of evolutionary factors that when you click the domino it just self evolves into
*  what you need it to get to allow me to stretch the metaphor farther if bitcoin is html there's html
*  five if ethereum is javascript javascript with v8 has become quite fast quite you know it runs
*  much of the internet so the the argument could be that eventually everything will be javascript
*  or maybe you could say eventually everything will be html and it's just be a bunch of different
*  tools that generate that html so is it possible that just like we're so we eventually return to
*  generation one bitcoin or we return to generation two ethereum as we you know at the end of this
*  journey you know the problem is your tail is wagging the dog there and it's not you have a
*  situation where you're so focused on the technology that you're failing to to understand that there's
*  still daisy here you still have the user and where's the app store where's the one click install
*  where's the use and utility you know all these layer two protocols and these defi applications
*  in five years they're completely protocol and blockchain agnostic because at the end of the
*  day they care about liquidity operating cost and user experience it's so a preposterous and absurd
*  for somebody to say oh well i'm going to go build my application get on the you know the apple store
*  and i am going to use amazon as my web host and no matter what happens i will always use amazon even
*  if the operating cost is crazy i see you see and so we're just in a unique period of history where
*  there's a network effect around some initial infrastructure and people tend to be building
*  around that but every single one of the the top d5 providers are if they're getting successful
*  into a certain network effect they're having the multi-chain conversation so i don't really believe
*  in a winner takes all maximalist view of well there's going to be some protocol that becomes
*  the god protocol first because they evolve too quickly second the incentives aren't aligned for
*  that tcpip didn't have a token connected to it there was no financial incentive where if tcpip
*  got adopted over something else they'd make some big company crazy amounts of money it's a useful
*  piece of infrastructure so i i think that the third generation is going to be as defined by
*  the social components and the usability components as it is by the technological capabilities of the
*  system really what these technological capabilities gave you was the ability to demonstrate a proof
*  of concept and say these things are possible kind of like xerox park you know when steve and bill
*  came in they said wow you have networked computers object-oriented programming and a gooey
*  and this is like what was it 70s it's like wow it's like incredible but none of that was an
*  actual product that wasn't a macintosh but it was enough to get the idea and then it was a race to
*  how do we productize something like that in that case it actually took several decades to roll out
*  that vision that those guys had and i think that's what bitcoin and ethereum did but what's unique
*  about this is normally you throw away the prior experiments with these things these are self-evolving
*  systems so it's entirely possible to you know joe rogan quote to evolve bitcoin to a point where
*  it could become a third generation system if desired as some amalgamation of layer one and
*  layer two protocols and it's the same for ethereum in fact phatolog is throwing away ethereum and
*  replacing with ethereum too because he recognizes he needs to upgrade and evolve the system and
*  and that's what makes it fun because the techniques and methodologies that they've
*  chosen to evolve and upgrade this system are distinctly different from the ones that we've
*  chosen and we have no idea which one's actually going to win but we learn from each other and we
*  co-evolve from each other so you're running like all these experiments in real time in a giant
*  marketplace and maybe they'll consolidate maybe they'll stay divergent i mean look at big tech
*  you have google apple microsoft facebook they all coexist and they're trillion dollar companies
*  some cases with tcp it consolidates to one standard that's what we end up using so what's
*  your intuition with cardano having the proof of stake and then eventually smart contracts versus
*  the bitcoin with layer two technologies this kind of evolving creature again you said you can't
*  really predict the future but what's your intuition why one might be more successful than the other
*  so the problem with bitcoin is it is so slow it's like the mainframe programming of of the past and
*  it's the only reason it's still around is because there was so much invested in keeping it around
*  that you know you just kind of have to leave it there and one day cobalt will die you know it's
*  it's a it's it's there's nothing about it from a collection of usps that's particularly desirable
*  you have extremely long settlement time you have extremely low programmability it is not aware of
*  any other system there's no native way of issuing an asset in that system you can't even do a pull
*  transaction i mean you can't do anything that's interesting or unique there and yeah all do respect
*  it's you know mafia i'll do respect home you got some problems you come to me on the day of my
*  daughter's wedding i know i know so you know i'll do respect to the bitcoin people it's like an
*  amazing incredible first generation thing and it really we're all here because of bitcoin but the
*  problem is you have to upgrade the damn thing you know just because you were a high school
*  football star doesn't mean that 30 years later you're still a high school football star in the
*  same shape you've got the beer belly you're old you're not doing this thing again that's what
*  bitcoin has to do there's fundamental improvements that i think bitcoin can make at the protocol
*  level that would actually make it an incredibly competitive system like if they wanted to keep
*  nakamoto consensus proof of work there's ways to enhance proof of work i mean mingan sear did this
*  with bitcoin ng promoter aswanis did this with prism make it 10 000 times faster and you don't
*  compromise the fundamental security assumptions that the system has you can add programmability
*  to it blockstream created a language called simplicity is so there's there's actual ways
*  to extend and we did this with cardona with the extended utxl model there's ways to extend
*  what bitcoin has keep the philosophy the accounting the way of thinking about transactions
*  but then suddenly you can now do defy and other things but what they've done is said we will not
*  evolve the base layer at all and we're just going to build all this layer two stuff which is usually
*  highly fragile and centralized and requires enormous effort at the base level to do anything
*  there's it's not a coincidence fatalik started as a color coins guy and a master coin guy
*  hanging out in those circles he was trying to innovate and do things in bitcoin and it was so
*  hard and difficult that he started diverging and going and doing things in a different system
*  entirely you know i knew the master coin guys chair on the all these people they were maximalists
*  they really wanted to build something cool and exciting for bitcoin and anything they did the
*  developers would attack them it's all you're you're misusing op return you're doing this that it was a
*  holy war anytime you wanted to evolve so i think it's its own worst enemy it has the network effect
*  it has the brand name it has the regulatory approval but there's no way to change the system
*  even correcting obvious downsides in that system now what's really cool is ethereum doesn't suffer
*  from that problem it is it's getting to a point where it has a similar network effect to bitcoin
*  but the community there is is completely different in culture they love evolving they love upgrading
*  sometimes a little too much and so that means that if you look at the trajectory of things if i had
*  to bet just those two systems bitcoin or ethereum i would say nine times out of ten ethereum is going
*  to win the fight against bitcoin if it was the only competitor well obviously we're here and a
*  lot of other people are here so there's different things going on so it's a much more complex game
*  but you i think that's always a key you know zooming out a little bit you know it set the
*  technology aside and the word salad of cryptography aside because it's too much we have to always do is
*  say what incentive does the system have to evolve and when you look at things like android and the
*  app store and these analogous platforms you say ah the evolution is user-driven and there's a
*  financial incentive for the user to participate so if i had to look at the trajectory of this thing
*  come back 10 years later it's probably going to have millions of applications and lots of stuff
*  going on because that's the way the system was constructed okay it makes sense when you look at
*  bitcoin you say what is the incentive to evolve the system there's none what is the incentive for
*  the system to to get more competitive it's not in fact it's the opposite they've turned it into a
*  religion i i was in miami at this this bitcoin conference there i had a toilet paper roll thrown
*  at me that had shit coin written on it you have max kaiser out on the stage you know doing his
*  best rick james impression you know we'll see the guy that did the f elon yes yes yes you know and
*  and so you're watching this stuff and you say okay first why would anybody want to join that
*  and then second where is the conversation about how do we achieve something i started with cardano
*  the end in mind i said what you know we really want to sit down and build this financial operating
*  system and the definition of success is the poorest person in the world has access the same
*  system as the richest person in the world and they both get treated fairly we've never had that
*  happen before okay that's something you can agree with it disagree with it say it's boiling the
*  ocean it's impossible at least i have something i can't for the life of me understand what the
*  hell is the point of bitcoin when i joined the bitcoin space way back in the day it was hey we
*  hate the dollar and you know hey we like gold a lot let's create digital gold let's build a payment
*  system and then it just kind of went all these different directions and nobody can actually tell
*  you what bitcoin is for it's a store of value okay you know if there's some proof of work thing
*  where maybe you're like incentivizing that alternative energy to be pretty i don't know i
*  say nobody really knows the philosophy there's no direction and they say but don't worry just buy
*  and hold and everything will sort its way out i believe it's hodl yeah hodl what about the idea
*  of digital gold so try to replace that particular physical material that is gold and transfer into
*  the digital that's something okay let's do that then and just say that's all it does then why are
*  we doing lightning why are we doing any of these other things you don't really need with you know
*  a commodity a digital commodity high throughput you can have slow settlement you can have high
*  transaction fees all these types of things and you know that's that's fine okay that's something
*  pick it well the idea is to try to come up with technology like the lightning network that could
*  have something like gold but then still build an economy around it something with the high
*  throughput transactions and have we ever built a successful banking credit system off of gold
*  never it never works because there's too much volatility in underlying asset would you take a
*  gold denominated loan for something and somebody says all right i'll give you five bars of gold to
*  go buy this car and pay me back five and a half bars of gold nobody would know in five years where
*  they come out in that kind of arrangement the idea is that the gold is used for the settlement of
*  transactions and then you're operating the actual economy is operating outside of gold and then you
*  kind of connect back to gold so we have to go back to the gold reserve and we tried that for a long
*  time it didn't really work in a modern global economy we had the brett woods agreement all these
*  other things and and so i understand what you're saying and you maybe maybe there's some merit to
*  that but if that was really in earnest where they want to go then the conversation should be about
*  well how do we make it easy for layer two protocols to interact with bitcoin so why is simplicity not
*  built into it why is it taking so long to do snore sags why is it taking so long to do all
*  these obvious upgrades which are cryptographically low danger also nipa pals non-interactive proofs
*  of proof of work there's no cost to doing that it's just a property of proof of work where
*  certain puzzles are more special than other puzzles and by noticing that you can create
*  these beautiful proofs that allow you to have side chains and like clients it's not compromising
*  security of the system it's just something you get for free with proof of work those came out in 2016
*  there's derivative work fly client floating around where the hell is it yeah this is the
*  frustration that i have is like if you really are serious about this whole lightning and gold
*  economy thing i love choice i'm a libertarian by nature i love competition and you know i read all
*  those books i read louis von misis's work and murray rothbard's work and i love what hayek had
*  to say about private currencies let's go try it that's great but then you have to have some
*  focus and commitment as an ecosystem and the excuse they use is well no we don't because we're
*  decentralized and then and because we're decentralized we don't need that as if there's
*  some sort of guiding swarm intelligence that will naturally push the system in that particular
*  direction but then you ask well how do people measure the success of bitcoin is it the fact
*  that they've actually achieved lots of transactions and lots of actual economic activity and lots of
*  businesses accepting that will go up it's the price that's what they do that and that's the
*  only thing they pay attention that's why this is the most attended bitcoin conference in history
*  not because somehow bitcoin got so much more adoption it's because this is the highest price
*  point bitcoin has ever been this year you know over 30 000 so first of all let me state that
*  charles for the most part is purely objective the uh the bias that comes in for the record i want to
*  say that i have heard because you mentioned the mafia that you prefer good fellows over the godfather
*  so a man who prefers good fellows over godfather you take it for that opinion for what it is
*  i actually have to think about that one for quite a bit i think oh come on joe pesci was so good
*  he's incredible i also love casino and those big glasses on the denier i love it with Sharon stone
*  but we could talk about that for hours but let me ask you about the bitcoin conference because it is
*  a kind of uh i would say an important moment in human history it was quite exciting in terms of
*  size and and uh kind of turmoil and all those kinds of things and you were there in uh what is
*  it hot and humid miami i believe that's the way you introduced it uh so what do you make of the
*  community of bitcoin uh or that particular event in human history what makes me sad is i remember
*  the old bitcoin community and i've seen what it's become and the old community was really fun like
*  the san jose conference in 2013 or subsequent conferences you know there was just a lot a lot
*  of people they had no money and they just they just really love this idea of decentralized money
*  they love this idea of decentralization in particular and you could strike up a conversation
*  with everyone there's no ego at all but what was really fun is is just you could really get
*  intimate friendships and relationship great conversations with people uh there it's kind
*  of like the early days of ai you know they all met in dartmouth and all these other places very
*  intimate there was no egos everybody was just trying to do some really cool stuff now just like
*  those early days there was an overestimate of how robust the solutions would be so we believed oh
*  yeah 10 years we're gonna rule the whole world right didn't exactly happen on the other hand
*  bitcoin grew from nothing in just 11 years to i'm in mongolia riding camels and the camel herder
*  has bitcoin and the coby desert so that's telling you that's a pretty pervasive technology if you
*  have that level of adoption that quickly when i went to miami it was unrecognizable you know
*  everything was so commercial half of the vendors at the at the conference were like watches with
*  that were cost half a million dollars and they were covered in diamonds so when you see that
*  materialism leak its way in it is first is repulsive the other thing was there was no
*  like i remember one of the first conferences i mo levin's conference in january 2014 the
*  north american bitcoin conference ironically in miami there was a bitcoin help center booth
*  dima ran it and a few of the other bitcoin ogs ran it the core developers actually came over like
*  jeff and others who were there and sat at the booth and anybody come up ask a question anything
*  you want to ask about bitcoin it's like that was the culture just help people welcome in there was
*  no help booth there there was no notion of that there were six hour lines and superstars and
*  things like that and again again it was always the same thing look how much money all these people
*  have made and the whole point of bitcoin was to redefine the notion of money redefine the notion
*  of value you know these types of things so it just i i'm no longer part of that and it made me sad
*  because i i really enjoyed being part of the how i got started was the bitcoin education project i
*  did a class on uni i gave it away for free i had 80 000 students and they would email me i got
*  5000 emails before i stopped answering them and everyone come in and ask me some question about
*  something sometimes arcane sometimes trivial and i take the time to sit down and answer the question
*  or forward the email to somebody i knew who could answer that particular type of question and there
*  were some amazing people in the early days like mike herne and gavin and others and they were just
*  super committed and they mike's case he knew satoshi he actually emailed him back and forth
*  because he was around 2009 2010 he did the bitcoin java client and satoshi was all excited he said
*  oh wow bitcoin can come to a cell phone this is really cool and exciting and then what happened
*  mike left bitcoin in 2013 over the whole big block debate that that happened they just treated him
*  like dirt like he was subhuman or something so i don't know the culture has changed a lot and
*  and it's if they like it it's good for them they can enjoy their religion but it's not for me and
*  where i like being is like i had a guy who used to work for me alex chirpanoi and he created this
*  beautiful project called ergo to me that is the spiritual successor to bitcoin ergo is really
*  special because it has the same culture it has the same mentality and the technology is kind of like
*  a natural evolution of what you would do if you knew about bitcoin and you wanted to build the
*  next big thing so it's still a proof of work system it's still a utxo system but he added
*  utxo with some smart contracts it's this sigma protocol idea on the proof of work side satoshi
*  had this one cpu one vote idea so alex tried to create non-assourceable puzzles to make it
*  impossible to have mining pools and there's all these other beautiful little things and he's just
*  he's this brilliant russian programmer and he surrounded himself with all these other brilliant
*  people he has zero ego it's like he has negative ego when you put up with a person with ego your
*  ego goes down yeah right and everything about alex is always like how do i solve this how do i do
*  that and he gets legitimately excited when he meets somebody that he can collaborate with or
*  learn from that's where bitcoin was in the beginning everybody set their egos aside whether it was
*  hal finney or whatever and they would just say how can i help what can i do and it was all about
*  coming up with some cool new thing or solving some cool new problem i don't see any of that
*  so quite a few people are excited about ergo and excited about the fact that you
*  kind of appreciate alex and ergo do you see cardano potentially utilizing the proof of work
*  mechanism from ergo as part of this uh pool for the consensus mechanism i mean anything's possible
*  and you know there's a lot of evolution ergo has to go through um and ergo was it was kind of like
*  when the sbox 360 first came out while they were prototyping it microsoft needed a development
*  environment they ironically purchased a lot of apple computers to do that because apple was
*  moving away from the power pc to intel and microsoft was moving towards the power pc just
*  this weird intersection of history so at that time the largest order of mac computers made was
*  done by microsoft and they're using it for xbox stuff so ergo we viewed the same way so we said
*  well we have this extended dtx0 model the only thing that's as sufficiently close to it where
*  we can beta test contracts is actually with ergo and alex just was a little faster in getting
*  certain things out because we were doing things in a slightly more rigorous way and slightly more
*  expressive way so we actually tested a stable coin and oracle and other things on ergo and it has
*  just incredible community they when we said hey we're coming here to work and build oh yeah we
*  love work with you guys this is so cool uh the other thing is alex used to work for us and he
*  had this lovely project called scorex and it was all about like a pedagogical framework for building
*  blockchains and if you want to do prototyping or academic research it was great it was super modular
*  and it separated the consensus network and transaction layer from each other in just the
*  right way so that you can make it modular and mix and match things so you can put secure academia
*  in or maybe a different network layer and a different consensus protocol like proof of work
*  to another proof of work and so forth so we loved having that kind of ip sitting around because it
*  gave us the ability to kind of play around with ideas in a matter of weeks instead of months or
*  years and then he just took that concept and he gave it away the wave protocol was built on it
*  that was uh sasha ivana he did that and i think there's two or three other cryptocurrencies that
*  were launched from scorex and then alex took and that and built ergo from it so there was a nice
*  intersection where there was overlapping technology with ergo with our technology and the other thing
*  was that the community was so open and friendly it was just a no-brainer just go in and start
*  building some things there now in terms of evolving ideas the whole sigma protocol idea is very
*  different and it's very interesting and there's a guy at a boston university
*  his name will come to me in a segment who uh who came up with this stuff and i think there's some
*  merit there especially as we start moving closer to this idea of blockchains being used to validate
*  proofs instead of running computation what's the sigma protocol weather so it's just a way of
*  expressing scripts and uh basically you get these concise representations of proofs and then you can
*  say okay the script is correct but you don't have to run the whole program so there's a lot i'm not
*  doing the topic justice there's a lot more to it but that that's the basic concept and in a redeemer
*  validator model you need stuff like that because as your your model gets more complex and a lot
*  more things happen it's you don't want to have a situation where i have to run replay a huge amount
*  of the utxl graph to be able to get to a point where i have the state of the system you need some
*  mathematical artifact that gives you the state of the system quickly and then you're saying okay i
*  now know how to what computation thread i need to run to be able to get enough to be able to redeem
*  this transaction so he just found a more compressed representation of it and you know
*  the math doesn't matter what matters is there's a whole beautiful field that thinks about this type
*  of stuff and it was never once linked before into our industry the brilliance of alex was to actually
*  realize you could do that and pull those things together and it may actually have some merit but
*  by no means is the only guy that does this stuff there's actually other approaches in verified
*  computing that have explored that like my favorite came out of microsoft research is a project called
*  pinocchio and there was a follow-up called chipetto and the basic idea was that it's fortuitous that
*  you know you have these computer science problems like hashing where you can you can do all this
*  computation and once you've done all of it you found this magic number that you can verify that
*  the computation was done correctly so the proof of work works this way hard to do the proof of work
*  easy to check the proof of work cryptography also works this way you have some trap door where you
*  can verify something's correct but to get that thing done you know if you're doing it brute force
*  it takes an enormous amount of computation well not all problems are like this like protein folding
*  to verify the protein is folded correctly you have to fold the protein you have to redo the work but
*  what if for arbitrary computation you could take a problem and then you could generate a proof that
*  you've done that computation correctly and the proof validates in logarithmic time or constant
*  time wow that's incredible right well microsoft actually wrote a paper on how to do that it's
*  called pinocchio so that's another example of these types of things these roll-ups of things
*  where instead of doing the computation on chain or trying to create some sort of replicated machine
*  that does all this stuff you instead just say okay only thing i'm going to use the blockchain for is
*  to check your proof but i'm going to turn it into a distributed computing problem and any person in
*  the world can do the problem on any server untrusted server even because you you don't have to trust the
*  output you trust the proof and the proof is deterministic it tells you these things so you
*  know whether you're using zero knowledge or sigma protocols or you know some other mechanism it's
*  moving you in that particular direction to turn it from a replicated to a distributed problem and
*  go from i'm doing the work to i'm checking that the work was done that's fascinating and all of
*  a sudden we're back to the p equals mp yeah uh thing where the for many very interesting problems
*  the checking is efficient uh is much more efficient than the solving right and also do you want
*  complete determinism or is it probabilistic because if you relax that requirement a little
*  bit then suddenly actually you have a broader class of things you can construct this stuff for
*  you mentioned utxo there's a paper titled the extended utxo model it writes in the introduction
*  bitcoin and ethereum hosting the two currently most valuable and popular cryptocurrencies
*  use two rather different ledger models known as the utxo model and the account model respectively
*  at the same time these two public blockchains differ strongly in the expressiveness of the smart
*  contracts that they support this is no coincidence ethereum chose the account model explicitly to
*  facilitate more expressive smart contracts on the other hand bitcoin chose utxo also for good
*  reasons including that its semantic model stays simple in a complex concurrent and distributed
*  computing environment this raises the question of whether it is possible to have expressive smart
*  contracts while keeping the semantic simplicity of the utxo model okay so what's the fuck that
*  means exactly what is utxo what is the account model and what is the idea of the extended utxo
*  model so i guess the easiest way of visualizing it is that utxo is kind of like cash register
*  accounting so you know and let's assume you don't have credit cards you just have cash and so when
*  you go and buy some milk and potatoes or whatever you go to the cashier you pull out your 20 dollar
*  bill you give it to them and let's say that comes up to 1750 they have to make change so you don't
*  tear your 20 dollar bill and cut a piece of it off and say here's part of my 20 you give them the
*  entire 20 dollar bill and then they give you something back and the things that they give you
*  back are also atomic units they don't cut those things up so that's kind of what utxo is all
*  about in a nutshell is that there's inputs and outputs your inputs that 20 and your outputs will
*  be the 1750 that goes to them and then the remaining change that goes back to you okay
*  the problem with this particular model is that the way it was implemented with bitcoin there was no
*  notion of of how do we run complex product kits complex contracts on this thing where instead of
*  just saying okay i'm just going to push value to you i want to put lots of terms and conditions
*  into the movement of that value like you only get this if i mow your lawn on tuesday or you only get
*  this if you know some event happens like the broncos win the super bowl or something like that
*  okay so you need some notion of programmability with it so a lot of people are trying to figure
*  out in the early days of bitcoin how could we improve the expressiveness of the system
*  and one of ways of doing it is you can go to a different accounting model bank style accounting
*  so in a bank ledger every time you do a withdrawal deposit you know it's a mutable system you know
*  with the cash register accounting you don't tear up the bills with the bank you can deduct or add
*  to the ledger all the time so ethereum kind of works in that bank accounting system where you
*  just you send messages you send transactions and you're going up or down and so you can trigger
*  programs the same way so what we did is we said okay if you take the utxl model and you have some
*  data to it and instead of saying it's just a digital signature but it's in a script you're
*  you can basically create something that's still the same as cash register but now you have
*  programmability and the big difference is local versus global so in the case of utxl your scripts
*  are your concerns so whatever is going on in that cash register has no bearing or impact on the other
*  cash registers but when you look at bank accounting you have to know the state of the entire banking
*  world to be able to make that work why because if that transaction is inbound that wire transfer
*  is inbound you have to know those funds are actually there that thing is actually happening
*  so when you have a global state for a program it's like you could do a lot more with it but
*  it's a lot more dangerous and so you have to build all these mechanisms to try to protect yourself
*  from it so what we did is we said okay add data add a programmability and you're kind of this nice
*  goldilocks zone between what ethereum did with an account style model and a global state system
*  and you're not as restrictive as bitcoin but you're still in a turning complete world you can still
*  run all kinds of things and then any standard mathematician they'll say okay well is it isomorphic
*  you know is there a mapping between this what type of function can can i actually take something
*  expressed in one structure and transmit it to the other structure and properties are preserved so we
*  wrote a paper it's called climatic ledgers where we actually showed that utxl extending utxl and
*  accounts are are somewhat similar and that you could map things that happen in one system to the
*  other system the properties are preserved between the two so in practice what's nice about extended
*  utxl is that you can put infrastructure on top of it to make the development experience relatively
*  similar to the development experience of what you would do with ethereum but you don't have to worry
*  about this global state so when you talk about sharding it's a lot easier to do that it's a lot
*  more conceivable to that and also you get determinism in the system so when i have a plutus smart
*  contract whatever i run locally is exactly what i expect to run in the system when you have a
*  concept of this mutable global state in the system whatever you run locally is not necessarily what
*  you're going to get when you actually push it into the system so you may misprice things and
*  the contract will fail it doesn't ever happen in the plutus world so you get a lot of advantages
*  with this particular model the downside is that it's a little bit less expressive on the boundaries
*  and a little bit harder to write certain types of software with it but again how you resolve that
*  is you kind of build higher level languages and other such things that compensate for these types
*  of things and design patterns that compensate for these types of things the other advantage that we
*  have that's really fun and exciting is that bitcoin lives in this model and there are other
*  utxl-based systems and so they're all talking about smart contracts as well and they would like to
*  continue working in the utxl model so if you're a bitcoin contract developer or other things there's
*  actually already a group of people that understand this very well and that's still a fairly large
*  part of the mind share of the entire space so there are no silver bullets and anytime you pick
*  a particular model there's an upside and a downside and there's different ways of doing things from
*  cash register accounting or bank accounting you can even do different accounting models but we felt
*  this was kind of the best first step to go into because it we started with something very familiar
*  that had a long history behind it and it maps very beautifully to functional programming principles
*  this concept of immutability and these things and you know much more strict management of state and
*  no notion of having this global concept that you have to kind of manage as you break up the system
*  now in practice what does this mean to the developer when they actually start real writing
*  an application not too much you know there's going to be a little bit of retooling and some
*  new patterns you have to learn but in practice you can still do the same thing so you can
*  implement a uniswap tile style thing in fact we even wrote that code with the plutus pioneers
*  program so you can go to youtube and watch a lecture and see how that's done you can do a stable
*  coin you can do an oracle you can do interactive contracts it's just it has to be done a little
*  differently than the way that you would do it in an account style model just like you can write an
*  application java you can write an application in haskell they both can do the same thing but the
*  code is going to look different and the kind of the canonical way of looking at things is different
*  so in terms of oracle oracle networks what are your thoughts about chainlink and external
*  off-chain data sources and everything we've been talking about now with the external
*  with the extended utxl model yeah i mean trying to do smart contracts without oracles like trying
*  to have sex with your pants on i mean it's not really fun it's not not exactly the best of things
*  the way i've been doing all these years i didn't know for any other person lex i wouldn't believe
*  you but for you um that's why i'm single this makes so much sense now okay so anyway uh you need
*  the outside world to be ejected into your system right yeah i'm trying to keep a straight face yeah
*  it's great you need the outside world to make your system useful it's like all the kinds of things
*  that you care to do with a smart contract usually involve human beings and information streams
*  aggregating and doing something so so the oracle is a super important component in practice for
*  any smart contract involving any notion of value you need to know when things have happened how
*  they happen who won who lost etc etc so first where do you get the data from so what's the
*  aggregator you know this is why we love our relationship with wolfram because if you know
*  one of the things you'll know about wolfram as you get to know the guy is he's a data pack rat
*  every email every communication every interaction he's archived somewhere like last time i talked
*  to oh yeah i have emails from you from 2012 it's like you still have those like yeah every
*  keystroke is written down it's stored somewhere so if you use wolfram alpha it's a similar acrum
*  of the way his mind thinks and so you can query the system and be like oh how many shipwrecks
*  have happened in florida between 1950 and 2000 that have resulted more than a billion dollars
*  of cargo loss and uh at least one fatality and it'll return an answer yeah i mean he has this
*  it's an incredible source of data that's computable for people who don't know wolfram alpha
*  is more than just the thing that assists you with your math homework in high school it's actually
*  this giant network of data of like weather data of location data just statistics all kinds of
*  is doing the aggregation in a way that you can query across data sets and it's exactly this kind
*  of idea it basically represents the very kind of thing you would hope to be able to query off chain
*  as part of the smart contracts right but the only downside is it's centralized you know and that's
*  that's always the achilles heel of wolfram is he tends to like proprietary things and he tends to
*  like centralizing things and mostly because he likes running the things and and then you know
*  everybody can have an opinion on that um the thing though is that the after you've done aggregation
*  there's a question of injection how do you get that data into the system and you can do that
*  in a very naive way where you can say oh i'm just going to attach a public key to it and it'll sign
*  for that data feed that injection and then somehow i'll just trust it as it is or you could try to
*  make it more complicated you could weight data feeds from different sources and have some notion
*  of truthiness or a veracity metric or something like that so chainlink is just one of many different
*  philosophies that was born out of the academy i believe ari jewel was connected to it and there's
*  some good people on that side and it has a philosophy about how do you aggregate a philosophy about how
*  do you inject and how do you create incentives so that that process over time gets more federated
*  or or more decentralized instead of centralizing around one particular setup now closely related
*  corollary to this is computation off chain so as i mentioned smart contracts are intimately
*  connected to oracle the question is how much pre-processing and state management are you going
*  to do outside of the system versus what do you do inside of the system so it's a very it's a very
*  interesting balance between these two and they were thinking about this stuff for a long time
*  there's a great paper called town crier came out way back in the day cornell and that was all about
*  using like sgx to scrape things and you know and and you can rely on trusted hardware to give you
*  good data and but you could also use those sgx cores to do contract processing because if it runs
*  in trusted hardware then it's very unlikely to be tampered with or manipulated and because of that
*  you can don't have to federate it or decentralize it you can run it on a single device as if it was
*  running on a cryptocurrency so there seems to be a desire in that community to capture more and
*  more of the smart contract stack and pull more and more of that stack into that layer two
*  infrastructure from running on layer one why because you have cost reduction and potentially
*  because your trust model collapses to whatever chain link is offering you're not gaining anything
*  by doing the computation on ethereum uh or and or another platform because you know you know it's
*  you ever watch the simpsons there was this beautiful episode where mr burns wants to turn
*  the power off in springfield that is the perfect analogy for information security so he and smithers
*  they go through this elaborate series of doors and secret passages and guard dogs and robots and
*  shit to get to the center of the power plant to turn off the power and when they arrive at the
*  center of the plant there's like this stray dog that's inside the room and there's this wicker
*  door that lead a screen door that leads to the outside and you're like well why the hell did you
*  go through this elaborate series of doors and things if there's like a back door into your
*  system well that's basically a real life analogy of of you know the relationship between the oracle
*  and the smart contract you're only as good in your infosec model as your weakest link and
*  it doesn't matter if all of your computation is decentralized if you're at the mercy of your
*  data feed because i can just manipulate that and break the entire security model of the system
*  you know okay you'll perfectly execute the wrong answer so they say well if you're trusting us
*  anyway why don't you pull more of what we're you're doing on chain into our stack which
*  creates more transaction fees for them and more value for them but there are many different ways
*  you can you can do oracles and when i you know earlier i was talking about the biology of these
*  things cell differentiation the minute that you admit heterogeneity in your system and you start
*  having cells like stake pools or things that are on and 24 7 then you can start asking the what if
*  question why don't you guys you know just also provide data feeds why don't you guys also provide
*  state channels or payment channels or generate random numbers for me or whatever and you're now
*  a service provider you're making the blockchain full-time but part-time you're doing this you
*  know if you're making bagels you probably make donuts that type of a concept so i think that
*  type of competition is going to be very difficult for a lot of these layer two protocols and aren't
*  tightly coupled with the protocol because the the ones that are tightly coupled with the protocol
*  they have a built-in trust advantage they've already built a commercial reputation there's
*  already an increasingly more decentralized set the other thing is you don't need a token
*  you can just use ada you know you can you don't need an oracle coin for these types of things
*  to work and by the way that's just for the injection component and the veracity attestation
*  so is it true or not that's not about the aggregation that's still a tremendously time
*  intensive expensive proposition there's only a few people in the world that have what steve has
*  with wolfram and those guys by just cutting off those supply to replicate what they have is
*  something that would cost hundreds of millions or billions of dollars and so it's an interesting
*  question of how do you incentivize decentralized aggregation of information and that's kind of
*  what town crier and other protocols we're trying to achieve so maybe you can say how town crier
*  works because it's like how do you what's your vision you're now partnering with wolfram wolfram
*  alpha and in sort of exploring this partnership of data and the blockchain what's your vision
*  for a possible distributed version of wolfram alpha well you know the first step is just say can we
*  use this as a feed and they can be what bloomberg is to the financial markets you know so you have
*  a terminal and you have something and there's always a value of at least offering choice and
*  so it's not like we're anti chain link or picking winners and losers it's an open protocol it's an
*  open system so if we're successful chain link will migrate or will at least support us because
*  they like money you know they like users they like liquidity it's a disservice to their community not
*  to support a potential customer set but you know you're gonna have a spectrum from the desire to do
*  a completely decentralized aggregation curation injection and veracity attestation to a completely
*  centralized vertically integrated set you need to be able to have that whole spectrum and offer
*  that to the smart contract developer to decide you know what is what makes sense by the way a
*  lot of cases they're going to be their own oracle so for example the world of warcraft example that
*  i gave well you know it's a completely centralized thing it's a video game run by a single company
*  there's no sense in saying that we're somehow going to decentralize that what they're just
*  trying to do is extend their currency or nfts or whatever into new marketplaces so the minting of
*  that is controlled by a single entity and the world state of that you had just have to trust
*  blizzard to inject that into the system you could try to imagine some sort of like you know sentinel
*  group of people within the game who keep blizzard honest but it's completely unnecessary because
*  they can change the rules of the system arbitrarily so in that case you're optimizing around
*  efficiency and cost reduction so you'd want a single feed that gets injected into the system
*  if you look at a stablecoin that's algorithmic and it's basing its value on the aggregation of
*  many different exchanges that's the polar opposite example because there you're saying okay what's
*  the price of my asset relative to some basket but how do i know that the price feeds i'm looking at
*  are accurate you'd have to look at binance and bitrix and all these other things or maybe there's
*  conventional forex exchanges or something like that okay well how do you weight that and how do
*  you clip outliers and you know these types of things that's a completely different conversation
*  and there's a lot more mechanics you have to put in for that bundling and attestation of the
*  veracity of the data feed and what happens if you get it wrong your stablecoin gets mispriced and
*  everything goes to hell and you know the markets will eventually correct it for arbitrage seeking
*  behavior but anything that was built on that will fail in the in the short term so oracle is really
*  just a game of you know you have to build a standardized interfaces and make it as easy as
*  possible for people to do that and then let people choose how they want to inject data and what level
*  of assurance do they need behind that and the question is how much do you leave to the user
*  versus how much does the protocol take care of for you and it's a difficult design question for
*  our part you know we love working with steve and wolfram and they're they're a great company and
*  they really have some bright people there and we know on the data set that they're second to none
*  because not only do they have it it's computable you can do all kinds of things and manipulate
*  it was a very rich query language so that's a great thing and we want to make sure that that's
*  accessible to developers and cardano but remember they're like bloomberg it's a centralized speed
*  in that respect so if you want to build a chain link as competitor you know there's other protocols
*  you could do for that now you asked about town crier and that was that was an attempt to kind of
*  like sweep the oceans with the net you know get some get the data through a decentralized way
*  i and that was just saying hey let's use trusted hardware to go read all kinds of websites and
*  other things and because it's trusted hardware the scraping is non-biased you know if you find
*  something inconvenient to whatever the person who's scraping is it the trust hardware will still do it
*  and it can't be changed you'd have to manipulate sgx to do that so that's great but you still run
*  into the problem of how do you wire that together the underlying websites still don't have any notion
*  of veracity or reputation behind them and then you also have the issue of storage where the hell
*  do you put all of it yeah if you have exabytes of data what's the incentive for that that's the dream
*  of the semantic web i still think is a fascinating idea i have to basically convert the internet into
*  a court like a knowledge base that you can you can query you can integrate the same way you did
*  from alpha but much bigger right but that that means basically revolutionizing the way we put
*  the internet together which i think these ideas of off-chain data will will motivate people because
*  there's a lot of money to be made and creating finally there's money to be made with a semantic
*  web so that that'll be an interesting kind of future i do want to ask you about video games
*  really quick in a small tangent because you said this really interesting idea of blizzard being
*  centralized control is it possible to have items in the game that are not controlled by blizzard
*  sure being controlled in a decentralized fashion that you can like what is it the grandfather sword
*  and diablo what was it really somebody was criticizing me i said i was saying all these
*  kinds of nice things about diablo 3 and they said diablo 2 resurrected is coming out they need to
*  check it out there's a lot of there's a lot of camps and wars we both know that diablo 2 is far
*  better that's what they're saying this is the war that they're having okay so we'll play it's coming
*  out soon i'll play it fine but nevertheless those items are owned by blizzard is there is it possible
*  to create video games where items are owned by the people like outside of blizzard and uh do you think
*  in like a half century from now we will all live in those games and we'll forget the physical
*  space even well yeah that's definitely possible i look at crypto kitties that's a great example
*  of that can you explain what crypto kitties is well it's basically just a video game that kind
*  of lives on a blockchain and the creatures within the game can breed with each other and create new
*  crypto kitties and you can own them just like like like some sort of dystopian tamagotchi with lots
*  of money behind but but anyway you know the thing is those assets actually have a blockchain based
*  representation and so whether the the infrastructure that hoists up that game off chain goes on or off
*  because that ledger exists outside of the game any person can come in replicate it restore it
*  and you know turn it back on sans intellectual property so yeah it's completely possible to
*  to break your architecture up where you have a notion of the player part and then you have a
*  notion of the experience part and you can interchange experiences almost like you do
*  cascading style sheets or something for you know have different presentations and the ownership of
*  the underlying layers the players so yeah that that's definitely doable and frankly that's what's
*  going to happen in the gaming world because there's so much value in that i mean everybody
*  wants play and you know right now the model is you make a game you sell licenses and you you have a
*  huge surge of people at the beginning of the game buying the video game and then you have this long
*  tail but you've gotten almost 95 of your value in the first six months you have a huge churn rate
*  the odds are the vast majority people won't be playing the game within 12 months but if you can
*  create an interactive game where there's an actual economy inside the game then you have eve online
*  or second life or any of these things where you have people playing for 10 years and there's like
*  people buying virtual real estate and all these other things you as the game developer actually
*  don't have to create a lot of content so your long tail gets a lot fatter and it generates a lot more
*  revenue and your cost of operating system is fairly fixed or diminishing so the economics align
*  for doing exactly what you're what you're talking about i think it'll get done what i just saw
*  recently sort of this calculation that people played wow and fortnight for 140 billion hours
*  yeah so and that's without the economic incentives there so do you think it's possible that like most
*  of our economy in the future will be people playing video games essentially like okay so
*  one one vision of the future especially with ai and automation and people like um that we get
*  wealthier and wealthier there's this kind of rising gdp for the entire world and then people
*  are losing their jobs but they're still are well off enough to be able to have a high quality of
*  life so we're all looking for meaning and meaning we'll find is by playing video games and now there's
*  this extra levels like you can be a bill gates within a video game world in the digital world as
*  opposed to the physical world uh is that you think that's the future you just want to have the west
*  world if you can't tell the difference doesn't matter line uttered to you um did you ever
*  interview yval harari was he not yet eventually well yeah i get but you know i guess you know
*  homo deus that's kind of like the road map there right this hedonistic dystopia where everybody
*  just lives wired into some simulation and i there's some movies about that ready player one and
*  the other one was surrogate and so forth so yeah it was hollywood has certainly visualized what
*  this could be but you know i i'm not so pessimistic in that respect um i do believe that the video
*  game world is evolving at an amazing pace if you look at where unreal is at is just incredible the
*  latest unreal engine and within one or two more ticks of that clock the iterations so five to
*  ten years the photorealism will be so good that it'll be hard to distinguish between real life and
*  in video games and you know the hardware is almost there so the question is then when you have
*  photorealistic experiences where you've you've successfully traversed the uncanny valley to a
*  point where it's good enough then will virtual reality be more desirable than actual reality
*  and for the vast majority of people the answer is probably yes because for actual reality is tough
*  it's hard you know but then your knowledge of that you live in a virtual world actually becomes a
*  problem for you so there's going to be this kind of sad dark industry where people try to create
*  amnesia where they're not aware that they're inside the virtual world and so that's that's
*  an interesting why is it sad i mean it's almost like uh because you know it's it's not real but if
*  if you could forget that it's not real then you believe what you're experiencing is real
*  yeah but yeah so what you forget like you forget all the ugly parts of life which is the physical
*  the meat space and then you get to enjoy video games but it's always lurking in the back of
*  your mind that you're in the matrix well you have to not be in the matrix that's just why the the
*  bald dude in the matrix was like i want to be rich and have a beautiful wife and eat a steak every
*  day you know he didn't want to know he was in the matrix so you would take the red pill not the blue
*  pill well no hang on it depends on how good the virtual world is well that's what i'm trying to
*  tell you is i mean isn't that what most of the beautiful experiences about uh human life are is
*  forgetting for a moment for time like the mess of it yeah i mean that's what love is you forget
*  like all of a sudden everything is beautiful but like the reality is you're going to lose that
*  person and most likely love will fade and no matter what even if it doesn't you're both going to be
*  dead soon jesus christ so i'm taking the blue pill on that one you went full urtis becker on me man
*  okay but you know right you know i get what you're saying though and actually and but but then
*  it begs the question how do we and goes back to the very first question you asked in this interview
*  which is like how do we know we're not in a simulation or you know is this this bosstrom's
*  concepts or these ideas like real well it's entirely possible that we are and that we we desire to be
*  because the real world is horribly horrifically dystopian or bad or maybe we're actually don't
*  exist we're completely virtual and does it matter and i'd argue that it probably doesn't at um you
*  know at some certain point if you're at the end of your life in your 90s dying of cancer you know
*  the fact that you can live out being young healthy and 25 is probably a desirable thing and no one
*  would ever complain about that where it becomes problematic is if the vast majority of society
*  enters this virtual simulacra of reality and as a consequence nothing works because there's no
*  one to do anything society falls apart in that respect you know there's no desire to do anything
*  in the real world innovation stops the desire to actually do real work stops because you're always
*  inside this virtual economy so i don't know it's it's it's an interesting question but you know
*  drawing it back more to where we're at today the evolution factors are there you know vr is evolving
*  at a very rapid rate the game engines are just incredible today and they're really doing amazing
*  things and there seems to be an overwhelming desire for people to escape the harshness of
*  where they live just by evidence by how many billions of hours have been spent playing video
*  games people still play skyrim yeah yeah it's good games it's probably my favorite game with the whole
*  elder scroll series but you know it's fascinating because smart contracts is actually the mechanism
*  by which we take a lot of the meat space stuff and move it to the digital world so that where this is
*  the all the stuff we've been talking about is really probably the mechanisms which take us there
*  which uh i i find that world not dystopian i find that world quite utopian because there's so many
*  opportunities to create beautiful experiences but uh but since we're talking about the future let me
*  ask you the timeline question or even just like definitional what is alonzo you mentioned uh
*  some fun hello world experiments going on all right uh and how and when will cardinal get smart
*  contracts yeah so alonzo church is a famous famous mathematician computer science guy and he was a
*  contemporary of turing and there was like these three different views of computing recursive
*  functions from girdle and turing machines from turing and church had lambda calculus and they're
*  all equivalent and they all give you the ability to build a computer so we like functional programming
*  so we decided that's your favorite church so we had to name something after church and it's it's
*  just weird that you know we never did so we said okay alonzo is is a good release name basically
*  was bringing smart contracts to cardinal took us a long time to get here and we'll be there in the
*  next 90 days you know it's uh we like everything we do there's a process and so there's all the
*  colors of the rainbow we start with alonzo blue and then white and purple uh and each step you do
*  some more things you bring more users in and then eventually you get to a threshold where you say
*  okay everything works the way intended and you push a button we initiate what's called a hard
*  for combinator event and boom the system has smart contracts you just wake up and it's there it's
*  like it's in your house so it's like when i got my blue check mark on twitter i woke up and i had it
*  yeah it's just like christmas and you were never the same you can't you can't go back it's uh yeah
*  like hard fork it's a hard fork of charles yeah exactly you got blue mark well actually i think
*  you can take it away but can they take my check mark away i think
*  like but that'd be like a hard fork backwards i guess okay so so great so that's uh but currently
*  there's uh so there's um there's a testing procedure going on to see uh what does that
*  look like and what will give you confidence that things are working well yeah so first you start
*  with the mariera which is where we're right now multi-asset so you can do metadata and issue tokens
*  but you you have limited programmability on chain alonzo adds the programmability end but we already
*  have most of the the foundations of the extended utxl model and the smart contract model is just
*  those things aren't ready so the first step is say fork it so all those rules are now there okay so
*  that's what we did with alonzo blue we we forked a testnet based layer and it successfully survived
*  going from mary to alonzo which means that you can move transactions from one side to the other both
*  systems work and then the next step is say okay well are the stake pool operators people run the
*  infrastructure able to run this testnet just like they run cardano and that's what we're doing right
*  now with blue we're bringing all these spos in and then are we able to submit and run smart contracts
*  on the system and they actually return around trip you send something you get something back
*  yay okay um so that's where we're at and then what you do is each step so the next is white you go
*  from like 50 people to several hundred and then purple is an open testnet where we want every
*  single person the entire ecosystem to use it it's also a dev net so that means that people are
*  writing with plu's playground and local interpreters their their smart contracts can actually start
*  testing them now on the public infrastructure so it's kind of like releasing um dev kits to the
*  xbox or something like that you send them out to game developers before you release the xbox so they
*  can test their video games in anticipation of the release of the system so you run that for at least
*  a month and as long as it doesn't blow up in your face and oh god what have we done hindenburg oh
*  the humanity uh you release it and you know you ship it the problem is it's no longer in our control
*  you know there's over 100 exchanges that have listed cardano there's lots of wallet infrastructure
*  there are thousands of different constituencies so it's less of a technological problem now and
*  it's more of a coordination problem so you have to evolve in a very methodical way and each step
*  the way you bring new actors in they get ready for it they upgrade their infrastructure to it
*  and then like shells eventually you get to the outer shell which is the hard fork for the general
*  public and if we've done it right like that blue check mark they wake up and it's exactly the same
*  what do you just get a little update update your client and they start demanding wagyu beef is
*  there stuff you're worried about in terms of like when something's this tricky you know goes up
*  several orders and magnitudes in terms of scale are there problems that you foresee is there like
*  like we said there's game theoretic aspects all those kinds of things uh like what worries you
*  the most i i mean i sleep like a baby i wake up every two hours crying um damn that's a good line
*  you're full of good lines um i mean there's a lot you just made me realize that expression makes no
*  sense i slept like a baby but go ahead yeah exactly right messing your whole world up right now lex
*  um no i mean there's so much that keeps me up at night you know it's like you're in a cold
*  sweat every day when you have an ecosystem like this because you you you the other thing is you're
*  judged as much by the applications people build on the platform as you are by the platform you've
*  constructed so you know one of the most unfair things that happened in our industry was blaming
*  vitalik for the dow hack he didn't write the code he wasn't responsible for it a completely
*  independent different team and because it blew up a lot of people just developed this idea
*  ethereum is not secure the vm is fundamentally broken and it's true there are some issues there
*  but come on that's that's like saying oh well you know photoshop didn't work fuck bill gates
*  yeah you know and that's the issue is you get you get you get as a platform developer you know
*  into it coupled with the wins and losses of your application developers so if they go do amazing
*  things it's like oh yeah windows is great we love it and if they go do terrible things they're like
*  oh man i guess he's trying to kill all of us um so what we're kept up a night about is not just
*  what we've constructed but also how do we curate an ecosystem and foster the development of an
*  ecosystem where you have assurance baked into the application and that's somehow expressible to the
*  user so when you download your smart contract or you click your one click install to use your
*  uniswap clone or whatever the hell it is that's deployed on cardano you have a little green check
*  mark or something that indicates to you that somebody audited the code or followed a specification
*  the lack of that is problematic because then first there's impersonations the whole my ether
*  wallet thing or like your videos or my videos are the same every comment there's a bot that says hey
*  you know give me some money or something like that that kind of stuff happens but then just
*  protocol level flaws like what happened with the dow hack that's what really keeps me up at night
*  how do you resolve that problem because i don't hire these people i don't tell them what to do i
*  didn't tell them how to build things on the platform they may have tons of experience and
*  knowledge they could be simon paton jones or they could have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever and
*  they read one tutorial and they've written three lines of code their entire life and they've
*  deployed something horribly broken copy paste and suddenly it all goes to hell i'm judged by both
*  that's what really keeps me up at night and we're as a company trying to figure out and as the
*  ecosystem trying to figure out standards like at university wyoming we're setting up the smart
*  contract engineering institute we're negotiating with them right now and the goal there is just
*  to create some you know standards for how to certify smart contracts and so that you can get
*  that green check mark and know that it's it actually has some assurance level behind it
*  but god that's a huge coordination problem and it's a huge information presentation problem and
*  incentives problem and so forth and unfortunately people who value being first to market will kind
*  of piss in the pool for everybody else in terms of maybe you can comment on the topic of decentralized
*  exchanges what kind of decentralized exchanges decks is what are they first of all and what
*  kind would you like to see built around cardano yeah so people want to create exchanges that
*  don't have custodial risk the point of exchange is to build you a marketplace where bids and
*  can find each other market people can meet and trade you can find a price and you get liquidity
*  so you know you got gold you want to turn your gold into dollars okay well somebody has to create a
*  marketplace for that so like coinbase is an example of marketplace but centralized but the problem is
*  you have custodial risk so when you put your gold and your dollars your digital representations of
*  these things into the exchange what if you know wall-e he was eve broke up with him and now he's
*  really sad and he's gone to the dark side and he's become wall-e the hacker okay so he can go and
*  sneak his way in and hack into coinbase and steal all your your gold and your tokens so instead of
*  you actually being able to swap these things you've lost all your money and there's other problems
*  too like like let's say you know daisy has now come in and become a regulator and said oh i don't
*  like these exchanges anymore i'm just going to shut them all down yeah and then you have no access
*  to it so you have sovereign risk you have the risk of threat you have regulatory risk you have
*  the issue of banks maybe cutting you out so it's been in our industry for more than 10 years mount
*  gox was the most famous example of that they collapsed i believe in 2013 and hundreds of
*  millions of dollars was lost over the course of a while so the point of a dex is saying can we do
*  what a marketplace does but not have coinbase not have a central actor run this thing and there's
*  a lot of problems with that because exchanges are generally creatures of latency you know high
*  frequency trading for example they do things the nanosecond they co-locate their infrastructure
*  with the exchange software just so they can front-run orders over other people i mean it's
*  crazy the amount of technology that they put in so the traditional wall street version of an exchange
*  is very centralized very fast very optimized and kind of behaves by a very close set of rules when
*  you look at a dex you have to accept that you're going to have to have slightly different rules
*  because you're operating in a global systems latency and you're operating in a system that
*  has different behaviors however that said there's a lot of great protocols that have been built for
*  it you know uniswap has kind of evolved a lot over the years and we've seen a huge competition
*  and a lot of evolution to basically build out protocols that kind of skew some of these security
*  problems enjoy high liquidity and then also have this beautiful concept of openness one of the
*  gatekeepers to crypto when you're a cryptocurrency developer are the exchanges i remember when we
*  first created cardano you know the we the bitfinex guys reached out the cardano foundation they said
*  oh we'd be happy to list data and i said okay and they said yeah we want five million dollars to do
*  it you know so there was kind of a some italian for go fuck yourself in those email conversations
*  fuck hula is what i said but uh but anyway there was the that kind of back and forth happens all
*  the time and and because these guys are gatekeepers they they have this nepotistic control information
*  asymmetries and so forth so having a dex you don't have that problem you have open listing
*  and you basically just put the asset into it and if anybody wants to trade it they will and if it
*  seems like it's a good idea a natural market will form market making will occur and you get liquidity
*  with it so there's no barrier to entry for that type of system the biggest existential problem
*  for dex is right now is the concept of regulation so basically right now when you use binance or
*  coinbase or these other guys you have to go through kyc and aml know your customer and
*  anti-money lottery so basically who are you and you know is your money real or not or are you
*  a drug dealer or something so normally you do that by saying okay i'm going to give them my copy of
*  my passport and maybe they're going to request some tax records or whatever the best practices
*  are for the particular jurisdiction and then that exchange is liable if that's fucked up so if the
*  government comes in and says hey guys uh you know we pull your compliance records and they find
*  discrepancies they'll actually put the exchange out of business or fine them very heavily jp
*  morgan chase got 19 billion dollars in finance and fines over the last 20 years for various
*  compliance issues amongst other things so this is expensive a very difficult thing and at dex it's
*  open system you just have value coming in not identity and so all these things are trading
*  amongst synonymous accounts and so there's no notion of compliance right now for that
*  so a lot of regulators are coming in and saying oh well this is just a cesspool for terrorism and
*  drug dealing and bad stuff and they they're word salad of of bullshit but you know it is what it
*  is you have to deal with these guys and so there's been a lot of discussions of can we take dexes
*  and keep the openness and keep the liquidity and no counterpart of custodial risk and can we add
*  some notion of compliance to that in a decentralized way that doesn't require a single actor to be a
*  gatekeeper so i think actually by combining dids decentralized identifiers that's the way to do it
*  but it's actually the next generation of the technology is the regulated decks and you know
*  who regulates that how does that work and so forth but i think ultimately those are going to be the
*  only marketplaces that end up surviving in this current environment if your desire is to exit to
*  a dollar if you don't really care about the fiat side like a traditional legacy currency you can
*  always do things in a shadowy unrelated unregulated way but i mean it's a personal
*  preference and a business preference can we kind of return to um to proof of work and proof of stake
*  there's just so many topics i want to talk to you about so i'll jump around a little bit but at the
*  bitcoin conference jack dorsey spoke i think i believe he said bitcoin changes everything
*  i think you made a video for jack trying to explain different ideas to him i guess describing
*  the difference between proof of work and proof of stake as we've talked about right what do you hope
*  jack dorsey comes to understand about the difference between proof of work and proof of stake well i
*  hope he understands it's just a resource that's the entire point of the video i was trying to make
*  is like dude you're like in this cult where you think the only way to be secure is proof of work
*  and somehow proof of stake is less secure than proof of work i don't even know how you you put
*  those inequalities there because you're talking about apples and oranges you're making different
*  trade-offs and there's different assumptions about the nature of the people involved but the
*  mechanics are the same and so it's really more of a question of what type of system do you prefer
*  do you want mercenaries guarding rome or do you want roman citizens carving rome okay and as the
*  romans learn it's better to have citizens usually doing that okay and that's the only point i was
*  trying to make to to dorsey and you know i don't think he watched it or particularly cared but it
*  was more of a video for everyone and to start that dialogue of realizing that the real game is not
*  is proof of stake better than proof of work is how do we go from one to n and what should n be
*  you just mentioned that semantical addressable web going back to ipfs and these other concepts
*  well what how do you pay for the enormous burden of storing that much data you can create a
*  consensus protocol for it there actually is one it's called permacoin came out 2014 15 andrew
*  miller wrote it and a few other authors i think our john katz may have been an author as well
*  but basically it was just a you know a throwaway proof of work style algorithm that only works
*  if you have large amounts of data okay so it's like your miners are like a hard drive effectively
*  proof of storage i think you call them yeah there's this type of stuff and there's been
*  since then many iterations evolutions of that type of protocol okay so what if you throw that
*  into your resource bag now you have a capacity in your system for storing huge amounts of
*  information that's incentivized by the way the system works and you can balance that with a
*  proof of stake system and you can balance that with a let's say you have proof of useful computation
*  we may have a paper on that who knows coming soon and what if you have a proof of useful
*  computation where maybe you can do wac stat or something who knows with something like that okay
*  well now you have three resources inside your system and those three things keep your system
*  secure they keep each other balanced and they just so happen to create the world's largest
*  supercomputer that's programmable and it just so happens to create the world's largest database
*  that's programmable in addition to having a shareholder style model for ownership inside of
*  it to kind of balance these things out so people care about the appreciation of value inside the
*  system so that was my point to jack is you're a business guy why are you betting all your eggs
*  and one crazy model that's a cult step away and realize that that does something it's a tool but
*  saws aren't the only tool in the toolbox there's hammers and screwdrivers and other things go to
*  end resources and let's have a real conversation about what would a world computer or a world
*  infrastructure that's useful for your business domain in his case twitter require and what type
*  of resources would you need for the such a thing well in this case square more importantly
*  currently if you look at square and cash rap they support uh bitcoin you know he is kind of all in
*  on the proof of work idea not all in but currently kind of uh that's the the one supported i guess
*  there's just a tip in proof of work i love you so much charles thank you appreciate this
*  but uh i'm not gonna run with that even though i'm tempted to uh but uh looking forward do you
*  hope cardano becomes part of cash app i mean he's a business guy or at least i'd hope he is and
*  it's not about what i want or what he wants it's about what markets want you know when you run a
*  publicly traded company you have a fiduciary obligation your shareholders to maximize the
*  utility of sustainability and value of your company and so if he's running you know a company that
*  makes money off of these things it makes absolutely no sense to be a maximalist you want transaction
*  volume that's how you make your damn money it was coinbase was the same way they were very
*  maximalist in the beginning very quickly they started realizing hey we're losing a lot of
*  money if we want to ipo we kind of need to be a bit more diverse eric vorhees was also a maximalist
*  way back today now look at eric he's got a shape shift and all these other pieces of infrastructure
*  he's he's a lot more friendly with us altis so you know jack will make that decision his people
*  will make that decision i think based on market dynamics transaction volume and value to the user
*  and if the concern is actually legitimately security then the only question i'd ask their
*  team is can you please provide me a definition of one you're doing pow is more secure than
*  proof of stake as a tweet isn't is not really a proof okay you need to actually come out and
*  sit down and say what is your security model what do you care about what do you value what's the
*  problems you're concerned about a proof of stake and they never really get there and that's why i
*  call a you know this maximally like a religion because it's just like saying you know well the
*  angels descended from the heavens and it's like well how do you know well because the bible said
*  so or this doctrine said so it's like well that's your evidence somebody wrote something down
*  can you please give me a little bit more they say no you're challenging the word of god
*  in this case you're challenging the word of satoshi and all i ask for is just what is the
*  burden of proof we wrote the papers we have security models we went through the peer review
*  process god that was not easy we wrote formal specifications in some cases we formalized those
*  specifications with isabelle for god's sakes which is not easy to do and then we implemented it and
*  it's running in production with a million users at a 50 billion dollar market cap i mean is it what
*  point does you do you start saying well maybe there's something there you know and they say no
*  there's nothing there and it's not secure it can't be secure he's okay then why do you believe what
*  you believe and they never come back to me with an answer ever well i believe god didn't go through
*  a peer review process when you wrote the 10 commandments so um sometimes it works out
*  sometimes not uh let me ask on that same thread tesla spacex el musk currently invested in bitcoin
*  but are openly looking to explore other cryptocurrency investments what case would you
*  make for cardano well if they truly care about alternative energy and sustainability you know
*  carbon reduction or carbon neutrality you you can't be in a system where there is no built-in
*  mechanism to constrain the energy consumption you know with proof of stake energy consumption
*  is a negative it's you want to minimize it if you can get the same amount of stuff done on a raspberry
*  pie as you can a big server you're going to do it on the pie because ultimately that server cost
*  and the energy cost is coming out of your budget with proof of work any innovation you come up with
*  to optimize power you just build more asics because you know it's always 30 more power
*  efficient great by 30 more you keep you keep you keep you keep adding to the work so because you
*  want more hash power more hash power more share of the pie so you have no energy savings component
*  i know these people are saying well there's a lot of wasted energy in the grid and this is kind of
*  incentivizing using that wasted energy and it's a better way of storing it than batteries because
*  you're now storing it as a bitcoin instead of storing it as energy okay maybe there's some
*  truth to that but um anyway it's just the energy is a critical point for you like the yeah and
*  that's exactly right the energy is a critical point for me with with with tesla because they
*  assert to be an alternative energy company and unless they can make the case that somehow the
*  proliferation of bitcoin is legitimately going to proliferate batteries solar and wind or other
*  things then it's probably good for them to just focus on the most efficient energy efficient
*  cryptocurrency possible otherwise you're exacerbating global warming you're exacerbating
*  the ecological consequences of it the other thing is bitcoin is the least programmable of all the
*  cryptocurrencies and if you want to do interesting sexy unique things let's say tesla for example
*  they want to start doing v2i and v2v for uh for autonomous vehicles and have the vehicles start
*  talking to each other and connect it to 5g well imagine if you want to build a telco coin or
*  some sort of 5g coin and you want to build an iot layer network there's just no real way to do that
*  on bitcoin with the way it's designed so you'd need fundamentally different infrastructure to create
*  such a token and regulate such a system and have these things autonomously negotiate and do business
*  with each other you need dexes and stable coins and all kinds of mechanics to make something like
*  that possible well that's really beneficial to tesla if they could figure that out because they
*  can actually get data from those cars through a marketplace and exchange for the benefit of
*  autonomous driving or for the benefit of understanding road conditions or safety
*  enhancement and so forth so it's just depending are you just here to speculate are you here to
*  actually use as another medium of exchange or do you actually want to build infrastructure on this
*  thing the more closely you get to utility that the further down the road you get there then the
*  more programmability you need and so it makes a lot more sense to be an ethereum fan or a cardano
*  fan than to be a bitcoin fan so to be both put to the stake and have the smart contracts capabilities
*  yes and that's why we went over ethereum because they're proof of work you mentioned god god
*  spelled backwards is dog how's that for a transition
*  you mentioned god god spelled backwards is dog how's that for a transition
*  and uh elon musk and uh tesla are at least a little bit curious about a coin called doge coin
*  right you made a video directed to elon on how to improve doge coin what are your ideas for making
*  doge coin even better than it already is well you know doge coins just based is a
*  it's like that nine inch nail song a copy of a copy of a copy yeah it's just a copy of a copy it's a
*  bitcoin gave like coin like coin gave doge coin and it was kind of a parody cryptocurrency and
*  i think jackson was trying to do it to like prove a point about alt coins and then true to forms
*  like nobody got the doctrine and completely perverted the entire religion it's almost like
*  the emperor of man and warhammer 40k it was like this atheist don't worship me and now there's like
*  this whole religion built around the emperor so dogecoin has become a thing and it's become such
*  a large thing that it is a reasonable target for somebody to fix it up and repair it make it an
*  interesting cryptocurrency the point of the video was to show what a modern third generation
*  cryptocurrency really would require it's a major overhaul and there are already people doing this
*  you know there's the solanas and the harmony ones and the cardanos neos and all these other guys
*  and they have billions of dollars and huge dev teams and all these innovative protocols
*  if you're really serious about this thing sticking around being useful in doing stuff then the point
*  of the video was to show the types of things you'd have to think about and the types of papers
*  that are all open source patent free and don't have any notion of intellectual property behind
*  them that his engineers could grab and go and do and he did mention on twitter that he was looking
*  for feedback on how to improve doge and so i said all right well i'll just put all these things
*  together it was a little tongue in cheek because i figured he'd ignore it but it was also showing
*  how hard it is to innovate in this tire space you know you don't just go and say i'm gonna go build
*  a battery-powered car or rocket or enter a new industry it's really hard to do that you spend
*  years and lots of effort you have to do series of small learning steps you have to pick up
*  destroyed rockets on the side of the beach and things like that before you get to the
*  rocket landing itself well analogously it's really hard to build a cryptocurrency
*  the satoshi probably spent years thinking carefully and that work was a derivative of 30
*  years of work in the digital asset space starting the 1980s working its way through so and then
*  bitcoin only did very limited things relative to what ethereum can do or cardano can do and so
*  forth so the minute that you extend that complexity you're talking about years of r&d years of
*  engineering effort that needs to be done so what's the point of doge is it just a meme
*  is it actually contending to be useful or is it competing as a store value against bitcoin now if
*  it's competing as a store value against bitcoin why the hell does it have the monetary policy it
*  does also there's predatory distribution of the underlying asset and over 90 some percent is
*  consolidated less than one percent of the holders for dogecoin for dogecoin at a very very low price
*  point so they can sell at almost any price point and make a profit so you know it hits 50 cents
*  they're billionaires and and it's not like 20 000 people it's probably less than 100 wallets that
*  have that distribution so there's this existential ticking time bomb that's in doge that once the
*  guys who are vested start selling they can just keep selling and keep selling and ride it all the
*  way down and make windfall profits regardless of what price they sell down and who are they selling
*  against the retail investors you know people make 500 dollars you know spare money a month or
*  spare money a month or something like that and it bothers me because i see it in my community so
*  i live in longmont now in colorado and i was at a restaurant and i was talking to the waitress and
*  she asked me what business those and i said i'm in the cryptocurrency space and she's like what is
*  that and i started explaining all of it she says oh yeah i own some dogecoin i said you own anything
*  else no no i just bought some why did you buy doge oh i saw elan tweeting about it and i thought it
*  was a good deal you know so when you see stuff like that where people have no clue what they're
*  doing they don't really understand the supply dynamics the ownership dynamics and these types
*  of things and then when the clock stops you know they're the ones who get hurt and then the
*  regulator comes in the elizabeth warrens of the world and they say see this is an evidence these
*  guys can't regulate themselves control themselves we need to control everything either let's ban it
*  or let's just announce that the only three are legitimate and he and you know every one of them
*  has to be connected to identity and rah rah rah and i'm just very concerned that that's a bad thing
*  to do and that's why i've been so vocal about this topic and my hope is that a compromise can
*  be made where real developers come in and they start working on doge and they find a way to
*  create some sort of use and utility for it so at least it has a value floor and you know it won't
*  collapse is it possible for cardano and doge going to work together somehow yeah it'd be a lot of fun
*  you know i i'm not adverse to the idea of of cleaning up the code base but legitimately
*  whoever comes in be two years or three years of work you know because you have to do real stuff
*  and that code is like litecoin circa 2012 2013 well the the interesting thing about elon i've
*  got to interact with them quite a bit that combination of humor and extreme ambition like
*  in the face of impossible odds is something he does really well and so i think that's the spirit
*  of dogecoin is fun and almost like bold ambitious innovation and so i think you can't discount the
*  power of that but where's the innovation what's the well this is step one what's going to mars
*  for dogecoin well that's i mean he came he came in the same way to uh to raqqas he came in the same
*  way to uh to electric cars it was seemed impossible at first but you step in and you solve the
*  problems first principles one at a time but but i'll challenge you a little bit on this because
*  i think he had some trends though that he was very smart to recognize the case of battery power cars
*  he said hang on everybody has tablets and cell phones and these other things and
*  there's an incentive to make batteries better faster cheaper and charge faster and that's
*  connected to mobile computing so regardless if you want battery power cars or not every year
*  you have billions of dollars of r&d being pushed to force this capacity to evolve and he's just
*  getting on the train and piggybacking on that so that was a brilliant business acumen to recognize
*  that in the case of spacex it was a just obvious question if every time you get on a plane you have
*  to throw the plane away no one would fly so reusability is like a fundamental thing that if
*  you solve that you've now opened space up to a complete new class of commercialization i don't
*  see the problem in dogecoin because if he was looking for it then why not look at a real
*  platform actually trying to solve a real problem there's so many of them there he is he throw a
*  rock he can hit 15 of these guys and they'd all die to work with you at musk yeah that's very
*  interesting i mean so first i i could continue pushing back on your intuition about electric
*  cars and batteries and so on i don't think it's it's more obvious in retrospect than it is in
*  at the time i would say because i would agree with you on the batteries front i wouldn't necessarily
*  the lecture car because first of all nobody started a successful car company from for decades
*  well but it was the loyalty the ev4 guys or whatever it was with gm they didn't want to
*  give them back when they they had the lease program so there's some basic intuition that
*  there is some hunger here but it's not obvious that you can do it successfully and with relaunching
*  rockets for cheap that's not that sounds good on paper but to do it well nasa is spending way more
*  money for this and the russians were assholes not selling any rockets like you say you have to do it
*  all yourself from scratch how do you build the team how do you do uh how do you launch rockets
*  when if you fail a few times you're going to go bankrupt right i mean it's just business wise i
*  would rather build an app like angry birds oh yeah yeah he's got this launch rocket you got to give
*  him credit he's got boulders for balls he's a good picture yeah thank you for that uh but i don't i
*  maybe that's what i mean i think there's not enough first principle thinking on the cryptocurrency
*  side i think i agree with you on that but there's some aspect to which the seriousness of the
*  cryptocurrency world is paralyzing so in some way the innovation that you spoke to requires
*  taking risks requires not taking everything so seriously like being afraid to take those bold
*  risks in the space of ideas not in the space of financials so in that way i think that's one pro
*  for bitcoin is uh there's room it's hungry for innovation but i think cardano in that same way
*  is hungry for innovation just like as you said with some more rigor and formalism behind it
*  i mean even ethereum has a has a hunger for innovation that's where bitcoin is a little
*  bit more um i would say conservative in terms of how much innovating they're willing to do
*  in terms of the incentives they built into the systems for the evolution of the cryptocurrency
*  but yeah i mean it's difficult to psychoanalyze why dogecoin is the thing that excites elon so much
*  but at the same time there's some power to the fun it sounds ridiculous to say but the fun
*  the this this idea that um you know the most entertaining outcome is the most likely right
*  it there could be something built into the physics of the universe that makes that true
*  because you know the the viral nature of fun has power well it's a neural science thing we like
*  dopamine we like these these chemicals in our brain you know and when we have fun we want more
*  of it so you tend to gravitate towards work activities and play activities that are enjoyable
*  to you and it is nice sometimes to kind of come and control an entire industry yeah you know i
*  could imagine he's probably at the time of his life it's the same as like uh taking tesla private
*  at 420 yeah that kind of stuff yeah and it's one thing when you do it with friends it's another
*  thing when you do with the whole industry and it hurts people financially uh and also i understand
*  he hates short sellers and there's there's some things there and i can't speak for him because i
*  only know the guy from a distance it's just i live in this space and i have to deal with the
*  consequences and clean up the mess you feel the pain yeah and this results in a regulatory event
*  it's like i'm the guy who has to put on a suit and go to washington and go and sit in a senate
*  inquiry and all this stuff and he's the guy that you know just like laugh with his friends about
*  how he crashed the crypto market and how easy it was to do it and that's that's my only umbrage
*  about this on the other hand you know if it brings a lot of cool new interesting things
*  and people into the space that's a net positive and so you know it's not universally bad or
*  universally good and i'd like to give people the benefit of the doubt and so i'm really hopeful to
*  see what comes about this recent surge of interest and if elan actually puts his money where his
*  mouth is and takes some of his enormous engineering talent and you know capital and
*  starts contributing and building something in the cryptocurrency space it'd be really cool to see
*  that happen there's a bunch of different technical aspects i want to ask you about on the cardano
*  side so first maybe on the scaling side what is hydra how does hydra compare to other different
*  ideas for scalability like roll-ups yeah main trade-offs with respect to security ux
*  um and anything else you want to talk about you have to have a little bit more energy lex come on
*  you know what i need i need that coke machine that you mentioned the the thing that converts water to
*  cocaine okay from director bullock we'll leave that we'll leave this in right yeah um isomorphic
*  state channels that's a that's a great topic right there's a word salad of cryptographic terms
*  uh whether lightning hydra roll-ups any of these things really what you're trying to do is say okay
*  uh if i do it on layer one it's slow and expensive what i'm going to do is batch something somehow
*  some way and then do it in a different system where it's fast and cheap and what i'm doing with
*  that is i'm losing some of the security guarantees of the base layer and admitting a slight higher
*  degree of this of centralization but then i get super fast settlement i get super low cost
*  transactions and potentially i may even be able to get distributed computing meaning that instead
*  of having the smart contracts run in a replicated system they could run on a single node like a
*  stake pool and their stuff is different from the other guy's stuff so you go from a system of
*  capacity of whatever it is to a system of n for the totality of all the stake pools so basically
*  hydra is just the next generation of that when you have the ability to tinker with the accounting
*  model and the layer two solution is is co-designed with the layer one solution so it's like what
*  lightning would have been had lightning been co-developed when bitcoin came out there would
*  have been special provisions made in bitcoin specifically to accommodate lightning and it
*  would have made it very easy for you then to move inside the system outside of the system and have
*  security properties preserved like availability for example or fraud resistance say oh you can't
*  steal the money or these types of things where things get really complex and this is why hydra's
*  novel over lightning is when you want to move beyond payments to state management okay so payments
*  are just i want to move between alice to bob as quickly as possible as low cost as possible
*  so for example um i have a micro tipping application like change tip on twitter or
*  you know like a video i'm watching youtube video like maybe this video in the future and people
*  really like it and they click tip and you get five cents or something like that okay so that's an
*  example of a perfect payment application and that's great but what happens when you actually
*  have a rich smart contract like a dex or you know you want to do a video game or something
*  like that you want to run that off chain but then there's some reconciliation on chain that happens
*  so a state channel basically lets you do that but it's a lot more complicated and there's a lot more
*  to think about so hydra basically just has in its design a collection of ideas of how to do that
*  and the current paper is for a single head the next thing you do is composition so you go multiple
*  heads and there's a routing protocol between them and then eventually create these tail protocols
*  for when things get asynchronous so instead of always being aligned and always being available
*  what happens if they die for a bit and then they come back and you can create all kinds of guarantees
*  that your funds won't be lost or locked forever or things like that there's a failure recovery
*  mode for this type of stuff and basically the the idea is leverage what lightning has already
*  achieved with bitcoin but then take advantage of the fact that you have a more expressive
*  accounting model and a more expressive programming model so you can just physically do more and you
*  can put more crypto inside that thing now contrast it with roll-ups really that is just saying you're
*  going to take some thing batch a bunch of transactions together and you're going to generate a proof
*  and then what you can do is whenever you see some part of that history you can check it against that
*  proof that's rolled up and they're closely related concept of recursive snarks that you'll see a lot
*  there's things like the mina protocol or other things and basically the idea is that whenever
*  you see something you can always generate two proofs an existential proofs that the coins exist
*  and a non-existence of a double spend so you can always check those two properties and the proof is
*  verifiable and logarithmic time ideally so you can have giant amounts of data but it's very small
*  the actual proof is concise okay so they're just different boats for different floats the advantage
*  of a layer two network where there's actual channels and there's interaction and their
*  service providers is the channels can eventually scale in the collection of things that they can
*  do and eventually they can become interoperability networks between cryptocurrencies so at some point
*  we could modify the bolt spec and make it somewhat interoperable with hydra and then what you could
*  happen is you could use it as a bridge to actually do cross-chain traffic and send transactions
*  between the systems you don't really think about that too much when you're talking about roll-ups
*  that's more of optimizing what you have within the system within the chain so what can you can
*  you elaborate how it's possible to do cross-chain traffic well you already have the intermediary
*  you have the channel operator and you already have lightning which protocol right and you just
*  build a dex that runs within that system and they can swap assets or you can do wrapped assets
*  so you lock it like low cost i guess you could just switch yeah the same thing lets you batch
*  things on one will let you batch the other so if lightning works on bitcoin and hydra works on
*  cardano you can eventually bridge these two together and create a way of moving back and
*  forth and the same things that make transactions in and out of that network cheap will make creating
*  wrapped assets cheap at least on the bitcoin to cardano side you can't create assets on bitcoin
*  another flaw of bitcoin that they've never fixed what's your thought about layer two technologies
*  in general is there stuff you're excited about we talked quite a bit about lightning network hydra
*  i mean these ideas do you think there will be somebody that wins out or is this going to be
*  this kind of dynamic thing that we just keep building different ideas and they all interact
*  with each other it goes back to biology that cell differentiation concept is you have to build
*  specialized tissue to do things the point of layer two is to extend the network it's adding a foot
*  it's adding an arm it's adding a brain it's adding a heart it's adding eyes giving you additional
*  senses you have years now so when you add these layer two products like a tola prism is a perfect
*  example of that we don't have identity at the base layer of cardano it's a real bad deal to do that
*  because then china will come in or us will come in and tell you how to do that what you do is
*  you build a layer two protocol that's blockchain agnostic and then the user can decide when and
*  where they need an identity and then bring that identity into the system and if you designed it
*  right when they bring it in it's very easy very fluid and suddenly the experience enhances
*  everything just gets better oh wow okay now i can use all these regulated things they go from gray
*  to green in the app store that's so cool or oh wow now i can send to human readable addresses
*  because if i have an identity and you have an identity we can alias them with some namespace
*  and now i sent to lex instead of some you know horrible back 32 address structure okay so that's
*  that's really what you need to do with layer two is say okay each layer two protocol is meant to
*  do something either gives me payments or lower cost smart contracts or interoperability or identity
*  and then it's a marketplace so you should have blockchain agnosticism with your layer two
*  solutions and so you can mix and match and choose whichever collection of services you need and
*  that's actually how it works these days with microservices and these other things and cloud
*  software you know every firm is an aggregation of dozens of providers and basically that
*  composition of them is your software stack jumping around back to proof of work what are
*  non-interactive proofs of proof of work nipopos nipopos nipopos it's fun to say right nipopos
*  it's just one of those things that you notice that certain proofs of work when you solve them
*  come up less frequently than other ones and just by that nature you can sample them and then
*  construct proofs from them so you can with this with that just set have a more concise representation
*  of an amount of work for a range of the chain so that we said again yeah i was gonna say
*  that word salad basically the idea is okay so let's say that this block and i'm just simplifying
*  the concept a lot this this block you know you get a regular green type of proof of work and then
*  this block you get a green and you keep going and then suddenly you get a red one okay so it's still
*  a valid proof of work but it's more rare than the other ones yeah okay so if you notice that
*  particular pattern what you can do is you can just start not caring so much about the green ones and
*  you can just bookend your chain with red okay and then you can just repeat that and repeat that
*  repeat and you can collect you can create this really compressed representation of these things
*  so what does it mean it means that suddenly when you have that now you have a way of representing
*  a long range of history with a very small proof so you can use it for light wallets and you also
*  can use it for side chains if both side chains use proof of work so when you see a transaction
*  come in you don't have a copy of the side chain but you have a copy of the proof of work and
*  it's the same algorithmic weight as the normal longest chain you know because you don't have all
*  the greens but the reds only occur with a certain sampling frequency so this is the brainchild of
*  dianesis zendros and agulose and it's just an amazing paper and what's what's so cool about it
*  is it doesn't require any structural changes to proof of work it's just something you notice as
*  an off-gas of proof of work it's like you're watching an engine operate and you notice like
*  every 500 times a piston will do a certain weird thing and so you take advantage of that you say
*  well if i count 10 of them now i have 5 000 pistons strikes because i i observe that pattern so it's
*  the same concept there and it's just a property of the engine so you don't really need a hard
*  fork at end it's just there and because you can build proofs that way now you can use those proofs
*  to do like clients and you use those proofs to do other things because you just use that as
*  something that comes with the history you don't have to have the whole blockchain now is this a
*  weird property of multiple proof of work chains okay that's to be key to the particular consensus
*  algorithm but usually there's some some portability in this type of thing like we're right now
*  exploring can you do nipa piles with prism or any of these sharded proof of work protocols but it
*  looks like you can the closely related is log space mining so you can use this concept and instead
*  of having the entire blockchain to be able to mine you can use a compressed representation of it
*  and we wrote a paper called log space mining that basically explains how to do that so your miner
*  only has this very small micro ledger as opposed to the entire ledger how does it connect back to
*  the entire ledger how does the because because you have those red blocks you have those special
*  things and so you so you know that the state you're working on is actually legitimate right
*  so the map is goes both ways yeah it's pretty cool wow that's really interesting yeah and
*  dns is a genius he's a really really smart kid and he got his phd under us he went to university of
*  athens and he was a aga losis graduate student and now he's doing a postdoc at stanford under
*  david shee and this is literally the only thing he does he's does interoperability sidechain stuff
*  nipa piles and so forth and he's written a lot of great papers on it and that was a testimony to
*  hard work for getting the paper published because the paper came out in 2016 but i think it took
*  three or four years for it to go through peer review he kept trying to push it one conference
*  after rejection after another rejection but he got it through real proud of that kid and then he
*  just doing all this beautiful derivative work now like block space mining and so forth so reddit
*  and you said since it starts with reddit you know it's going to be fun the the top question
*  on the cardano subreddit which is quite a wonderful place by the way was can you get charles
*  to play devil's advocate against cardano if it's going to fail what would failure look like and
*  what are the most likely reasons it would fail okay well there's the failure for example i said
*  one of the project goals was to achieve self-evolution so if it doesn't achieve that
*  where it can evolve itself iteration by iteration then obviously the product didn't do what was
*  intended right if it continuously required the supervision of custodians in order for it to
*  succeed the system just won't work the good news is we have a lot of data showing the opposite
*  you know we used to run an federated model and now we're completely decentralized for block
*  production but that didn't just happen overnight i mean there was a whole process with the
*  incentivized test net and the stake pool pioneers program and the launch of shelly and the decrementing
*  of the decentralization parameter and every step of the way people showed up and had to do things
*  and we went from several to thousands of people who are regularly maintaining the infrastructure
*  but there's no guarantee that that would be sustainable and there's no guarantee that the
*  next step the smart contract step will achieve what we want and the next step the governance
*  step will achieve what we want i mean it's an experiment and all these types of things
*  all cryptocurrencies all companies are in a sense experiments when they are evolving the business
*  model and as our case our our businesses systems and society we're offering to the world a vision
*  of how to run humanity in a different way and the only way the system can do that is by millions of
*  people joining the system is self-evolving the system and growing it in that particular direction
*  another failure scenario would be the system evolves in the wrong direction so it's self-evolving
*  but it goes into a more centralized dystopian way and that's that's problematic as well what would
*  that look like what would dystopia the self-evolution toward dystopia look like a small group of actors
*  have total control over who gets to use the system and how they get to use the system and your use
*  of the system is monitored and shared with that small group of actors so social credit in china
*  is a great example of that a small group of people have access to that and then your experience in
*  chinese society is determined by it so that's an example of a failure mode and another could be
*  just network effect we we start experiencing a churn rate and the you know inputs don't match the
*  outputs in that you lose more than you gain and then over time the system dies off however that's
*  really hard in practice once you reach a certain network effect even if you become stagnant and
*  stale you tend not to lose your users and our evangelism is unbelievable in the cardinal
*  community i think we're number one for tattoos you know and that's if you think about that it's a
*  strange metric to have but there are brands that associate that way apple and harley davidson and
*  so forth people tend to actually tattoo the logo those people don't leave they don't actually walk
*  away from the ecosystem they're fanboys to the core so there's a there's a lot of of people that
*  are here for life they don't care if it's dollar ada two cent data they believe in the mission
*  vision and value of what we wish to achieve and they've become evangelists in that respect
*  so the question is does that community sustain itself and also does that community not make the
*  same sins and mistake of bitcoin where they become toxic and maximalistic and they start
*  becoming highly religious about whatever beliefs they have my hope is our community will be open
*  and socratic and love the scientific method and be willing to entertain ideas without adopting them
*  and discard ideas that are proven to be wrong if we become dogmatic and embrace an orthodoxy that
*  is counterproductive innovation then it'll stall out the ecosystem and you'll notice i never said
*  price in any of this i never said hey you know failure is if the price goes way down and success
*  is if the price goes way up that's unfortunately the metric that most people use but i couldn't
*  care less about it because you know the reality is if you construct a system that encompasses the
*  entire globe and has billions of users it's probably going to be a pretty valuable system
*  that's a you know a secondary thing you know it's an after effect of having success in adoption use
*  and utility unfortunately most people have read it and twitter and other channels they tend to
*  just judge your entire success based on that i had very few people when shelly launched even though
*  it took us four years to get there a lot of work say congratulations on shelly but i had a lot of
*  people when aida reached the dollar saying we're so proud of you amazing work congratulations and
*  so forth and that's probably the most disheartening thing about the the whole being around and doing
*  this stuff where all the things you do only matter as long as it's making someone else rich and
*  and in a way i feel almost like a failure you know because that that mindset means that we haven't
*  yet inculcated the community in a proper way saying hey guys this is about more than money it's about
*  more than the value of aida what we're attempting to do here is re-engineer the way society works
*  i'd like your voting to be different i'd like your property to be different i'd like you on your
*  cell phone to have a universal wallet and when you go to starbucks or wherever you can buy your
*  coffee with silver gold or airline miles or something like that and they get paid whatever
*  the hell they want to get paid and i want those rails to be done with a system that puts you in
*  charge not someone else and they say yeah that's all fine and great as long as aida's five dollars
*  we're we're all happy you see so that that's a problem there are of course other things that
*  could fail like you know we could lose project cohesion lots of people could quit and die but
*  again there's so much momentum there's so many things here the ideas are already out there
*  and there's no intellectual property you know when you publish a hundred papers you write a
*  million lines of code that's something and it's permanent and it's in the commons now so it's
*  just as much yours as it is mine so there's no notion that somehow you know if the core
*  development company disappeared then that concept is lost forever like for like the library of
*  alexandria burning to the ground it's it's there and someone else will take it fork it
*  and get it done i mean first of all that's fascinating the self-evolution you don't know
*  which trajectories that's going to take but also there could be singular singular events like bugs
*  in the system create an opportunity to hack the system is that something that you see as a potential
*  failure case yeah it's always a possibility bugs can exist there can be flaws in the protocol
*  design zcash was a great example of that where there was a subtle flaw and it damaged the fidelity
*  of the cryptocurrency in ways no other cryptocurrencies ever experienced normally when
*  you have a bug the bug you can see it like the bitcoin overflow the value overflow incident yes
*  bitcoin can be created but we can verify they weren't so the monetary policy is preserved when
*  you have a bug with a private system like zcash and it exists on the shielded side there's no
*  guarantee unless you can audit the total supply inside that's shielded side my understanding is
*  you can't that somebody didn't exploit the bug and create trillions of these coins out of thin
*  air just hiding them on that system and dripping them out and so the monetary policy is forever
*  damaged as a consequence of bug like that it's probably the worst type of bug you can have for
*  these types of products so you know no matter how good of a job you do they have great scientists
*  there are great people there great engineers there you can always have something like that seep its
*  way in leak its way in and that lurks in the distance but you know if that's a problem shared
*  with every one of your neighbors you know this is like everybody working on a nuclear power plant
*  well yeah you can all die of radiation poisoning well we all kind of knew that didn't we you know
*  so yeah so it's like i i don't really think too much about it you know i i think the context of
*  the question was more what is cardano specific over ethereum or bitcoin or any of these other
*  things and yeah okay existential lurking bug could happen it's lower probability for us than
*  the other systems because we use formal methods and we use peer review inside the the the protocol
*  design so there's been more eyeballs and tools and techniques used to check things and we actually
*  have discovered a lot of weird wonky bugs before production and resolve those bugs so shows you the
*  system works it's a lot of fun what about close kind of competitors i don't know if you would put
*  it that way but if you look in the space of ideas uh competitor cryptocurrencies like polka dot
*  what are some interesting differences between cardano and polka dot technically philosophically
*  historically is that something you think about when you think about the future of cardano
*  yeah i mean we do we actually have a whole group of people that do business intelligence and
*  comparative analysis and we're getting to a point where we want to start eventually forking their
*  code and running private versions of it just playing around with things getting better
*  understanding it consensus actually does this they actually did it with eos and they wrote this lovely
*  report like trashing eos saying hey by the way all those claims these guys made are just not true
*  uh but you know it's nice to do that it's nice to use your competitors technology or you know
*  competing protocol technology because you learn a lot along the process it's not all bad you know
*  there's always something there because they have different trade-offs and customers that potentially
*  are more interesting like right now we're rocking how do we want to do the side chain model of
*  cardano polka dots actually a tremendously useful piece of infrastructure for that conversation
*  because they copied part of our infrastructure you know well gavin's a trained computer scientist
*  he got his phd from york and he read our papers obviously and he realized that orvores was a
*  really good starting place for building a proof of stake system so polka dots consensus is very
*  similar to ours and so if you're saying hey how do you do a good side chain model with proof
*  an orvores style proof of stake well we already have this parachain thing right and so so now
*  by just looking at that i can kind of get an idea of how one way of doing it and so that's just
*  beautiful that we live in a space where that's there it's open source and it's really good you
*  just say okay well we'll just take that and adopt that there's no shame you know the other side of
*  it is that polka dot really has focused a lot on commercial adoption silicon valley adoption getting
*  real use and utility i say in a much more sustainable way than ethereum is focused on
*  seer ethereum was kind of a spray and pray thing polka dot was more of like hey let's let's go
*  ahead and actually curate our ecosystem more carefully and we're going to build it in a way
*  where there's predictable or as predictable cost as possible with the rollout of the infrastructure
*  and you know that that's so important for a business it's not necessarily important for
*  an experiment or a startup where you know they're just trying to get populations quickly as possible
*  we'll figure out later but if you're actually sitting here saying i need to know what my
*  expenses are three years five years ten years into the future you need predictability there
*  i think they have a better shot of it than anything in f2 or or with currently ethereum
*  now they're the big contrast between the two systems those we actually have native multi-asset
*  we have a different accounting model i think our base ledger is far more expressive our rate of
*  evolution with proof of stake is much faster than theirs because they're based on derivative work
*  and we already have or worse omega and other things there i think we have a better ultimately
*  a better sidechain model will come because we have something called mithral for that
*  but we learned a lot from their work the other thing is that we thought about governance a lot
*  more carefully in my view and we have catalyst and volterra and really the key there is saying
*  how do we make sure that every single person who holds data can participate in the network that
*  wasn't a high design priority of polkadot it was more fast commercial adoption the acquisition of
*  customers will come to governance later and those were just different business philosophies but it's
*  nice to have a competitor like that and oftentimes i've said that polkadot's like ethereum 1.5 it's
*  what f2 probably should have been there was what vitalec wanted to do which was incredibly
*  aggressive and brilliant but it's a lot and there's so much execution risk in that plan and i think
*  they've had like six years of playing around with it had they gone down the polkadot road they
*  probably would have been a market with it in 2018 and because they already had the network effect
*  they would have had years of building on that iterating that and they already had a path to
*  it too all they had to do was just give elaine she and her cohorts at cornell you know five ten
*  million dollar grants no white would have been the dominant protocol not orboris in the proof of
*  stake space so it's really fascinating historically when you look at these things the rivalries and
*  what they did and what they didn't do and you know gavin had a chance to have c++ ethereum be used
*  as ibm's enterprise blockchain the only reason they didn't do it is you know it was licensed gpl and
*  i think they wanted to relicense apache if you ever talked to bob summerwall he was there at the
*  time and he had this amazing story about like these terrible fights where you know it's like
*  guys just relicense the goddamn code let's figure out a way to make this happen so that we can
*  get this huge network effect of of being basically ibm's play they didn't do it they created fabric
*  you know these types of things so there's uh there's a lot of lore and stories in that respect
*  but the space is better because of polka dot and there's a lot of good people there web 3 is a
*  good concept and you know we've run into their people in germany and zurek a lot and they've
*  always been cordial and friendly and you know really affable before i talked to you about
*  governance which is one of the most fascinating things about cardano there's a lot of stuff to
*  untangle there since you mentioned some humans in this wonderful story you did make a video
*  before we talked directed to me thank you so much for that it came from a place of love
*  but it was basically saying as as we have been you would love to talk about the technology about
*  the future that you're creating with cordano and just the future of the cryptocurrency space
*  i think you're kind of worried that you'll be talking to a journalist that's looking for
*  clickbait content that kind of thing but i'm fascinated by human beings i think you're all
*  from the outside of perspective incredible human beings i don't know about personal intentions all
*  those kinds of stuff but i think you're changing the world together in different ways and i just
*  wanted to sort of give you an opportunity if there's a in the name of love and friendship
*  is there something from your history over the past decade or so outside of technology on the
*  human side of things that you draw inspiration from you draw insight from you're just proud
*  that happened i mean it's like asking paul mccartney about john lennon yeah tell us about
*  john lennon it's like you know how much do you hate yoko for you know for almost eight years now
*  i've been it's just been this reoccurring pattern every interview tell us about your time at ethereum
*  those six months you spent there that were so pleasant and enjoyable tell us all about it
*  and tell us about your relationship with vitalik it's like i barely talk to the guy i see him
*  every now and then like every two years we say hey he says hey it's like okay maybe 10 20 years
*  in the future uh you know walt mossberg or robo walt will bring us together like he did
*  steve jobs and bill gates and we can kind of talk about you know that was a tense conversation by
*  the way the 2007 interview yeah 2007 great though wasn't it yeah that was the body language that was
*  art yeah it was that was fascinating and that was a fascinating study of human nature yeah so maybe
*  that'll be us in like 10 or 20 years who the hell knows the robot versions of all three of you yeah
*  my only point though is that you know it's a closed chapter and it's funny i was there for
*  six months i've been building cardano for years we've we've done all this stuff we've i've been
*  to 52 countries i love talking about those experiences and there's so many of them i've
*  met heads of state you know i was mongolia like eagle hunting and you know being bucked off
*  horses and riding the the sand dunes uh we we've invented all this new cool technology that's the
*  space itself is using and we've had a chance to sit on government panels uh past laws 24 laws in
*  wyoming i mean there's like all this amazing stuff that's there and it's such a fun conversation
*  there's so many superheroes in that conversation like kaelin long and taylor lim home and uh there's
*  uh alex chirponoi who we already mentioned that i met along the travels i met ralph merkel cool i
*  met all these amazing people along the way i have fond memories of uh by the you should interview
*  him by the way amazing guy does nanotech now uh you know i i met uh you know i was hanging out
*  silvia mccauley and i remember before he launched y'all grant i said you should really just do a
*  bitcoin cash style play an airdrop bitcoin what the hell you're doing distributing this
*  he's like trust me i know what i'm doing uh you know so it's like it's like so many great
*  conversations and so many great people and what i've really noticed in this industry when you
*  separate the tribalism the maxillin side there really is a a love of creativity and building
*  and there's like no other industry like it yeah i've been in many different places in life and
*  here people just love art they love beauty they love the unknown they love pushing things like
*  you know really you know in some cases not necessarily the most socially beneficial way
*  but they really love the challenge right uh and that has been fun i wouldn't trade it for anything
*  in the world the dark side of the industry is that people love labels they love saying this person's
*  this person's evil this person's a sociopath this person's not and by the way they've never met that
*  person they've never interacted with that person and they just say well i heard from this person
*  i read this book or i did that i was like oh so some books written by a journalist makes
*  fifty thousand dollars a year who's looking for a movie deal say that somebody said this or did
*  this in an unconfirmed way so what can you do sue them for slander i mean so you just let it ride
*  and you let it roll and if it was just ending there that'd be great but the problem is it
*  cascades and people just repost it and they relive it and again and again and again and then what do
*  you do about it you eventually just say i'm not going to talk about it anymore i'm done with it
*  and you move on and you say you know what if it's your problem it's your problem it's your reality
*  that you want to live in i'll be defined by the things that i achieve and do and the people that
*  we help and the things that we build and you know since i started this industry i've gotten to a
*  point where not only do we have this amazing company with these incredible people who work
*  at this company but we also have the ability to pursue amazing different interests like i met ben
*  gortzel and ben and i are going to do an a gi project together and of all places for wanda
*  and he gave me this 85 fucking page paper he was wearing that damn hat that he always wears
*  i don't i think he showers with the hat on he never takes that thing off i think he refused i
*  interviewed him and he refused to tell me the story of the hat he wouldn't tell me either i
*  interviewed him as well in wyoming and and he had every time i call him he's like he'll have his
*  shirt off he'll have the fucking hat on and now all i can think about is the hat right i wonder
*  what the story there is i know it's it's like it's got to be it's that might be the a gi yeah
*  exactly but anyway he gives me this 80 page paper and he says charles it's like the culmination of
*  everything i want to this is how we're going to do a gi and i said that's crazy ben i said i'll
*  throw some money at it so we're going to hire some developers and i have no idea where it's
*  going to go but i mean i get to hang out with ben gortzel you know that's that's fun that's the
*  kind of stuff and that's the the really cool side of the space and it's it's what i enjoy
*  in the vitalic rival the thing the ethereum thing uh you know i try my best not to mention it i hate
*  the fact that still when bloomberg or anybody else writes a story about me they'll say ethereum
*  co-founder like can you say something else well i think if i've learned anything from the internet
*  you can't resist that kind of stuff you just have to just say elon it's the joke joke it away
*  i've noticed this this already started to happen with me it's like people just make up stuff they
*  haven't made up anything interesting yet but they could and i've seen that with bill gates for
*  example just stuff being made up i mean probably half of this truth sorry i'm sorry but like you
*  know i guess what i realized this is the dark side of memes is you can just make something up
*  you know spread yeah and then that's it and that's this that's what happens but then and the problem
*  is half the world will believe it yeah it could be good stuff it could be bad stuff so i guess
*  the hope is it bounces up in the end i tend to believe you almost want to play with that
*  and not take it seriously just kind of laugh it off and enjoy life and keep creating keep
*  doing awesome stuff right operating both in the physical space with other humans and in the digital
*  space with humans and ai systems and just have fun yeah because most of us uh in the long arc
*  of history will be completely forgotten and will be mad will matter it'll all be some kind of just
*  like uh hracker's guide to the galaxy will just be one sentence that summarizes all of our existence
*  and uh the sad thing is most of us will not be part of that sentence or all of us well thanks
*  for all the fish lex thanks for all the fish the dolphins are running this thing and they're talking
*  to the ufos recently which is very interesting uh because the ufos keep going to the water so
*  we humans assume that the ufos are here to visit the aliens are here to visit us but it's probably
*  the fish no i just think it's next generation aircraft that uh we're using oh that we're just
*  not aware of but why are they talking to fish well that's the place you test hypersonic aircraft
*  is over oceans so that's the russians with their hypersonic nuclear weapons that's what
*  rods from god man rods from god so let me try to transition from ufos to abraham lincoln
*  lincoln said that nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a man's
*  character give him power do you think power and money can corrupt most people and if so do you
*  worry of this corrupting force on your own mind you're one of the leading minds in the cryptocurrency
*  space you're the leader of the cardano project you're the king of the rats of the rats uh does
*  this corrupt your mind both the power and the money of it yeah i mean you see this most pervasively
*  with people who inherit a large amount of money or title like you know dynasties like the melons or
*  the rockefellers or other people is the worst thing you can do to somebody is just hand them
*  a lot of power that they're not prepared for and the challenge with this space is like everybody's
*  young and we're all billionaires now and we have these cult followings and do all these things
*  right nobody really says no to you like for example like i have this ranch up in wyoming and
*  and it has 400 bison on it so now i'm a bison rancher like if if somebody if somebody was like
*  monitoring auditing that'd be like charles you have any experience racing taking care of bison
*  i'd be like no so you think it's really a good idea to have this ranch with 400 bison running
*  around what the hell are you going to do with bison i just have figure out what i'm going to
*  do with these bison so and i you know we'll make a video game we'll do crypto bison um but uh and
*  you're going to get one i'm not pulling out thank you i i'd love to i'm not pulling at that string
*  just yet so i'm wondering how you're going to connect this back to power right and so but my
*  point is that when you are unrestrained like literally no one can say no or you you have the
*  ability to distort reality around yourself and you're not constrained by social customs it creates
*  a situation where you start losing perspective you're not grounded anymore i think so it's less of
*  a question of will you become evil or not it's more of a question of will you lose so much touch
*  with humanity that you just can't relate or understand people and then you inadvertently
*  by your actions start harming people either through the policies that you pursue or you know
*  the things that you start building and so forth so i think the best inoculation against that is to
*  surround yourself with activities that are utterly divorced from your reputation and status the best
*  thing are animals and gardening because you know a donkey doesn't care if you're a billionaire
*  broke he'll shit on you exactly the same way you know and so so there's a humility behind these
*  types of activities and these things and there's a a honest work component like when you grow hay
*  or whatever you have to plant you have to actually water you have to irrigate you have to actually
*  be there and if you can't use some excuse while i was meeting the president of el salvador i was
*  doing this so the hate doesn't give a shit it's hey right so it grounds it connects you the other
*  thing is you have to get used to giving away all the best things in my life have come as a consequence
*  of first giving like i got started the cryptocurrency space by giving away a free class bitcoin or how
*  we learn to stop worrying or love crypto you did a free podcast right in life if you give and you
*  develop that mindset of i'm not attached to the things i have and if push comes to shove it goes
*  away usually get more back like i keep away all my ether i never received any of 293 000 ether at the
*  all-time high over 1.2 billion dollars i give it to my secretary i had no idea if it was going to
*  be worth anything or not but he kind of got shafted and i was like well they don't like me so they
*  don't like you by the transitive property of relationships so you're screwed and he's like
*  well i'm going to go back and my wife is probably going to divorce me and all this stuff and what
*  do i do i said well i'll give you my ether i don't know if it's going to be worth anything
*  so you know he's still pretty good so you know but then again regardless of doing that i now have
*  cordano i have this great career i've done all these amazing things so i think that's the there's
*  a single best way of handling power is you have to do things to keep yourself grounded in case of
*  washington he was deeply connected mount vernon during the revolutionary war he was like sending
*  letters talking about the irrigation ditches and the barn and things like that he was always
*  connected to that and then also develop a mindset that you're only here temporarily everything you
*  have is finite it's going to go away at some point no matter how much you want to keep it you will
*  die and somebody else will have it so you live for the next generation you don't live for yourself
*  you look to the future you say what am i going to leave behind what am i going to transmit
*  and then you in that kind of mindset always forces you to be more gracious cooperative and
*  collaborative with people all these dictators they are ego maniacs and they they connected these
*  fantasies and they live for themselves look at ji and china he's unraveling a power structure that
*  was what made china china today you know after mao they said we probably shouldn't have another one
*  of those guys and so he they said let's let's build something where there's checks and balances
*  and no one person is going to run the whole show or else it'll descend and regress and
*  will have problems and then what he's done he's he's thinking only about himself not the best
*  interest of china so he's systematically unraveling a system they've been embracing for over 40 years
*  and to what end after he dies the next guy who comes in even as he's super competent the next
*  guy is going to horrifically abuse that power structure and the same thing happened with the
*  romans after augustus the great emperor then suddenly down the line you have calligula
*  and nero and all these other terrible emperors that just destroyed everything that the republic
*  and the empire sought to achieve so so you have to think for the future you have to think in
*  institutions and systems you have to have things that ground yourself and you have to be fully
*  prepared to lose everything and give up everything after i left ethereum i had nothing okay reputation
*  was damaged not a lot of money nobody really wanted to work with me no one picked up a phone
*  for two whole years it was horrible and so i was a bedrock in that experience and now look at where
*  i'm at i built all the way up to that and so that wasn't by accident it was i had to surround myself
*  with amazing people why would amazing people want to surround themselves with me if i was this
*  narcissistic asshole who just looks like it's me me me everything would be a transactional
*  relationship it would be okay we'll get as much as we can and then run away as quickly as possible
*  instead it was i'm going to invest in you and maybe i'll win maybe i won't win but you know i'll be
*  the last guy to leave the boat if if they were freezing to death you get my coat and i'll just
*  deal with the cold that kind of mindset you have to have that i got that from my dad he got it from
*  his father you know my my grandfather and great-grandfather my dad said grew up montana
*  and they were like products of the homestead act very rough montana you know a lot of people died
*  and froze to death up there eaten by animals or something or shot by their neighbors and nobody
*  investigates anything because it's montana so the only way you survive is by taking care of each
*  other and being a good member of that community and if somebody gets big you feel have this
*  implicit desire to go and give back and take care of the community that you came from and invest in
*  that community like i came from the mathematical community i never completed a phd but one of the
*  things that i'm doing is i'm going to put 20 million dollars and set up a center to do automated
*  theorem proving and we're going to heavily invest in lean because i'm super excited about
*  mechanizing math and making a machine understandable i know all these guys who do this work there's like
*  all these mathematicians and computer scientists and no one pays attention to them and they they're
*  kind of like the redheaded stepchildren of mathematics and they live on the boundaries and
*  periphery meanwhile they're super passionate and they absolutely love what they do and if only they
*  had the right resources within 50 or 100 years what they're doing can probably become the dominant
*  model of how to do mathematics so i'm now in a position where i have the financial means to
*  take care of these guys so all i have to do is just call them up and say hey would you like to
*  work with oh absolutely and cut a check and it's done so the the interesting tension here so we
*  talked about ways to prevent power from corrupting a human being that's in a leadership position
*  there's a interesting case in the cryptocurrency space of bitcoin and satoshi nakamoto that's
*  basically doesn't have a leader so the the benefit of a leader is somebody that perhaps even when
*  they don't carry power maintains a little bit of a flame of a vision i suppose bitcoin has that
*  with the original work by satoshi nakamoto and and the sort of that even though it's anonymous
*  the idea still lives on through the community but nevertheless the leader is anonymous do you think
*  this is an interesting case study about leadership is for the leader to maintain anonymity it was a
*  saying from sun zu paraphrasing it the best leaders are felt but never seen yeah yeah so i
*  think that's exactly right the less the leader can be in the room and the more the principles of
*  the leader are in the room the better for the firm because what you're doing is creating more
*  leaders that way you're inspiring the next generation the next wave the next circle out to
*  act with those principles but contribute in their own way and their own flair and so you gain
*  collective intelligence inside the organization instead of just constraining yourself to however
*  the great the leader can be the other side of it is if the the leader's principles are too strong
*  so this is the dark side of it you end up with what's happened disney with walt disney after he
*  died for like 20 years people said we don't do that because walt disney wouldn't do it that way
*  or to a lesser extent apple is the only don't do that because steve jobs wouldn't do it that way
*  well he's dead he's gone move on so somebody i think asked you whether you're a clone or a deep
*  fake and you said that you admitted you slipped up on video saying that you're a deep fake
*  so on that actually a poker playing robot that escaped a lab the truth finally comes out but
*  i said on that topic who do you think is satoshi nikomoto is it possible that you are in fact
*  satoshi nikomoto no uh you know if you you you have a preponderance of the evidence
*  uh i think the most likely candidate would be adam back it's the ockham's razor candidate and mostly
*  because he's the right place right time right age right skill set you know if you look at the
*  design of bitcoin the types of decisions like the use of fourth the scripting language that was
*  pretty common in english and european pedagogy in the 1980s and 1990s is like an example language
*  for a stack-based assembly and like little stuff like that little quirks like that also he created
*  hashcash which was the predecessor of proof of work he just kind of got a chip on his shoulder
*  that microsoft never did anything with it so he's probably looking for something he grew up with all
*  the cypher punks he knew of hal finney you know he knew of all these people he knew feels every
*  health any well no because the the the code was not good enough um how was a unix linux guy he
*  was a talented programmer he was a talented developer the initial code for bitcoin was
*  developed it looked like on a windows machine you know adam worked at microsoft go figure
*  and also it was very academic and it had to be cleaned up and a lot of things had to be
*  patched up and fixed if a guy like hell developed it they probably had less of the you know let's
*  use sec p two three six k one and these types of things and more of like hey let's build this cool
*  engineering thing and we'll figure out the protocol design later on it just stinks of an older
*  academic the initial design of bitcoin and the initial rollout of bitcoin and then brilliant
*  people like greg maxwell and others they came and cleaned it all up and lo and behold where's adam
*  like the ceo of the largest bitcoin development company in the space who's trying to keep working
*  on and building out bitcoin and where the hell was adam when satoshi was around i don't i don't
*  think there was any overlap where they were both together at the same period of time but i mean if
*  you really care you can if you're you know you could even do this there's a lovely paper written
*  by the u.s army um if you just google like code stalometry u.s army it's a technique where you can
*  use uh ml and a few other things to actually kind of develop a fingerprint for the way that
*  people write code so all you got to do is take the original bitcoin source code and then take all the
*  open source repos from around that time period and before and see if there's a match between those
*  two now if he's really good at creating an alias probably not so good at obfuscating the code that
*  was written so the odds are that you'd probably find a match to a repo that's connected to a
*  real life human identity or at least a weaker opsec because you know you're younger you have
*  weaker opsec do you know if people have tried that i don't think anybody's actually done it but
*  there's actually a beautiful paper it's like 94 accurate the code stalometry so i've uh for various
*  reasons i've worked with people that work on stylometry of natural language okay uh the and
*  i think it matches closest to nick sabo if you actually do the the the written stylometry analysis
*  of satoshi's writings to so i meant stylometry as a field i didn't actually look for application
*  for this particular problem but so you're saying nick sabo is the closest match yeah somebody did
*  it years i didn't look at if the model was sounder now but i just remember reading on a bitcoin talk
*  and sabo is another one of the common candidates hell fanny sabo and adam are probably the the top
*  three things that people what do you think about this idea of anonymity of publishing something
*  anonymously would you ever consider publishing a paper you've uh you've been part of i mean the
*  cardano ecosystem has published a lot of incredible papers is there ever a value to publish anonymously
*  well every paper that goes through the referee process the authors are ripped off so you don't
*  actually see the authorship when you submit to the conference so that's just best practice
*  but the question is do you preserve the anonymity post-conference and actually
*  not reveal the author of the paper it's a detriment for the deals we make because the whole premise
*  of working with our company as an academic is that you're going to have amazing co-authors and
*  your work is going to appear in great conferences great journals and as a consequence you get tenure
*  if you publish anonymously you know it's it's like being like a doing clearance work in high energy
*  physics or something like that it's like after 30 years of this amazing career working on nuclear
*  weapons and classified reactors you know you finished and then you go to apply for a job and
*  they're like so what have you done for the last 30 years stuff where is it on your cv well i can't
*  really talk about it okay welcome to community college you know so you get you get really screwed
*  if you do that so there's a misalignment of incentives in the academic world towards anonymity
*  and generally it's only done when you're doing something very controversial or there's a
*  whistleblowing type of a component it's not typically done for foundational work and satoshi
*  was really one of the first things because like if there was a satoshi doxed himself and i don't
*  think it's possible anymore but if he or she did that that's like a noble prize in economics
*  likely you know there's there's a you're on the short list for that and there's enormous accolades
*  that would come beyond the monetary incentives of being able to dox yourself but that'd be cool if
*  they give a noble prize in economics to an anonymous to satoshi no komodo it's been proposed
*  and it was turned down yeah so yeah i mean it there are a few people in our company that have
*  done sadonomous publications like the if you look at the chimerical edgers paper that's a it's not a
*  real name it's a crazy name it's a sadonomous publication and you know but that's usually for
*  throwaway work there is one project we inherited from an anonymous person which is fascinating
*  it's called q adidas and it's basically an extension of the q ad manifesto from the 90s
*  and the pseudonym is bill white and i think it's some anonymous mathematician but i can't figure
*  out which one it is but basically it's a marketplace for deduction so it's like a it's like this magic
*  machine where you can create incentives for people to write mathematical proofs and a theory
*  improver and make some money from it so there's uh there's some cool work that's there and it's
*  sad that bill stayed anonymous because i think that could have been easily published and there
*  was a lot of really cool things that could be done with q adidas so you did say the success of cardano
*  sort of the vision you have is for you to have less and less power over time so this idea of
*  governance what's your vision for a decentralized secure governance system
*  so the first thing you have to do is you got to look at meaningful metrics not vanity metrics
*  and so what does it mean to have legitimacy in a governance system you can build any governance
*  system you want you have a dictator right like bob is in charge it's like whether you like bob or not
*  you know he's in charge that's not very legitimate and you can have pure democracy where every single
*  person votes and then nothing ever gets done you know county dog catcher is like a six-year election
*  or something like that so there's a spectrum there between absolute power to one and perfectly
*  egalitarian power to every single potential participant inside the system and then the
*  question is okay well how do you even architecture how do you handle choice architecture in that so
*  like are you asking your people about every question or are you asking your people about a
*  subset of questions related to a particular set of topics but then they're not allowed to talk
*  about other topics like for example are they allowed to change the tax rate but they can't
*  change freedom of speech that kind of a thing so the first thing you have to do when you build
*  these types of systems and they get to a certain scale is you have to build some mechanism for
*  people who are interested in governance to self-select and participate just create a
*  collection bucket and bitcoin we had bitcoin talk and bitcoin reddit and these things and eventually
*  the github repos and these things there was a place to go if you were interested and you need
*  some sort of change management system where people who want to evolve the system can write
*  it down in a very careful way so in bitcoin's case it was bitcoin improvement proposal on
*  theory it's the ethereum improvement proposal and for us it's the sip the cardinal improvement
*  proposal but it's just a structured way of discussing how you wish to change then there's
*  a question of do you want to do this implicitly or explicitly it's a case of bitcoin and ethereum
*  it's an implicit system so there's no on-chain voting there's no like five people said this and
*  four people said this so we do this in the case of cardinal we're actually explicitly inviting
*  this this is one of the biggest differentiators between cardinal polka dot eos and these other
*  things is that we're really serious about governance to the extent that we're actually
*  doing foundational research in e-voting we're building new voting systems we're exploring
*  preference voting and quadratic voting and the long and the short is that we want more and more
*  people to participate in voting for things and you have to start somewhere so we're our
*  hypothesis is we can bootstrap the system with the treasury system so in cardinal some of the
*  inflation goes to the block producers just like any other cryptocurrency but some goes into a
*  decentralized treasury she now has over a billion dollars of ada in it so it's a lot of money
*  and that treasury is not under my control or the foundation's control it's actually controlled by
*  the community as a whole through a program called catalyst and so all these people can come together
*  they can submit spending ballots and other people who hold ada can vote to approve that
*  what's nice about it is you have a growth engine to improve two two accesses one is absolute
*  participation so increase the amount of people who hold ada participating so the absolute number
*  of people participating and the other is meaningful participation so the depth of
*  participation did you just show up and vote or did you spend hours debating things on idea scale
*  the innovation management platform interacting with the funding proposal going back and forth
*  and there's there's dozens of little things like that now my hypothesis is if you run this with
*  enough iterations eventually you get to a certain critical mass like over 50 absolute participation
*  and a high level of meaningful participation where you can move beyond funding and you can start
*  actually having meaningful questions about protocol design and improvement proposals and so forth and
*  then what you can do is you can roll out new voting systems and new social structures and you
*  can let them start voting on training wheels like system parameters like for example the minimum
*  transaction fee or that k parameter for the amount of stake pools or these types of things
*  okay then they build enough competency there and they move up a next level and they actually start
*  talking about hard forks using the update system the hard for combinator system see so that's how
*  you voting on a hard fork voting on a hard fork you can't do it unless your social dynamics are
*  right your voting system is right and by the way you also need to write a constitution around the
*  same time because not all hard forks are created equally the kinds of things that would add support
*  for a new cryptographic primitive are distinctly different from the kinds of things that would
*  change your monetary policy of the system so the the constitution would be written
*  and maybe you can comment on what is the innovation management uh it's a company so we partnered with
*  a company called idea scale and they run a kind of a side platform so people are interested they
*  kind of that's kind of our version of a forum they sign up and there's special tools in that
*  platform for discussions that are productive so they don't descend into kind of like trolley
*  reddit style conversations but they're much more focused around how's your product building out
*  and by the way we're going to add more infrastructure over time in fact our chief of staff tamara has
*  and she's working on setting up an incubator and accelerator and we have lots of cool partners
*  we've talked with in that space and it's the same concept your idea comes in what enters the system
*  should not be what gets approved on the other side it should go through some sort of gauntlet
*  some sort of crucible where you iterate your way through and there's all kinds of optimizations and
*  upgrades and evolutions and combinations and destructions that occur and then by the time
*  you get the other side either the the idea just dies on the vine because it was a bad idea or
*  it's a significantly stronger far more fundable thing and potentially even gets attached with
*  accountability so you don't just fund the idea you actually fund the auditor at the same time
*  who actually holds the person accountable because the blockchain is not a real company it's
*  an ethereal thing you need a counterparty to hold someone accountable who's real
*  for that type of stuff and that type of funding so that's what we're doing this year it's like
*  we have a whole team of people partners like governance live and idea scale and papers we've
*  written and about 30 40 000 people regularly participating in this so it's a huge social
*  experiment and we're learning an enormous amount and then our goal is by the end of the year to
*  have a meaningful percentage of the entire cardinal population inside of it like 40 50 percent then
*  once you're at that threshold now you have democratic majority of the entire system and
*  you can have a real conversation about okay how do we write a constitution for this type of a system
*  and sorry to interrupt but so the constitution you know people still argue about it because
*  natural language much like poetry lends itself to multiple interpretations is it possible to formalize
*  some of these ideas that reduce the ambiguity everything is old is new again we were talking
*  about loge bond back in the day right so so there's definitely formal languages you can use
*  to express these things that's why i'm so interested in things like idris and cock and agda and
*  theorem proving because that's exactly what you're attempting to do is to express some some concept
*  or desire or construction in a language that's machine understandable and manipulatable in
*  particular how does the system know its own design so what is the reference of a cryptocurrency
*  usually it's a canonical code base like you know here's bitcoin core and the c plus plus code is
*  that is the canonical code base but actually that's not right you should have specifications
*  blueprints that are implementation agnostic as your canonical code base and can your system know
*  those specifications understand those specifications and can your change management system be for that
*  and then can you provide a proof that your client is by similar to that specification so yeah that's
*  10 years in the future but that's that's where you would go with that kind of a concept but you're
*  you're tending towards a formalism eventually but that's not necessary for the system in the
*  short term it's good enough just to have you know i know it a winner and say the haskell client is
*  that and then what you basically do is you vote on a sip and then once it's approved then you go
*  and implement that and there's some mechanism to trigger the update system to update the reference
*  client do you have an example of a sip a cardano improvement proposal like yeah like the curb benefit
*  pledge sip 007 so the 007 yeah everybody loves that yeah i can change my luggage code now lex
*  what is that so yeah so basically it just has to do with the pledge it was a pledge is a certain
*  amount of eta that a stake pool operator will set aside and connect to his pool in order to be
*  listed in the registry and actually it's connected to how much income you make as a pool operator
*  so if you set it too high you have a consolidation you have lots of pools if you set it too low what
*  will happen is larger pools will tend to fragment and actually run multiple instances of themselves
*  and so this is delicate parameter that you have to tweak and so we have a formula for it our formal
*  specification that's quite involved and so one of the community members came and said well i think
*  we can massively simplify this this design and actually get a better result for smaller
*  stake pool operators and so it's sip 007 and there's actually a lot of conversation and people
*  are thinking about it and it was it's just stunning for me because to understand how to write a sip
*  like this you actually have to read like 100 pages of mathematical prose in the formal specification
*  so the guys who wrote i was like fuck yeah this is great but that's an example of a sip but the
*  that's that's one thing but it could be as big as hey i want to add like quantum resistance to
*  the system and here's how you do that you know like quantum vrf and i want to put xmss and all
*  this other stuff so there's a lot you can do and you can do it in you can do it indirectly or
*  implicitly where there's some social process outside of the system where you eventually approve
*  a sip or you can do it explicitly where you directly vote or some representative democracy
*  some group of representatives directly votes and then once you've decided it's there the
*  constitution is necessary because you need to know the decision threshold is it super majority or
*  majority and also the voting process like a lot of policy experts believe that if brexit was a
*  multi-stage vote it would have never passed because what people would have done the initial stage and
*  all the whores of brexit would have been broadcasted society and then there would have been some
*  reluctance and buyer's remorse on it and then the second round would have failed or something like
*  that but because it was just a singular event you know it's like they passed it now british
*  are all passive aggressive about it oh sign very well we shall remove from europe and so so your
*  voting system has a lot to do with you know the outcome you get the other thing is you know what
*  type of voting is it just an absolute or is it a preference voting like so you know you pick your
*  favorite sip follow your second favorite sip or something like that you know so condor say or
*  two examples of are you a fan of those like the ranked choice vote i love them so much especially
*  for political diversity because this whole concept of throwing your vote away if it's alice or bob
*  you're always going to get a it's self-park did it best right the giant uh the turd yeah yeah you
*  know you know the you know the one third versus i forget what else douche douche versus turd douche
*  versus turd south park uh so if it's ranked order you know or preference voting you never have that
*  situation because you always pick your favorite and you get a lot more diversity on the ballot
*  but then you have eros paradox and you know all these other things that come up so it's there's
*  no perfect system and really you have to be comfortable with governance in a game of inches
*  and you start by some guiding principles and the guiding principles is more is better and
*  productive interactions are better than destructive interactions and you have to be able to quantify
*  those things as long as you have an engine that allows you to grow in those directions then you
*  have a lot more people along for the ride when you actually start talking about these bigger and
*  bigger things the other challenge was that we had to decentralize development of the protocol
*  and the brain of the protocol we have fully decentralized the brain of the protocol the
*  peer-review academic process means that there's now an academic incentive for graduate students
*  post-docs and professors to spend enormous amounts of time writing papers in our ecosystem
*  because they want tenure you know they want to and we showed that you can get it we there's been a
*  lot of people who've gotten great academic careers from working with us so yeah keep adding to that
*  pile of 105 papers this is great and that doesn't need charles hoskinson it doesn't need iohk funding
*  or anything like that they're on we're already seeing unfunded derivative work from people who
*  are completely disconnected from us writing papers about stuff in our ecosystem so just
*  continue to develop that but that's looking good the centralized development we're working on that
*  as well our goal is sometime the next few years to make sure there's at least three independent
*  clients so three completely independent teams and code bases and also to get a separation of
*  the commercial clients from the reference code and turn the reference code into like a formal
*  specification a formal blueprint and then have that change management be completely decentralized
*  the core developers are actually voted on and you know the sip process is used to change that and
*  then some way of proving that your client follows the specification as use of the protocol is there
*  beyond the cardinal ecosystem these ideas of distributed governance do you see ways it could
*  revolutionize politics yeah yeah governments oh yeah like the ethiopia deal for example
*  you know we have five million people that we brought in with the did system there that's going
*  to follow them throughout their whole life right now they're high school students but when they're
*  in their 20s 30s they're going to want to use that for e-voting and for payments and so forth
*  can you describe the ethiopia project because that's fascinating yeah so we spent four years
*  in ethiopia i went there in 2017 and shook a lot of hands kissed a lot of babies and they said oh
*  yeah we'll have it all done in six months everything is is a lot of fun there but it takes a little bit
*  longer than you you'd think to get anything done and that's okay i really love ethiopia it's a
*  beautiful country um so we spent four years we trained a whole cohort of developers and then we
*  started a relationship with the ministry of education and they care a lot about proper
*  credentials one of the biggest problems they have is when someone graduates it's really hard for them
*  to prove the quality of the credentials that they have and it really hard for them to prove the
*  knowledge that they have so if you want to be an ict outsourcer or how does a somebody know that
*  this is a real program or how does somebody really know that this is a real doctor or whatever the
*  hell you're outsourcing so they said can you come and build a digital identity system for credentials
*  so every student in the country at some point will get a did a decentralized identifier and then
*  you can prove all sorts of things about them like gpa or what particular diploma they hold or blah
*  blah blah and then the beautiful thing is the way we designed it is it's extensible to include
*  payments extensible to include proofs about themselves like are you over the age of 21 that
*  kind of stuff and then eventually it could be used to link into a cryptocurrency system in this case
*  we built it for cardinal so atala prism is the framework we're using for it every student will
*  get one and then those students will be able to use those credentials in the cardinal ecosystem
*  eventually for defy like lending and so forth so it's the largest blockchain deal of its kind and
*  it probably will grow to 20 million people over the next 24 months the other beautiful thing about
*  ethiopia that people don't know is the prime minister is a cryptographer he's in his like
*  40s 50s a young guy and he can actually read the papers we write and so he's a really bright guy
*  and he's written this beautiful agenda called digital ethiopia 2025 and one of his things in
*  the agenda is is digital identity he wants every person in the country to have a digital identity by
*  2025 and he wants to implement an e-voting system at some point for that so when you ask about
*  governance all these governance tools that we're constructing for cardinal are completely reusable
*  for nation-state a company and by the way if you create a cardinal application will eventually be
*  reusable for you because if you have a defy protocol you need a voting system why the
*  fuck do you have to reimplement that native multi-asset anything that works on ada works
*  with a native multi-asset i can you can use our voting system for your asset you get a government
*  in a box that you can parameterize any way you want and similarly when a government does something
*  with cardinal not only do they get all this amazing infrastructure but wait there's more they
*  actually get this amazing voting system that they can use for smaller large-scale decisions
*  that they want to do on the u.s side we're thinking about trying to roll something like this out in
*  the state of wyoming you know there's been tons of laws that are passed it's a very friendly crypto
*  place the very least it'd be fun to see if we can do the republican democrat primaries with preference
*  voting and voter registration this way and do it and do it completely online with an e-voting
*  system so you know that's something we'll be pursuing in 2022 you think there's some openness
*  to that yeah yeah that's the one good thing about the craziness of trump he's made like half of
*  america think the election system is completely repairably broken so you know you walk in it's
*  like we're going to go kill dominion and they're like yay that's that's great let's go do that
*  whether you believe that or not uh you know it's created a market opportunity created a lack of
*  faith and credibility in the system to improve the yeah to improve the exactly exactly what do
*  you think about el salvador becoming the first country to approve a cryptocurrency bitcoin in
*  this case as uh as a legal currency and where is this trend going first of all this event
*  if we mentioned the bitcoin conference the bitcoin folks believe that this is a monumental event
*  do you think this is a start or something new well they're both right the critics and the
*  the pro people um so the critics are saying this is a nothing burger and it's just a publicity event
*  for el salvador and then the people say this is the most monumental event they may actually be
*  right because there's reciprocal agreements when a country issues a currency other countries
*  honor that usually and it trades on forex exchanges so if like bitcoin becomes a recognized
*  currency of a country then it may be the case that the united states and european union others can't
*  actually stop them from trading on forex exchanges and being treated as a currency from a regulatory
*  perspective so it was like a really clever back door into the the league of nations and actually
*  we had this crazy hair brained idea years ago we were down in mexico at the satoshi round table
*  and we're like hey let's go buy a country let's go let's go to tuvalu and get them to do something
*  with the cryptocurrency because they sell everything in tuvalu like the dot tv extension
*  and they're fishing rice and taiwan pays them money to recognize them and so forth so i'm like
*  man maybe we can convince tuvalu to do something with crypto uh that didn't work out so well but
*  uh but now el salvador is actually playing the game and that's a real country it's got like five
*  million people and so forth so we know the president's brother and we've had some
*  conversations there so maybe we'll go you know next few months and see what's going on there
*  and do a state visit and talk to the president but it's a it's an interesting development and
*  it's one of those things that it can't quite be ignored because the nation state's doing it
*  on the other hand you have to manage expectations is the central bank taking a position in bitcoin
*  you know are they actually switching over to a cryptocurrency as their unit of account
*  are they now getting off of bis and they're all using the the settlement rails of central banks
*  are they actually block chaining the entire country and they have some broad ambitious agenda to go
*  and do all that that remains to be seen and so it really is a commitment there the other thing is
*  that if you're autocratic these systems are not so good for you because the minute you adopt these
*  types of systems you're pushing a lot of power to the edges so there's a world of difference between
*  optics and actual commitment and actual commitment is i'm prepared to accept the
*  consequences that the state is going to lose a lot of power along the way and the problem is it's
*  not clear to me some of these politicians who are pro blockchain and i'm not making a statement on
*  el salvador in particular i'm just saying in general are fully aware of that reality a lot
*  of them seem to think that somehow they can contain the blockchain genie in the bottle and
*  blockchain their whole country but you know stay president for life that doesn't work
*  once they have that power they're gone did you think once they realized that this is one of the
*  failure cases one of the things that people are concerned about is governments banning cryptocurrency
*  well that's china case right they they started realizing this was a legitimate threat to capital
*  controls into the autocratic system that they've constructed there and then suddenly china started
*  to build its own people's bank of china blockchain and bitcoin is now the redheaded stepchild they
*  didn't really care too much because it was great for corruption you could have a capital controls
*  and so all the like well-connected people there's oh yeah bitcoin's bad but then they'd have bitcoin
*  of their own and they could use it to send money around but now the governor has gotten very serious
*  about it there's a thing like okay we want to control and dominate this whole thing and it's
*  a threat to our plan for the digital you want to become the world standard to displace the dollar
*  but so the moment you have a salvador in just more and more countries say there'll be a country in
*  europe for example right that that accepts bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies cardano
*  the ideas that would put a lot of pressure on you so there'll be like this kind of ripple effect
*  right that you'll be and then the individual governments won't be able to help and eventually
*  there'll be a superpower like i don't know russia or the united states and or i don't know canada
*  so do you see that sort of an inevitable trend where cryptocurrency takes over the world as a
*  as a store of value and as a method of payments yeah probably i mean you can do just so much more
*  with programmable finance you know transactions in general have five properties you know you have
*  the asset that runs on the rail that's what we always think about and you can transact that you
*  know and then you have the identity and you transact that either like one to one one to many many
*  to one or many to many and then you have metadata so that's the story of the transactions like where
*  did it take place these types of things and then you have the contractual relationship so that's
*  the smart contract component then you embed that within regulation so transactions always live
*  within jurisdictions this is relevant to the conversation will digital currencies take over
*  because those things are right now done separately in a very fragmented and fractured way and they're
*  not completely globalized and so super expensive the hoist up this entire system and automate
*  things like compliance it's usually a huge part of every bank's balance sheet so when you look at
*  the concept of a digital currency you're saying all five of those things are programmable
*  and so they could be like library driven you say oh i want to be in compliance with
*  the eritrea okay pull up the eritrean library now you are it's built into the transaction
*  previously it's like go hire some lawyers and go figure out the entire code and translate some
*  things and rah rah rah and it's crazy um so the just the orders of magnitude efficiency gains
*  that you get and the increased liquidity you get and the fact that you can now represent all assets
*  with a universal way that financial stem cell there's an inevitability to the victory of our
*  industry the challenge is how do we deal with this with the squabbling of superpowers you know
*  china wants to be the new world standard america wants to preserve that and the rest of the world
*  is trying to figure out how do we create something that's a bit more fair and balanced
*  and so crypto comes in and it potentially is both an ally and a competitor to those desires because
*  if you do too much crypto you need the nation state anymore if you do too little crypto well
*  you know it's china or america you know so where's that what's that sweet spot do you hope
*  that in the process of cryptocurrency pushing power to the edges to the people that we would
*  be able to alleviate some of the suffering in the world caused by centralized power and the abuses
*  of power and corruption all those kinds of things 100 i made a very angry video months ago i make
*  i make angry videos i should drink lex i really should maybe you should drink more yeah i know
*  right it depends on who you ask i i made a video a little while i said you know our industry is an
*  industry of frustration it exists because we weren't the industry that charged 85 interest to
*  the poorest people in the world for loans we weren't the industry that charged 15 to move money
*  for for a maid sending money home to mom and manila you know we weren't the industry that
*  laundered hundreds of billions of dollars of drug money and funded arms dealers in africa and all
*  these things or permitted oil for food to exist and so forth and the people who did these things
*  aren't in jail they're rich they're billionaires they fly private jets so our industry is the
*  antidote to these types of things we say guys we want a system that's fair that's it and we want
*  everybody to be treated equally that doesn't mean it's everybody's going to win it doesn't mean that
*  when you lose you know somebody's going to come on a white horse and bail you out you're going to
*  have winners and losers but it's fair that's all we want that's all we've ever wanted there's no
*  coincidence that bitcoin was created right around the same time as the 2008 financial crisis it's
*  not like these were just unrelated events they're highly correlated to each other
*  okay i'd say perhaps even causal go figure and everything we've done as an industry from that
*  moment to today and beyond has been about that that that endless relentless desire to make things
*  a little bit less corrupt a little bit less nepotistic and a bit more open and it's gotten
*  so insane that they have these things in wyoming called speedy banks where your full reserve banks
*  they have 100 of their balance sheet is is accounted for they don't lend and then you
*  have the people in the banking community saying well those are a risk to banking we were we were
*  scared that these speedy banks are going to default it's like what world are you living in
*  you have fractional reserves sometimes like two percent assets on the balance sheet and then you're
*  worried that the guys who actually have a dollar for every dollar they say they have are the ones
*  that are going to collapse it's like the 1984 level double speak when you see the system and
*  negative interest rates and all these other things and so i absolutely believe the direction course
*  of this industry is is to make things more honest and fair and also by its very existence it exposes
*  double standards hypocrisy and corruption just the fact that it's there because it's one thing
*  to say that well it just can't be because of the nature of global finance there's no way to do it
*  otherwise it's another thing to see it there as an example and say well that thing is doing it why
*  can't you guys be this way that's why i'm so passionate about africa because they don't like
*  the systems they have and everybody's really young and they are going to throw all the systems out
*  in the next 20 years and they're going to replace them with something else if we get this stuff into
*  africa 1.2 billion people will be living in a considerably better system than the rest of the
*  world and then everybody else will look at that and say why the hell are those guys so rich why
*  are those guys making the money why are those guys doing so well and it's not satisfying here
*  well that's you know africa is just better no one's going to say that they're going to say okay yeah
*  you know yeah it's nepotism and corruption and you know lack of transparency and these types of
*  things so i think absolutely it has the potential to improve the human condition but humans have to
*  get out of the way humans have ingrained in themselves selfishness and it is a desire to
*  maximize them for themselves and their family and not think in systems and so we have to evolve
*  capitalism at the same time and what i mean by that is right now you're trying to maximize the
*  amount of resources you get today what we need to do is start thinking about how do we create future
*  versions of ourselves in 2100 and create a resource for that time period and then the name of the
*  game is to maximize that or balance that with what you get in the short term and then suddenly
*  you're saying to yourself well if i'm doing things that are good for me today but compromising
*  then i make less money so so capitalism as an engine is okay the problem is it's misparameterized
*  right almost like inject long-term incentives into the capital system exactly and cryptocurrency
*  space is the only economic system where that's actually possible you can create a token
*  omics scheme we're doing things that are beneficial for people you'll never meet
*  because you're long dead actually makes you money today you can't do that in a legacy financial
*  system and so forth so i think that that's the real impact capital conversation that has to be
*  had as as you explore these things is you have to talk to people and say look it's not about
*  communism or socialism versus capitalism it's not about hey let's donate and save the world or
*  try to be charity and make things better it's all about how do you use the fact that we have a better
*  toolkit to create a different system a different incentive model where the default configuration
*  of the system is long-term thinking and the default consideration of the system is get rid
*  of all these negative externalities that marketplaces have and judge the success of
*  society not by how the greatest of society are doing but by how the least of society are doing
*  you know hdi not gdp this kind of thinking and i think crypto can actually be the the vanguard
*  that kind of pushes us there and the first countries to adopt that are going to be just
*  significantly better places to live and the people who envy them will force the other countries to
*  change that's right that'd be a ripple effect so when you wake up in the morning or as you sleep
*  like a baby wake up multiple times in the middle of the night are you uh do you feel the burden
*  of of this kind of future that's in your hands and not to mess it up like uh what is it big
*  lobowski her life is in your hands dude don't worry about them they're nihilists
*  do you do you feel the burden of like because we're talking about all these you know 100 plus
*  papers and the academic beauty of the algorithms we're talking about but then there's millions of
*  human lives at stake here i mean you always feel the burden especially my own company i mean i have
*  all these people work for me and you know they eat because i pay them right so if i can't pay them
*  then that's my fault and so so you you you have to as a leader you always have to be cognizant
*  that there's all these people have signed up for your crazy vision and you have to be larger than
*  life you know you always have to be good you don't you're not allowed to have a bad day you
*  know you're not allowed to feel like shit you always have to show up you always have to be pushing
*  forward um and so that's a huge burden on many respects because there's charles the person and
*  then you know charles the ceo and these are very different things uh in terms of expectations at
*  the very least and so it's it's it's heavy in that respect that said what gives you solace is that
*  you're not in it alone you know it's lonely but you're not alone you have so many amazing people
*  around you that are willing to help and actually take some of that burden and my life has gotten
*  considerably better when i learned how to delegate and trust and even if people screw up and fail
*  it's worth the risk because ultimately you're amplifying yourself the other thing is that it's
*  okay not to get all the way you want to you want to push there but make sure whatever the hell you
*  do you leave something for somebody else to pick up and carry on that's why we care so much about
*  the publication process and open source because we'll never file a patent in our entire history
*  because whatever we do it's yours as much as it is mine and maybe i can only get you 70 percent
*  of the way and i'll plop over dead from a heart attack or get killed by an eagle or something
*  like that maybe somebody brings the eagle maybe somebody brings the hasty eagle back and it kills
*  me you know so it could happen they're bringing the wooly mammoth back talk to george church about
*  that it's a good way to go yeah i know the eagle or the mammoth i'd rather be crushed by a mammoth
*  because eagles actually fly you up and drop you it's also you won't die it'll be a slow death and
*  they probably peck at you exactly you just be grievously wounded on the ground and the eagle's
*  like slowly devouring you yeah don't don't go down that way i've lost my train of thought
*  the point is that you feel deeply great there's a bunch of people around you and then you give
*  yeah you delegate you delegate and somebody fights the eagle and other people takes care of that and
*  this that the other you just do the best you can you're in the arena you fight as hard as you can
*  you leave nothing is for home you can put it all on the field and then when you go home you have
*  pride in what you've done and you know that you've at least made a slight difference you know one
*  person can make a huge difference look at nor Norman Borlaug i mean just one our whole world
*  teaching people how to grow crops he saved a billion lives over the course of his life
*  billion people didn't starve to death because of one guy it's amazing the asymmetry and the
*  returns on that type of a thing just for the knowledge transfer of all things and yet not a
*  household name so that's the other side of it of the burdens you know people always want something
*  for something so they say oh if i endure all these burdens i should be given something
*  i entered into the space fully expecting that probably the most likely outcome was jail
*  that's what my dad told me and other people told me and it was because it's like look at where we
*  came from the liberty dollar e-gold all these things anybody tries to innovate the monetary
*  system either end up like gadaffi or they end up in prison or they end up you know like nepotistic
*  corrupt banker or something like that and so you know the financial regulations are not built for
*  rapid innovation they're not built for bitcoin there's a reason toshi was anonymous it wasn't
*  because you know enjoyed the anonyms there was legitimate criminal risk for this type of activity
*  so the fact that i've gotten this far and i'm doing pretty good that's a win you know you take
*  that life is good what is a productive day in the life of charles hoskinson look like now we're
*  getting to the details here diet like fasting or not maybe coffee non-coffee exercise sleep
*  uh scheduling like periods of deep work programming then the social media stuff that you do
*  right you clearly enjoy being on social media and also live streaming educating inspiring the world
*  or getting drunk and ranting at the computer well first off you do a wet year and a dry year
*  that's what prevents you from becoming an alcoholic so unfortunately the way that schedule worked
*  2020 was my dry year like i didn't drink the entire year not a single sip of alcohol it was all the
*  purpose yeah you do a dry year and then you do a wet year also this is one of the your ideas about
*  life as you alternate yeah you have to alternate you know never do too much of any one thing
*  well churchill never alternate he just kept drinking throughout his life he did pretty good
*  just just just to push back against yeah him and albert north whitehead although it didn't
*  churchill get kicked out as prime minister at some point so maybe he took it took yeah he was sober
*  happy in shape churchill he'd have led britain for 30 fucking years
*  see lex yeah that's why we can't have nice things uh conor s thompson maybe you're onto something
*  oh you know it's really crazy if you go to aspen and see the bar he used to go to there's i actually
*  met a waitress who knew him really well and he'd go in there like two three times a day
*  and she's like yeah he'd do cocaine right here on the table and he'd come in with lots of pills
*  and just put them all out on the table and be taking them at different hours and they were all
*  clearly illegal substances but we just give him coffee whatever you wanted he's a great guy but
*  then we asked the day in the life of charles i fast i tried to do intermittent fasting 168
*  the longest fast ever did for a long-term fast was two weeks which was just crazy wow oh my god i
*  was can you take me through the journey of like philosophically what was going on in your mind
*  well so normally when i do an extended fast is about three four days because that's the sweet
*  spot before you start losing muscle mass and other things start happening and there's people know so
*  much more about this than i do but i just feel pretty good and you kind of get addicted to the
*  fast high you know you don't have to eat you have no downtime you're just going you never your energy
*  never dips and so i i used to do like three five days maybe three four was was the sweet spot but
*  then after about a week i was like how long do i can i make this go and so i started talking to
*  people is it well angus barmary did 384 days of course i'm not as fat as angus so i said i can do
*  two weeks so i just kept going and kept going and kept going and kept going and right around the two
*  week mark you know i fainted for a little bit in a chair and i was like okay maybe i should start
*  eating again but then i was legitimately worried about like refeeding syndrome and this stuff like
*  okay how do i how do i take care of that so my brother's a doctor and i called him and i said
*  hey willy uh you know i haven't eaten in two weeks how do i how do i start eating again and he's like
*  what slowly slowly yeah so in the usual routine intermittent fasting although i haven't been as
*  good about it as i should be and i used to work out i don't do as much as that the stress and the
*  work life balance has been horrible the last 24 months and i've gained a lot of weight and all
*  that stuff but i'll fix that but i do try a lot of things like i use the calm app and i do meditation
*  recently i started doing photobiomodulation you ever heard of that no this crazy headset called
*  v light you saw that picture of me with like the weird thing with the red lights on actually
*  shoots lights into your brain it's really cool stuff but it improves blood flow and actually
*  there's some peer-reviewed studies that show that it does neurogenesis so you actually generate
*  new neurons and things like that it's really cool stuff so i do that and it actually helps a lot
*  and you know it's every day is a little different do you get a few hours of like alone time to work
*  to think yeah deep deep work is so important uh you know there's even a book on that like deep work
*  yeah by cal newport i think you interviewed him didn't you yeah everyone should listen to this
*  podcast deep questions he's awesome he's a mathematician a theoretical computer scientist
*  so those guys really need their time alone to really think that's the one thing i deeply miss
*  you know when you're a ceo you're the master of the five minute deal you come in you talk to people
*  for him you make a decision you move on the next thing you move on the next thing and i used to be
*  used to like really deep focus you'd sit down and think about something for 10 hours 15 hours 20 hours
*  and that's that and i enjoyed it it was just so beautiful to be get lost into something and just
*  go and go and go and then you become a ceo it's like you never can go and go you're lucky if you
*  read a four page thing because there's something else that comes up you know you have to try we
*  have to do that so i've been trying lately to have and actually our chief of staff recommended
*  it's like fridays is do not disturb day so it's for deep work you know you don't have meetings
*  and any of these things and so far i have not committed to that but everybody else in the
*  organization has started to move there but i my hope is next month that i can actually get serious
*  about that the other time i'm lost in thought is i do a lot of float tanks have you ever done
*  isolation tanks but i really want it it's one of the most amazing things you can do you know you
*  come out on the other side and all your stress worries they're just gone and you have so much
*  productivity and clarity if you combine that with daily naps that's the way to go yeah i'm a huge
*  fan of naps so what about the social media stuff and like you doing the live streams
*  do you ever dread those do you are you energized by those so because you're exceptionally good at
*  communicating all the different kinds of ideas and being very transparent with the community
*  all those kinds of things i really enjoy the live streams you know it's it's fun it's never been a
*  chore because it's for them you know it's a chance for people in the community who've been loyal
*  and they really love it to actually just be there ask some questions and well i try to make it as
*  entertaining as possible and you know you have your trolls and you have your your love and
*  it's actually nice to have a mixture of the two because sometimes you can beat down trolls just
*  for fun you know that kind of stuff and i and i it's grown to a cult following i think there's
*  like 40 50 000 people and it's almost like fight club in a certain respect so i was in vancouver
*  years ago and i was at air canada checking in just about to fly back to colorado and i was
*  getting this weird vibe from the guy that was checking me in and then right after he takes my
*  bag he kind of leans over to me he's like i love aida you know and i was like really he's like yeah
*  i watch your live streams and then i was flying into london i was london heathrow airport and the
*  passport control guy was there and i was just about to take my passport out and he says welcome
*  to london mr hoskinson i was like oh god am i going to jail in london why does the border
*  patrol guy know who i am this is this is a bad deal for me and it turned out he watches my
*  he watched my live streams and so there's there's a lot of that in the and and that's that's so much
*  fun in fact here in austin as a mexican restaurant just down uh uh close to this place and while
*  eating there two different people recognized me and i took a picture with one of them and again
*  they watched the live streams so that's well if there's anything like fight club you have to
*  wonder if some of those people or all of them are just figments of your imagination right i would
*  i don't i don't have an answer for that like
*  i could be a figment of your imagination which just proves that yeah but honestly if i was capable
*  of that level of delusion why the hell don't i look like brad pet good point okay so uh on this
*  topic let me ask you about mushrooms you're interested in mushrooms growing mushrooms
*  i believe you are also interested in the mind expanding capabilities of psychedelics at least
*  you mentioned kind of the interesting place where your interest in non-psychedelic mushrooms might
*  go can you explain the nature of your interest in mushrooms is it personal is it business is it both
*  oh it's a little bit of everything you know it's just an underexplored area of science and botany
*  that ought to be explored because there's so much cool interesting stuff there uh mushrooms do so
*  much like these have these things called corticeps and they are like a zombie fungus that infects
*  insects takes them over and then it will have them kind of get to other insects and then burst out
*  of their head like uh like an alien and spray spores on them and repeat the process i mean they
*  even made a damn game about this the last of us or something like that and this is a real thing
*  like you can google it and see like these dead ants with these fungal stabs coming out of them
*  it's like holy god this is crazy and and in the same same topic you go all the way to lion's mane
*  and it could actually help treat alzheimer's and treat depression and parkinson's and regrowth
*  nerves and so forth other things they've shown some effectiveness against covid you know it's
*  just so crazy the diversity in the mushroom kingdom of the medicinal applications the
*  pesticide applications you can use it a lot to kind of save hay and trees there's a lot of things
*  you can do that to combat all kinds of invasive species and they it's true there's a lot of cool
*  stuff with psychedelic mushrooms and there's great book called from michael pollen uh how to change
*  your mind where he was really the first journalist a long time to go and roland krifftis work his
*  way through the johns hopkins studies but the long and short for me when i read that book like okay
*  mine expansion is great but look at the effectiveness of psychedelics uh you know
*  philosophy mushrooms with ssrs selective serotonin read-up take inhibitors for the treatment of
*  depression they showed in the johns hopkins studies that they're equal or better in effectiveness in
*  many cases yes fascinating uh for the treatment of depression then a drug that you have to take
*  forever and this is just one or two treatments and then you you desist from it that's a miracle
*  because there's so many people suffer from severe depression and it's a lifetime ailment
*  and the fact that we have something in the toolbox that we've under explored is a very powerful
*  thing the other thing was end of life issues a lot of people get cancer i've lost people in the
*  family from cancer and it's so hard those last two three months because they kind of like have this
*  this they're in a horrific pain they're trying to find meaning and why is this happening to me
*  and if you can just give them a substance that on the other side of it there's a good chance they
*  can come to peace with everything and and die with a lot more dignity and happiness that alone
*  justifies an enormous amount of study and the fact that these things are super cheap and they grow
*  pretty much anywhere it's pretty cool now on the commercial side you can make a lot of money from
*  mushrooms um and i'm working with a company called farm box foods and it's one of the
*  they do both vertical hydropartic farming they also do uh mushroom and you know they they put
*  these amazing labs and and shipping containers that are kind of like controlled environments
*  you grow 400 pounds of gourmet mushrooms a single week off of that and your margins can be up to 30
*  per year if you're just selling them for food consumption if you're doing supplements they can
*  be even higher than that so it just kind of made sense from a diversification of assets to say hey
*  let's do some stuff in hydroponics and aquaponics and in mushrooms but the more i do the more i
*  learn that community just the the cooler that community is like i went to this beautiful
*  mushroom festival in cape springs down in georgia and i met this guy named bill yule and he just
*  looks like a druid you know just like like he lives in a tree and he opens up the tree and goes out
*  everything and i was like bill what do you do so i go and i i try to study beetles and boletes in
*  a very particular type of beetle and uh and they mate in the most crazy way is like this this beetle
*  will fuse on top of another beetle and they'll vibrate and if they make the right harmony she'll
*  mate with him otherwise they'll kick her off and you can only make the harmony while you're on a
*  specific type of bolete mushroom if it's anywhere else the harmony it's like who the fuck does it
*  it's like 20 years 30 years just thinking about goddamn beetles and bolete mushrooms
*  but that's that community and they're the happiest people you'll ever meet and they're just so much
*  fun to talk to and uh there's just so much lore there that's not discovered the other thing is
*  there's a ton of undiscovered mushrooms so you know you go to my ranch up in wyoming go out
*  that national forest next to it you'll probably discover six or seven new species just just doing
*  some gene sequencing and things like that so there's like a like a gold rush for new things
*  to discover to treat all kinds of things so i love mushrooms love that community i think there's a
*  lot of wonderful medicinal properties and uh everybody there is just a lot of fun to hang
*  out with the other passion is aquaponics and hydroponics and i got a lot more serious after
*  covid i go to the supermarket all the store shelves are barren and i say guys can you imagine
*  if like we had a real big thing what this would be like we need to have domestic food production
*  we need to have resilience at the community level so let's go build a 40 50 million dollar
*  aquaponics facility next to every major city so at least you have some local production of
*  food and people won't starve to death otherwise it's it's very bad and again the margins are
*  phenomenal they're 20 30 if you actually do it right and alternate your crops properly and so
*  forth and you create a lot of high paying jobs with it as well and so you kind of draw a lot
*  of value from staying close to nature in all of these kinds of ways they're keeping you humble
*  like you said uh what is it the goat is still gonna crap on you oh yeah the donkeys will shit
*  on you whether you're broke or a billionaire that's a good line that's the like
*  they'll be your the line you'll be remembered for right if the universe has a sense of humor
*  that's it's a neo yogi bearer so uh i think mushrooms is a good place to uh to ask about
*  my uh friend joe rogan so i keep folks from the cardano community kept saying keep saying things
*  like uh lex podcast first then joe rogan experience i guess i'm the moon and joe's mars in this
*  metaphor uh since i'm a cs person i can talk a little bit uh more fluently about cryptocurrency
*  because fundamentally uh cryptocurrency is a computational idea but then there's somebody
*  like joe who's more like an everyman he does not necessarily know the technical intricacies of
*  cryptocurrencies what kind of and i don't think he's had a cryptocurrency person on did he
*  interview andreas on tonopolis oh he did that's right a long long time ago but that was almost
*  like um you know the cryptocurrency space goes through phases and i think we're in a new era
*  of some kind right and what how do you talk to joe about cardano how do you talk to joe about
*  what the heck i remember something you tried to explain to him what dogecoin is
*  how do you explain this whole space of what bitcoin is of where ethereum is of where cardano
*  smart contracts and some of this proof of work with this proof of stake ideas that we've been
*  talking about you don't what you do is you start with applications that they're interested in so
*  he's an elk hunter and so he's probably interested in elk tags right so you start there and you say
*  that whole system can be put on a blockchain and here's how it's going to be better for you
*  you see that's what you do you always connect it to something they know and love and then once
*  they get that they say oh that's really cool and then they ask what else can you do with it what
*  else can you sell me on it and you kind of work your way outwards there problem technologists
*  make is they're so damn in love with the technology they have that tail wagging the dog where they just
*  want to talk about the technology and how incredibly cool it is and that's fun it's like
*  talking about math oh god let's talk about co-bordisms that's fun all right everybody's
*  eyes glazed over you know you always have to connect it to the interest of the particular person
*  and what they care about what they love what they need royalty payments you know he's a big guy he's
*  got the spotify thing he's got all these things going on intellectual property is probably pretty
*  important joe at some juncture so nfts we can talk about this concept of perpetual royalties
*  so for example let's say that you create a piece of art you can build into the token itself a
*  perpetual royalty does something you care about maybe every time it sells it pays it back to you
*  or maybe every time it sells it donate to some clean water charity or something like that the
*  point is that the actual acquisition of the nft requires adherence to that smart contract so people
*  can't deviate from your desire even after you die so you know stuff from andy warhol or from picasso
*  that can still be generating some donation every time a picasso sells to something else you can do
*  that with nfts and so he starts thinking god what else can i do i do shows maybe i can do my tickets
*  with these types of things maybe i can do loyalty points for my fans so now you got him engaged and
*  he's thinking all the opportunities for him and it gives him an incentive to anchor and connect to
*  those concepts and then over time he starts asking questions well how do we know it's secure then we
*  can talk about proof of work or proof of stake or these types of things well so this is how it stays
*  secure if you're really interested and there's there's an incentive to have the attention span
*  necessary to do the homework eat the broccoli and get over that hill but it's also an opportunity
*  at least it was for me especially with bitcoin a while ago is to take another look at the monetary
*  system or even look at the you know i've been looking quite a bit at the history of the 20th
*  century and sort of look at that history through the perspective of the monetary system the gold
*  standard and all those kinds of things and just add that little layer of consideration of how much
*  money of how money can be used to by people in power to control the populace right and it's
*  it's a it's fascinating to look at the history from that perspective and then that allows you
*  to look at the future of how we can change that in order to empower people and then of course the
*  the the governance thing that you're working on is fascinating because
*  i mean i don't know but it seems like a deeply broken aspect of our government is just the voting
*  system and discussing how that could be revolutionized is fascinating because a lot of conversations
*  end up being on you know on the internet about like number go up which is like financial side and to
*  me personally at least i think that's the same for joe is that's just boring like it's the investing
*  the financial side of it i know it has a lot of impact but it's kind of boring right because long
*  term is not going to have any impact if the idea is a strong long term it's going to win right the
*  ideas are weak long term is going to lose the ups and downs of the short term don't matter that's
*  just like casino games that you play speaking of games video games gotta ask you about those
*  okay will you mention diablo maybe you're a fan of diablo yeah yeah it was great sky room was great
*  sky room was great too like the elder scrolls i actually bought the game that the elder scrolls
*  was based on do you know that so uh way back in the day the elder scroll series was inspired by
*  a game called legends of valor that i played when i was a little kid and it doesn't actually have
*  an ending they ran out of money before they finished it so they just kind of like put this
*  little thing on and said okay but you never finish it so i actually bought all the intellectual
*  property for the case all that i didn't know there was a connection between legends of valor
*  yeah yeah i forget the name the guy was it tod something at bethesta he uh he was he played it
*  he was inspired by it and then he created arena right after playing it that was such a good game
*  arena daggerfall yeah yeah yeah i had a copy of daggerfall when i was a kid but it had a bug and
*  so when you left the dungeon it would crash and this was before like you can get an easy patch for
*  it so i never actually played daggerfall i entered in through morrowind yeah no the daggerfall was
*  uh the the fascinating thing which jumping all over but we'll return to legends of alxette i
*  want to ask you about that but daggerfall was fascinating because i think of all the other
*  school games it was like the largest because it was uh like randomly generated right it would
*  like randomly generate the worlds the the dungeons and so on which is fascinating to think about like
*  how big can you make the world uh both in actuality and feel like it's incredible to have a video game
*  i don't know how many video games do this well where the feeling is you can be lost here forever
*  you can you can live here uh because most video games have like a bottom it feels like you can
*  run out of stuff when daggerfall was like i can just keep doing this right at least that's what
*  i felt at the time but yeah why what the heck legends of valor what's the idea there well i
*  mean it's there's really nothing about it that's super compelling today i mean there's a nostalgia
*  of youth that's there but i mean it doesn't even have a class system a level system the combat
*  system is terrible there's no journal the magic system is terrible and so forth and so i i just
*  wanted to start somewhere and i felt like that would be an incredibly fun overhaul project i kind
*  of got the idea from beam dog studios when they did another one of my favorite games remember
*  baldars gate yeah they did that baldars gate too oh yeah the enhanced edition was great they should
*  have never just done thrown a ball they should have done an actual proper sequel and i got down
*  that whole road um but anyway uh i got the idea there i said well take some old piece of ip and
*  then you can kind of retrofit it and clean it up and what's nice about legends of valor is it's a
*  blank slate you can do your own elder scrolls you can create your own class system and level
*  system and so forth you could write some beautiful exciting fun narratives for that and also it gives
*  me a chance to explore a lot of things i think should be dragged into game development like
*  algorithmically generated music is one example the problem with sound games as you mentioned you play
*  lots and lots of hours but your sound content is much smaller so you have tons of repetition in the
*  soundtrack so what if you could you know connect the music to the state of the game world and
*  automatically through some process will generate music and there's actually people who study this
*  you know and so that's one dimension the other thing is you have things like gpt3 and so forth
*  there was a great game uh event zero uh and it came out like 2016 where you could actually have
*  a dialogue with an ai uh and you're like a marooned astronaut on a space station that's abandoned
*  and you have to somehow work with this ai through communicating with it to convince you to to take
*  you home but the ai is a bit duplicitous and i don't want to spoil the plot of the game because
*  it's such a cool game but it's actually like a paint by never it's almost like zork where you
*  you don't have pre-selected dialogue you actually type in the terminal and the ai will reply to you
*  back and forth and this was 2016 and it's like things have gotten an order of magnitude better
*  so the evolution of that tech i think within the next five years brought into video games could you
*  give you incredibly cool dialogue inside the inside the game so algorithmically generated
*  music better dialogue better gameplay mechanics also i'd love to explore alternative physics
*  systems you know alternative geometries like you know uh hyperbolic geometry or these types of
*  things and there's actually hyperbolica is a game that does that and you can do down the euclidean
*  geometry as well and bring those elements into a game design and that's what we'll do is legends
*  of valor so it'll be kind of like skyrim but with a lot of really cool new shit it's kind of like
*  i saw aerosmith years ago and he was out there he's like do you like the old shit do you like
*  new shit kind of middle shit you know so so you're going for the middle yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna try
*  to do some of the old and some of the new and you know bring it in so that'll be a lot of fun um and
*  what's nice about it is that uh there is a lot of of new play in the market because of the microsoft
*  acquisition of pathesta they've been losing employees like crazy and there's a lot of
*  belief that elder scrolls 6 will not live up to expectations because microsoft will i will tweet
*  okay listen to me i will go into i'm all about love on the internet but i will go hard at you
*  microsoft if you screw up elder scrolls well we might have to do a spiritual successor right
*  and it might have to happen with legends of valor you never know right uh but it's a passion project
*  so i have no time for it at all it's like so low on my list of things to do so i'll probably do
*  in 2022 2023 and we'll build a nice crew and we'll do it wyoming probably in wheatland or some really
*  small town and we'll import everybody and then we'll have to build the whole city up like elan
*  is doing here in texas it'll it'll be a fun project well i like programmatically generated music you
*  mentioned balders gate i there's by the way haskell frameworks for that uturpy is one for generating
*  music yeah for doing it for i wonder how successful that could be because i i remember
*  balders gate was the first game when i realized music is so important to the game it was the thing
*  i remembered about the game it was the reason that it was the thing i thought about when i was away
*  from the game is like that the feeling it created that music i don't even remember the music anymore
*  but i remember that music was jeremy soul i think was the composer yeah it was great and actually
*  getting like ramajewati or bear macready in to do that it would be so cool okay this is awesome
*  uh ridiculous question what's the maybe let's say top three graded video games of all time
*  uh yeah balders gates definitely in the top three arcanum is my favorite game and arcanum was
*  troika games was just this amazing studio where they they took the time to build probably the
*  the most compelling game worlds in the case of arcanum it takes place in like kind of like a
*  19th century victorian england play so steampunk but then there's also magic inside this game world
*  and there's this crazy juxtaposition between magic and technology and the more technology you have
*  magic stops working the more magic you have it disrupts technology so all the people on the
*  magic side hate the technology people and vice versa and so you're just this character in this
*  game world and you're just trying to figure out like where do you fit and uh it has this incredible
*  plot where you're you're kind of just a stowaway on a zeppelin that gets shot down and you get
*  dragged into this conspiracy and you have to kind of figure out the conspiracy as you go through the
*  whole game world and you meet all these different races like the elves and the dwarves and so forth
*  and they've all been impacted by the proliferation of technology in different ways like the humans
*  use steam engines to clear cut all the forest and it caused a lot of problems the dwarves leaked
*  that technology to the humans and so they kind of got exiled for it and so forth and you have to
*  decide like where do you fit all this and you have a lot of choices as a player you can be on
*  the magic side the technology side kind of be neutral there's like 40 different endings for the
*  game it's just incredible this is all like 2000 and you talk about a procedurally generated world
*  you have a quick travel but if you want you can just walk and the world randomly generates but it's
*  not like daggerfall where there's interesting things along the way so it was really ahead of
*  its time and it was kind of the last of a generation of games um it was based on the same
*  framework that interplay used for fallout the original fallout fallout 2 so that was really a
*  cool setup how were the graphics they were not as interesting oh it's isometric three uh top down
*  so oh cool yeah kind of like the fallout look and so uh it doesn't hold up super well today but
*  that was never the point it was a more of a story driven game but it was one of the very few games
*  where at the very end of the game you can actually talk the villain into killing himself instead of
*  fighting you if you if you and you had to really work at it you had to become a master of persuasion
*  and get your charisma score maxed out and learn all this stuff along the way and you have this
*  philosophical debate over the nature of life and death with him that's amazing yeah and then you're
*  just like by the way you're wrong and here's why and he's like oh yeah you got a point i'm just
*  gonna kill myself i was like wow this is great planescape torment is uh the other one i think
*  is probably the greatest what's it called planescape yeah it's another one on the infinity engine which
*  was what was used for baldars gate so it looks like baldars gate and god that was such an
*  incredibly well written game you play this character called the nameless one and this
*  little blue guy and you wake up in a morgue and it turns out that you're immortal and every time
*  you die you lose all your memories and so you've just been apparently living this life for a very
*  long time and you meet all these people in this crazy city called sigil who know you but you don't
*  know yourself and you're trying to figure out your name your identity and why do you have this curse
*  where you live forever but you keep forgetting every time you get killed and it turns out you
*  weren't such a nice person throughout this entire game world but then again it's this question of
*  well if you can start over and you lose all your memories do you have a chance for redemption
*  or not so it's incredible game planescape torment and it's actually another one of those games where
*  you can you can never actually have a fight you can just kind of talk your way out of everything
*  and there's probably like thousand pages of dialogue inside the game those guys have a lot
*  of fun and a lot of drugs making that game do you think these are the these three games are the
*  kinds that would still be okay to play today or are they forever lost in time because uh
*  because we sort of are got desensitized to the richness of computer graphics and all those kinds
*  of things in modern games i think you can enhance these games because your storytelling medium is
*  so much more engaging you know i was at the movie theater before covid and the person to the left of
*  me was looking at their cell phone during the movie and the person to the right of me was looking at
*  their cell phone they're just not engaged anymore everybody is attention starved and the video game
*  is one of the last mediums where you have undivided attention of people they're really into it they're
*  all into that thing and so i think the fact that you have vr and ar and enhanced graphics and
*  all these new gameplay mechanics it's a value add instead of a value negative because ultimately
*  what are you doing telling stories and you're trying to connect people to something maybe it's
*  the nature of life and death or are we truly real are we in a simulation or not or something
*  like it'd be great to do 13th floor as a game or something like that and the question is well how
*  good of a story can you tell well you're constrained by your storytelling tools and technology the fact
*  that games are so much more advanced now means that you now have many more dimensions of storytelling
*  available to you and actually with ai now coming in and really good ai coming in the next five or
*  ten years your storytelling is not static anymore the person can actually majorly participate and
*  change the outcome of ways that were previously unpredictable the other thing is they're still
*  educational you can teach people concepts that they never knew before and it's like if you want
*  to teach people about bizarre geometries or like minecraft is a great example a lot of people
*  learned how computers work from redstone think about that it's true yeah yeah they use i mean
*  yeah as we said we're more and more going to be living in the video game worlds might as well
*  sort of uh as opposed to just make it fun also expand our knowledge expand our ability to think
*  like uh explore different ideas and do education broadly defined within those video game worlds so
*  we do the entirety the entirety of life in in the video game worlds hopefully doesn't look like
*  we'll see do you have advice for young people today aside from playing lots of video games
*  you know high schoolers college students thinking about their career thinking about life
*  well we no longer live in a world where you get one skill set you do it for 40 years and retire
*  i mean that that ship has sailed a long time ago so learn how to learn and learn and appreciation
*  and love for learning so that's the first thing you know josh wateskins wrote this beautiful book
*  the art of learning if you ever read it stuff like that so good study skills you know slipbox
*  notes these things what was it um zettel castan or whatever was it yeah there's a lot of little
*  techniques that you can pick up along the way and basically the teacher had to process lots of
*  information very quickly retain it and then decide what's useful to you for that moment
*  the second thing is do not undervalue eq emotional intelligence we we've lived for a long time in a
*  society where iq was dominant it's like how smart you are excuses everything else you can be a
*  horrible human being but he's a really bright guy right the asshole mathematician or physicist
*  we now live in a world where the balance is far more important you have to be smart but you also
*  have to be a nice guy and don't undervalue that so learn things like closed circuit communication
*  and active listening these skill sets will always pay enormous dividends along the way
*  third remember that you're judged for the things that you have and what you do with those things
*  you know if you have very little you still have to do something with you have a lot you have to do
*  even more so learn how to give and do that early on learn how to give back volunteerism charity
*  mentoring these types of things those are so incredibly valuable to a person's development
*  the people that you mentored in the academic world you learn this you have graduate students
*  they one day will be professors and it might just so happen they might eclipse you remember
*  gouse had a doctoral advisor never forget that you know and so did Feynman make sure that you
*  mentor people you give back and you learn how to learn and you learn how to teach super important
*  for your development as a person now you'll notice all those things are agnostic to whatever domain
*  you happen to have chosen you could be in medicine or law or technology whatever that's your fancy
*  whatever your passion happens to be and don't conflate your earning in your career if people
*  try to keep putting these things together they're increasingly becoming decoupled there's a lot of
*  cases where people do their passions and they do it for free or you know for sustenance but then
*  they have something else they do on the side to also augment or supplement their income probably
*  best that way when you conflate the two you tend to get burnt out terribly you see this a lot with
*  musicians or other people they just they want to make music but they have to tour or whatever
*  because they got to pay bills stuff like that happens other than that i mean i i'm not a guru
*  i'm not in any particular position you showed up in a robe which i thought was kind of weird
*  and you had a crown and you kept calling yourself king king of the rats and that was in a robe that
*  was a ukada okay thank you for clarifying audience he's joking reddit i heard somebody's going to
*  write blog post charles hoskinson walks walks around with a crown let me ask you a ridiculously
*  big and the most important question what's the meaning of this whole thing of life well i got
*  a story for that does this have something to do with the farm well no no no it's from japan i
*  used to live in japan i live in osaka rax to namba beautiful area it's like if you're gonna live
*  anywhere in japan live in osaka you live anywhere in osaka live next to the restaurant district at
*  four o'clock in the morning get good ramen these are the things in life that make you who you are
*  so there was a shogun and he was kind of a badass he was really good killing people really good at
*  running his empire and then he got a bit disgruntled in his late 40s and he said you know i'm just going
*  to give it all to my son and i'm going to wander around japan until i find the perfect cherry blossom
*  that's what i'm going to do everybody thought he went crazy he said no no no that's what i'm
*  going to do and he took his whole entourage with him and so his son is now the shogun and
*  and then he's just wandering throughout japan and having all these incredible crazy adventures
*  as he's wandering throughout japan you know fighting bandits and loving beautiful women
*  and so forth and then 30 years later he's passing these two geisha gals and one of them turns around
*  and they notice him slumped over next to a cherry tree and so she goes over to try to rouse him and
*  he's dead and in his hands is a wilted cherry blossom that's a very japanese story right
*  the point is that it's not the actual blossom finding the perfection that matters it's the
*  it's the things you do on a day-to-day basis the places you go the people you meet the experiences
*  you have and the joy you take and the things that you do here in the moment now you have to get there
*  you know if you look at jiro dreams of sushi there's this guy 70 years of his life making
*  the same damn piece of sushi again and again and again he's the happiest guy around elbert camu
*  and his story of sisyphus you know sisyphus should be miserable it's the greek curse no he's happy
*  he has total clarity of purpose and every day he gets to basically roll that stone just a little
*  bit better than the day before a different way than the day before and it's not the destination
*  it isn't getting the stone up to the top of the hill that matters it's the fact that the act you
*  find that joy in that act that ikkigai that way of life that purpose of life that i think is the
*  closest thing a human can get to a meaning you're a blip you know you you didn't exist
*  you're dead and if you compare it to the size of the universe in that time it's just a little
*  blip so all you can do with what you have is just find meaning in the things that you do on a daily
*  basis and you can't predict the macro we have all this wealth and power in america what if a world
*  war breaks out we could be destitute like warmark germany and so you know you could be a big guy you
*  can be now living on the street side would you be miserable the point of life is getting to a point
*  that no matter what comes your way what misfortune comes your way you're in a position where you can
*  find an modicum of happiness and love and empathy for others in that moment and then the highest
*  pursuit of life is the ability to share that mindset with other people and give it to them
*  somehow and that's that's really hard you know because everybody comes they're always eor oh
*  doom and gloom and cynical you and but this and that a reputation this that you have to somehow
*  transcend all of it and say you know that doesn't matter look at the cherry blossoms aren't they
*  beautiful today and let's find a better one tomorrow see the you're also a fan of fishing
*  i've read somewhere yeah and one of my favorite books is old man in the sea uh where there's an
*  old man sort of battling a big fish and basically closing out the last chapter of his life in this
*  battle so i think another aspect of life with this boulder it feels like the boulder gets bigger and
*  bigger as we get closer to to uh to death and you know you you find yourself married to a particular
*  struggle uh in life that eventually just kind of um overtakes the entirety of meaning of your
*  existence do you think uh i know what it is for me uh do you have something like that the broader
*  vision that unites your work with cardano and everything you've done in life the the big fish
*  that you're going to end up in uh in the dark of night struggling with in the end the last chapter
*  of your life like the big problem you're taking on well in mathematics it was the goldbach conjecture
*  i'd like to prove that that's probably that's a really big fish so do you still have a love
*  for mathematics oh god yeah of course i do um you never lose that you never lose it you lose the
*  ability to do deep work and you don't have the creativity and the the raw inspiration this is
*  why i've gotten to automated theorem proving because what i lack and because i'm getting older
*  i can now have computers understand it and use ai to just solve this stuff it's like the cheat
*  codes for math you know so fuck those guys we'll we'll still do that but you know mathematics still
*  has those those last passions and you know there's all kinds of cool things that i'd like to see done
*  like quota complexes allow you to unify topology and number theory in really novel ways and there
*  are all kinds of cool things but who cares um it's it's everybody has those those white whales another
*  thing i love to do is bring back the woolly mammoth you know that's george church's you know
*  hidden pleasure in five to ten years it's actually going to happen and i have this beautiful ranch in
*  wyoming and i gotta find a way to convince george to let me raise his his clone mammoth fence
*  on my ron the bison among the bison they'd probably get along really well and then i have
*  to learn all these cool things about woolly mammoth like you know do you shave them in the
*  summertime and let them get shaggy during the winter or do you just let that coat go and then
*  fall who knows you're like it's an undiscovered country i just had i just had the image of
*  charles hoskinson alone on a bison farm trying to raise a a woolly mammoth and just start wearing
*  a white suit and say welcome to hoskinson's ranch i'll have a cane with amber on it yeah with the
*  chalkboard that you keep scrambling on like uh the beautiful mind the movie and you'll have voices
*  oh the schizophrenia has already come you guys are all figments of my imagination anyway now one of
*  my goals though you know i love catfish and they live a long time they get really damn big if you
*  see those guys i'd love to catch one now and be in my 60s and catch the same fish twice
*  and recognize it maybe i'll lift a scar or something you know that'd be really cool
*  going back to the fish thing you know yeah because both the fishes gone through a lot i've gone
*  through a lot we can just be like reminisce exactly exactly and then i'll die of a heart
*  attack and my mammoths will eat me that's something to look forward to uh charles this was one of the
*  most amazing conversations i've ever had it's truly an honor that you would uh spend your valuable
*  time with me and i'm glad you exist in the cryptocurrency and the technology space and
*  i can see your love for mathematics and your love for life just radiate through everything you do so
*  thank you for being you and thank you for talking to me today it's a lot of fun thank you so much
*  lex thanks for listening to this conversation with charles hoskinson and thank you to gala games all
*  form indeed express vpn and eight sleep check them out in the description to support this podcast
*  and now let me leave you some words from william faulkner you cannot swim for new horizons until
*  you have the courage to sight of the shore thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
