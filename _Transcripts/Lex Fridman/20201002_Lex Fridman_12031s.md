# Michael Malice: Anarchy, Democracy, Libertarianism, Love, and Trolling | Lex Fridman Podcast #128
**Lex Fridman:** [October 02, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIk1zUy8ehU)
*  The following is a conversation with Michael Malus, an anarchist, political
*  thinker, author, and a proud part-time Andy Kaufman-like troll, in the best
*  sense of that word, on both Twitter and in real life.
*  He's a host of a great podcast called You're Welcome, spelled Y-O-U-R.
*  I think that gives a sense of his sense of humor.
*  He is the author of Dear Reader, the Unauthorized Autobiography of King
*  Jong-il, and The New Right, a Journey to the Fringe of American Politics.
*  This latter book, when I read it, or rather listened to it last year, helped
*  me start learning about the various disparate movements that I was under-educated
*  about from the internet trolls to Alex Jones, to white nationalists, and to
*  techno-anarchists.
*  The book is funny and brilliant, and so is Michael.
*  Unfortunately, because of a self-imposed deadline, I actually pulled an all-nighter
*  before this conversation, so I was not exactly all there mentally, even more so
*  than usual, which is tough because Michael is really quick-witted and brilliant.
*  But he was kind, patient, and understanding in this conversation, and I
*  hope you will be as well.
*  Today, I'm trying something a little new, looking to establish a regular structure
*  for these intros.
*  First, doing the guest intro like I just did.
*  Second, quick one or two sentence mention of each sponsor.
*  Third, my side comments related to the episode.
*  And finally, fourth, full ad reads on the audio side of things and on YouTube,
*  going straight to the conversation.
*  So not doing the full ad reads.
*  And as always, no ads in the middle because to me, they get in the way of the
*  conversation.
*  So quick mention of the sponsors.
*  First, SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool I've ever come across.
*  I don't like looking at numbers, but someone probably should.
*  It helps you make good decisions.
*  Second sponsor is DoorDash, food delivery service that I've used for many years to
*  fuel long uninterrupted sessions of deep work at Google MIT, and I still use it a
*  lot today.
*  Third sponsor is Masterclass, online courses from the best people in the world
*  on each of the topics covered from rockets to game design to poker to writing and to
*  guitar with Carlos Santana.
*  Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to
*  support this podcast.
*  As a side note, let me say that I hope to have some conversations with political
*  thinkers, including liberals and conservatives, anarchists, libertarians,
*  objectivists, and everything in between.
*  I'm as allergic to Trump bashing and Trump worship as you probably are.
*  I have none of that in me.
*  I really work hard to be open minded and let my curiosity drive the conversation.
*  I do plead with you to be patient on two counts.
*  First, I have an intense, busy life outside of these podcasts.
*  Like it's 4 a.m.
*  right now as I'm recording this.
*  So sometimes life affects these conversations.
*  Like in this case, I pull an all nighter beforehand.
*  So please be patient with me if I say something in eloquent, confusing, dumb,
*  or just plain wrong.
*  I'll try to correct myself on social media or in future conversations as much
*  as I can. I really am always learning and working hard to improve.
*  Second, if I or the guest says something about, for example, our current president,
*  Donald Trump, that's over the top negative or over the top positive, please don't
*  let your brain go into the partisan mode.
*  Try to hear our words in an open minded, nuanced way.
*  And if we say stuff from a place of emotion, please give us a pass.
*  Nuanced conversation can only happen if we're patient with each other.
*  If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review the five stars and Apple
*  podcast, follow on Spotify, support on Patreon or connect with me on Twitter,
*  Alex Friedman.
*  And now here's my conversation with Michael Mallis.
*  There was a Simpsons episode where he starts mixing like sleeping pills with
*  like pet pills and he's driving his truck.
*  And I like, I want to see what happens.
*  He makes red bull and nitro cold.
*  There's a lineup of drugs.
*  This is going to be so fun.
*  This is good.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's start with love.
*  Yeah.
*  So one, one thing we'll eventually somehow talk about, it'll be a theme throughout
*  is that you're also Russian.
*  Yes.
*  A little bit less than me, but how let at my cause I'm from Ukraine.
*  Oh, you're from Ukraine.
*  Okay.
*  Wow.
*  No, because you came here a little bit when you were younger.
*  Yeah.
*  I, I came here when I was 13.
*  So I saturated a little bit of the Russian soul.
*  I marinated in the Russian soul, a little deeper.
*  I haven't told anyone this, but I'll be glad to tell you to Vyresh.
*  Um, I haven't been back since I was two and next summer it looks like me and my
*  buddy, Chris Williamson, who's also a podcaster.
*  He's British modern wisdom.
*  He looks like Apollo.
*  We're, we looks like we got a videographer.
*  Which Apollo?
*  Apollo the God.
*  He looks like the Apollo.
*  Yeah.
*  He's like a model.
*  I thought you were talking about Iraq.
*  So we're going to go for the first time to see where I came from, which is Ukraine.
*  We're going to go to Lvov and either St.
*  Petersburg or Moscow, probably St.
*  Petersburg or both.
*  It's going to be intense.
*  It's going to be a lot of panic attacks.
*  I feel.
*  And your Russian is okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Got the do-ish.
*  Hmm.
*  That a show, but you might know you can't talk Russian Ukraine or it's like a, they
*  get offended.
*  Yeah.
*  But then you also want to go to Russia.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  For me, there's several people in Russia.
*  I want an interview on a podcast.
*  Okay.
*  So one, one of them is a good girl.
*  Pro man, which is a mathematician.
*  And the other person is Putin.
*  You know, my favorite food and story is, do you know this?
*  No.
*  When he had Merkel with him, do you know this story?
*  No.
*  Merkel scared of dogs, like petrified of dogs.
*  So he brings in his like, like, like a black lab.
*  It's a Labrador.
*  It's like the sweetest animal and it's all over her and there's pictures and she's
*  sitting like this and she's terrified.
*  And he's like, what's wrong, Angela?
*  It's just completely trolling her.
*  Yeah.
*  He's aware of the sort of, uh, the narrative around him.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he plays with it.
*  Yes.
*  He enjoys it.
*  It's a very Russian thing.
*  My friend wanted to do a film about me.
*  He goes, I realized you guys aren't like us at all.
*  You just like, like look at us.
*  And then I started telling him stories about the upbringing and he's like, oh
*  my God, and as I'm telling them, like, wow, this stuff is really crazy.
*  Like how we are wired.
*  Who's the we?
*  Your friend is?
*  The Russian, the friend's American.
*  I was saying the way Russians are brought up and the way maybe, I don't
*  think it was just my family.
*  I bet you had similar things.
*  Like here's an example.
*  I was, I had a buddy staying with me.
*  He had a problem with his roommate.
*  So he crashed in my place.
*  Fine.
*  I went to the gym and I come back and he goes, oh, there was, and
*  my apartment building is four apartments.
*  So it's not like a huge thing.
*  He goes, oh, there was someone knocking at your door.
*  So, you know, I told him a blah and, and for me, and I want to know if you're the
*  same way, if I'm at someone's house, that's not my own and someone knocks on the door.
*  I wouldn't even think to answer it.
*  Like if I had an apple here, maybe I'd eat it.
*  I cut it, whatever.
*  I'm not going to, it just doesn't enter my head to smash into my face.
*  The thought of answering the door, if it's not my house, it would never
*  enter my head, would enter your head.
*  No, but why?
*  But he's an American.
*  So someone's at the door.
*  He goes and opens it, even though it's not his house.
*  I would never do that.
*  I would never think to do that.
*  That is so strange that you pick some very obscure thing to delineate Americans.
*  And I don't think that's obscure because I think it speaks to how we perceive
*  strangers with Americans, everyone's friendly and with us, it's like, no, no,
*  like you have that moat and I think that's a, that percolates into many different
*  aspects of how we relate to people.
*  And I had to do a lot of that.
*  That's true.
*  You're right.
*  There's a relationship I formed there in Russia or very deep, close, and then
*  there's the strangers, the other that you don't trust by default.
*  It takes a long time to go over the moat of trust.
*  For a long time until recently, whenever I said anything to anyone, my brain ran
*  a scan that said, if this person turns on you, would this, can they use this against
*  you?
*  And I would do this with everything I said with strangers.
*  And after a while, it's like, you know what?
*  Maybe they will, but I'm strong enough to take it.
*  But this is not how Americans think.
*  Or here's another one.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  Sorry, I'm taking over the interview.
*  People ask about like advice for work, right?
*  Like I had this, there was this party I went to and basically everyone had their
*  own problems and everyone else gave their advice, right?
*  And someone was having a problem with the coworker and the advice these
*  Tupoi Americans gave them is, oh, sit down and have a talk with them.
*  And to me, this is like the last case, last resort.
*  Like first you have to see what you can without showing your hand, showing your
*  vulnerability only when everything hasn't worked out or you're like, all right,
*  let me sit down with you and try to have it out with you probably.
*  But for them, the first thing is like sit down and be like, oh, you're causing me
*  problems and blah, blah.
*  So I perceive that right away is a threat that this person sees an antagonism
*  between us and also as a weakness that I'm getting to them.
*  So my reaction isn't, um, how do I make it better?
*  My reaction is to reinforce my position and see what I can to marginalize them.
*  Usually I haven't worked in a corporate setting in a long time, but
*  it's not, I don't approach it the way an American would like.
*  I'm glad you came and talked to me.
*  Now I probably would cause it's going to be a friend.
*  So you attribute that to the Russian I'm bringing as opposed to you have
*  deep psychological issues.
*  I think there's a synonymous.
*  Wait, am I, would you think differently?
*  Maybe a few years ago?
*  Hmm, I don't know.
*  I, I think you lost me at the, cause you kind of said that you're kind of implying
*  you have a deep distrust of the world.
*  Like the world does.
*  I think the default setting would be distrust.
*  Yeah.
*  But I would put it differently is I almost ignore the rest of the
*  world. I don't even acknowledge it.
*  I just, uh, savor, I save my love and trust for the small circle of people.
*  I agree.
*  But when that person is being confrontational or as they perceive it as
*  being open, now there's a situation.
*  How do you, how would you handle that?
*  Like, like a cold wind blows.
*  You just kind of like, yeah, but it's not like this is an opportunity for us to
*  work out our differences.
*  It's a cold wind.
*  It's not a hug.
*  That's my point.
*  I don't think it's a hug.
*  What it really is, is a cold wind.
*  I'm so inhumane.
*  It's a cold wind person.
*  But it's great.
*  But it's not a source of like, I'm not suspicious of like, I'm not anxious, I
*  would say, or like living in fear of the rest of the world.
*  Oh, I agree.
*  But you're not receptive to that person.
*  Right.
*  That's all I'm saying.
*  And they are.
*  Got it.
*  So speaking of which, let's talk about love.
*  Yes.
*  Which requires to be receptive of the world.
*  Yes.
*  Of strangers.
*  Agreed.
*  How do we put more love out there in the world, especially on the internet?
*  One mechanism I have found to increase love, and that's a word that has many
*  meanings and is, you know, used in a very intense sense and it's used in a very
*  loose sense.
*  Can you try to define love?
*  Sure.
*  Love is a strong sense of attraction toward another person, entity or place
*  that causes one to tend to react in a disproportionately positive manner.
*  That's off the top of my head.
*  Disproportionately.
*  Yes.
*  So for example, if you-
*  Why not proportionately?
*  Because like, if you're, someone's about to, who you love is about to get harmed,
*  you're moving heaven and earth to make sure, uh, or like a book you love, you
*  know, like, I love this book, like you're going through the fire to try to save it.
*  Whereas if it's a book you really like, it's like, Oh, I'll get another one.
*  I don't, you know, and a book's a kind of a loose example, but-
*  So you're going with the love that's like, you're saving for just a few people,
*  almost like romantically, like love for a close family.
*  But it's also-
*  What about just love to even the broader, like the kind of love you can put out to
*  people on the internet, which is like, just kindness.
*  Sure.
*  I would say in that case, it's important to make them feel, um, seen and validated.
*  And I try to do this when people who I have come to know on the internet, and
*  there's a lot, uh, I try to do that as much as possible because I don't think
*  it's valid how on social media, and I do this a lot myself, but not towards everyone.
*  It's just there to be aggressive and antagonistic.
*  You should be antagonistic towards bad people and that's fine.
*  But at the same time, there's lots of great people and especially with my
*  audience, and I would bet disproportionately with yours, there's a lots of people who
*  are because of their psychology and intelligence are going to be much more
*  isolated socially than they should.
*  And if I, and I've heard from many of them, and if I'm the person who makes
*  them feel, oh, I'm not crazy, it's everyone else around me who is just basic.
*  Uh, the fact that I can be that person, which I didn't have at their age to me
*  is incredibly reaffirming.
*  You mean that source of love?
*  But I mean, love in the sense of like, you know, you care about this person and
*  you want good things for them, not in a kind of romantic way.
*  But I mean, you're using a broad sense now.
*  Yeah.
*  But you're also a person who kind of, I mean, uh, attacks this power structures
*  in the world by mocking them effectively.
*  Yes.
*  And, uh, love, I would say requires you to be non witty and simple and fragile,
*  which I see it as like the opposite of what trolls do.
*  Trolls are, if I, if there is someone coming after what I love, there's two
*  mechanisms, right?
*  At least two, I go up and I'm fighting them.
*  And in which case you bring in, if you are getting hurt in a knife fight, even
*  if you win the knife fight, or if you disarm them and you preclude the
*  possibility of a fight and you drive them off or render them powerless, you
*  can, you keep your person intact as yourself and you also protect your values.
*  So how do you render them powerless?
*  As you just said, by mocking them.
*  One of the most effective mechanisms for those in power, we're much closer
*  to brave new world than 1984.
*  The people who are dominant and in power aren't there because of the threat of,
*  you know, the Gulag or prison.
*  They're there because of social pressures.
*  Look at the masks.
*  I was on the subway not that long ago in New York City.
*  Um, no one cared who I was until I put off the mask.
*  I was in the subway that long in New York City.
*  There was, and I put this on my Instagram.
*  I've told this story before.
*  There was an Asian dude in his early thirties.
*  He was like in Western clothes.
*  It's not like he had a rickshaw or something.
*  An older man in his fifties stood up over him on the subway, screamed at him,
*  said, go back where you came from.
*  You're disgusting.
*  I'm going to get sick.
*  If you think this guy is a vector of disease, which is your prerogative, why
*  are you coming close to him?
*  Why are you getting in his face?
*  And what was the rate?
*  Sorry.
*  So it was because he was Asian.
*  It was both.
*  It was the not having a mask that gave him the permission to act like a
*  despicable, aggressive person toward him.
*  Right.
*  And the point being, uh, a lot of these mechanisms for social control are
*  outsourced to low quality people because this is their one chance to assert
*  dominance and status over somebody else.
*  So the best way to diffuse that isn't with weaponry or fighting.
*  It's through mockery because all of a sudden their claims to authority
*  are effectively destroyed.
*  So let me push back on that.
*  What about fighting that with, with love, with, um, patience and
*  like kindness towards them?
*  I don't think kindness is, I think that would be a mismatch and inappropriate.
*  There's Superman, there's Batman.
*  Okay.
*  And Superman's job is to help the good people.
*  And Batman's job is to hurt the bad people.
*  And I will always be on the Batman side than the Superman side.
*  Both work, uh, silly tight costumes.
*  One has a point in the ears.
*  Both are ridiculous.
*  So it's, uh,
*  it was a billionaire who gets, you know, he, he's swimming in trim.
*  Which one is the Batman?
*  Okay.
*  I'm, I'm under educated on, um, okay.
*  I'm the superhero movies.
*  I apologize.
*  Okay.
*  But, but you're just saying you, your predisposition is to be in the Batman
*  side is to, uh, fighting the bad guys.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's what I'm good at.
*  That's what you're good at.
*  But just to play devil's advocate, or actually in this case, I am the
*  devil because it's what I usually do.
*  Which is the devil here.
*  They're angels advocate.
*  Exactly.
*  I'm to be the, to be the angel advocate.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, I feel like mockery is, um, is a, is a path towards escalation of conflict.
*  Yes.
*  In many ways.
*  Yes.
*  So you're not, I mean,
*  it's kind of like guerrilla warfare.
*  I mean, you're not going to win.
*  I am winning.
*  We're all winning.
*  We're winning on a daily.
*  This is my next book.
*  We're winning.
*  We've won before.
*  I'm not joking.
*  The net, the topic of the next book.
*  Yes.
*  Is the white pill.
*  The white pill is that we're going to, we are winning.
*  The most horrible people are being rendered into laughing stocks on
*  a daily basis in social media.
*  This is glorious.
*  I so disagree with you.
*  I disagree with you because there's side effects that are very destructive.
*  It feels like you're winning, but we're completely destroying the possibility of
*  having, um, like a cohesive society.
*  That's called oncology.
*  What's that mean?
*  Curing cancer.
*  No, I, your concept of a cohesive society is in fact, a society based on oppression
*  and not allowing individuals to live their personal freedom.
*  Oh, so you're, you're utopian view of the world.
*  You're the utopian.
*  You're saying cohesive society.
*  I'm saying, I don't need that.
*  I'm saying there's going to be conflict, right?
*  There's going to be conflict.
*  You and I are disagreeing right now.
*  That's not cohesive.
*  Doesn't mean we like each other less.
*  Doesn't mean we respect each other less cohesive.
*  Doesn't it, it's, it's just a euphemism for like everyone submitting to what I want.
*  No, I mean, cohesive could, could, uh, could be that it could be, um, it could be
*  like enforced with violence, all that kind of stuff, sort of the, uh, the libertarian
*  view of the world, but it could just be being respectful and kind of each other,
*  uh, and kind towards each other and loving towards each other.
*  I mean, that's what I mean by cohesive.
*  So when people say free, it's funny, like freedom is a funny thing because freedom
*  could be painful to a lot of people.
*  Um, it's, it's all matters how you define it, how you implement it,
*  how it actually looks like.
*  Sure.
*  And I'm just saying it feels like the mockery of the powerful leads to further
*  and further the divisions.
*  It's like the, it's turning life into a game to where it's always your plan.
*  You're, you're, you're creating these different little tribes and groups and
*  you're constantly, uh, fighting the groups that become a little bit more powerful
*  by undercutting them through guerrilla warfare kind of thing.
*  And that's what the internet becomes is everyone's just mocking each other.
*  And then certain groups become more and more powerful.
*  And then they start fighting each other and into basically they, they form
*  groups of ideologies and they start fighting each other in the internet.
*  Where the result is it doesn't feel like the common humanities highlighted.
*  It doesn't feel like that's a path of progress.
*  Now, like when I say cohesive, I don't mean like everybody has to be, you
*  know, enforcing equality, all those kinds of ideas.
*  I just mean like not being so divisive.
*  That's like, so it's going back to the original question of like, how do we put
*  more love out in the world on the internet?
*  I want divisiveness.
*  Oh, you see, you think this is the goal.
*  It's the goal.
*  So you started this conversation where you talking about, you have
*  love for that small group.
*  Uh, I think we both would agree to have a bigger group would be better,
*  especially if that love comes from a sincere place.
*  Um, I think our country specific, I wrote an article about this four years ago.
*  That's time to disunite the States and to secede.
*  This country has been held together with at least two separate cultures with
*  dumb texts and string for over 20 years.
*  Uh, there's an enormous amount of contempt from one group toward another.
*  Uh, this contempt comes from sincere place.
*  They do not share each other's values.
*  There's absolutely no reason just like any unhealthy relationship where you
*  can't say, you know what, it's not working out.
*  I want to go my own way and live my happiness.
*  And I genuinely want you to go your way, live your happiness.
*  If I'm wrong, prove me wrong.
*  I'll learn from you and take lessons and vice versa.
*  But the fact that we all have to be in the same house together is not coherent.
*  And that's not love.
*  That is the path towards friction and tension.
*  Do you think there is concrete groups?
*  Like, is it as simple as the two groups of blue and red?
*  No, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's also very fluid because you and I are allied
*  as Jewish people, as Russians, as males, as podcasters, uh, you're an academic.
*  I'm not there.
*  So there's, there was, there were different, but we each are a Venn diagram,
*  even within ourselves.
*  And I can talk to you about politics and then we can talk about Russia stuff.
*  And then you could talk about your, your work, which I don't know anything about.
*  So that would be where you're way up here and our way down here.
*  So there's lots, every relationship with just between individuals.
*  There's it's very dynamic.
*  So how do we succeed?
*  Like, how do we form individual states where there's a little bit more.
*  Cohesion.
*  Sure.
*  And voluntary cohesion.
*  So the first step is to, uh, eliminate.
*  And the concept of political authority as legitimate and to denigrate and
*  humiliate those who would put themselves in a position in which they are there to
*  tell you how to live your life from any semblance of, of validity.
*  And that's starting to happen.
*  Um, if you look at what they had with the lockdowns, Cuomo and de Blasio, New York,
*  uh, we have, I was, uh, tired a couple of weeks ago and I said to my friend,
*  Oh, just click, maybe have COVID.
*  And he goes, it's not possible.
*  Like, what do you mean?
*  And he goes, we haven't had any deaths in like two months.
*  And there's only like 100 cases a day for like two months.
*  And I go, you're, you're exaggerating because everything was still closed.
*  And I looked at the numbers and he wasn't exaggerating and there's no greater
*  American dream to me than an immigrant family comes to the States, forms
*  their own little business.
*  Maybe mom's a good cook at the restaurant, dry cleaner, fruit stand.
*  And those people aren't going to have a lot of money.
*  Those are the first ones who lost their companies because of these lockdowns.
*  Uh, they, Cuomo, who's the governor of New York opened up the gyms.
*  He said, you're clear to open up.
*  De Blasio said, and we don't have enough inspectors.
*  You're going to have to wait another couple of weeks, uh, to regard that as
*  anything other than literally criminal is something that I am having a hard
*  and hard time wrapping my head around.
*  You said, I mean, that's something I'm deeply worried about as well, which is
*  like thousands, it's actually millions of dreams being crushed that American
*  dream of starting a business, of running a business.
*  What about all the young people who you and I have in our audiences who are
*  socially isolated at best and now they can't leave their homes, uh, isolation
*  and ostracism are things that are very well studied in psychology.
*  These have extreme consequences.
*  I read a book called ostracism and this wasn't scientific, but basically the
*  author was a psychiatrist, a college, whatever, and he had one of his colleagues.
*  They didn't experiment.
*  Let's for a week, you ostracize me completely.
*  We know it's an, and he goes, even knowing it's the experiment, the fact
*  that he wouldn't make eye contact with me and the fact that he ignored me had
*  an extreme emotional impact on me.
*  Knowing full well, this is purely for experimental purposes.
*  Now you multiply that by all these, the suicide, the number of kids who are
*  thinking about suicide was through the roof during all this.
*  Uh, and my point is until these people, it's going to, I would predict like 2024.
*  That's where we're going to have to start having conversations about what personal
*  consequences have to be done for these people because until then they're
*  going to do the same thing.
*  So you think there's going to be society wide consequences of this that we're
*  going to see like ripple effects because of the social isolation?
*  I know.
*  I mean, we also need to talk about consequences or Cuomo and de Blasio
*  because if, if politicians respond to incentives and the incentives are there
*  for them to be extremely conservative, because if you have to choose as Cuomo
*  said in a press conference between a thousand people dying and a thousand
*  people losing their business, it's not a hard choice and he's right.
*  But at a certain point, it's like, all right, you're losing both.
*  You're losing, not losing the, you're making these decisions, um, and not
*  having consequences for it and you're going to do it again the next time.
*  So we need to make sure you're a little scared.
*  Okay.
*  And I don't know what that would mean.
*  But you're laying this problem, this, this incompetence.
*  I don't think it's incompetence.
*  I think it's very competent.
*  I think they're just, their job is, yes.
*  But what, but you're laying it not at the, at the hands of the individuals,
*  but the structure of the, of government.
*  It's both.
*  Yes.
*  How, how would we deal with it better without centralized control?
*  Well, we didn't really have centralized control because every country and every
*  state, you know, handled it in a different mechanism, but a city has centralized
*  control, just, yeah, right.
*  I mean, no, that's not true.
*  So Cuomo and de Blasio, they had a lot of disagreements over this over the
*  months, and this was actually a source of great interest and tension.
*  Um, de Blasio wanted, at one point was talking about like quarantining
*  people in their homes.
*  Cuomo was like, you're crazy.
*  Uh, something, same thing with the schools, same thing with the gyms.
*  Um, and there were other such, uh, examples.
*  But the point being, this was an emergency.
*  This is World War I.
*  I talked about some Tim Pool show, um, was very dangerous because it gave a lot of
*  evil people, some very useful information about what the country would put up with
*  and what they can get away with under wartime.
*  And this set the model for things like the new deal and the
*  other things of that nature.
*  It is undeniable, you're a scientist, so you understand this perfectly well, um,
*  that this lockdown gave some very nefarious people, some very valid data
*  about how much people will put up with, uh, under, uh, pressures from the state.
*  So fundamentally, what is the problem with the state?
*  That existence.
*  Okay.
*  Well, but, uh, to play Angel's advocate again, you know, government is the people.
*  Oh, come on.
*  You don't, you, you, you're saying, do you, you don't, do you really think this?
*  I, as best I think it's possible to have represent representation.
*  Can you imagine if like you have an attorney, you're like, oh, you
*  can't have the attorney you want.
*  You're going to have this guy who you absolutely hate, who you
*  share no values with.
*  Why?
*  Because he drives, I mean, leaders, political leaders and political representation
*  drive the discourse.
*  Like we, you know, uh, the majority of people voted for him or whatever,
*  however, however you define that.
*  And now we get to have a discussion.
*  Well, was this the right choice?
*  And then we'll get to make that choice again in four years and so on.
*  First of all, the fact that I have to be under the thumb of somebody
*  for four years makes no sense.
*  There's no other relationship that's like this, including a marriage.
*  Uh, you can leave any other relationship at any time.
*  Number one, number two is always impeach what they did that part of it.
*  I'm in just saying that there's the mechanisms are flawed in many ways.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And, and so that's number one.
*  Number two is it doesn't make sense that if I don't want someone to represent me
*  that because that person is popular that they are now in a position to.
*  So having, uh, um, representation and having citizenship based on geography
*  is a pre landline technology in a post cell phone world.
*  There's no reason why I have to, just cause we're physically in between two
*  oceans, we all have to be represented by the same people.
*  Whereas I can very easily have my security be under someone and switch it
*  as easily as cell phone providers.
*  So, okay.
*  But it doesn't have to be geographical.
*  It can be ideas.
*  Sure.
*  And this country represents a certain set of ideas.
*  Yes, it does.
*  It started out geographically.
*  It's still as you started off as ideas as well, but like there's a, it's, it
*  was intricately, I mean, that's the way humans are is there's, I mean, uh, there
*  was no internet, so it was your geographical in the same location and you sign them
*  much of documents and then you kind of debated and you wrote a bunch of stuff
*  and then you agreed on it.
*  Okay.
*  So you understand that no one signed these documents and no one agreed to it
*  as Lysander Spooner pointed out over 150 years ago, the constitution or the
*  social contract, if anything is only binding to the signatories.
*  Um, and even then they're all long dead.
*  Uh, so it's, it's this fallacy that somehow, because I'm in a physical place,
*  I have agreed, even though I'm screaming to you a face that I don't agree to be,
*  um, subordinate to, uh, some imaginary invisible monster that was created 250
*  years ago, uh, and this idea of like, if you don't like it, you have to move.
*  That's not what freedom means.
*  Freedom means I do what I want, not what you want.
*  So if you don't like it, you move.
*  Okay.
*  Just to put some, I don't like words and terms, 1110111011.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Is that what your language is?
*  It is.
*  I'm translating it all in real time, but, uh, would you call the kind of
*  ideas that, uh, you're advocating for and we're talking about anarchy?
*  Yes.
*  Anarchism.
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  So let's get into it.
*  Can you, can you try to paint the utopia?
*  That an anarchist worldview dreams about the only people who describe
*  anarchism as utopia are its critics.
*  If I told you right now, and I wish I could say this factually that I have
*  a cure for cancer that would not make us a utopia, uh, that would still probably
*  be expensive, uh, we would still have many other diseases.
*  However, we would be fundamentally healthier, happier and better off.
*  All, all of us then democracy.
*  So, uh, sorry, I jumped back from the cancer.
*  No, then democracy or government.
*  So it's only curing one major, major life threatening problem,
*  but in no sense is it a utopia.
*  So what can we try to, uh, answer this question?
*  Many, same question many times, which is what exactly is the problem with democracy?
*  The problem with democracy is that those who need leaders
*  are not qualified to choose them.
*  Those who need leaders are not qualified to choose them.
*  So, uh, that's the central problem of democracy.
*  Not all of us need leaders.
*  Right.
*  We, what does it mean to need a leader?
*  Are you saying like people who are actually like free thinkers don't
*  need leaders kind of thing?
*  Sure.
*  That's a good way of working.
*  Well, like you don't, okay.
*  So do you acknowledge that there's some value in authority in different subjects?
*  So what, what that means is I don't mean authority, somebody who's in control of you, but.
*  You're doing the definition switch.
*  Because I am, I am.
*  You're right.
*  You're right.
*  It's unfair.
*  Okay.
*  Those, those bad.
*  But that's what they do.
*  That's their trick.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's, this is one of the useful things, by the way, let's just total sidebar.
*  If people ask me for advice, I always tell them if you're going to raise
*  your kids, raise them bilingual.
*  Because I was tri-lingual by the time I was six and that teaches you to think in
*  concepts.
*  Whereas if you only know one language, you fall for things like this because using
*  authority in the sense of a policeman and someone is an authority in physics, it's
*  the same word conceptually, they're extremely different.
*  But if you're only thinking in one language, your brain is going to equate the two.
*  And that's a trap that people who only speak one language have.
*  For sure.
*  But even if you know multiple languages, you can still use the trick of using
*  more severe convenience to manipulate the conversation.
*  But you weren't trying to do that, but you fell.
*  I accidentally did it.
*  Yeah.
*  We all tend to do that if you only speak one language and think of one language.
*  But if, I guess, let me rephrase it.
*  I, are you against, do you acknowledge the value of like offloading your own
*  effort about a particular thing to somebody else?
*  Absolutely.
*  Like an accountant, a lawyer, a doctor, absolute, a chef, infinite.
*  Isn't that ultimately what a democracy is?
*  No.
*  So you're basically electing a bunch of authorities.
*  Using the word you in two senses.
*  Using the word you meaning me as an individual, not using you as a mass.
*  Yeah, as a mass, not you as an individual.
*  Right.
*  So I would absolutely want someone to provide for my security.
*  I would absolutely want someone to negotiate with me for foreign power,
*  something like that.
*  That does not mean it has to be predicated and what lots of other people
*  who I do not know, and if I do know them, probably would not respect, think about.
*  It's of no moral relevance to me.
*  Nor I to them.
*  Did you think this kind of, there could be a bunch of humans that behave kind of
*  like ants in a distributed way.
*  There could be an emergent behavior in them that results in a stable society.
*  Like, isn't that the hope with anarchy is like without an overarching.
*  But ants, I mean, ants are the worst example here because
*  ants have a very firm authority.
*  The queen?
*  Yeah.
*  And they're all, they're all drones.
*  They're all clones of each other.
*  Yeah.
*  But so if you forget the queen, their behavior, they're all, well, from your
*  perspective, from your human intelligent perspective, but from their perspective,
*  I probably see each other as a bunch of individuals.
*  No, they don't.
*  Ants are very big on altruism in the sense of self-sacrifice.
*  They do not think the individual matters.
*  They routinely kill themselves for the sake of the hives in the community,
*  but they see that's from the outside perspective, from the individual
*  perspective of the individual, they probably, they, they don't see it as altruism.
*  Right.
*  But they, they, they view and they're right.
*  Cause the ants life is very ephemeral and cheap that it's more important to
*  continue this mass population that that one individual ant live.
*  Like bees are another even better example, the honeybee when they sting,
*  they only sting once and they die.
*  And they do it gladly.
*  Cause it's like, okay, this community is much more important than me.
*  And they're right.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So fine.
*  So let's forget, I'm being pedantic, but it's important.
*  I think I'm not just being pedantic for the sake of being pedantic, but there's
*  something beautiful that I won't argue about because I do.
*  There's an interesting point there about individualism of ants.
*  I do think they're more individual than, but let's, let's give your
*  view of ants that they're it's they're communists.
*  Okay.
*  Let's go with the communist view of ants.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, but there's still a beautiful emergent thing, which is like, they
*  can function as a, as a society and without, I would say centralized control.
*  Yeah.
*  It's another argument.
*  Yeah.
*  So is that the hope for anarchy?
*  It's like, you just throw a bunch of people that voluntarily want to be in
*  the same place under the same set of ideas and they kind of like the doctors
*  emerge, the police officers emerge, the, uh, the different necessary structures
*  of a functional society emerge.
*  Do you know what the most beautiful example of anarchism is that is just
*  beyond beautiful when you stop to think about it and I'm not, I'm not being
*  tongue in cheek language, there's infinite languages, language, the things
*  that language can be used for are bring tears to people's eyes, quite literally.
*  It it's also used for basic things.
*  No one is forcing us.
*  We speak two languages each at least.
*  No one's forcing us to use English.
*  No one's forcing us to use this dialect of English.
*  Uh, it's a way and, and despite there being so many different languages,
*  uh, lingua franca emerge, you know, people, the language that everyone is Latin,
*  even in North Korea, they refer to the fish and the different animals by the
*  Latin scientific, uh, uh, no one decided that's true.
*  There's an organization that sets a binomial nomenclature, but there's no
*  gun to anyone's head referring to a Seamoth as a Pegasus species.
*  And when you think about how amazing language is, and in some other context
*  would say like, well, you, you need to have a world government and they're
*  deciding which is the verbs and you have to have an official definition and an
*  official dictionary and none of that's happened.
*  And I think anyone, even if they don't agree with my politics or my worldview,
*  cannot deny that the creation of language is one of humanity's most
*  miraculous, beautiful achievements.
*  Absolutely.
*  So there, there you go.
*  There's one system where a kind of anarchy can result in, in beauty,
*  stability, like sufficient stability and yet dynamic flexibility to adjust it
*  and so on and the internet helps it.
*  You get some, something like urban dictionary, which starts creating
*  absurd, both humor and wit, but also language and syntax and jargon
*  immediately size people up.
*  If you use, if you say vertebral, I know you're a doctor, cause that's how
*  they pronounce it, the spinal column.
*  Uh, I'm sure in your field, there's certain jargon and right away you can
*  know if this person's one of us or not.
*  I mean, it's infinite.
*  I mean, I don't need to tell you anyone.
*  Emojis.
*  Yes.
*  There's so much there to study with language.
*  It's fascinating.
*  But do you think this applies to human life?
*  The meat space, the physical space.
*  Yes.
*  So these, there's that kind of beauty can emerge without, uh, without writing
*  stuff on paper, without laws.
*  You could have rules.
*  You don't need, you don't have to be laws.
*  So enforced by violence.
*  Like that's what, what's a law?
*  I love a law is something that is unchosen.
*  A rule is something.
*  If I go to my pool and I sign up to remember a pool on the wall, there's certain things.
*  It's like, you know, certain number of people in the pool.
*  No peeing in here.
*  Good luck enforcing that one.
*  Um, and so on and so forth.
*  Well, that's the problem.
*  Aren't you afraid that people are going to pee in the pool?
*  That's not as my big concern is mass incarceration as the fact that the
*  police can steal more money than burglars can.
*  The fact that innocent people can be killed with no consequences.
*  The fact that war can be waged and with no, uh, consequences for those who waged
*  it, the fact that so many men and women are being murdered overseas and here.
*  And the people who are guiding these are regarded as heroic.
*  So you think there might that in an anarchist system, there's a possibility
*  of, of having less wars and less, what would you say, corruption and,
*  uh, less abuse of power.
*  Let's talk.
*  Yes.
*  And let's talk about corruption because, and I made this point on Rogan, you and
*  I, again, this is the Russian background.
*  We realize that when it comes to corruption, American is very naive.
*  Corruption, they think is, oh, I got my brother a job and he's
*  getting money on the table.
*  That's not when we're talking about like state corruption, things that are done
*  in totalitarian states and even to some extent in America, like Jeffrey Epstein,
*  Gillian Maxwell, things that Stalin did, things that Hitler did, uh, you know,
*  when the CIA was torturing people at Gitmo, they had to borrow KGB manuals
*  because they didn't know how to torture correctly because they never thought of
*  these things.
*  We, it's very hard for us to get into the mindset of someone who's like a child
*  predator, someone who, uh, let me give you an example from my forthcoming book.
*  There was a guy who was the head of Ukraine in the thirties.
*  I forget his name.
*  Now these old Soviets, they were tough.
*  I mean, they pride Stalin means steel.
*  You know, they pride themselves and their cruelty and how strong they were.
*  And this was the purge, you know, Stalin is trying to, you know, killing lots of
*  people left and right.
*  And his henchmen Beria, uh, had the quote, uh, find me the man and I'll find you the
*  crime, you know, they would accuse someone and they would torture him until he talked
*  and confessed.
*  And then he had to turn people in and they took this guy in like beginning of the year,
*  I think it's 36, 38.
*  He was head of Ukraine by May.
*  He's arrested and they take him to the Ljubljana, the basement in the red square
*  where they're torturing people and they put, they did the works on him and he was a
*  good Soviet and he stood up and he, they, who knows what they did to him.
*  He didn't talk.
*  So they said, okay, one moment.
*  They brought his teenage daughter in raped her in front of him.
*  He talked.
*  So when we talk about corruption, we would never in a million years, think of this.
*  That's not how our minds work.
*  Um, so when you're talking about states and people where you don't have ease of exit,
*  where you are forced to be under the auspices of an organization, creating a monopoly
*  that leads to in extreme cases, but in not as extreme cases, really, uh, nefarious
*  outcomes.
*  Whereas if you have the option to leave as a client or customer, that would have a
*  strongly limiting effect on how a business and what it can get away with.
*  So, but don't you think maybe, I don't know who the right example is, whether it's
*  Stalin.
*  I think Hitler might be the better example of, don't you think, or Jeffrey
*  Epstein, perhaps don't you think people who are evil will, will find ways to
*  manipulate human nature to attain power, no matter the system.
*  Yes.
*  And like the, the, the corollary question is, do you think those people can get
*  more power in, um, in the democracy, in, you know, in, when there's a government
*  already in place, they can, it's easily, they get more power, more dangerous to
*  have a government place.
*  First of all, sociopaths don't know for their charm and for their warmth.
*  Here's the two situations in a free society.
*  I'm a sociopath.
*  I'm an evil person.
*  I'm the head of Macy's in a state society.
*  I'm an evil person.
*  I'm a sociopath.
*  I'm the head of the U S government.
*  Which of these are you more concerned with?
*  It's like night and day.
*  So you would have far more decentralized military.
*  You would have far more decentralized, um, uh, uh, security forces, and they
*  would be much more subject to feedback from the market.
*  If you have an issue with Macy's or any store with a sweater, look at that
*  transaction, if you have an issue with the state, hiring a lawyer costs more
*  than a surgeon to even access the mechanism for dispute is going to be
*  exorbitant and price poor people out of the market for a conflict resolution
*  immediately.
*  So right away you have something that's extremely regressive.
*  Uh, and even though this is touted as some great equalizer, it's quite the
*  opposite.
*  So in current society, there's deep suspicion of governments and states.
*  They're not, that's not really,
*  well, like just your example of Macy's.
*  I mean, don't you think a Hitler could rise to be at the top of a social
*  network like Twitter and Facebook?
*  Okay.
*  Let's suppose Hitler ran Twitter.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, let's take this thought experiment seriously.
*  Literally, what could he do?
*  So all the only tweets are going to be about how much the Jews suck, right?
*  Okay.
*  Fine.
*  Okay.
*  All the cool people are leaving.
*  There could be some compelling, like you said, um, evil people are charming.
*  There could be some compelling narratives that could be with conspiracy theories,
*  uh, untruths that could be spread like propaganda.
*  Like does every criticism of anarchism is in fact a description.
*  Well, the strongest criticism of anarchism are in fact description of the status
*  quo.
*  Your concern is under anarchism, propaganda would spread and people would
*  be taught the wrong ideas.
*  Unlike the status quo.
*  That's not even a criticism of anarchism.
*  I'm not actually criticizing.
*  It's an open question of, it's an open question of in which system will human
*  nature thrive, be, be able to thrive more.
*  And in, in which system would the evils that arise in human nature would be more
*  easily suppressible.
*  There that's, that's the question.
*  It's a scientific experiment and I'm asking only from our perspective of the
*  fact that we've tried democracy quite a bit recently and we, I don't, maybe you
*  can correct me.
*  We haven't yet seriously tried to anarchy in a large scale.
*  Well, we don't need to try to, so anarchy isn't like a country, right?
*  It's like, it's, you can't, I'm not, it's like saying, well, if anarchy works, how
*  can we even have an anarchist government?
*  Right?
*  So anarchism is a relationship and language is an example of this.
*  It's a worldwide anarchic system.
*  You and I have an anarchist relationship.
*  There's almost no circumstances.
*  We'd be calling the police on each other.
*  I mean, it's, I'm asking the same question in a bunch of different directions out of,
*  born out of my curiosity is why is anarchy going to be better at preventing the darker
*  sides of human nature, which presumably your criticism of government.
*  Oh, because it's, because of decentralization.
*  So the darker side of human nature is an extreme concern.
*  Anyone who says it's going to go away is absurd and fallacious.
*  I think that's a non-starter when people say that everyone's going to be good.
*  Human beings are basically animals.
*  We're capable of great beauty and kindness.
*  We're capable of just complete, cruel, and what we would call inhumanity, but we see
*  it on a daily basis, even today.
*  And what's interesting is the corporate press won't even tell you the darkest
*  aspects because that's too upsetting to people.
*  So they'll tell you about atrocities and horrors, but only to a point.
*  And then when you actually do the homework, you're like, oh, it's so much worse than,
*  like that thing about Stalin, right?
*  So we know in a broad sense that Stalin was a dictator.
*  We know that he killed a lot of people, but it takes work to learn about the
*  Hall of the More, it takes work to learn about what those literal tortures were.
*  And that this is the person who later FDR and Harry Truman were shaking hands with
*  and taking photos with, and was being sold to us as Uncle Joe.
*  You know, he's just like you and me.
*  So when you have a decentralized information network, as opposed to having
*  three media networks, it is a lot easier for information that doesn't fit what
*  would be the corporate American narrative to reach the populations.
*  And it would be more effective for democracy because they're in a much
*  better position to be informed.
*  Now you're right.
*  It also means, well, if everyone has a mic, that means every crazy person
*  and with their wacky views.
*  And at a certain point, yeah, it has to become, then there's another level, which
*  is then the people have to be self-enforcing and you see that in social
*  media all the time when someone says this, the other person jumps in.
*  You think, but isn't social media a good example of this?
*  Like, so you think ultimately without centralized control, you can have
*  stability, like what about the mob outrage and the mob rule, the power of
*  the mobs that emerge?
*  The power of the mob is a very serious concern.
*  Gustav Le Bon wrote a book in the 1890s called The Crowd, and this was one of
*  the most important books I've written because it influenced both Mussolini and
*  Hitler and Stalin, and they all talked about it.
*  And he made the point that under crowd psychology, human and lynching is
*  another example of this.
*  None of those individuals or very few would ever dream of doing these acts.
*  But when they're all together and you lose that sense of self, you become the
*  ant and you lose that sense of individually, you're capable of doing things
*  that like in another context, you'd be like, I should kill myself.
*  I'm a monster.
*  So you're worried about that, but like, isn't the mob, doesn't the mob
*  have more power under anarchy?
*  No, the mob has much less power in anarchy because under anarchism, every
*  individual is fully empowered.
*  You wouldn't have gun restrictions.
*  You would have people creating communities based on shared values.
*  They would be much more collegial.
*  They'd be much more kind as opposed to when you're forcing people to be
*  together in a polity, when they don't have things in common, that is a
*  get like having a bad roommate.
*  If you're forced to look like jails, if you're forced to be in locked in a room
*  with someone, even if you had first liked them, you would be forced to be
*  someone, even if you had first liked them after a while, you're going to start to
*  hate them and that leads to very nefarious consequences.
*  So as an anarchist, what are you doing in a society like this?
*  Right.
*  I think I'm doing okay.
*  I mean, I mean, there's an election coming up.
*  There's a, as, as you talk, uh, you're welcome is one of the 15 shows that
*  you host.
*  Okay.
*  It's down to one, but I'm a big fan.
*  You talk about libertarianism a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, is there some practical political direction, like in terms of
*  we as a society should, should go?
*  I don't mean we as a nation.
*  I mean, we as a collective of people should go to, uh, to make a better world
*  from an anarchist point of view.
*  Sure.
*  Uh, I think politics is the enemy.
*  Uh, and anything, the government.
*  So anything that lessens its sway on people, anything that delegitimizes it is good.
*  I wrote an article a few years ago about how wonderful it is that Trump is regarded
*  as such a buffoon because it's very, very useful to have a commander in chief who's
*  regarded as a clown because it's going to take a lot to get him to convince your kids
*  to go overseas and start killing people and making widows and orphans, as well as
*  those kids coming home in caskets.
*  Whereas if someone is regarded with prestige and they're like, oh, we need to
*  send your kid overseas.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  I mean, this guy's great.
*  So that is a very healthy thing where people are skeptical of the state.
*  But there's a lot of people that, uh, regard him as, as one of the greatest
*  leaders we've ever had.
*  Yeah.
*  Dinesh D'Souza.
*  He's another Lincoln.
*  I, when you talk shit about Trump or talk shit about Biden, I think I'm trying to
*  find a line to walk where you, they don't immediately put you into the, this person
*  has Trump derangement syndrome or they have the other, the alternative to that.
*  I'm more than happy when people are preemptively dismissing me because they
*  don't have to waste time engaging with them because those people will be of no
*  use to me.
*  When I was on Tim Poole recently, Tim Poole's show, uh, Tim Poole is known for
*  his little like hat.
*  I got a propeller beanie motorized and it was just spinning the whole two hours.
*  I didn't know what a 1950s thing.
*  The point being I wore it because there's lots of people who would say, I can't take
*  seriously someone who wears a hat like that.
*  And my point being, if you are the kind of person who takes your cues based on
*  someone's wardrobe, as opposed to the content of your ideas, you're of no use
*  to me as an ally.
*  So I'd be more than happy you preemptively abort rather than waste our
*  breath.
*  This is the deep, this is a very, very deep thing that you and I disagree on,
*  which is this is goes to the trolling versus the love, uh, is I believe that
*  person instinctually dismisses you on the very basic surface level.
*  But deep down there actually, there's a wealth of a human being that seeks the
*  connection to seeks to understand deeply, to connect with other humans that we
*  should speak to.
*  I, I, yeah, you and I completely disagree.
*  See, you're saying, I'm saying there's no mind there literally.
*  Okay.
*  So let's, I naturally think the majority, so I naturally think the majority of
*  people are have the capacity to be thoughtful, intelligent, and, um, you
*  know, learn about ideas, ideas that they instinctually based on their own likes
*  current inner circle, disagree with and learn to understand, to empathize with
*  the other, we're like, I, I, and in the current climate, there's a divisiveness
*  that discourages that.
*  And that's where I see the value of love of, of encouraging people to, to, uh,
*  to strip away that surface instinctual response based on the thing they've been
*  taught, based on the things they listen to, to actually think deeply.
*  Have you ever had, uh, gone to CVS or Dwayne Reid and your bill, how much you
*  owe them is $6 and you give them a $10 bill in a single and watch the look on
*  their face?
*  You watch them void their bowels and panic because you've given them $11 on a
*  $6 bill.
*  This is not a mind capable or interested in thoughts and ideas and learning.
*  No, you're talking about the first moment of, uh, a first moment where
*  there's an opportunity to think.
*  They are desperate to avoid it.
*  No, they're just, it's an incapable of it.
*  I, I just, it's, uh, they're, they have the same exact experience as I have
*  every single day when I know it's time for me to go on a, on a run of five
*  miles or six miles or 10 miles.
*  I'm desperate to avoid it.
*  And at the same time, I know I have the capacity to do it and I'm deeply
*  fulfilled when I do do it, when I do overcome that challenge.
*  You are one of the great minds of our generation.
*  You are telling me that any of these people can do anything close to the work
*  you do.
*  Not in artificial intelligence, but in, uh, in, um, in the ability to be
*  compassionate towards other people's ideas, like understand them enough to be
*  able to passion requires a certain baseline of intelligence because you have
*  to perceive other people as being different, but of value.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  That's a sophisticated mindset.
*  I think, I think most people are, are capable of it.
*  You don't think so.
*  No, and nor are they interested in it.
*  But in that kind of, if you don't believe they're capable of it, how can
*  anarchy be stable?
*  Uh, if you have a farm, there's one farmer and 50 cows, it's very stable.
*  You're just not, you're not asking the cows where to, where to, where to farm
*  things.
*  Yeah, but the cows aren't intelligent enough to do damage.
*  Cows, cows certainly, bulls, cause they could do a lot of damage.
*  They could trample things.
*  They could attack you.
*  Cows are like, how much they weigh like 4,000 pounds.
*  Can you connect the analogy then?
*  Because like, sure.
*  You can't expect that.
*  Yeah.
*  Saying a cow is a cow isn't a slur.
*  It's not saying you hate cows, cows, or even let's take the example I always
*  use with good reason is dogs.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, I always say to study how human beings operate, watch Cesar Milan
*  because human beings and dogs have co-evolved.
*  Our minds have both evolved in parallel tracks to communicate with each other.
*  Dogs are, can be vicious.
*  Dogs for the most part are great, wonderful, but you can't expect the dog
*  to understand certain concepts.
*  It's not an instance.
*  And now most people are offended.
*  Are you saying I'm like a dog?
*  If you're a dog person, like I am, this is actually a huge compliment.
*  Most dogs are better than most people.
*  Um, but to get the idea that this is something that is basically your
*  peer is nonsensical.
*  Now, of course this sounds arrogant and elitist and so on and so forth.
*  And I'm perfectly happy with that, but it is very hard to understand.
*  It's very hard to persuade me or anyone that if you walk, George
*  Carlin has that joke, think how smart the average person is.
*  Then realize 50% of people are dumber than that.
*  If you walk around and see who's out there, these people are very kind.
*  They are of value.
*  They, they reserved to be treated with respect.
*  They deserve to be secure in their person.
*  They deserve to feel safe and to have love.
*  But the expectation that they should have any sort of semblance of power
*  in my life is as nonsensical as asking Lassie to be my accountant.
*  So, but that goes to power that not to, uh, the ability, the capacity to be
*  empathetic, compassionate, intelligent.
*  What, if I were to try to prove you wrong, that's a good question.
*  Okay.
*  What would, what would, what would you be impressed by about society?
*  Well, how would I show it to you?
*  That's a good question.
*  How would you show it to me?
*  Cause I think something has to be falsifiable if we're going to make a claim.
*  Right.
*  So what would it, what would it, cause we both made claims that aren't a kind of
*  our own like interpretation based on our interaction.
*  Like when I opened Twitter, everyone seems to say, why do you only follow one person?
*  Who do you follow?
*  Who's the one person you follow?
*  Uh, Stoa Kemperer.
*  I, I, I follow a lot of people.
*  I have a script.
*  I have a script that I have an entire interface.
*  So I, I think Twitter is really, this is real love.
*  It's not ironic love.
*  I love watching it.
*  And I'm sure you do too.
*  I love watching a quality mind at work because when someone has a quality mind,
*  they're often not self-aware.
*  I catch this on myself of how it operates.
*  And then when other people see it, they're like, oh my God, this is so beautiful.
*  Cause there's such an innocence to it.
*  Yeah.
*  But like when I opened Twitter, I'm energized.
*  There's a lot of love on Twitter.
*  People say like, I love Twitter.
*  I agree.
*  I have, you don't think I have a lot of love on Twitter.
*  My fans pay my rent.
*  I mean, I don't know your experience of Twitter, but when I look at your, which
*  is a fundamentally different thing, I'm saying my experience from the, so maybe
*  you can tell me what your experience is like as a human.
*  So when I observe your Twitter, I think I, I don't, I wouldn't call it love.
*  I would call it fun.
*  Yes.
*  And because of that, that's a different kind of like love emerges from that
*  because people kind of learn that we're having, this is like game night.
*  Like, uh, you know, we're, we can talk shit a little bit.
*  We can, uh, and you can, you can even like pull in, you can make fun of people.
*  You can have the crazy uncle come over that, um, there's a huge Trump supporter
*  or somebody who hates Trump and you can have a little fun.
*  I get it.
*  It's a different kind of thing.
*  I, I wouldn't be able to, um, uh, be the, you're the host of game night.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  So I wouldn't be able to host that kind of game night.
*  Yeah.
*  I imagine you programming your robots and you're asking what is fun and it
*  just starts sparking.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  What is fun?
*  So the robots in my life that survive are the ones that don't, that like survive
*  that whole programming process.
*  So they're kind of like, they're kind of like the idiot from this, the
*  eskimo, very like simple-minded robots.
*  Is moving a can from one table to another.
*  That's game night for, for, for our kin.
*  You know what?
*  I'm on my quotes is, and I think about this every day and I mean it
*  with every fiber of my being.
*  Uh, we're born knowing that life is a magical adventure and it takes them years
*  to train us to think otherwise.
*  And I think that Willy Wonka approach, it's a very Camus approach.
*  It's something I believe with every fiber of my being, I try to spread
*  that as much as possible.
*  I think it is very sad.
*  I'm not being sarcastic.
*  I, this comes up as condescending.
*  I mean it at face value.
*  It's very sad how many people are not receptive to that.
*  And I think a lot of those function how they were raised.
*  And I, I could have very easily with my upbringing have not maintained
*  that perspective and there's a lot of, I have a lot of friends in recovery,
*  like AA, and they have an expression, um, not my circus, not my monkeys, right?
*  That you can't really take on other people's problems on your own.
*  At a certain point, they have to do the work themselves because you can only
*  do so much externally and there are a lot of very damaged people out there.
*  And they're damaged people who revel in being damaged and they are damaged
*  people who desperately, desperately, desperately want to be well, who
*  desperately want to be happy, who desperately want to find joy.
*  So if I can be the one and as arrogant as this sounds, I'll own it.
*  Who does give them that fun and to tell them it doesn't have to be like you thought.
*  Like it could be, it's going to hurt.
*  It's going to suck, but it's still a magical adventure and you're going to be
*  okay because you've been through worse.
*  Like that, if that could be my message, I would own it all day long.
*  And so what does adventure look like for you?
*  Cause I mean, it actually boils down to, I still disagree with you.
*  I think trolling can, can be, and very often is destructive for society.
*  Yes.
*  I want to destroy society.
*  That is the goal.
*  I want, I want to help many people.
*  Unironically.
*  Okay.
*  Unironically.
*  Yes.
*  What do I do with that?
*  Okay.
*  So do what that will is the hall of the law.
*  Um, like I just want to, so you're hosting game night and I just want to play monopoly.
*  I want to play, um, what's the risk.
*  Okay.
*  I want to play these games and you're saying games.
*  I was trying to think of a friendlier game, but they're all kind of aggressive.
*  Battleship, Axis and allies, you know, fun stuff.
*  But like, uh, so that's an adventure, but you're saying that we want to destroy
*  everything to even like the rules of those games are, are not like you
*  have voluntarily agreed to those rules.
*  The point is if someone comes in, who's not, who no one invited to game night
*  and are telling you, no, when you play monopoly, you have to get money when you
*  land in free parking or you don't.
*  It's like, who are you?
*  We're having our own fun and you smell.
*  I don't know, but there's an aggressive.
*  There's an aggression.
*  Let me, let me speak to that, which I think you're picking up on.
*  Uh, I had a friend named Martha, Marsha, excuse me.
*  She ran something called cuddle parties, which people laughed at about a lot back
*  in the day and the premise of the cuddle parties, everyone got together and
*  cuddled, right?
*  And it's like, ah, then you stop to think about it and you realize, uh, physical
*  contact is extremely important and a lot of people don't have it.
*  And if this is a mechanism of people getting that, it actually is going to have
*  profound positive psychological consequences.
*  So after she explained it, I'm like, okay, we laughed at this cause it's weird.
*  And now that I think about it, this is wonderful.
*  And I asked her about like, like the tough question, I go, what if guys get
*  turned on and on their website, it's even has a rule like do not fear the erection.
*  Right?
*  Cause it's going to be a natural consequence of physical proximity.
*  And the point she goes, she said this, I think about us all the time.
*  People will take as much space as you let them.
*  It is incumbent on each of us to set our own boundaries.
*  We all have to learn when to say, no, you're making me uncomfortable.
*  If someone doesn't respect your right to have your boundary to be uncomfortable,
*  this person is not your friend.
*  Now they can say, I don't understand.
*  Like, why is this okay?
*  Why is that not?
*  I let me know you better.
*  So I'm respectful of you.
*  But if they roll their eyes and they're like, get over, I'm going to do what I
*  want, this person is not interested in knowing you as a human being.
*  Okay.
*  That is the aggression.
*  It is.
*  You have to draw those lines.
*  I mean, but that's a very positive way of phrasing that aggression.
*  I'm a very positive person, but the trolling there's a destructive thing to it.
*  Yes.
*  That hurts others.
*  Yes.
*  But it's not bad people.
*  I, so I only troll as a reaction or towards those in power.
*  Okay.
*  So maybe let's talk about trolling a little bit because trolling when it can,
*  maybe you can correct me, but I've seen it become a game for people.
*  That's enjoyable in itself.
*  I, I'm not, I'm not, I, I disagree with that.
*  That's not a good thing.
*  If you are there just to hurt innocent people, you are a horrible human being.
*  But doesn't trolling too easily become that?
*  Uh, I don't know about easily.
*  Let me give you an example of the, of the, of where trolling came from.
*  The original troll was Andy Kaufman.
*  He was on the show, Taxi.
*  He was a stand, he was a performance artist, not a standard comedian.
*  And this is a quintessential example of trolling.
*  He had a character, um, where he was basically like a lounge singer.
*  He had these glasses on, uh, and just a terrible, a terrible singer and so on
*  and so forth, and he denied it was him.
*  And he came out and I'm blanking on the guy's name.
*  I can't believe it.
*  Tony Clifton.
*  Wow.
*  He came out in the audience and he goes, you know, my wife died a few years ago.
*  Every time I look at my daughter, Sarah's eyes, I can see my wife, Sarah, come out
*  here, let's do a duet.
*  And Sarah was like 11, sits on his lap.
*  They start singing duet.
*  Her voice cracks.
*  He smacks her across the face.
*  What the hell are you doing?
*  You're making ass out of me in front of these people.
*  They're there.
*  She starts crying.
*  The audience is booing and he goes, don't bore.
*  You're just going to make her cry more.
*  Now it ends.
*  This wasn't his daughter.
*  It wasn't even child was an actress.
*  This was all set up.
*  He's exploiting their love of children in order to force them to be performers.
*  That is trolling.
*  No one is actually getting hurt.
*  It's a humorous, though twisted exchange.
*  If you go online looking for weak people and you are there to denigrate them just
*  for them being weak or in some way inferior to you, that is the wrong approach.
*  I am best on the counterpunch.
*  A lot of times people come to me and they'll be like, I hope you die.
*  You're ugly.
*  You're disgusting.
*  And there's this great quote from Billy Idol, which I'm going to mangle.
*  He has something effective.
*  I love it when people are rude to me.
*  Then I can stop pretending to be nice.
*  Then you start fights.
*  Now it's a chance for me to finish it and make an example of this person.
*  But that's very, very different from I'm going to go around and humiliate people
*  for the sake of doing it in my view.
*  And I can see how one would lead to the other.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's my fundamental concern with it.
*  So my dream is to put use technology, create platforms that increase the
*  amount of love in the world.
*  And to me, trolling is doing the opposite.
*  So like Andy Kaufman is brilliant.
*  So I love obviously sounds like I'm a robot saying I love humor.
*  Okay.
*  Humor is good.
*  But like, it's, I just see like 4chan.
*  I see that you can often see that humor quickly turn.
*  Yeah.
*  Because what happens is a lot of low status people, this is their one mechanism
*  through sadism to feel empowered and then they can hide behind.
*  Well, I'm just joking.
*  Yeah, like there's this dark thing.
*  That's not acceptable.
*  That's something to be kind of.
*  The dark LOL that people do, which is like, they'll say like the shittiest thing.
*  Right.
*  And then do LOL after.
*  Like as if, I don't even know like what is happening in that dark mind of yours.
*  Because they are feeling powerless in their lives.
*  Right.
*  And they see someone who they perceive as higher status or more powerful than
*  them or even not a peer.
*  And they, through their words, cause a reaction in this person.
*  So they feel like they are in a very literal sense, making a difference on
*  earth and they matter in a very dark way.
*  Uh, it's, it's disturbing.
*  This is not, I mean, it's unfortunate that that term trolling is used for that.
*  As opposed to what Andy Kaufman does, as opposed to what I do.
*  Um, it's, it really is a sinister thing and it's something I'm not at all a fan of.
*  Or do we, how do we fight that?
*  So like, uh, a neighboring concept of that is conspiracy theories, which is.
*  I don't think they're neighboring at all.
*  I go ahead.
*  Let me, let me give us sort of naive perspective.
*  Maybe you can educate me on this from my perspective.
*  Conspiracy theories are these constructs of ideas that go deeper and deeper and
*  deeper into, uh, creating worlds where there's, uh, powerful pedophiles controlling
*  things like these, uh, very sophisticated models of the world that, you know, in
*  part might be true, but in large part, I would say are our figments of imagination
*  that become really useful constructs.
*  And self-reinforcing.
*  Self-reinforcing for then feeding, like empowering the trolls to attack the
*  powerful, the conventionally powerful.
*  I don't think that that's a function of conspiracy theories.
*  Now let's talk about conspiracy theories.
*  Cause one of my quotes is you take one red pill, not the whole bottle.
*  This concept that everything in life is at the function of a small cadre of
*  individuals would be for many people reassuring because as bad as it looks,
*  you know, they, whoever they are, it's usually the Jews, aren't going to let it
*  get that bad that they will pull back.
*  Or the black pill is that they aren't intentionally trying to destroy everything
*  and there's nothing we can do and we're doomed.
*  And there's an amazing book by Arthur Herman called the idea of the
*  client Western history.
*  I it's one of my top 10 books where he goes through every 20 years, how there's
*  a different population that say it's the end of the world.
*  Here's the proof.
*  And very often the proof is something that is kind of self-fulfilling where
*  there's no, it's not falsifiable.
*  And we both have to think of ways to falsify our claims from earlier.
*  So it is a big danger.
*  It's a big danger online because very quickly, if someone who you thought was
*  good, but now is bad on one aspect, well, they're controlled opposition or they've
*  been taken over or they've been kind of appropriated by the bad people, whoever
*  those bad people would be.
*  Um, I don't know that I have a good answer for this.
*  I don't think it's as pervasive as people think.
*  The number of people who believe conspiracy theory.
*  Right.
*  I mean, and also conspiracy theory is a term used to dismiss ideas that have some
*  currency, the constitutional convention was a conspiracy.
*  Uh, the founding fathers got together secretly under sworn to secrecy in
*  Philadelphia said we're throwing out the Arctic's confederation.
*  We're making new government.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And Luther Martin left and he told everyone this is a conspiracy and they're
*  like, yeah, whatever, Luther Martin.
*  So, and Jeffrey Epstein was a conspiracy.
*  Harvey Weinstein was a conspiracy, Bill Cosby was a conspiracy.
*  They all knew they didn't care.
*  Uh, communist infiltration in America.
*  There's a great book by Eugene Lyons called the red decade.
*  They all knew they, every atrocity that was done under Stalinism was excused in
*  the West and if you didn't believe it, Oh, you've got this crazy anti-Russia conspiracy.
*  So it's a term that is weaponized in a negative sense, but that does not all
*  imply that it does not have very negative real life consequences because it's
*  kind of a cult of one, right?
*  Like I'm at home with my computer.
*  I bang into this ideology, anyone who doesn't agree with me, they are blind.
*  They're oblivious.
*  Mom and dad, my friends, you don't get it.
*  We were warned about people like you.
*  And I think there's a very heavy correlation.
*  I'm not a psychiatrist, of course, between that and certain types of mild
*  health illness, like, uh, you know, some kind of paranoid schizophrenia or
*  things like that, because after a certain point, if everything is a function, this
*  conspiracy, it's, it's, it's, there's no randomness or beauty in life.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I, I don't know if you can say anything interesting about it in the way
*  of advice of how to take a step into conspiracy theory world without completely
*  going like diving deep because it seems like that's what happens.
*  People can't look at Jeffrey Epstein.
*  I can tell you what the device I'd have.
*  So I'm seriously and rigorously without going because you can look at Jeffrey
*  Epstein and say, there's a deeper thing.
*  You can always go deeper.
*  Right.
*  It's like Jeffrey Epstein was just a tool of, uh, the lizard people and the lizard
*  people are the Satanists in this case.
*  And somehow recently very popular, but as pedophiles somehow always involved,
*  I'm not understanding any of that.
*  I need, I legitimately, I say this both humorously and seriously.
*  I need to look into it.
*  And I guess the bigger question I'm asking, how does a serious human being,
*  uh, somebody with a position at a respectable university, like look at a
*  conspiracy theory and look into it.
*  When I look at somebody like Jeffrey Epstein, who had a role at MIT.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And I, and I think I'm not happy personally.
*  I didn't, I wasn't there when Jeffrey Epstein was there.
*  I'm not happy with the behavior of people now about Jeffrey Epstein, about the
*  bureaucracy and the, everybody's trying to keep quiet, hoping it blows over
*  without really looking into any.
*  Like looking in a deep philosophical way of like, how do we let this
*  human being be among us?
*  Can I give you a better example?
*  Sure.
*  That is kind of conspiratorial.
*  The speaker of the house, the longest serving Republican speaker of the house,
*  Dennis Hastert was a pedophile.
*  He went to jail.
*  The Democrats don't throw this in the Republicans faces every five minutes.
*  Not even democratic activists.
*  I find that very, very odd and not what I would predict.
*  Now I'm not saying there's some kind of conspiracy, but when it comes to things
*  like sexual predation, which is something that I'm very, very concerned about.
*  I have an uncle now.
*  My sister just had her second kid recently.
*  He's adorable.
*  It's something that I don't understand.
*  It feels as if there's a lot of people who want this to all go away.
*  Now I think it's also because we don't have the vocabulary and framework to
*  discuss it, because when you start talking about things like children, these
*  kind of issues, we want to believe it's all crap because it's for those of us
*  who aren't in this kind of mindset, the idea that this happens to kids and
*  happens frequently is something so horrible that we, it's just like, I don't
*  even want to hear it.
*  And that does these children and adult survivors and enormous disservice.
*  So I don't know that I have any particular insight on this, but see, like
*  how do you, I mean the Catholic church, again, there's all these topics that.
*  Public school teachers are far more proportionally, uh, predators of
*  children than the Catholic church.
*  I mean, I don't know what I, you're right.
*  You're right.
*  Um, perhaps I'm, uh, I've been, you know, reading a lot about Stalin and Hitler.
*  Somehow it's more comforting.
*  Yeah.
*  Like to be there and then, and then, and then the atrocities that are happening
*  now, it's a little bit more difficult.
*  Because there was a New York times article started dropped you where they
*  were had a, um, people tracking down child pornography.
*  And I think the article said that didn't have enough people just to cover the,
*  uh, videotapes of infants being raped.
*  And we can even wrap our heads around like reading Lolita, like, okay, she's
*  14, 12, okay, it's still a female, an infant.
*  It's, it's something that again, like with the Stalin example, we sat down here
*  for a hundred years, we would never think of something like this thing in a
*  sexual context, it makes no sense.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, so, and the fact that this is international, okay, we
*  eliminated completely in America.
*  Well, then they're going to go find this.
*  There's infants all over the world.
*  There's video cameras all over the world.
*  So then it has to become a conspiracy because I, someone has to film it.
*  I'm filming it.
*  You're buying it.
*  Your kid, it is literally a conspiratorial, not in the sense of like a mafia
*  conspiracy or some government Illuminati, but there is our networks designed to
*  produce this product.
*  See, but like what I'm, I'm trying to do now, I mean, part of the, one of the
*  nice things with like a podcast and other things I'm involved with is, um,
*  removing myself from having any kind of boss so I can do whatever that helps.
*  Oh, it's so, it's so wonderful.
*  That just happened to me.
*  It's, it's, it's the most wonderful thing ever.
*  Uh, so I could do, I can actually in moderation consider like look into stuff.
*  Careful though.
*  I was going to write a book about this and people pointed out, you sure want to do
*  this research because if you start Googling around for this kind of stuff,
*  it's on your computer.
*  Oh, in that sense, I'm more concerned about, you know, it's the Nietzsche
*  thing, looking into the abyss.
*  Like you want to be very, I believe I can do this kind of thing in moderation
*  without slipping into the depths.
*  I think that's, that's intelligence.
*  That's, uh, like I recently quote unquote looked into like the UFO community, the,
*  um, extraterrestrial, whatever, whatever community.
*  I think it always frustrated me that the scientific community like rolled their
*  eyes at all the UFO sightings, all that kind of stuff, even though there could be
*  fascinating, beautiful physical fun, like first of all, there could like ball
*  lightning or the ball lightning.
*  Right.
*  That's at the very basic level is a fascinating thing.
*  And also it could be something like, I mean, I don't know, but it could be
*  something interesting, like worth looking into.
*  My grandfather was an air traffic controller back in the Soviet Union.
*  And he said, we saw this stuff all the time.
*  These are planes that were not moving or whatever things that were not moving
*  according to anything we knew about.
*  So it's absolutely real.
*  He's not some jerk with an iPhone in his backyard.
*  This is a, a military professional who understood technology, who knew
*  where the secret bases were.
*  So if he's telling me it's something, doesn't mean it's Martians, but he's
*  telling me there's something there.
*  And there are many examples of, of these like military people.
*  These aren't some layman who sees a story.
*  Yeah.
*  And, and so it's, you, you can dismiss, when you're talking about professionals
*  who are around aircraft all the time, who are familiar with aircraft at the highest
*  levels and they're seeing things that they can't explain.
*  It's they're clearly not stupid and they're clearly not under formed.
*  So my, there's different ways to dismiss idea.
*  For example, I am a, you were saying that trolling is a good mechanism.
*  I'm against that, but I'm not dismissing it by like rolling my eyes.
*  I'm considering legitimately that you're way smarter than me and you
*  understand the world better than me.
*  Like I'm allowing myself to consider that possibility and thinking about it.
*  Like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm
*  maybe, maybe that's true.
*  Like seriously considering it.
*  That's what that's, I feel the way people should approach intelligent people,
*  serious quote unquote people, scientists should approach conspiracy theories.
*  Like look at it carefully.
*  You know, is first of all, is it possible that the earth is flat?
*  It's not trivial to show that the earth is not flat.
*  It's a very good exercise.
*  You should go through it.
*  Yes.
*  But once you go through it, you realize that, uh, the,
*  based on a lot of data and a lot of evidence, and there's a lot of different
*  experiments you could do yourself actually, uh, to show that the earth is not flat.
*  Okay.
*  The same kind of process can be taken for a lot of different conspiracy
*  theories and it's helpful.
*  And without slipping into the depths of, of lizard people running everything.
*  That's where I, I, I've now listened to two episodes of, um, of Alex Jones's
*  show because he goes crazy deep into, um, into different kinds of worldviews
*  that I was not familiar with.
*  And I don't know what to make of it.
*  I mean, the reason I've been listening to it is because, um, there's been a lot
*  of discussions about platforming of different people and I've been thinking
*  about what a censorship mean.
*  I've been thinking about whether, because Joe Rogan, uh, said he's
*  going to have Alex on again.
*  And then I enjoyed it as a fan, just the entertainment of it.
*  But then I actually listened to Alex.
*  And I was thinking, is this human being dangerous for the world?
*  Like, is the ideas he's saying dangerous for the world?
*  I'm more concerned with the Russian conspiracy that we had for three years.
*  And the claim that our election was not legitimate and that everyone in the
*  Trump White House is a stooge of Putin.
*  Uh, and the people who said this had no consequences for this.
*  Alex Jones doesn't have the respect that they do.
*  Uh, these are both areas of concern for me.
*  But he might, he might if there's, if he's given more platforms.
*  So like the, the, the, the people who've, and I'd be curious to, I'm also a little
*  bit, I don't know what to think about the idea that Russians hacked the election.
*  It seems too easily accepted in the mainstream media.
*  Hillary Clinton said that how they did it was they had ads on the dark web.
*  Now you and I both know what the dark web is.
*  So the possibility of ads in the dark web having an influence from, uh,
*  proportionally influenced on the election is literally zero.
*  Perhaps I should look into it more carefully, but I've found very little
*  good data on exactly what did the Russians do to hack elections?
*  Like, like technically speaking, what are we talking about here?
*  Like as opposed to these kind of weird, like the best thing, there's a couple
*  of books and like reporting on like farms, like troll farms, troll farms.
*  But let's see the data, like how many exactly, what are we talking about?
*  Like, what were they doing?
*  Relative, not just like some anecdotal discussions of, but like relative to the
*  bigger, the size of Facebook, like if there's a few people, several hundreds,
*  say the posting different political things on Facebook relative to the full
*  size of Facebook, let's look at the full size, the actual impact, like the,
*  cause it's fascinating the social dynamics of viral information of videos.
*  When, when, uh, Donald Trump retweets something that I think that's
*  understudied the effect of that.
*  Uh, like he retweeted a clip with Joe Rogan on, um, within Mike Tyson, where
*  Mike Tyson says that he finds fighting orgasmic, I don't understand that, but
*  they'd be fascinating to think like, what is the ripple effect on the social
*  dynamic of our society from retweeting a clip about Mike Tyson?
*  What's your favorite Joe Rogan, um, um, Trump tweet?
*  I, I, I tuned them out a long time.
*  Oh, unfortunately.
*  I, I have, um, it's the, this goes to the, you and I have a different
*  relationship with Donald Trump.
*  You appreciate the art from a troll.
*  This is nonsexual.
*  Nonsexual.
*  Yeah.
*  So I, uh, I tend to prefer, uh, Bill Clinton.
*  He's more my type.
*  No, I'm just kidding.
*  Uh, I don't know.
*  You don't like that consent stuff.
*  No, no, no, no, you appreciate the art form of trolling and, and, uh,
*  Donald Trump is, is, uh, a master.
*  He's the Da Vinci of trolling.
*  So I tend to think that trolling is ultimately destructive for society.
*  And then Donald Trump takes nothing seriously.
*  He's playing a game.
*  He's making a game out of everything.
*  He takes a lot of things seriously.
*  I think he's very committed to international peace.
*  Sorry.
*  I, I shouldn't speak so strong.
*  I think, I think he takes actually, yes, a lot of things seriously.
*  I meant on Twitter and the game of politics.
*  Yeah.
*  He is, um, he only takes irreverently.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And, um, I appreciate it.
*  I just would like to focus on like genuine, real expressions of humanity,
*  especially positive.
*  Well, this is one, this is my favorite tweet.
*  My fans got it laser etched and put in a block of loose site for me.
*  And he said, every time I speak of the losers and haters, I do so with great affection.
*  They cannot help the fact that they were born fucked up.
*  That's an actual Trump tweet.
*  It's my favorite one.
*  And that's kind of nice.
*  That's love.
*  That's love.
*  That's kind of nice.
*  Great affection.
*  That, I mean, exclamation point.
*  I broke Lex.
*  What is love?
*  Yeah.
*  The sparks are flying, but I have to kind of analyze that from a, like a literary
*  perspective, but it seems like there's love in there, like a little bit, a little
*  bit lighthearted.
*  Cause he's saying even when I'm going after them, don't take it so seriously.
*  Yeah.
*  That's, that's nice.
*  It is nice.
*  It is acknowledging the game of it.
*  That's nice.
*  Uh, he's not always,
*  in some ways he's very, very vicious.
*  Yeah.
*  Very vicious.
*  He's done things that I can tell you about that.
*  I'm like, this is a bad person.
*  What do you think about one of the, okay, listen, I'm not, I, for people listening,
*  I do not have Trump derangement syndrome.
*  I'm, I don't, I see, I try to look for the good and the bad in everybody.
*  One thing, perhaps it's irrational, but perhaps because I've been reading history,
*  I, the one triggering thing for me is the delaying of elections.
*  I believe in elections and this is, this is the part that you probably disagree
*  with, but I, you know, I believe in the value of people voting.
*  And I just seen too many dictators, the place where they finally, the big switch
*  happens when you question the legitimacy of elections.
*  Who's been questioning the legitimacy of elections for the last three years?
*  I've only heard Donald Trump do it last like year, but the last three years
*  you're saying somebody else.
*  You don't think not my president, illegitimate.
*  We're not going to normalize him as president.
*  Russia hacked this election, impeached.
*  You're not a real president.
*  You don't think that's questioning legitimacy of 2016?
*  No, it's a good, uh, I haven't been paying attention enough, but I, I would,
*  I would imagine that argument has been that I haven't actually heard too many
*  people, but I imagine that's been a popular thing to say.
*  Okay.
*  I, but nevertheless, that's a part that didn't, uh, that's not a statement that
*  gained power enough to say that, um, Barack Obama will keep being president
*  or Hillary Clinton should be president.
*  Newsweek had that article, how Hillary Clinton gets to be president.
*  Newsweek.
*  No, but she's not.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  My worry isn't, my worry isn't, uh, saying that the election was illegitimate
*  and people whining and mass scale.
*  And then, uh, Fox news or CNN reporting for years or books being written for years.
*  My worry is legitimately martial law.
*  A person's mate stays president.
*  So here's the issue.
*  Like there's a, there's a
*  I did a book on North Korea.
*  I'm not someone who thinks dictatorship should be taken lightly.
*  I'm not someone who thinks it can't happen here.
*  Uh, I think a lot of times people are desperate for dictatorship.
*  So I am with you.
*  And I think this is something if you're going to hand wave it away,
*  everyone else hand waved it away.
*  Oh, Hitler's never going to be chancellor.
*  He's like a lunatic.
*  He's a joke.
*  He's a joke that he, they couldn't find a publisher for Mein Kampf in
*  English because this is some guy from some random minor party in Germany
*  spouting nonsense who's going to read this crap.
*  You know, so I completely agree with you in that regard.
*  You don't think we're there.
*  My point is Donald Trump this year had every, uh, pathway open to him
*  to declare martial law.
*  The cities are being burned down.
*  He could have very easily sent in the tanks.
*  Uh, and people would have been applauding him from his side.
*  We feel so good right now.
*  But am I wrong though?
*  No, I, I, what he did, he tweeted out to mayor Wheeler of Portland.
*  He said, call me.
*  We will, we will solve this in minutes, but you have to call.
*  And he sat in his hands and they said, oh, it's his fault.
*  The city is burning down.
*  He's not doing anything.
*  And he goes, I'm not doing anything until you ask me to do it.
*  So I think that is even if you think he's an aspiring dictator, that is at
*  least a sign that there is some restraint on his aspirations.
*  Can I just take that in as a beautiful, um, like moment of hope?
*  So I'm going to remember this moment.
*  Beautiful dead.
*  I'm going to, I'm going to remember that.
*  I mean, um, I, I should say that perhaps I'm irrationally, this is the one moment
*  where I feel myself being a little.
*  I don't think it's irrational.
*  I think there's an asymmetry because it's kind of like, okay, either I, if I
*  leave the house, it's like Russian roulette.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe it's like a one in six shot.
*  I'm pulling the trigger.
*  I'm killing myself, but that's one in six.
*  That's not, and the consequences are so dire that a little paranoia would go a
*  long way.
*  There's something that I can't go back.
*  Yeah.
*  You, you, it's an asymmetry.
*  Yeah.
*  And the, the thing is the thing that makes Donald Trump new to me.
*  And again, I'm a little naive in these things, but he surprised me in how many
*  ways he just didn't play by the rules.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's made me a little ant in this ant colony think like, well, do you have to
*  play by the rules at all?
*  Right.
*  Like why are we having elections?
*  Why did you say like it's coronavirus time?
*  Like it's, it's not healthy to have elections.
*  Like we shouldn't be like, I could, if I put my dictator hat on, Nancy Pelosi said
*  that Joe Biden shouldn't debate.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, did she?
*  Yes.
*  She says she, she shouldn't dignify Trump with a debate.
*  He's the president.
*  He could be the worst president on earth.
*  Evil despicable monster.
*  I'll, I'll take that as an argument.
*  So she's playing politics, but she's, I don't think that's playing politics.
*  I think when there's a certain point where things get, when things get, uh, when
*  you start attacking institutions for the emergencies at the moment and acting
*  arbitrarily, that is when things are the slippery slope.
*  Yep.
*  So you're saying debates is one of the institutions.
*  Like that's one of the traditions to have the debates.
*  I think the debates are extremely important.
*  Uh, I now, I don't think that someone's a good debater is going to make a good
*  president.
*  I mean, that's, that's a big problem.
*  But you're just saying this is attacking just yet another tradition, yet another,
*  you know, like how if you're dating, if you're married to someone and someone
*  throws out the word divorce, you can't unring that bell.
*  You threw it out there.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm saying you don't throw things out like that unless you really are
*  ready to go down this road.
*  And I think that is, there's nothing in the constitution about debates.
*  We've only had them since 1980, but still I think they are extremely important.
*  It's also a great chance for Joe Biden to tell him to his face.
*  You're full of crap.
*  Here's what you did.
*  Here's what you did.
*  Here's what you did.
*  So fascinating that you're both, you acknowledge that and you also see the
*  value of tearing down the entire thing.
*  So you're both worried about no debates or at least in your voice, in your tone.
*  There's a great quote by Chesterton.
*  I'm not a fan of him at all, but he says, before you tear down a fence, make sure
*  you know why they put it up first.
*  So I am for tearing it all down, but there's something called like a control
*  demolition, like building seven or there's, we knew we were in Tel Aviv.
*  And hashtag building seven.
*  We knew we were in Tel Aviv.
*  Wow.
*  You're faster than me.
*  You're, you're operating in a different level.
*  I need to upgrade my operating system.
*  I told you when I was 95.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, uh, building seven, if you're gonna, uh, it's like Indiana Jones, right?
*  If you're going to tear, pull something away, make sure you have something in place
*  first, as opposed to just breaking it.
*  And then just, especially in politics, it's cause it, it escalates.
*  And when things escalate without any kind of response, it, it can go in a very bad.
*  That's when Napoleon comes in.
*  So what's your prediction about the, the Biden Trump debates?
*  Again, I just have this weird, maybe we'll return to maybe not in this.
*  How do we put more love into the world?
*  And like, one of the things that worries me about the debates is it'll be, um, it'll
*  be the world's greatest troll against, uh, the, the grandpa on the porch.
*  Who crapped his pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And it will, it will not put more love into the world.
*  It will, it will create more mockery.
*  Like, uh, Joe Biden did a great job against Paul Ryan in 2012.
*  Paul Ryan was no lightweight.
*  No one thought he was a lightweight.
*  Joe Biden handed Sarah Pail in her ass in 2008, which isn't as easy to do as you
*  think, cause she's a female.
*  So you're going to come off as bullying.
*  That's something you have to worry about.
*  So the guy isn't, um, I think he is in the stages of like cognitive decline.
*  Um, so I think it's going to be interesting.
*  Uh, I want it to be, um, like Mike Tyson beating up a child, cause it'll be a
*  source of amusement to me.
*  Um, but I don't know how it's going to go.
*  Because it's possible that Joe Biden will be the Mike Tyson.
*  Yes, because in his last debate with Bernie, he was perfectly fine.
*  And again, the guy was a Senator for decades and I don't think anyone, if you
*  looked at Joe Biden in 2010, would have thought this guy is going to be, have
*  his ass handed him a debate.
*  You wouldn't think that at all.
*  So I don't know who we're going to see.
*  Plus he's got a lot of room to attack Trump.
*  So I'm sure he's going to come strapped and ready and he's going to have his
*  talking points and watch Trump dance, try to tap dance around him.
*  And if he's in a position, I don't know what the rules of the debate are to
*  actually nail them to the wall.
*  It might actually, I'm sure he's going to have a lot of little lines too.
*  The problem is Trump is the master counter puncher.
*  So he, like when Hillary's, you know, had her line, she's like, well, it's a
*  good thing that Donald Trump isn't in charge of our legal system.
*  And he's like, yeah, you'd be in jail.
*  It's like, it's like, oh, like you, lady, you set him up.
*  That's painful to watch those, those debates.
*  I mean, there's something, uh, I think it's actually analogous.
*  Um, come to think of it, uh, your conversation with me right now, some
*  sleepy Joe, I'm playing the role of sleepy Joe.
*  I actually connect to, uh, Joe.
*  Because there's like these weird pauses that I do.
*  I do the same.
*  I do the same thing and I noise the shit out of me that like, uh, in mid
*  sentence, I'll start saying a different thing and take a tangent.
*  I'm not as slow and drunk as I sound always.
*  I swear I'm more intelligent underneath it.
*  I'm slower, but less drunk.
*  Exactly.
*  But the result, one of those is true, but not both.
*  Yeah.
*  And, and, and Trump, just like you are a master counter puncher.
*  So it's going to be messy.
*  Here's the other thing.
*  In all seriousness, Chris Wallace is the moderator.
*  Chris Wallace has interviewed Trump several times and he was a tough, tough
*  questioner, so I don't think he's going to come in there with softball questions.
*  I think he's really going to try to nail Trump down, which is tough to do.
*  I like him a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  He's re and he's like, Mr.
*  President, sir, that's not accurate.
*  Blah, blah, blah.
*  He's done it.
*  And Trump gets very frustrated because he doesn't just let him say whatever he
*  wants and he hits him with the followup.
*  He's a, he's a, I guess he's on Fox news and he, I listened to a Sunday
*  program every once in a while.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  He gives me hope that, I don't know, there's something in the voice, like
*  that he's not bought.
*  He's I, I, there's no question.
*  He's going to take this seriously, which I think is the best you could
*  hope for in a moderator.
*  Like it feels like there's people that might actually take the mainstream
*  media into a place that's going to be better in the future.
*  And like, we need people like him.
*  You mean like Robespierre?
*  What do you mean?
*  Like taking the mainstream media to a better future, like bring out the guillotines.
*  Okay.
*  See you, you, you put your anarchist hat back on.
*  I don't think Robespierre is much of an anarchist, but yeah, I get what you're saying.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't think there should be a centralized place for news?
*  There isn't now.
*  Well, that's what mainstream media is supposed to represent and broken.
*  Well, it's not whatever, uh, what do you call that?
*  A place where people traditionally said was the, like the legitimate source of truth.
*  No, that's what the media was supposed to represent.
*  No, that's their, that's their big branding accomplishment.
*  It's a complete lie.
*  That was never true.
*  Yeah.
*  Because if you, here's what happens.
*  We remember the Spanish American war.
*  Remember the main, we have to take Cuba, yellow journalism, Willy Randolph
*  Hearst, right, then record scratch.
*  And then we're all objective.
*  Like when did this transition happen?
*  According to people when you were saying that the Kaiser is the worst human being
*  on earth, when you were downplaying, uh, Stalin and downplaying Hitler's atrocities.
*  When, when you were saying we had to be in Vietnam at what point WMDs, when did it
*  change?
*  It never changed.
*  You just are better con artists at a certain point and now the mask is dropping.
*  Yeah.
*  But don't you think there's, uh, at its best, like investigative journalism can
*  uncover truth in a way that, um, that like Reddit, uh, subreddits can't.
*  You know, Reddit, sure.
*  I agree at its best.
*  Absolutely.
*  That's not even the dispute.
*  But like, uh, don't you think, uh, like fake it until you make it is the right way
*  to do it, meaning like the news.
*  No, no, I meant the news saying like, we dream of doing, of arriving at the truth
*  and reporting the truth.
*  They don't say that.
*  CNN had an advertisement that said, this is an apple.
*  We only report facts.
*  That's a lie.
*  No, that's now, and now it's clear things have changed.
*  And they haven't changed.
*  You just more, you're more aware of chicanery.
*  But okay.
*  So the, how many people died in Iraq?
*  Cause Saddam Hussein was about to launch WMDs.
*  Who had consequences for this?
*  No one.
*  This isn't a minor thing.
*  This is lots of dead people.
*  Yeah.
*  And also, I mean, dead people.
*  It's horrible, but also the money, which has like we said, economic effects.
*  Marian Williamson, I think it was, it was had the Trump, both of them had the great
*  point that goes, it's like a trillion dollars.
*  How many schools would that build?
*  How many roads would that build?
*  Even here?
*  Why are we building hospitals in Iraq that we destroyed when we could building
*  hospitals here?
*  It makes no sense.
*  It's horrifying.
*  So who's responsible for that?
*  Like who, um, Alex Jones.
*  No, I meant for, well, uh, so.
*  Who's responsible for arriving at the truth of that, of speaking to the
*  money spent on wars in Iraq.
*  This is one of the great things about social media.
*  Uh, Twitter, you have faith in Twitter.
*  Not, not specific with Twitter, but yeah, social media is the whole, what anyone
*  could be here's a great, another great example before, if you were talking about
*  police brutality or these riots, you would have to perceive it in the way it was
*  framed and presented to Nicholas Sandman.
*  Another example, uh, Brianna Taylor, all these things, well, they wouldn't
*  have footage of her.
*  Um, you would have to perceive in the way that it's edited and presented
*  to you by the corporate press.
*  Now everyone is a video has video camera.
*  Everyone has their perspective and it's very useful when these incidents happen
*  where you could see the same incident from several angles and you don't need
*  Don Lemon or Chris Wallace to tell me what this means.
*  I can see with my own eyes.
*  Yeah.
*  I've, I've been very pleasantly surprised about the power.
*  See, like people, the mob again gets in the way, they get emotional and they
*  destroy like the, the ability for people to reason, but you're right.
*  That truth is unobstructed on social media.
*  Like if you're, if you're careful and patient, you can see the truth.
*  Yeah.
*  Like for example, data on COVID, some of the best sources are doctors.
*  Like if you want to know the truth about the coronavirus, what's happening
*  is there's follow people on Twitter.
*  Yeah.
*  There's certain people that are just like sourcing information versus
*  the CDC and the WHO.
*  It's that's, that's fast.
*  I mean, it's, well, it's kind of anarchy, right?
*  It's, it's, it's kind of, it is anarchy.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, well, there's some censorship and all that kind of stuff.
*  You have censorship under anarchy in a sense that you're talking about.
*  Like people be kicked off of Twitter.
*  That's a drawing boundaries.
*  Somebody.
*  Okay.
*  So, I mean, it's a private company.
*  Private company.
*  Most people wouldn't say Twitter is working, but they, that's probably
*  because they take for granted how well it's working and they're just
*  complaining about the small part of it.
*  That's broken.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Another question about, you feel better?
*  No, by the way, I mean, I had a personal gripe with the situation about the, um,
*  not a personal gripe, but I felt overly emotional about, um, the possibility
*  that there will be some of Donald Trump messing with the election process.
*  But you made me feel better saying like he, if he had a bunch of opportunities
*  to, um, to do what, like to do what I would have done if I was a dictator, I
*  would, um, the first time those rides over George Floyd, I would institute
*  um, martial law.
*  Do you know what I remember very vividly is after 9 11 and everyone was waiting
*  for George Bush to give his speech and he had 98% approved rating.
*  And I remember very vividly, cause if he had said we're suspending the
*  constitution, everyone would have cheered for him.
*  Like he couldn't get enough support at that time and he didn't do it.
*  And I can't say anything really good about George W.
*  Bush.
*  I'm not a fan of his to say the least.
*  So I think you and I, and you know, other people who are familiar with, you
*  know, uh, totalitarian regimes to some extent from our ancestry or whatever,
*  from research should always be the ones freaking out and warning, but we should
*  also be aware of, we got a ways to go before it's Hitler.
*  And thankfully, uh, there are a lot of dominoes that have to fall into place
*  before Hitler, it's like the game secret Hitler, it's a board game before
*  Hitler becomes Hitler.
*  Like it's not, especially in America, there's lots of things that have to
*  happen before you really get to that point.
*  I mean, FDR was for all intents and purposes, a dictator, but even then the
*  worst you could say, and this is not something that you should take lightly
*  was internment of Japanese citizens, but they weren't murdered.
*  Uh, they weren't, you know, uh, you know, under lock and key in the sense of
*  like in cells, so things could have gotten a lot worse for him.
*  We have to, I mean, Hitler is such a horrible person to bring up because
*  Mussolini, you know, Mussolini is better because Hitler is so closely connected
*  to the atrocities of the Holocaust.
*  There's all this stuff that led up to the war and the war itself say that there
*  was no Holocaust Hitler would probably be viewed differently.
*  Yes, I think so.
*  Well, I mean, but you think that's a very controversial stance.
*  You think Hitler would be viewed differently if it wasn't for the Holocaust?
*  Well, I mean, but it's a funny thing that the, the, the, the, I would say the
*  death of how many 40, 50 million.
*  I mean, I don't know how you calculate it as is not seen as, as bad as the 6 million.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Cause of Mal and Stalin.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's, but it's interesting.
*  Uh, you're working on it.
*  You're working on it.
*  Yeah.
*  The next book I'm talking about.
*  Reminding.
*  Well, it's good.
*  Um, I'm glad a good writer is, cause it was not reminded.
*  My last book, the new right, you know, I had to deal with some like the Nazis.
*  And one of the points they make is how come everyone knows about the Holocaust,
*  but no one knows about the Hall of the More.
*  And they're right.
*  We should know about this because it is a great example of both how the
*  Western media were depraved, but also what human beings are capable of.
*  Uh, and those scars are still, you know, many Americans think Russia
*  and Ukraine are the same thing.
*  You know, that like the, oh, Trump's in bed with the Ukrainians.
*  Trump's about the Russians.
*  They think it's the same thing.
*  They're it's for us, it's complete lunacy.
*  Um, but this is the kind of thing where Pol Pot is another example, uh, where
*  people have no clue of what has been done to their fellow man in the face of
*  this earth and they should know.
*  How much of that do you lay at the hands of communism?
*  How much are you with like a Jordan Pearson who has, as intricately
*  connecting the atrocities, like, like you're saying 1930s, Ukraine,
*  where people were starved.
*  Um, I recently, my grandmother recently passed away and she, she, she
*  survived that as a kid, which is, it's fat.
*  Those people, I mean, just, they're tough.
*  They're tough.
*  Like that whole region is tough because they survived that.
*  And then right after the occupation of Nazis, yeah.
*  Of Germans.
*  Um, how much do you lay that at communism as an ideology
*  versus, um, Stalin, the man.
*  Uh, I think, you know, Lenin was building concentration camps, you know,
*  while he was around and slave labor.
*  Um, I don't, I think it's clearly both.
*  There's certain variants of communism that were far like Khrushchev, you know,
*  and Gorbachev, uh, the reason the Soviet union fell apart.
*  And this is kind of, I'm going to spoil the end of the book.
*  There's an amazing book called revolution 1989.
*  It's like the most beautiful book I've ever read by Victor Sebastian.
*  He's a Hungarian author.
*  And basically what happens in 1989, Poland has their elections.
*  And then, then in 1990, they kind of led into labor people to the government.
*  And people start crossing borders, you know, in the Eastern block.
*  And you had Hanukkah from Eastern Germany and, uh, Ceausescu from Romania,
*  calling Gorbachev because those are the two toughest ones by communist standards.
*  They go, they're, they're just escaping.
*  We're going to, we're going to lose everything.
*  You got to send in the tanks like you did in Hungary, like you did in Czech
*  Republic, Czechoslovakia in 68.
*  And Gorbachev goes, I'm not sending the tanks.
*  And they go, dude, if you don't sing in the tanks, it's all done.
*  And he goes, Nope, I'm not that kind of guy.
*  And they were right.
*  I mean, they, uh, Ceausescu was personally shot with his wife up against the wall.
*  Hanukkah, I forget what happened to him, but they all self-liberated.
*  My friend who was born in Czechoslovakia, his mom was pregnant, you know, under
*  communism and she never even imagined he'd be free and he was born under free.
*  Uh, and they were all looking around all these countries that self-liberated
*  because they're like, this is a trick, right?
*  They're just, they're trying to figure out who's like not good so that they can
*  arrest us en masse and they didn't.
*  So, uh, there, uh, even within communism, there are bad guys and better guys.
*  But we talked about anarchy.
*  We talk about democracy.
*  Do you see like there's democratic socialism conversations going on in, uh,
*  the popular culture, socialism is seen as like evil or for some people great.
*  Sure.
*  What, like, what are your thoughts about as in a political ideology?
*  Evil.
*  So you're on the evil side.
*  Yes.
*  Fundamentally.
*  Yes.
*  What, what, what is it?
*  You know, what, yeah.
*  Whoa.
*  What makes it evil?
*  What's like structurally, if you were to try to analyze what?
*  Sure.
*  There's, I say three ways.
*  Morally, no person has the right to tell another person how to live their life.
*  Um, economically, it's not possible to make calculations under socialism.
*  It's only the price, the prices that are information that tells me, oh, this is,
*  we need to produce more of this.
*  We need to produce less of this without prices being able to adjust and give
*  information to producers and, and, and, uh, consumers, you have no way of being
*  able to produce, uh, effectively or efficiently.
*  And also it is, uh, it turns people against each other.
*  When you force people to interact, when you force them into relationships, when
*  you force them into jobs, um, and you don't give them any choice, when there's
*  a monopoly, uh, the consequence of monopoly, everyone's familiar with
*  in ostensibly under capitalism.
*  But somehow when it's a government monopoly, all those economic
*  principles don't work.
*  Doesn't make any sense.
*  But there's force in democracy too.
*  It's just, you're saying there's a bit more force in, uh, in socialism.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's interesting that you say that there's not enough information.
*  I mean, that's ultimately, you need to have really good data to achieve
*  the goals of the system, even, even if there's no corruption, right?
*  You just need to have the information, right?
*  Which you can't.
*  And capitalism provides you, um, like really strong real time information
*  that, um, and if like capitalism that is best and cleanest, which is like
*  perfect information is available.
*  There's no manipulation of information.
*  That's one, you know, that's one of the problems.
*  Okay.
*  Can we talk about some candidates, the ones we got and possible alternatives?
*  So one question I have is why do we have within the system?
*  Why do we have the candidates we have?
*  Is it, it seems, um, maybe you can correct me.
*  Highly unsatisfactory.
*  Like the, like, is anyone actually excited about our current candidates?
*  I'm kind of excited because no matter who wins the elections can be hilarious.
*  So that is something that I'm excited about from a, from a humor perspective.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that what the whole system is?
*  So that's one theory of the case is the entire thing is optimized for viewership
*  and excitement by definitions of like the reality show kind of excitement.
*  I think it is.
*  If you look at what happened with Brett Kavanaugh, this is not a career that
*  would draw people who are, you might say quality.
*  Because no matter who they are, there would be a huge incentive from the other
*  team to denigrate them and humiliate them in the worst possible ways.
*  Because as the two teams lose their legitimacy among gen pop, it's going to
*  get harder and harder for them to maintain any kind of claims to authority,
*  which is something I like, but which does kind of play out in, you know,
*  certain nefarious ways.
*  So people, the best of the best are not going to want to be politicians.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I could have a job where I have a job interview and I'm running
*  Yahoo or whatever, or I could for 18 months have to eat, you know, corn dogs
*  looking like I'm going down on someone and shake hands and have all this, my
*  family and on social media daily called the worst things for what, and then I'm
*  still not guaranteed the position.
*  But the flip side of that, like from my perspective is the competition is weak.
*  Meaning like you need a certain, a minimum amount of eloquence clearly that
*  I don't, uh, the bar, which I did not pass.
*  I don't think either of them would be considered particularly eloquent,
*  Biden or Trump.
*  No, I know.
*  But that's what I'm saying.
*  The competition, like if, if you were, um, wanted to be, become a politician,
*  if you wanted to run for president, the opportunity is there.
*  Like if you were at all competent, like if you had, so like Andrew Yang is an
*  example of somebody who has a bunch of ideas is somewhat, uh, eloquent, like
*  young, energetic, it feels like there should be thousands of Andrew Yang's,
*  like that would enter the domain.
*  And he went nowhere.
*  Well, he, well, I wouldn't say he went nowhere.
*  He generated quite a bit of excitement.
*  He just didn't go very far.
*  That's okay.
*  You don't have to run for president to generate excitement with your ideas.
*  You could be a podcast host.
*  I'm not even joking.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  And he's both Andrew Yang.
*  Oh, he's a podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  He has a podcast called Yang Speaks.
*  No.
*  Okay.
*  Cool.
*  Oh, wow.
*  The music of the way he said, uh, yeah, cool.
*  Is the way my mom talks to me when I tell her something exciting going on in my
*  life.
*  Oh, that's nice, honey.
*  Oh, you made a robot.
*  Oh, that's cool.
*  I'll make coffee.
*  Oh, you still single though, aren't you?
*  I wonder why.
*  I wonder why.
*  Make yourself a robot.
*  Why?
*  Give me some robot grandchildren.
*  Uh, okay.
*  But, uh, first of all, okay.
*  Let me ask you about Andrew Yankees.
*  He represents fresh energy.
*  You don't find him fresh or energetic.
*  You know, like, is there any candidate you wish?
*  Was, um, in the mix that was in the mix.
*  You wish was one of the last two remaining.
*  Yeah.
*  People like Marion Williamson.
*  I thought was great.
*  Uh, Tulsi I thought was great.
*  Amy Klobuchar got a bad rap.
*  Uh, I think she held her own.
*  Um, smart.
*  She wasn't particularly funny.
*  That's okay.
*  I think she was not threatening to a lot of people.
*  What did you like about them?
*  I guess it's named all women.
*  That's interesting.
*  It wasn't even intentional.
*  Um, Tulsi I like that she was aggressive, has a good resume.
*  And is not, um, staying the course for the establishment.
*  Marion Williamson I like cause she comes from a place from what it seems of genuine compassion.
*  Maybe she's a sociopath.
*  I don't know.
*  I read her book and it actually affected me profoundly because it's very rare when you
*  read a book and there's even that one idea that blows your mind and that you kind of
*  think about all the time.
*  And there was one of that such idea in her book about, um, she was teaching something
*  called a course in miracles in Hollywood.
*  I think she still teaches it.
*  And this was during the eighties to hide the AIDS crisis.
*  And all these young men in the prime of their life were dropping like flies.
*  And she's trying to give them hope.
*  Well, good luck.
*  They're dying.
*  No one cares.
*  And they're like, you can't tell us that they're going to cure this.
*  Like you're, that's a lie.
*  And she goes, what if I told you they're not going to cure it?
*  What if I told you it's going to be to like diabetes?
*  They cut off your foot and you're going to go blind.
*  Would that be something that you can hope for?
*  And when you put it like that, it's like, yeah, like if you're talking to
*  someone like a homeless junkie and you're like, you could be a doctor.
*  You're a lawyer or a lawyer.
*  Like cool story.
*  Like you could have a studio apartment with a terrible roommate and a shitty job.
*  But when you're on the street, you know, cooking breakfast in a teaspoon and you
*  hear that, you're like, wait, would that really be so bad?
*  Is that really so much worse than this?
*  No.
*  And it becomes something.
*  So when she put it in those terms, I'm like, wow, this woman that really did a
*  number on me in terms of teaching people how to be hopeful, small steps, but it's,
*  but it's also then it becomes less of, I need a miracle to be like, oh, this is
*  really manageable.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, it's, and it's absurd to think it's impossible.
*  What about what's your take on you?
*  The 2020 that Bretman Weinstein pushed forward?
*  It was DOA.
*  He couldn't even stand up to Twitter.
*  Dead on arrival.
*  Dead on arrival.
*  He couldn't even stand up to Twitter, let alone or to Facebook.
*  They got blocked, let alone to the...
*  Wasn't that hugely problematic by the way, that Twitter would block that?
*  Not at all.
*  Um, I don't know why they blocked it, but I believe, I don't know problematic means.
*  That's a word that does a lot of work, uh, that people want it to do conceptually.
*  Um, the idea that like unity is like taking the rejects from each party and we're
*  going to like have something that no one likes and therefore it's going to be a
*  compromise is absurd.
*  The last time we had this kind of unity ticket was the civil war where you had
*  Andrew Johnson from the Democrats and Lincoln from the Republicans.
*  This was not something that ended well, uh, particularly nicely for both halves
*  of the country.
*  So that's the way you see it is like the way I saw it, I guess I haven't looked
*  carefully at it.
*  I hadn't either to be fair.
*  Yeah.
*  The way I saw it is emphasizing centrists, which is, uh...
*  How's Tulsi a centrist?
*  Tulsi was involved?
*  Yes.
*  He's trying to push Tulsi and like Jesse Ventura or something.
*  Oh, so, okay.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know the specifics.
*  As a scientist, you also know centrism is not a coherent term in politics.
*  But see now you're like, uh, uh, what is it?
*  Pleading to authority and my ego.
*  No, no, I'm pleading to how you approach data.
*  If someone is saying the mean is accurate, that only mean that I mean, the
*  mean could be anywhere.
*  It's a function of what's around it.
*  That's mean is true.
*  I don't even know what a centrist is supposed to mean, but what it means to me,
*  there's no idea.
*  A centrist.
*  There's more of a center right or center left.
*  To me, what that means is somebody who is a liberal or a conservative, but is,
*  um, open-minded and, uh, empathetic to the other side.
*  Joe Biden had the crime bill.
*  Joe Biden voted for Republican Supreme court justices.
*  Joe Biden voted for a balanced budget.
*  Joe Biden voted for Jewish's war.
*  And I'm sure probably haven't looked this up the Patriot act.
*  Joe, if you want a centrist, you have Joe Biden.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  He's worked very well with the Republican.
*  That argument could be made.
*  Of course they'll, everybody will always resist that argument.
*  I, you know, it's indeniable.
*  In fact, during the campaign, some, uh, um, uh, activists started yelling at him
*  at a town hall, not yelling, just saying, Hey, we need open borders.
*  Joe Biden says, I'm not for open borders.
*  Go vote for Trump and literally turn his back on the man.
*  And this is during the primaries where it would be who view to try to appeal to the base.
*  And of course you can probably also make the argument that Donald Trump is
*  center right, if not center left.
*  Well, I mean, he's, he's very, uh, uh, unique as a personality.
*  But if you look at his record and his first time he's rhetoric, you can
*  say he's not centrist at all.
*  But in terms of how he governs the budgeting, I mean, it's been very moderate.
*  It certainly hasn't been like draconian budget cuts.
*  Uh, the Supreme court, you could say, okay, he's hard, right.
*  Immigration, you could say in certain capacities is hard, right.
*  But in terms of pro-life, what has he done there in terms of, you know, so it's
*  in many other aspects, he's been very much this kind of me too, a Republican,
*  but certainly the rhetoric, it's very hard to make him the case that he's a centrist.
*  So you don't like, uh, is there any other idea you find compelling?
*  Like what I like about UND 2020 is it's an idea for a different way for like a
*  different party, a different path forward.
*  So ideas just like anarchy is an interesting idea that leads to discourse.
*  That leads to-
*  I don't think it's interesting at all.
*  And here's why I don't think it's interesting.
*  Uh, Sweden has eight parties in its parliament.
*  Iceland populations like 150,000.
*  They've got nine.
*  I think it was Czech Republic has nine.
*  Britain has five.
*  Um, so the claim that two, uh, parties is the, uh, censorious of speech, but three,
*  oh, now all of a sudden it makes no sense.
*  Doesn't port to the data.
*  Number one, number two is Donald Trump demonstrated that you can be basically
*  a third party candidate sees the machinery of a existing party and appropriate to
*  your own ends as Bernie Sanders.
*  Bernie Sanders has never been a Democrat.
*  Uh, major credit to him for that's not easy to be elected as Sanders and independent.
*  He's done it repeatedly.
*  So these are two examples of ossified elites, uh, right for the picking.
*  So to have a third party makes, uh, no real sense.
*  Speaking of which party you talk about quite a bit.
*  Uh, and, uh, uh, let's look, this is a personal challenge to you.
*  Let me bring up the libertarian party and the personal challenge is to go five
*  minutes without mocking them in discussing, uh, in discussing this idea.
*  So first of all, what is it?
*  I'm being trolled.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  I'm being trolled.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm being trolled.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  You remember the fun friends?
*  There was an episode where Chandler had to not make fun of people.
*  Like, can you go one day Chandler and Phoebe starts telling him about
*  like this UFO she saw and he's like, that's very interesting.
*  This is exactly that.
*  Okay.
*  So a true master would be able to play within the game within the constraints.
*  So, um, no, I, I'm pretty sure you'll still mock them, but I'll stick to the rules.
*  Five minutes.
*  So first of all, speaking broadly about libertarianism, can you speak to that?
*  How you feel about it?
*  And then also to the libertarian party, which is the implementation
*  of it in our current system.
*  So I think libertarianism is a great idea.
*  And I think there's many libertarian ideas that have become much more mainstream,
*  which I'm very, very happy about.
*  I remember there was an article in either New York or New Yorker magazine
*  in the early nineties, where they talked about the Cato Institute, which
*  is a libertarian think tank, and they referred to the fact that Cato was
*  against war and against like regulation with a wacky consistency.
*  Uh, cause they didn't know how to reconcile these two things.
*  I don't remember where the two things were, but I remember that
*  expression, wacky consistency.
*  And it wasn't even, we were all taught, and this is very much before the
*  internet, that there's two tribes.
*  And if you're pro-life, you have to hate gays.
*  And if you're for socialized medicine, that also means you have to be for,
*  uh, um, uh, you know, free speech.
*  It was just this very, and like there's a whole menu and you
*  got to sign into all of them.
*  And that menu is terrible.
*  They hate America.
*  They want to destroy it.
*  Oh my God, those are horrible.
*  Evil.
*  This is the menu you want.
*  And the libertarian party to some extent, and just libertarian as a whole said,
*  you know, you can do the Chinese buffet and take a look from column A, look from
*  column B and have an ideology that is coherent and consistent in ideology,
*  ideology of peace and, uh, non-aggression and things like that.
*  The libertarian party takes its model from like the early progressive and
*  populist parties from the early 20th century, which were not very effective
*  in terms of getting people elected, but were extremely effective in terms of
*  getting the two major parties to appropriate and adopt their ideas and
*  implement them and in Britain as well.
*  The liberal party got destroyed and became taken over by labor as the
*  alternative party to the Tories.
*  Um, and have those ideas basically become mainstreamed.
*  So I think that, and the libertarian, my friend who passed away, Eric, I
*  miss him dearly, uh, was the webmaster.
*  And his whole point is if you don't think of that in terms of party, in terms
*  of getting people elected, but if you think of it as a party in terms of
*  getting people educated about alternatives, then there's enormous use for that.
*  That was his perspective.
*  And I don't think that's an absurd perspective, but here's some libertarian
*  ideas that have become extremely mainstream.
*  War should be a last resort.
*  Uh, this is something we've taught as kids and we all say, but for many years
*  it's been like, they don't think of it as the last resort.
*  It's like something's bad.
*  Well, it's like the first instinct.
*  Now it's like, let's really give it a week, just a week.
*  Like what's going on in Syria?
*  Is there really going to be a genocide?
*  The Kurds, you know, things like that.
*  So that's one.
*  Another thing is drug legalization.
*  Uh, this was, you know, when you and I were kids, oh, it's crazy.
*  It's only hippies want to smoke pot.
*  Now it's like, with it, I was on a grand jury and I'll point out people make is,
*  are you sure that the 16 year old who's selling weed, let's say selling, should
*  his life be ruined?
*  Should he be imprisoned with rapists and murderers?
*  Like if you say yes, say yes, but you, but are you sure you have to acknowledge
*  that that's what you're meaning?
*  And then a lot of people are like, wait a minute, there's gotta be a third option.
*  Then he has no consequences or he's imprisoned with the rapist.
*  Like I'm not comfortable with either of these.
*  Uh, and I think the other one is a, an increasing skepticism.
*  This libertarians were on top of this first and the hard left of the police.
*  Uh, as of now, asset forfeiture steals more from people than burglaries.
*  What people don't know about what asset or forfeiture is.
*  If the cops come to your house and they suspect you, you haven't been convicted
*  of using your car or your house or whatever, in terms of selling drugs, they
*  can take whatever they want and then you have to sue to prove your innocence
*  and get your property back.
*  It's a complete violation of due process.
*  People don't realize this going on.
*  It's a great way for the cops to increase their budgets and it's legal.
*  And libertarians were like the first big one saying, guys, this is not
*  American and this is crazy.
*  And now increasingly people on conservatives and leftists like, wait a
*  minute, this, this is, even if you are selling drugs, like they take your house,
*  what are you talking about?
*  So I think those are some mechanisms that libertarianism though, but not by
*  name has become far more popular.
*  Yeah, that's interesting.
*  So the idea, yeah, coherent set of ideas, uh, that, that eventually get
*  integrated into the two party system.
*  Yeah.
*  The war, that's an interesting one.
*  You're right.
*  I would want, I wonder what the thread there is.
*  I wonder how it connects to nine 11 and so on.
*  But I think that I think the Patriot act, Patriot act for people who are
*  politically savvy were like, oh, okay, this is not a joke.
*  This is really a crazy infringement or freedoms and both parties are falling
*  over each other to sign into law and the Orwellian name, you don't want to,
*  how can you be against patriotism?
*  What kind of person, you know what I mean?
*  So that, I think for a lot of people, especially both civil libertarians on
*  the left and a lot of conservatives who are constitutionalists are like, wait a
*  minute, this isn't, I'm not comfortable with this and I'm also not comfortable
*  with how comfortable everyone in Washington is with it.
*  You're right.
*  Probably libertarian libertarians and libertarianism is a place of ideas,
*  which is why I have a connection to it.
*  Like I like, I like the, every time I listen to those folks, I like them.
*  I feel connected to them.
*  I would even sometimes depending on the day, call myself a libertarian.
*  Well, we're all in the spectrum.
*  So that's why we're on the spectrum.
*  Yeah.
*  But like, when I look at the people that actually rise to the top in terms of
*  like the people who represent the party, this is where like five minutes right out.
*  Right?
*  You can go, why are they so weird?
*  Why aren't strong candidates emerging that represent as political, like
*  representatives or as like, uh, famous speakers like that represent the ideology.
*  I think, uh, libertarians tend to, I think John and height in his book and his
*  research, he's a political scientist and he does a lot of things about how people
*  come to their political conclusions and what factors, um, force people to reach
*  conclusions and he found that libertarians are the least empathetic and
*  most rationalistic of all the groups.
*  And by that, he means like they think in terms of logic as opposed to like
*  people's feelings and that has positives and has negatives.
*  Uh, it would, and we have the AB testing with Ron Paul.
*  Ron Paul ran for president as a libertarian nominee.
*  He was the nominee.
*  He got pretty much nowhere in 1998.
*  Then he ran as a return to the Republican party as a congressman for many years from
*  Texas, he ran for the presidency in 2008 and 2012 and in 2008, he stood on stage
*  with Rudy Giuliani and told him that they were here in nine 11 because we're over
*  there, which would have been a shocking, horrifying taboo a few years earlier.
*  Many people were like, Holy crap, this is amazing.
*  Giuliani was all offended and Ron Paul's like, I took some guts by the way.
*  Yeah, I did.
*  When I heard that, it was so refreshing that not what he said, but the fact that
*  he said something that took guts.
*  It made me realize how rare it is for people, for politicians, but even people
*  to say something that takes guts.
*  Well, it's also the idea that like, you can't, even if you think America has a
*  right to invade any country on earth as much as it wants and kill people as a
*  consequence of war and blow up their buildings and destroy their country, you
*  can't with a straight face, not expect us to have consequences, even if they're
*  consequences from evil people, even if we're 100% of the good guys and they're
*  100% of the bad guys, those bad guys, some of them are still going to try to do
*  something.
*  What happens next?
*  You know what I mean?
*  So that kind of concept that there's any American culpability was, we're America,
*  with, you know, we are the good guys by definition, we're not culpable to have
*  people start thinking about what if there's another way, you know, what if
*  we're not there and then they're not here and we're kind of doing a backdoor
*  we're talking, so different scenarios.
*  So the fact that he got so much more traction as a Republican, the fact that
*  Donald Trump, who came out of nowhere, became the, not only the candidate, but
*  the president tells people it's like getting a book deal, right?
*  You can either go, there's three choices.
*  You can either self-publish, mainstream publisher, or independent publisher.
*  The independent publisher is the worst of all choices because you're not getting a
*  big advance.
*  They're not going to be able to promote you a lot and they don't get the
*  distribution.
*  Mainstream, I've done mainstream myself, right?
*  With self, I don't have the cred, the respectability of a mainstream, the
*  cache.
*  It can be a New York Times bestseller.
*  Right.
*  It takes a lot of work, but I get a lot more of the profit.
*  If it looks good on the shelf, on Amazon looks identical, so on and so forth.
*  With the mainstream, the benefits and costs are pretty much obvious to most
*  people.
*  So the same thing.
*  It's like, you can either be an independent like Ross Perot, or you could
*  be, just seize one of the party apparatus, which the benefits are enormous there.
*  But in terms of going third party, I don't know the libertarian party apparatus
*  other than maybe some ballot access is really that efficacious.
*  And then you're going to have a lot of baggage.
*  Because if you hear independent, Jesse Ventura, Ross Perot, you think of the
*  person, now you have to define yourself and you have to defend the party.
*  That's two bridges for most people.
*  Brilliantly put.
*  Okay.
*  Let me speak to it because I'm speaking to your own Brooks and yeah, I like him.
*  Yeah.
*  So, but that another example, I was asked him to tell you a joke about Ayn Rand
*  if he can do it.
*  So there, that's one criticism I've heard you say, which is they're unable to
*  speak to any weaknesses in either Ayn Rand's or Objectivist worldview.
*  Yes.
*  That's really, you put it, I know you're half joking, but that's actually
*  a legitimate discussion to have.
*  I'm not joking at all.
*  Because that's to me, one of the criticisms and one of the explanations
*  why the world seems to disrespect Ayn Rand, the people that do, is she kind of
*  implies that her ideas are like flawless.
*  She says they correspond to reality.
*  Yeah, right.
*  That's the term she uses.
*  That, I mean, Objectivist, it's in the name.
*  It's, you know, it's just facts.
*  Like it's impossible to basically argue against because it's pretty simple.
*  It's just all facts.
*  Well, that's, it's possible to argue against, but she would say she's never
*  met a good critic who can argue the facts that misrepresentation and she's not
*  entirely wrong.
*  She's often caricatured because she has a very extreme personality and
*  extreme view worldview.
*  But that to me, I mean, some people, there's a guy named in the physics
*  mathematics community called Stephen Wolfram.
*  I don't know if you're from Alpha.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  He has a similar style of speaking sometimes, which is like, I've created a
*  science, but that turns a lot of people off, like this kind of weird confidence.
*  But he's one of my favorite people.
*  I think one of the most brilliant people.
*  If you just ignore that little bit of ego or whatever you call that, that
*  there's some beautiful ideas in there.
*  And that, for me, objectivism, I'm under educated about it, about it.
*  Uh, I hope to be more educated, but there's some interesting ideas that again,
*  just like with UFOs, uh, not that there's a connection between you and
*  bring that up for your own.
*  He won't like it.
*  He won't like UFOs.
*  Oh no, no, no.
*  This interview is over.
*  Uh, that's a good yarn.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, but you know, you have to be a little bit open mind, but what's your
*  sense of, of objectivism?
*  What's, uh, are there interesting ideas that are useful to you to think about?
*  I own her copy of the first printing of the fountain head.
*  So that should tell you a little bit about how my affection for miss
*  Rand, how heavy that goes.
*  Um, I, I ran does not have all the answers, but she has all the questions.
*  So if you study Rand, you are going to be forced to think through
*  some very basic things and you're going to have your eyes open very, very heavily.
*  Uh, she was not perfect.
*  She never claimed to be perfect.
*  She was asked on Donahue, uh, is it true that according to your
*  philosophy, you are a perfect being?
*  She said, I never think of myself that way.
*  And she said, but if you asked me, do I practice what I preach?
*  The answer is yes.
*  And he's sounding Lee.
*  Um, she's a fascinating woman.
*  Uh, what is really interesting about her and this is something you'd
*  appreciate personally is when you read her essays, she'll have these weird
*  asides and it looked like she was talking about art and she'd be like, and
*  this is why the U S should be the only country with nuclear weapons.
*  And when you follow a brilliant mind making these seemingly disparate
*  connections, it's something I find to be just absolutely inspiring
*  and awesome and entertaining.
*  Um, I think there's lots of things about her that people like
*  Yaron would make uncomfortable.
*  Um, I, well, like she, they, so objectivism, like any other philosophy
*  has all these techniques to kind of hand wave away things you don't want to talk
*  about and like pretend that so they talk about things like having no metaphysical
*  significance, right?
*  So what that means is like, well, what about this?
*  Ah, I don't want to talk about it.
*  Like, it doesn't matter.
*  Like it literally means it fancy a philosophical terms doesn't matter.
*  Or they will say correctly that it's very twisted in our culture that when we have
*  heroes, we look for their flaws instead of looking for their virtues.
*  That's a hundred percent valid perspective.
*  However, if I'm sitting here telling you that I think this woman is a badass and
*  she's amazing and she should be studied, but there's also these idiosyncrasies.
*  They don't want to hear it because they, and I think it's very convenient for them
*  because there's a lot of things she did that were, here's an example.
*  Rand was very, very pro a happiness and poor pleasure.
*  She was very pro sex, which is kind of surprising looking at her and how she
*  talked and how strident she was as a result of this, she never got her cats
*  fixed to deny them the pleasure of orgasm.
*  So her male cats are spraying up her entire house.
*  Like that is, I mean, that's her putting her philosophy into practice, but it's
*  still gross.
*  So that's the kind of thing where I don't think he'd be.
*  Another thing is Rand had an art, an article on a woman president and she said a
*  woman should never be president.
*  Right.
*  Now when Rand says things that are too goofy for them, they say, Oh, that's not
*  objectivism.
*  That's her personal preference.
*  It's like she did not have these lines.
*  Objectivism was always defined as Ayn Rand's writings, plus the additional
*  essays in her books.
*  So if this was in part of those books, this counts as official objectivism, but
*  they pretend otherwise.
*  So that's another example.
*  Plus they, she was, and I bet you she was on the spectrum to some extent.
*  I'm not joking.
*  I'm not using that derisively.
*  She was of the belief and not inaccurately in it because that humor is used to
*  denigrate and humiliate.
*  And she was thinking about the Jon Stewart type before there was a Jon Stewart.
*  And a lot of times, like how I use mocking, but she was resentful correctly
*  that a lot of times people who are great and accomplished, little nobodies will
*  make a punchline just to bring them down and it's about her.
*  Here's an example I just thought of.
*  I remember in, I remember when it was, must have been the nineties, they had a
*  segment of MTV of all these musicians who were making their own perfumes.
*  Right.
*  And this girl grabbed Prince's perfume.
*  And before she even smelled it, she had the joke ready.
*  She just, oh, this smells almost as bad as his music lately.
*  It's like, first of all, I'm sure the perfume's fine.
*  And second of all, this is Prince.
*  He's one of the all time greats and you can't wait to denigrate him.
*  Like how, and part, I want to be like, how dare you?
*  Like as if, as if this perfume in any way, in any way, mitigates his amazing
*  accomplishments and achievements.
*  You horrible person.
*  But I do have some great Ayn Rand jokes and he would not be happy about them.
*  The perfume thing, the problem with is just not funny.
*  Not that, oh, he sucks.
*  Okay.
*  Great.
*  Not that they dared to try to be humorous.
*  Cause I don't know why you mentioned John's cause John's is pretty, can be funny.
*  Right.
*  But he taught a generation.
*  You still see this on Twitter where things have to be inherently sarcastic and snide.
*  But isn't that, I mean, aren't you practicing that?
*  No, I use irony, not sarcasm.
*  Here's an example.
*  When people, like you say something and someone replied to be like, um, last I
*  checked, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  And I'll say that I go, what do you think saying last I checked added to your point?
*  You're giving me valuable information and data, but you are trained to believe
*  that it has to be couched in this sneering.
*  It doesn't just give me the information.
*  This is useful information.
*  The that's, that's true.
*  It's a knee jerk, but see John Stewart did it masterfully.
*  Correct.
*  And they don't, and they don't, it's, it's like people who copy
*  comedies, certain comedians.
*  You try to copy them and use everything in the process of copying.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yep.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, but in terms of the, the philosophy of, you know, selfishness, this kind
*  of individual focused idea, and I imagine that connects with you.
*  Yes.
*  And I think it would connect with more people if they understood what she meant
*  by it, Nathaniel Brandon, who was her heir until she kind of broke with him.
*  And he was the code dedicatee of Atlas Shrugged said, no one will say
*  Ayn Rand's views with a straight face.
*  They won't say, I believe that my happiness matters and it's important
*  and it's worth fighting for, and that Ayn Rand says this and she's dangerous.
*  Now it's very easy to say this could have dangerous consequences if you're a
*  sociopath, but to put it in those terms, uh, I think is extremely healthy.
*  I think more people should want to be happy.
*  And I think a lot of us are raised to be apologetic, especially in this,
*  this cynical media culture that if you say, I want to be happy, I want to love
*  my life, that it's just like, okay, sweetheart.
*  And you, the eye rolling.
*  And I think that's so pernicious.
*  It's so horrifying.
*  And this is why I'm a Camus person because Camus thought the arch enemy
*  was cynicism and I could not agree more.
*  Like if you were the kind of person, if someone likes a band and you're like,
*  Oh, she liked them all, blah, blah, blah.
*  It's like, this gives them happiness.
*  Yeah.
*  Now there's certain exceptions, but it gives you happiness.
*  It's not for you.
*  That's cool.
*  Okay.
*  This is beautiful.
*  I, I so agree with you on the eye rolling, but you see the best of trolling
*  is not the eye roll.
*  Correct.
*  Of course not.
*  The best of trolling is taking down the eye rollers.
*  I'm going to have to think about that.
*  Okay.
*  Cause I kind of, yeah.
*  Uh, cause I put them all in the same bin.
*  Okay.
*  And they're not, they're not, they're not.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  Here's another example of trolling.
*  I was making jokes about Ron Paul.
*  He just had a stroke, right?
*  And someone came at me and they're like, Oh, blah, blah, blah.
*  You know, you're ugly.
*  I hope you have a stroke.
*  I hope you're in the hospital.
*  And I just go, I just did have a stroke on your mom's face.
*  So they came at me and now they got put in their place.
*  With a subpar.
*  Um, I mean, that wasn't clever.
*  You weren't, you weren't clever.
*  Not particularly.
*  No.
*  Well, one of your things you do, which is interesting.
*  I mean, I give you props in a sense is you're willing to go farther
*  than people expect you to.
*  Yes.
*  That's fun.
*  Yeah.
*  In fact, I'll probably edit out like half of this podcast because the, the thing
*  you did was she kept in, she'd mentioned Michaela Peterson as a podcast, which
*  is nice, I guess, was it on her podcast?
*  She was at mine.
*  She was on yours.
*  We did both, but this is when you're referring to when she was on mine.
*  Yeah.
*  She was on.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And you went right for the.
*  So I'll tell you what it was.
*  You don't have to paraphrase.
*  So I opened up, I say, you know, she's Jordan Peterson's dad and as many people
*  know, Jordan, sorry, he's her dad.
*  Yeah.
*  She's had a long issue with a substance addiction.
*  And I said to her, you're, you know, you're most famous for being, you know,
*  Jordan Peterson's daughter, you know, many people he's changed so many lives
*  around the world and he's been such an enormous influence to me personally that
*  I've started taking benzodiazepines recreationally and she's like, Oh my God,
*  Michael is so horrible.
*  Yeah.
*  You, cause you pulled me in with this cause you're talking, I mean, you know,
*  cause he's going through a rough time now she's going through just everything
*  was just, you pulled me in emotionally.
*  I was like, this is going to be the sweet Mike is going to be just this
*  wonderful and then just bam.
*  So that's, that's, that's, that was, uh, props to you on that.
*  It wasn't whatever that is.
*  That is an art form.
*  Uh, when done well, it can be taken too far.
*  My criticism is it that feels too good for some people.
*  What do you mean?
*  Uh, for, for too happy being a referent.
*  Cause to show that they don't care about anything.
*  That's another form of cynicism though.
*  Right.
*  So I, if you, cause you think it's possible to be a troll and still be the
*  live life to its highest ideal in the Camus sense.
*  I try.
*  That's kind of my ideal.
*  I believe it's not, it becomes a drug.
*  I feel like that takes you like, I think love ultimately is the way to experience
*  like every moment of every day.
*  You don't think that was an expression of, I honestly think we let's, let's,
*  let's split hairs here.
*  Cause I think this is, there's something of use here.
*  I do think that me, I'm me being able to make her laugh about this year of hell
*  she was in does create an element of love and connection between me and her.
*  Yeah.
*  But I know she would say that.
*  Yes.
*  It wasn't that it was what you said in combination with the sweetness
*  everywhere else, the kindness.
*  It's a very subtle thing, but like, it's like, uh, some of the deepest
*  connection we have with others is when we like mock them lovingly or correct.
*  But like there is stuff, there's kindness around that.
*  Sometimes not in words, but in like subtle things.
*  Cause it's, it's creates an air of familiarity, being familial.
*  Like we're through this together.
*  Like, yeah, yeah.
*  That's missing.
*  That's very difficult to do on the internet.
*  I agree with you.
*  I agree with you.
*  That's why I might like my general approach on the internet is to be, uh,
*  more like simple, less witty and more like dumbly loving.
*  But that's not your core competency being witty.
*  Me?
*  Yeah.
*  But I can be witty.
*  You can be, but I'm saying that's not your core company.
*  So I'm not saying you're bad at it, but I'm saying that's not where you go.
*  Like organically, especially with strangers.
*  I just feel like nobody's core competence on the internet is, uh, I guess
*  if you want to bring love to the world, nobody's core competence is given the
*  current platforms, nobody's core competence is wit.
*  It's very difficult to be witty on the internet without, while still
*  communicating kindness, like in the same way that you can in physical space.
*  I'll give you another example.
*  Someone, um, came at me and they were like, they gave me a donation.
*  People do this all the time and they go, oh, um, like I started reading
*  your books because of my wife and you know, now watch your shows together.
*  Uh, I keep up the good work and I go, what does her boyfriend think?
*  So that is an example of wit and love because that person feels seen.
*  I'm acknowledging them.
*  I'm also making a joke at their expense.
*  We know it's a joke.
*  So I think language is often used in non-literal ways to cue
*  emotional and connectivity.
*  It's difficult, but what you've done is, is difficult to accomplish, but you've
*  done it well.
*  I mean, you do, like you did, you do been doing these live streams, which are
*  nice that people give you a bunch of money and donations and stuff.
*  And then you, you'll often like make fun of certain aspects of their questions
*  and so on, but it's always, it's always.
*  That's not from love.
*  That is genuine annoyance because they asked me some really dumb questions.
*  They're still underlying.
*  It's not even like there's a kind person under that that's being communicated.
*  That's interesting, but I don't know if I get that from your Twitter.
*  I know I get that from the video.
*  Something about the face, something about like, yeah, of course it's much
*  harder, the more data, the more easy it is to convey emotion and subtlety.
*  Absolutely.
*  If you only have literally black and white letters, it's going to be, or
*  whatever, white and black, if you have night mode, it's going to be a very
*  different, it's much more limited information.
*  Yeah.
*  But this is the fundamental thing is like,
*  here's another example.
*  Like if they had access to my face, like a lot of times some people don't know
*  who I am and they come at me, call me a Nazi anti-Semite, right?
*  And I start talking about the Jews and just how terrible the Jews are.
*  Now all my audience knows I'm Jewish that I went to Yeshiva.
*  So they're sitting there laughing because this person is making ass to themselves.
*  That person has no idea.
*  But if there was video, then they would be like, okay, wait a minute.
*  Something's up.
*  Yeah.
*  Something's up.
*  I don't know.
*  I think it's entertaining.
*  I think it's fun, but I just, I don't think it's scalable.
*  And ultimately I'm trying to figure out this whole trolling thing because I
*  think it's really destructive.
*  I've been the outrage mob, the outrage mobs, the, just the, the dynamics of
*  Twitter has been really bothering me.
*  Okay.
*  And I've been trying to figure out if we can try to build an alternative to
*  Twitter perhaps, or try to encourage Twitter to be better, how to have nuanced,
*  healthy conversations.
*  Like the reason I talk about love isn't just for love's sake.
*  It's just a good base from which to have difficult conversations.
*  Like that's a good starting point.
*  Because if you start, like I would argue that the kind of conversation you have
*  on Twitter is fun, but it might not be a good starting point for difficult
*  nuanced conversation.
*  Well, I'm not interested in having those conversations with most people.
*  No, I know.
*  But so I agree with you.
*  I'm not, your point is valid.
*  Yes.
*  But like I'm saying, so if we were trying to have a difficult nuanced
*  conversation about say race in America or policing, is there racism?
*  And since you show racism of policing.
*  Okay.
*  There's a, the only conversations that have been nuanced about it that I've
*  heard is in the podcasting medium, which is the magic of podcasting, which is
*  great, but that that's the downside of podcasting is it's a very small number
*  of people, even if it's in the thousands, it's still small.
*  And then there's millions of people on social media and they're not having
*  nuanced conversation at all.
*  They're not capable of it.
*  That's the difference in your, that's I believe they are.
*  So that's no data that serves.
*  And then both of us aren't being not scientific.
*  You don't have data to support your world.
*  You either.
*  You're making the claim.
*  Well, you are too.
*  No, I'm not.
*  If I'm looking at an object, the pre the claim that has a mind.
*  Well, no, what you're, no, your, your claim is that people are fundamentally
*  stupid.
*  Are you a martial artist?
*  Yes.
*  How's it feel?
*  I just judo on you.
*  Yeah.
*  But you really don't think people are deep down like capable of being.
*  Intelligent.
*  No, not at all.
*  Not deep down that surface.
*  I'm not joking.
*  I'm not being tongue in cheek and not being cynical.
*  I do not at all, at all think they have this capacity.
*  I'm going to think, cause you're just being so clear about it.
*  You're not even, I'm going to think about that.
*  Why here's a, here's a, here's evidence for my position, not proof.
*  And this is of course, data that is of little use, but it's of interest.
*  A lot of times when you have an audience as big as mine and people come at you, not
*  only will people say the same thing, the same concept, they'll say the same concept
*  in the same way that is not a mind.
*  Yeah.
*  That surface evidence.
*  Um, you're saying this iceberg looks like this from the surface.
*  I'm saying there's an iceberg there that if challenged can, um, can rise to the
*  occasion of deep thinking and you're saying, Nope, Nope.
*  It's just frozen water.
*  Isn't that the Russian expression?
*  Ah, that's ice cream.
*  No, not my Roger.
*  No, I'm not Roger.
*  Doesn't it mean like, like, like no one's there.
*  Actually, I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  It means like, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like thought.
*  It means to Nick Wadoma.
*  Nick Wadoma.
*  Okay.
*  Well, uh, so you're challenging me to be a little bit more rigorous.
*  I think I'll try to challenge you anything.
*  I'm just saying, no, not challenging me, but like I'm challenging myself.
*  Okay.
*  So what you're saying, because I'd like to prove you wrong and find actual data
*  to show you're wrong and I think I can, but I would need to get that data.
*  That's funny.
*  You said, I think I can when they were working on my biography, Ego and
*  hubris, the title I had suggested was the little engine that could, but
*  shouldn't and I think that's a great title.
*  That's pretty good.
*  Yeah.
*  Speaking of biographies.
*  I mean, one, I read your book or listen to your book.
*  Listen to, there's an audio book for you, right?
*  Yeah, I did the audio.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You, you read it?
*  My golas.
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  So this was, this was, uh, I didn't do your own Brooks voice in the book.
*  I did all the different voices cause he has a lisp and I didn't want to sound
*  like I was making fun of him.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't remember you reading it, but it was, I was really enjoyed it.
*  No.
*  Okay.
*  It was good.
*  It was like a year, a year and a half ago.
*  This I can't prove.
*  Uh, well, let me at a high level, see if you can pull this off.
*  If I ask you, uh, what's the book you write about?
*  It's about, uh, a group of people who are united solely by their opposition
*  to progressivism who have little else in common, but who are all frequently
*  caricatured and dismissed, um, by the larger establishment media.
*  But you give this kind of story of how it came to be.
*  Sure.
*  And to me, like we're talking about trolls, but the internet side
*  of things is quite interesting.
*  So first of all, how does alt-right connect?
*  So the alt-right is the subset of the new right, which feels that race, not
*  racism is the most or one of the most important sociopolitical issues.
*  Are any of those folks like part of the mainstream or worth paying attention to?
*  Not under part of the mainstream, the alt-right.
*  Yeah.
*  By definition, they would be part of the mainstream.
*  They would not be part of them.
*  No, they would not.
*  I don't know that any of them, well, worth is not a position.
*  I'm not in a position to say worth.
*  I'm, I would say that it is of use to be familiar with their arguments
*  because to dismiss any school of thought, especially one that has
*  historically gained leverage, especially one that has historically
*  gained leverage in very dark ways, especially in America, in Europe
*  and other places, just to say, oh, they're racist.
*  I don't need to think about them.
*  It's, it's, it doesn't behoove you.
*  So what, uh, what lessons do we draw from the, the four chance side of things,
*  like the internet side of the movement?
*  Tits or get the fuck out.
*  Um, can you define every single word in this?
*  Tits are breasts or get the fuck out.
*  That's from 4chan.
*  Okay.
*  That's what, what's, uh, what's it mean?
*  Oh, sometimes like a woman will appear in 4chan and they'll just reply,
*  tits or get the fuck out.
*  I'm trying to understand what the, Oh, Oh, that's the way.
*  I just, um, very slow.
*  Very slow.
*  Uh, so that's okay.
*  So that's very disrespectful towards female members of the community.
*  I don't understand.
*  There's rules to this community and one of them is, uh, we're not very good
*  with women is that that's one of the principles.
*  It's a principle.
*  We're not going to ever get laid.
*  That's fundamental principle.
*  Is there, are you going to get pics?
*  Pics sometimes, sometimes on the
*  GTFO.
*  Okay.
*  So is there other actual principles of, so like it's, it's, uh, from my,
*  maybe naive perspective is they have like the darkest aspects of trolling,
*  which is like take nothing serious, make a game out of everything.
*  That's not 4chan per se.
*  One of the things that you will learn 4chan, which I think is very healthy,
*  is if you have an idiosyncratic or unique worldview or focus on an aspect of
*  history or culture, you'll be able to find like-minded people who you will
*  engage with you and discuss it without being preemptively dismissive.
*  That's an ideal that they, well, it's not ideal.
*  It's something that happens a lot.
*  Now 4chan is not really like Paul is their board with politics.
*  Um, but they will, you know, get into some like the people there are much
*  more erudite than you'd think.
*  So they do take my, my perception was they take nothing seriously.
*  So there's things that they take seriously, like discussing ideas.
*  I'll give you one example.
*  There was a video someone posted of a girl who put kittens in a bag and threw
*  it in a river and they found out where she was within a day and got her like
*  arrested.
*  So yeah, they do take some things very seriously.
*  Okay.
*  But that's like an extreme that, I mean, that's good.
*  First of all, that's heartwarming that they wouldn't somehow turn that into a
*  thing that's feels like more of a, what is it?
*  What's the other one?
*  8chan?
*  Well, 8chan is twice as good as 4chan.
*  Yeah.
*  That's their slogan.
*  But it feels like they're the kind of community that would take that kitten
*  situation and make a mockery.
*  Yeah, they're, they're a darker than 4chan.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't even, I'm not allowed to talk about 16chan.
*  I'm already overwhelmed clearly, uh, by 4chan lingo.
*  I have actually, I literally wrote down in my notes, um, like in doing research
*  for this conversation, I learned the word pleb and I wanted to ask you what this
*  pleb means.
*  You know what pleb means?
*  No.
*  I don't, what do you?
*  I saw, I mean, actually, no, I don't.
*  You know what a pleb is?
*  I just, I don't know what a pleb is.
*  Like a plebiscite or plebian.
*  Okay.
*  But it doesn't mean something more sophisticated.
*  Um, no, it's a very unsophisticated mechanism of being dismissive.
*  Of like the regular people.
*  Yeah.
*  Or someone who comes at me on Twitter.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  So back, back to the 4chan alt-right.
*  Wasn't the-
*  Those are very different concepts.
*  Don't, don't conflate them.
*  But which internet culture was the alt-right born out of?
*  Uh, well, alt-right was more born of blogs and people had different blogs
*  that were posting what they call like racial realism, scientific, which is
*  scientific racism, so-called.
*  Um, and you know, breaking down issues from a racialist perspective.
*  So that wasn't- 4chan is much more dynamic.
*  It's a message board.
*  It's very fluid.
*  Um, so it doesn't lend itself to these kinds of in-depth
*  analysis of ideas or history.
*  But it spreads them.
*  Like it-
*  It spreads them as memes.
*  Yeah.
*  And it, you know, but-
*  But it's not, it's not an essential mechanism of, uh, of the alt-right
*  historically?
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  So it was mostly about blogs.
*  Okay.
*  So what, uh, what do you make of the psychology of this kind of world view?
*  When you have- and this goes to your conspiracy theory subject earlier.
*  When you have a little bit of knowledge about something, that history that no
*  one's talking about, and there's only one group that is talking about it, and
*  they- and you have no alternative answers, you're going to be drawn to that group.
*  So because issues about race, antisemitism, homophobia are so taboo in our culture,
*  understandably, there's good reasons.
*  If you start putting things like, how old should you be to have sex with kids and
*  just have regular conversations, eventually some people are going to start taking
*  some positions you don't like.
*  So some things have to be sanctified to some extent.
*  They're the ones talking about it.
*  You're going to be drawn to that, uh, subculture.
*  And where does the alt-right stand now?
*  I mean, I hear that term used-
*  So the term has been weaponized by the corporate press for people that they
*  want to read out of society.
*  So it's used both on individual levels, like people like Gavin McGingis,
*  the Milo Yiannopoulos, some others.
*  I mean, I think they've referred to Trump as alt-right.
*  Um, and, and, you know, it's become a slur just like in cell or bot that has
*  become largely removed from its original meaning.
*  Do you have a sense that there's still a movement that's alt-right or like-
*  Yeah, they call themselves now-
*  Okay.
*  So there's something called the dissident right.
*  And they say, we're completely not like the alt-right because the alt-right's
*  A, B, and C, and we're B, C, D.
*  There's a huge overlap.
*  It's very much the same people.
*  Um-
*  Is there intellectuals that still represent some, some aspect of the movement?
*  I mean, sure-
*  Are you tracking this?
*  Not, not that much anymore.
*  Um, I think they've, they're, I don't find it particularly as, um, now that
*  the book's done, you know, my, I'm looking more into history from my next book.
*  Um, you mentioned communism.
*  I'm going to talk a lot about the cold war.
*  Um, so this kind of stuff has largely fallen away from my radar to some extent.
*  And they've also been the, the, it's been a very effective movement to get
*  them marginalized and silenced.
*  So they're not as, as deep as a concern in terms of concern or not.
*  Just their impact on society.
*  Yes, it's much lessened.
*  Yeah.
*  So as a troll on Twitter, in the best sense of the word, what do you make of cancel culture?
*  I think it's Maoism.
*  It's, I mean, the corporate America has done a far better job of implementing
*  Maoism than the Communist Party ever could.
*  You had this meeting not that long ago from, I think it was Northwestern
*  University Law School, where everyone on the call got up and said that they were racist.
*  I mean, this is something that legally you should be very averse to saying,
*  even if it were true.
*  Uh, and it's this kind of concept of getting up and confessing your sins
*  before the collective is something completely, uh,
*  Oh, they, sorry, they admitted this of themselves?
*  Yeah, they were like, because they're saying because they're white,
*  they're inherently racist.
*  So my name's John, I'm a racist.
*  My name's this, I'm a racist.
*  It was, it was, uh, you hear it and you're like, okay, this is looting tunes.
*  So you're saying that, wow, that's, that's so much, you took a step further.
*  So you're saying there's like a, a deep underlying force,
*  but in a sense cancel culture, it's not just some kind of mob.
*  It's not a mob at all.
*  It's a, it's a systemic organized movement, uh, being used for very
*  nefarious purposes and to dominate, you know, an entire nation.
*  How do we fight it?
*  Cause I sense it inside, you know, I used to defend academia, um, more because,
*  um, I still do to some extent it's a nuanced discussion because, you know,
*  like folks like Jordan Peterson and a lot of people that kind of attack
*  academia, they refer, they really are talking about gender studies
*  at certain departments and me from MIT.
*  You know, it's the university of science and engineering and the faculty there
*  really don't think about these issues or haven't traditionally thought about
*  it's beginning to even infiltrate there is the, you know, it's starting to
*  infiltrate engineering and sciences outside of biology.
*  Yeah.
*  Like let's put biology with the gender studies.
*  Like I'm talking about sciences that really don't have anything to do with
*  gender, uh, it's starting to infiltrate.
*  Um, and it worries me.
*  I don't know exactly why, like, I don't know exactly what the negative effect
*  there would be, except it feels like it's anti-intellectual.
*  Oh yes, of course.
*  And I'm not sure what to, uh, cause on the surface, it feels like a path
*  towards progress at first when you, when I'm like zoomed out, you know,
*  just like, like squinting my eyes, you know, not even in detail looking at
*  things, but when I actually joined the conversation to like, listen in the
*  conversation on quote unquote diversity, it quickly makes me realize that
*  there's no interest in, um, in making a better world.
*  No, no, it's about domination.
*  It's, it's about getting, yeah.
*  It's a way for, if you are a lowest status white person using
*  anti-racism is the only mechanism you will have to feel superior
*  to another human being.
*  So it's very useful for them.
*  Um, in terms of fighting it, uh, one of my suggestions has been to seize all
*  university endowments, which are the crystallization of privilege and
*  distribute that money as reparations.
*  So it'd be very effective by turning two populations against each other and
*  strongly diminishing the university's, uh, intellectual hegemony.
*  Uh, the universities are absolutely the real villains in the picture.
*  Thankfully, they're also the least prepared to be aggressed upon.
*  Uh, and after the government and the corporate press, they are the last
*  leg of the stool and they don't know what's coming and it's going to get
*  ugly and I cannot wait.
*  So this is where you and I disagree.
*  But one would, yeah, we disagree in a sense that you want to dismantle.
*  Broken institutions.
*  I don't think they're broken.
*  They're working like by design.
*  I think for over a hundred years, they have been talking about bringing the
*  next generation of American leaders, which is code for promulgating an
*  ideology based on egalitarian principles and world domination.
*  Let me try to express my lived experience.
*  Okay.
*  Sure.
*  Okay.
*  My experience at MIT is that there's a bunch of administrators that are the
*  bureaucracy that I can, I can say this is the nice thing about having a
*  pockets, I don't give a damn is they're pretty useless.
*  In fact, they get in the way, but there's faculty, there's professors
*  that are incredible.
*  They're incredible human beings that all they do all day, they're too busy, but
*  for the most part, what they do all day is just like continually pursue different
*  little trajectories of curiosities in the, in the various avenues of
*  science that they work on.
*  And as a side effect of that, they mentor a group of students, sometimes a large
*  group of students and also teach courses and they're constantly sharing
*  their passion with others.
*  And my experience is it's just a bunch of people who are curious about
*  engineering and math and science, chemistry, artificial intelligence,
*  computer science, what I'm most familiar with.
*  And there's never this feeling of MIT being broken somehow, like this kind of
*  feeling, like if I talk to you just now or like Eric Weinstein, there's a feeling
*  like stuff is on fire, right?
*  There's something deeply broken.
*  Uh, but when I'm in, in the system, uh, especially before the COVID, before this
*  kind of tension, everything was great.
*  There was no discussion of even diversity, all that kind of stuff.
*  The toxic stuff that we might be talking about right now, none of that was happening.
*  There's a bunch of people just in love with, uh, cool ideas, exploring ideas,
*  being curious and learning and all that kind of stuff.
*  So I don't, my, my sense of academia was this is the place where kids in their
*  twenties, thirties and forties can continue the playground of science and having fun.
*  It's if you destroy academia, if you destroy universities, like you're suggesting
*  kind of lessening their power, you take away the playground from these kids to, to, to play.
*  It's going to be hard for you to tell me that I'm anti-playground.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I guess I'm saying you're anti certain kinds of playgrounds, which is
*  yeah, the ones that have the broken glass on the floor.
*  Yeah.
*  I am against those kinds of playgrounds.
*  No, no, you're, you're, you're.
*  Yeah.
*  Nope.
*  See,
*  Yep.
*  Now you see, now you listen.
*  No, you wait.
*  Yeah.
*  I, I would say you're being the watchful mother who the one kid who hurt themselves
*  in the glass, one kid, it's an entire generation.
*  It's generation after generation.
*  I'm not a watchful mother.
*  I'm the guy with the flamethrower.
*  No, I, I, I understand that, but you're using the one kid who was always kind of
*  like weird, um, gender studies department, uh, that, that hurt themselves on the
*  glass as opposed to the people who are like, obviously having fun in the
*  playground and not, uh, playing by the glass, the broken glass.
*  And they're just, I mean, to me, some of the best innovations in science
*  happen in universities.
*  Okay.
*  You can't forget that universities don't have this liberal, like politics,
*  like literally in every conversation until this year, until this year, there's
*  something happening, but, uh, every conversation I've ever had had nothing
*  to do with politics would never Trump never came up, none of that ever come up.
*  Nothing like all this kind of idea that there's liberal all that, but that
*  that's in the humanities.
*  Yeah.
*  But do you think MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology might
*  be a little bit of an outlier?
*  Yeah, there's probably is.
*  Yeah.
*  But I, I don't, I honestly don't think when people criticize academia, they're
*  looking at, uh, they're in fact also picking the outliers, which is they're
*  picking some of the quote unquote strongest gender studies department.
*  This is nonsensical.
*  When I was at Bucknell, I was a college student.
*  We had to take, uh, you know, we had a bunch of electives and I want to take a
*  class on individual American individualism.
*  One of the texts of the five that we had to read was birth of a nation,
*  the movie about the clan.
*  So there's no department where these people are not thoroughgoing,
*  hardcore ideologues.
*  Uh, it's not a gender studies.
*  That's a humanity.
*  Fine.
*  All the humanities, not just gender studies.
*  Okay, fine.
*  I can give you.
*  History, English, yes, all of them, every university, as you know, has it
*  mandatory in the curriculum.
*  They have to take a bunch of these propaganda classes.
*  I look forward to YouTube comments because you're being more eloquent and
*  you're speaking to the thing that a lot of people agree with and I'm being my
*  usual slow self and people are going to say not very nice things about me.
*  Don't say anything that nice about Lex.
*  Okay.
*  Please let me try to just, just shoot up a school that would be preferable.
*  There he goes again.
*  Only the teachers the darkest possible place.
*  That's sunshine, baby schools.
*  That's where everyone goes to be happy playgrounds.
*  Okay.
*  There he goes.
*  Dark ear.
*  Dark ear just dives right in.
*  Like it just go dark and then just comes back off to the surface.
*  You're probably a figment of my imagination.
*  I'm not even having this podcast.
*  Well, after 18 Red Bulls, I'm surprised you could see anything.
*  This is like fight club.
*  Red Bull gives you delirium.
*  Yeah.
*  I got into it at Norton yesterday on the Twitter.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  Is the, uh, like the rest of the celebrities.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's like, oh, this is an existential threat to America.
*  Trump's a fascist.
*  He's delegitimizing the Oval Office.
*  I said, what an odd endorsement of Trump.
*  Well, you should have went through bat pit.
*  He might have a different opinion.
*  That's true.
*  Fight club reference.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, this conversation is over.
*  It's interesting.
*  I'd like to draw a line between science and engineering and science, not including
*  like the biological aspect, the parts of biology that touch and humanities and biology.
*  Like I feel because, uh, humanities, if you just look at the percentage of universities,
*  it's still a minority percentage.
*  And I would actually draw different.
*  I think they serve very different purposes.
*  Sure.
*  And that's actually a broken part about universities.
*  Well, like why, why is some of the best research in the world done at universities?
*  That doesn't like, there might be a different, like MIT.
*  It feels weird that a faculty.
*  Yeah.
*  These are conceptually different things.
*  Like we do research and we teach why this the same diagram feels weird, but that's
*  just, but, but I'm also, I'm coming to like the defense of the engineers that never
*  talk about, I'm not like, like my mind isn't, I'm not like deluded or something where
*  I'm not seeing the house on fire.
*  I'm just saying I am seeing the house because I also lived in Harvard square.
*  I'm seeing Harvard, but
*  and you see the tanks coming, they're coming.
*  Lex, it's going to be so beautiful.
*  I'm going to be like the American beauty, the plastic bag.
*  I just won't be able to stop crying because it'd be so beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  Thanks.
*  I could, I can already, I can already see it, but the, but the engineering
*  departments were like, I believe that the Elon Musk's of the world, that the, the,
*  like the innovation that will make a better world is happening.
*  And like, let's not burn that down because that has nothing to do with any, like
*  they're all like sitting quietly in while like, while the humanities are all these
*  kinds of diversity programs, they're, they're not having any of these discussions.
*  Listen, my Soviet brother, you both know, we both know that ice water runs in our
*  veins.
*  So if you're calling for mercy, that is not how I'm wired, but I'm not closing the
*  door.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm actually realizing now.
*  So for people listening to this, I'll probably pre pen this and saying that I'm
*  even slower than usual.
*  I didn't sleep last night, but I feel I'm actually realizing just how slow I am
*  and how much preparation I need to do.
*  And if I would like to defend aspects of academia, I better come prepared.
*  I don't think you need to defend them.
*  I think I'm granting you your premise freely.
*  No, you might be.
*  Okay.
*  I don't think the world is.
*  But actually you just defeat your own argument because you make, cause it is not
*  at all have to be the way that a phenomenal research institution like MIT,
*  which no one disputes has to also be an educational establishment.
*  These two things are not at all necessarily interconnected, but then you
*  have to offer a way to separate.
*  Correct.
*  But like, I'm not a big fan.
*  Everybody's different, but I'm not a fan of criticizing institutions without
*  offering a way to change.
*  And especially when I'm like, have ability to change, I'd like to, yeah,
*  I'd like to offer a path.
*  Like, what if they were in students, they were all meant to like, uh, like,
*  meant like, um, what's the opposite of a mentor?
*  Menti.
*  Protégé.
*  What's the term when you like, when you work at a place, like interns, not an
*  intern, it's not the one I'm thinking of, but anyway, like basically they're
*  working there instead of going to college there.
*  It's possible, but it's going against tradition.
*  And so you have to build new institutions and, uh, and then have these engineers
*  building new things.
*  That's crazy.
*  These research engineers, where they're going to be building things.
*  Well, one of the things, cause you're kind of, you know, apprentice.
*  That's the word I was looking at, which is ironic.
*  We're talking about Trump and we couldn't think of the word apprentice.
*  Yeah.
*  Well done.
*  We should both be fired.
*  There you go.
*  These Russian Jews so quick with their wit.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, but the, the, the thing is you're a fan of freedom.
*  I am.
*  And there's, there is, uh, intellectual freedom.
*  People, this is what I was trying to articulate.
*  I'm failing to articulate, but there truly is complete intellectual freedom
*  within universities on topics of science and engineering.
*  I believe you.
*  I agree with you.
*  I don't think it's going to take much persuasion, but I'll give you an example.
*  When that, I'm sure you know more details about this than I do.
*  When that, uh, scientists engineered that probe to land on that comet.
*  And the articles are written because this Hawaiian shirt he was wearing had like
*  pinup girls on it, which I think is female student sewed frame or something,
*  or his ex-girlfriend, and he had to apologize.
*  This is what Rand was talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  That the great accomplishments of men have to say, I'm sorry to the lowest,
*  most despicable, disgusting people.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  You know, let me bring this case up because I think about this.
*  Uh, this might not mean much to you, but it means a lot to a certain aspect of
*  the computer science community.
*  There's a guy named Richard Stallman.
*  Then a few, you know who that is?
*  No, he's the founder of the free software foundation.
*  He's like a big Linux.
*  He's one of the key people in the history of computer science.
*  The one of those open source people.
*  Right.
*  But he is like, I believe he's the one of the hardcore ones, which is like,
*  so all software should be free.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  It's very interesting personality, very key person in the new, just like
*  Linus Torvald key person.
*  So, but he also kind of speaks his mind and on a certain chain of conversations
*  at MIT that was leaked to the New York times, then was published, led him to be
*  fired or pushed out of MIT recently, maybe a year ago, and I always sat weird with me.
*  So what happened is there's a few undergraduate students that called
*  Marvin Minsky, not sure if you're familiar with who that is.
*  I've heard the name.
*  He's one of the seminal people in artificial intelligence.
*  They, they said that they called him a rapist because he met with Jeffrey Epstein
*  and Jeff free Epstein solicited to these are the best facts known to me that I'm
*  aware of that's what was stated on the chain.
*  Is he solicited a 17, but it might've been an 18 year old girl to come up to
*  Marvin Minsky and ask him if he wanted to have sex with her.
*  So Jeffrey Epstein told the girl, she came up to Marvin Minsky who was at that
*  time is I think seven years old and his wife was there too.
*  Marvin Minsky's wife.
*  And he said no, or like, you know, awkwardly saying, no, thanks.
*  And that was stated in the email thread as Marvin participating in sexual assault
*  and rape of this unwilling sexual assault.
*  And it was called rape of this person, right?
*  Of this woman that propositioned him.
*  And then Richard Stallman, who's he's kind of known for this.
*  He's very, he's, you make fun of me being a robot, but he's kind of like a debugger.
*  He's like, well, that sentence is not what you said is not correct.
*  So he like corrected the person, uh, basically made it seem like the, the use
*  of the word rape is not correct.
*  Cause that's not the definition of rape.
*  And then he was attacked for saying, Oh, now you're playing with definitions of
*  rape, rape is rape is the answer.
*  Right.
*  And then that was leaked in him defending.
*  So the way it was leaked, it was reported as him defending, um, rape.
*  That's the way it was reported.
*  And he was pushed out and he didn't really give a damn.
*  It's he doesn't seem to make a big deal out of it.
*  He just left.
*  He made an example of him.
*  They made an example and that, and that everyone was afraid to defend him.
*  So like there's a bunch of faculty, one dude, you're from the
*  Soviet union, doesn't this hit close to home for you?
*  I don't know what to think of it.
*  It hits close to home, but it was basically at least at MIT.
*  Now MIT is such a light place with this.
*  It's not common at MIT, but it was like 18, 19 year old kids,
*  undergraduate kids with this kind of fire in them.
*  There's just very few of them, but they're the ones that raise all this kind of fuss.
*  And the entirety of the administration, all the faculty are afraid to stand up to them.
*  It's so interesting to me.
*  Like, I don't know if I should be afraid of that.
*  You don't think you should be afraid that someone who's trying to be specific when it
*  comes to charges of violent assault is looking for that clarity, get their life.
*  Uh, other searches, let me give you more context.
*  There's a little bit more context to Richard Stallman, which is also a rapist.
*  No, no, but he's had a history through his life, uh, of, you know, every once in a
*  while wearing the Hawaiian shirt with, like he would make, he's a fat, uh, sorry,
*  but he's a fat unattractive.
*  He like what Trump referred to the, the, the, the guy in the basement.
*  That's Richard.
*  Okay.
*  I love, you know, he is what he is.
*  You know, people he like, he would eat his own, uh, he would pick skin from his feet
*  and lectures and just eat it.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Those videos him doing that.
*  I'm not joking.
*  He must really be behind the spectrum then.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  And, and, you know, uh, he, I think this, uh, and his office, he, uh, door, he wrote
*  something like, uh, uh, like hacker, uh, plus, plus lover of ladies or something like
*  that, like something kind of, yeah.
*  So professional, young professional and a little creepy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No, that's fair.
*  That is.
*  So he was also, so they're looking for an excuse to get rid of him.
*  It sounds like, uh, no, he was just, um, who's they, the administration.
*  Yeah, probably.
*  Probably a lot of times what people don't realize.
*  And this would be my defensive cancel culture.
*  A lot of times when someone gets fired over something like this, this isn't why
*  this is just giving them cover to get rid of them without getting a lawsuit.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's still.
*  So I think, I guess what I'm trying to communicate is he was a little weird and
*  creepy and he may not be the best for the community, but that's not necessarily
*  the message it's sent to the rest of the community.
*  The message is sent to the rest of the community that being clear about words
*  or the usage of the word rape is, uh, like you should call everything rape.
*  That's, that's, that's basically the message you sent.
*  Or you should call that.
*  We say rape, rape.
*  It's about submission.
*  I think I'm, you'd be very happy to know that there's a lot of people and she's
*  very crucified of this, like Betsy DeVos, the president of the department of
*  education, who are aware of this.
*  They are aware of this completely contradicts due process.
*  Uh, they're aware of how a rape accusation is something not to be taken seriously,
*  but because it's not to be taken seriously, it has to be also taken seriously.
*  The other context that, you know, once that word is around a male, this
*  can ruin his entire life.
*  Um, and that's, that's the sticky thing of the word.
*  Like I, like, I think about this a lot that, um, like how would I defend it?
*  If somebody like I've never, I can honestly say I've never done anything
*  close to creepy in my life, like, uh, with, like with women.
*  But you wouldn't know it if you had, right?
*  That's the thing.
*  A lot of these creepy guys don't think they're creepy.
*  They think they're being cute.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm just telling you even like, fine.
*  Let's say, right.
*  Let's say I'm not aware of it.
*  But the point that I am aware of is that somebody could just
*  completely make something up.
*  Correct.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  And like, what would I know?
*  He denied the charges.
*  There's an article around everything you did, supposedly.
*  And it goes, uh, Mr.
*  Friedman denied the charges.
*  Yeah.
*  But what creeps me out that happened.
*  Can I interrupt?
*  There's Zora Neale Hurston is one of my favorite writers.
*  She's from the Harlem Renaissance.
*  Um, she wrote their eyes are watching God a couple of other books.
*  She was just an amazing, amazing figure.
*  Her biography is called, um, wrapped in rainbows.
*  It's just a masterpiece.
*  I like, I think I read it one day.
*  Can't recommend her enough.
*  Fastening, fascinating woman during the thirties, I think it was her 1940.
*  She was out of the country.
*  She was accused of molesting a teenage boy.
*  She wasn't in America.
*  This could be proven.
*  So there was, it's absolutely false.
*  Not even a question.
*  She was indicted and she wanted to kill herself because she's like, people are
*  going to see these things and they're going to think maybe there's some truth to it.
*  Maybe it was voluntary, but they're just going to, and, and you could understand
*  why she'd be suicidal over this.
*  So yeah, this is, this is something that's been going on for a long time.
*  And in, in the fact that it's becoming, I do agree.
*  It's important.
*  I know a lot of women who have been sexually assaulted more than I am happy that I know.
*  And if I know that many, that means there's more.
*  So I don't, I think it's, it's a good idea that they feel seen, that they don't feel
*  wounded, they don't feel damaged, that they could talk to their friends.
*  And I'm like, man, this sucks.
*  It's happening to you.
*  And, and I don't think you're a slut.
*  I don't think you're asking for it.
*  I think you feel violated.
*  I think it's gross.
*  Talk to me.
*  Like I, I do think that that's important.
*  And I also think it's important though, like when things get kind of in a frenzy
*  that a lot of people are like, yeah, I also had something happen.
*  And very quickly, the line between he grabbed my boob and he violently raped me.
*  I don't think these two things are the same at all.
*  I think they're both sexual assault, but in terms of what someone can deal with the
*  next day, the next month, 10 years later, I don't think they're similar scenarios.
*  Yeah.
*  I had Juanita Broderick on my show and hearing her talk about, you know, her alleged
*  rape by Bill Clinton was very disturbing for me.
*  Very disturbing here because it was like half an hour.
*  So, you know, we think of these things and think, okay, hold it down, blah, blah,
*  and it's done half an hour when just even someone physically holding you down for
*  half an hour, like not even a sexual assault.
*  Like that's traumatic.
*  You think, am I going to, your brain's going to think, am I going to die?
*  When I zoom out, I think the, ultimately this is going to lead to a better world.
*  Like empowering women to speak to those kinds of experiences.
*  The benefit of it outweighs the...
*  The issue is whenever people are given a weapon, some are going to use it in
*  nefarious ways.
*  And that's the lesson of history.
*  Males, females, whites, blacks, children, adults, when people are given a
*  mechanism to execute power over others, some are going to use it.
*  Can I ask you for a therapy thing?
*  Sure.
*  Untrolling in a sense.
*  Uh, cause I mentioned somebody making up something about me.
*  I feel cause I wear my heart on my sleeve.
*  I'm not good with these attacks.
*  Like I've been attacked recently, just being called a fraud and all that kind of
*  stuff.
*  Just light stuff.
*  Like I haven't, you know, it was like, it hurt.
*  Okay.
*  Well let me help you.
*  Maybe it's cause I'm a New Yorker.
*  No, I'm serious.
*  Here's why.
*  In New York, a lot of times you'll be walking with your friend and a homeless
*  person will come up to you and start yelling things at you.
*  Your reaction isn't in those circumstances.
*  Let me hear this out.
*  Your reaction is physical safety and getting away.
*  Now it's not impossible that that homeless person is actually saying the truth.
*  This happened to my friend of mine.
*  She, this guy wasn't homeless.
*  Um, and he's walking down the street on Smith street and he's just talking out
*  loud and it goes, why they call them hipsters?
*  What are they hip to?
*  And she chuckles and it goes, what are you laughing at fatso?
*  You start something, I'll finish it.
*  And she, she just couldn't move.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like, is my weight a problem?
*  Cause that's the first thing he went to.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's, I don't know that I have any advice, but when you hear something like
*  this, this is, I think you need to be better in terms of boundaries.
*  I think you should not perceive this as a fellow human, but as a crazy homeless
*  person, because if this fellow human, if I thought that you were a fraud in some
*  context, that's a very weird word to use.
*  Cause fraudulent podcaster, these are real mics.
*  But if I was a scientist or human.
*  Sure.
*  But I would ask myself, is this person in a position to make this judgment
*  or are they backing it up?
*  Are they saying here, your conclusions were wrong.
*  Here's some mistakes in your data and you can engage with them in ideas.
*  But whenever someone uses a word to entirely dismiss your life without having
*  the knowledge of your life, you do not have to take that seriously.
*  I appreciate that kind of idea, but some things aren't about data.
*  Like, you know, I, I see myself as a fraud often and it's, it's more psychology of it.
*  Um, if I can reduce something to reason, I can probably be fine.
*  My worry is the same as the worry of, uh, like teenage girls that get bullied online.
*  It's like when I'm being open and fragile on the internet, it affects me in a way
*  where I can't, the reason doesn't help.
*  So it helps me, but I'm very heavy with the blocking.
*  No, I, so yeah, I, I, I block, I block.
*  I, it's helped a lot.
*  Aggressive banality.
*  I block immediately.
*  I also think time is going to help.
*  I don't think you're like, you didn't grow up wanting to be a podcaster, right?
*  That wasn't your aspiration.
*  So in some sense, you are going to feel like a fraud because you're like, what,
*  I don't have any training for this.
*  I have a training for a scientist.
*  I can talk to you about artificial intelligence for literally hours, but in
*  terms of this, like, what am I doing?
*  I'm kind of, so when they call you a fake, it's like, yeah, you're kind of right.
*  Cause like, I, I did kind of stumble into this and this is not my pedigree.
*  So I think that kind of probably speaks to you on some level.
*  Well, but they're, they're attacking not the podcast thing, but more like the
*  same people call Elon Musk of fraud too, which that, that's the way.
*  I rationalize it like, well, if they're calling him a fraud and they're calling
*  me a fraud, like even if you have rockets, they go into, like if you successfully
*  have rockets, landing back on earth, reusable rockets, you're still being
*  called a fraud, then it's okay.
*  Not necessarily.
*  It could be that he's not a fraud.
*  You really are.
*  That's, but I, it's not resonating with you because your brain knows the
*  logic, so you can trick yourself.
*  But, uh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But I don't know this whole trolling thing.
*  You seem to be much better at seeing it as a game.
*  You know why?
*  Cause you are under the delusion that every human being is capable of
*  intelligent reason decision.
*  I still think I'm right.
*  And I perceive them as literally animals.
*  So when a dog starts barking, all it's saying is that the dog is agitated and
*  this is not going to change my life.
*  One I order other than crossing the street, perhaps.
*  I'm going to prove you wrong one day.
*  If you're going to kill yourself, first shoot up a school.
*  But if I don't, I'll prove you wrong.
*  I'll bring the data and they'd be like, you're right.
*  Like, I have the receipts.
*  Okay.
*  So we mentioned Camus.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I love him.
*  Is there, um, this is, this is, this is a question that people like love.
*  When I ask how really smart people know, uh, what, uh, what books, let's say
*  three books, if you can think of them, technical fiction, philosophical, would
*  you, uh, had a big impact on you or would you recommend to others?
*  Sure.
*  Uh, the Machiavellians by James Burnham.
*  Uh, this is a book about how politics works in reality as opposed to how
*  people imagine it working.
*  Um, Menchus Moldbug, who's a figure in these circles, who's respected by a lot
*  of people, I was giving a talk and there was a bunch of panelists and we were
*  asked, what book would you recommend?
*  I said the Machiavellians independently of me.
*  That was the book he had recommended.
*  It's out of print.
*  It's hard to find, but that would be one.
*  Is that his book or no?
*  James Burnham.
*  It came out in 1941, I think.
*  So, uh, can you pause on the Moultch's?
*  What's his?
*  Menchus Moldbug.
*  That's a code name, right?
*  I, that guy, that guy's the pen name.
*  Curtis Yarvin.
*  It's his real name.
*  He's in, he swims in your circles.
*  Which circles?
*  He does some kind of programming.
*  Oh, he's originally programmed.
*  Yeah.
*  There's, he comes up as a person that I should talk with or I should know about.
*  But then I read a few of his things and they seem quite dangerous.
*  They're very long and verbose, but I think he's an amazing thinker.
*  Yeah, but he's the one who had the idea of sending the tanks to Harvard yard.
*  But doesn't he have like, uh, he has some radical view.
*  I forget what they are.
*  Very radical views.
*  Yeah.
*  He wants the military to coup.
*  But you're saying he's a serious thinker that is worthy of, not worthy.
*  I don't know that you would enjoy having a conversation with him.
*  I think a lot of people enjoy seeing it happen, but I think it'd be a
*  lot of talking past each other and it would be interesting.
*  What do you agree?
*  I did agree with him.
*  What do you disagree?
*  Okay.
*  Um, what do you agree?
*  What do you disagree?
*  I agree with him that politics has to be looked at objectively and without
*  kind of an emotional, um, connection to different schools.
*  I talk about him a lot in my book on the new right.
*  Um, disagree.
*  I don't think a military coup is a good idea.
*  Uh, he's, he doesn't think anarchism is stable.
*  I disagree.
*  Um, I mean, I mean him, I did a live stream with him, which is dorked out a
*  lot about history and like, you know, people who've fallen in the memory hole.
*  So I mean, he's got a lot of writing.
*  So,
*  so, uh, you know, the sense I got from him was that if I talk with him, a lot
*  of people would be upset with me for giving him a platform.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he's on that edge where they want to read him out of what
*  is acceptable discourse.
*  What's his most controversial?
*  I mean, you keep mentioning the tanks.
*  Is that the most controversial viewpoint?
*  Does he have a race thing?
*  No, he's the, the, the alt-right doesn't particularly like him in many ways
*  because he's not a big, uh, the race thing.
*  I don't know what would be his most controversial view, uh, to be honest.
*  I think because he is radical in terms of his analysis of culture, anytime
*  someone's a radical, that is dangerous.
*  Okay.
*  Book, uh, so that's one.
*  The fountainhead, which is, um, I would say no.
*  If, and if you read Atlas Shrugged before reading the fountainhead, you're
*  doing yourself an enormous disservice.
*  Don't you dare do it on the philosophical because every level, every, every level
*  fountainhead's a better novel.
*  Fountainhead superfluous.
*  If you read Atlas Shrugged first, fountainheads about psychology and ethics.
*  Uh, it does not have to do with her politics other than its implications.
*  So it's by far the superior book.
*  Um, the third one.
*  Ooh, this is a good one.
*  Question.
*  Let me see what I, there's so many good books out there that I love.
*  I I'm going to, this is not really my third choice, but I'll throw it out there
*  because I, um, this is such an important worldview, especially for people on the
*  right.
*  Are you virtue signaling?
*  No, this is counter signaling.
*  Um, Thaddeus Russell's book, A Renegade History of the United States.
*  His thesis is that it's the degenerates that give us all freedom.
*  Um, and things like prostitutes, things like madams, things like slaves, things
*  like immigrants, because they were so low status, they could get away with things
*  that then people who are higher status demanded and so on and so forth.
*  So I think that thesis and it really has extreme, um, consequences in, uh, thinking.
*  And no, on Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind, that's those are the four.
*  Is that his best?
*  I haven't read any of his stuff.
*  The Righteous Mind is the only one you want.
*  Okay.
*  That was four, but of course.
*  Forget that, we'll put Haidt in there.
*  Of course you would.
*  Uh.
*  No, forget Thaddeus.
*  So those are the three.
*  So we talked about love.
*  Let me ask you the other question I'm obsessed with.
*  Are you, uh, do you ponder your own mortality?
*  I do a lot, especially now that I'm an uncle, especially now that I have like
*  these younger people that I mentor.
*  Um, I was just yesterday, uh, my friend, John Gerges, who did my theme song for
*  my podcast, who did the book cover for, um, Dear Reader, who's like the most
*  talented person I know, his song came on the iPod at the gym and I thought,
*  um, I'm going to go to him and I almost messaged him.
*  I go, you know, one day one of us is going to bury the other and it's
*  going to be really sad.
*  And I thought about that and it was kind of like, oh man, that's really going to
*  suck.
*  Um, and you know, I don't know which scenario would be better.
*  Like I don't, I will be very sad if he's gone.
*  I'm sure he'd be very sad if I'm gone.
*  Um, I mean, what do you, are you afraid of it?
*  No.
*  Uh, you know, uh, um, Rand had this quote about how, uh, I won't die.
*  The world will end.
*  I've had enough experiences that I am, I really, at this point and everything's
*  icing on the cake.
*  So if you, if I were to kill you at the end of this podcast, it feels painless.
*  That would be okay.
*  Yeah.
*  You know why?
*  Does anyone know you're here?
*  You know why?
*  I'm asking for a friend.
*  Here's why.
*  There's that wit.
*  Save that for Twitter, Lex.
*  Do they call you Sasha?
*  No, I'm, uh, Lyosha.
*  Oh, that's my sister's husband.
*  Okay.
*  So here's why.
*  I strongly believe, and this is a very kind of Jewish perspective, that you just
*  have to world, leave the world a little bit better than you found it.
*  That all you could do is move the needle a little.
*  And one of the things I set out to do with Dear Read, or my book on North Korea,
*  I said, I was at a point in my career where I could do something to make a
*  difference instead of just writing like co-authoring books for celebrities, which
*  I'm very proud of, but you know, are neither here nor there.
*  And I thought, all right, I know how to tell stories.
*  I know how to inform people.
*  I know how to entertain people.
*  If I move the needle in America, who cares?
*  We got it really good here.
*  If I move the needle in North Korea a little bit, the cost
*  benefits through the roof.
*  I never thought of that.
*  Actually, I never thought of Dear Read from that perspective.
*  So when I set out to write it, I'm like, okay, what can I do?
*  I'm not going to be able to liberate the North Korean regime.
*  What I can do is the camera right now is focused on at the time Kim Jong-il,
*  now Kim Jong-un, and I can do just this, just this a little bit.
*  And I go behind that guy who you think is funny clown, there's millions of dead
*  people, there's children being starved, there's people who are performing because
*  they have a gun to their kid's head.
*  And if someone put a gun to your kid's head, you'd put on those dancing shoes
*  real quick and I and others have managed to change the conversation about North
*  Korea in terms of look at those silly buffoons to those poor people.
*  So the fact that that little thing I can say with a straight face, I did, doesn't
*  make me a great person, but it does make me someone who, if I have to go tomorrow,
*  I can say I did a little bit to make the world a better place.
*  What do you think is the meaning of life?
*  I think the meaning of life is.
*  Why are we here?
*  Oh, well that I'm a Camus person, so I'll give the Camus answer.
*  So there's two types of people.
*  Those who know how to use binary.
*  No.
*  Thanks.
*  Thanks for relating to the audience.
*  One, one, zero, zero, one, two.
*  Two?
*  Down vote.
*  What kind of radical freak is this Lex?
*  So, and I use this example of my forthcoming book.
*  You go into a countryside, a mountainside, and you see a blank canvas on an easel.
*  And one kind of mentality goes, this is just a blank canvas.
*  This is stupid.
*  This is what am I looking at?
*  And the other type goes, what a great opportunity.
*  I'm in this beautiful space.
*  I have this entire canvas to paint.
*  I could do anything I want with it.
*  So I am very much of that type two person.
*  And I hope others start to think of life in that way.
*  You and I have both been more successful than we expected to, especially growing up.
*  And in ways we did not expect.
*  And when you're young, you are so intent on driving the car.
*  And after a certain point, you realize it's not about driving the car.
*  You're being a surfer that you can only control this little board and you have no
*  idea where the waves will take you.
*  And sometimes you're going to fall down and someone's gonna really going to suck
*  it.
*  You're going to swallow some salt water.
*  But at a certain point, you stop trying to drive and you're like, this is freaking
*  awesome.
*  And I have no idea where it's going to go.
*  Beautifully put, I know I speak for a lot of people.
*  First of all, everyone loves the game you play on the Internet.
*  It's fun.
*  Not everyone.
*  You make the world, not everyone.
*  Today, they came for me hard.
*  But it makes the world seem fun.
*  And especially in this dark time, it's it's much appreciated.
*  And we can't wait till the next book and the many to come and to hopefully many
