# Steven Pinker: AI in the Age of Reason | Lex Fridman Podcast #3
**Lex Fridman:** [October 17, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epQxfSp-rdU)
*  You study the human mind cognition language vision evolution psychology from childhood adult.
*  From the level of individual to the level of our entire civilization so i feel like i can start with a simple multiple choice question.
*  What is the meaning of life is it a to attain knowledge is play to said be to attain power is nisha said.
*  C to escape death as earnest becker said D to propagate our genes as.
*  Darwin and others have said E there is no meaning as the nihilist have said.
*  F knowing the meaning of life is beyond our cognitive capabilities as Stephen Pinker said based on my interpretation 20 years ago and G none of the above.
*  I'd say he comes closest but I would amend that to attaining not only knowledge but fulfillment more generally that is life health stimulation.
*  Access to the.
*  Living cultural and social world now this is our meaning of life it's not the meaning of life if you were to ask our genes.
*  Their meaning is to propagate copies of themselves but that is distinct from the meaning that the brain that they lead to sets for itself.
*  So to you knowledge is a small subset or a large subset.
*  It's a large subset but it's not the entirety of human striving because we also want to.
*  Interact with people we want to experience beauty we want to experience the richness of the natural world.
*  But understanding the what makes the universe tick is is way up there for some of us more than others certainly for me that's.
*  That's one of the top five so is that a fundamental aspect are you just describing your own preference or is this a fundamental aspect of human nature is to seek knowledge just to.
*  In your latest book you talk about the the the power the usefulness of rationality and reason and so on is that a fundamental nature of human beings or is it something we should just strive for.
*  It's both it is we're we're capable of striving for it because it is one of the things that make us what we are homo sapiens wise men.
*  We are unusual among animals in the degree to which we acquire knowledge and use it to survive we we make tools we strike agreements.
*  I have my language we extract poisons we predict the behavior of animals we try to get at the workings of plants and when i say we i don't just mean we in the modern west.
*  But we as a species everywhere which is how we've managed to occupy every niche on the planet how we've managed to drive other animals to to extinction and the refinement of reason.
*  In pursuit of human well being of health happiness social richness cultural richness is our our main challenge in the present that is.
*  Using our intellect using our knowledge to figure out how the world works how we work in order to make discoveries and strike agreements that make us all better off in the long run.
*  Right and you do that almost undeniably and in a data driven way in your recent book but i'd like to focus on the artificial intelligence aspect of things.
*  And not just artificial intelligence but natural intelligence too so 20 years ago in the book you've written on how the mind works you conjecture again my right to interpret things.
*  You can you can correct me if i'm wrong but you conjecture that human thought in the brain may be a result of a network a massive network of highly interconnected neurons so from this.
*  Interconnectivity emerges thought compared to artificial neural networks we should we use for machine learning today is there something fundamentally more complex mysterious even magical about the biological neural networks versus the ones.
*  We've been starting to use over the past 60 years and become to success in the past 10.
*  There is something a little bit mysterious about the human neural networks which is that each one of us who is a neural network knows that we ourselves are conscious.
*  Conscious not in the sense of registering our surroundings or even registering our internal state but in having subjective first person present tense experience that is when I see red it's not just different from green.
*  But it just there's there's a redness to it that I feel whether an artificial system would experience that or not I don't know and I don't think I can know that's why it's mysterious we had a perfectly lifelike robot that was behaviorally indistinguishable.
*  From a human would we attribute consciousness to it or or ought we to attribute consciousness to it and that's something that it's very hard to know but putting that aside put inside that that largely philosophical question.
*  The question is is there some difference between the human neural network and the ones that we were building in artificial intelligence will mean that we're on the current trajectory not going to reach the point where we've got a lifelike robot indistinguishable from a human because the way they're neural so called neural networks are organized are different from the way ours are organized.
*  I think there's overlap but I think there are some some big differences that their current neural networks current so called deep learning systems are in reality not all that deep that is they are very good at extracting high order statistical regularities but most of the systems don't have a semantic level a level of actual understanding of who did what to whom why where how things work what causes what else.
*  Do you think that kind of thing can emerge as it does so artificial neural networks are much smaller the number of connections and so on than the current human biological networks but do you think.
*  Sort of go to go to consciousness or to go to this high level semantic reasoning about things do you think that can emerge with just a larger network with a more richly weirdly interconnected network.
*  Separated in consciousness because consciousness is even a matter of complexity really weird one.
*  Yeah you're gonna have you could you could sensibly ask the question of whether shrimp are conscious for example they're not terribly complex but maybe they feel pain so let's let's just put that one that part of it aside but.
*  I think sheer size of a neural network is not enough to give it structure and knowledge but if it's suitably engineered then then then why not that is we're neural networks.
*  Natural selection did a kind of equivalent of engineering of our brains so I don't think there's anything mysterious in the sense that no.
*  No system made out of silicon could ever do what a human brain can do I think it's possible in principle whether it'll ever happen depends not only on how clever we are in engineering the systems but whether even we even want to whether that's even a sensible goal that is you ask the question is there any.
*  Locomotion system that is as as good as a human well we kind of want to do better than a human ultimately in terms of legged locomotion.
*  There's no reason that humans should be our benchmark there there tools that might be better in some ways it may just be not as.
*  Maybe that we can't duplicate a natural system because at some point it's so much cheaper to use a natural system that we're not going to invest more brain power and resources so for example we don't really have a.
*  Subject exact substitute for wood still build houses out of wood we still build furniture out of wood we like the look we like the feel it's would have certain properties that synthetics don't.
*  There's something that there's any magical or mysterious about wood it's just that the extra stress steps of duplicating everything about wood is something we just haven't bothered because we have would like why say cotton I mean I'm wearing cotton clothing now feels much better than polyester.
*  It's not that cotton has something magic in it and it's not that if there was that we couldn't ever synthesize something exactly like cotton but at some point it's just it's just not worth it we've got cotton and likewise in the case of human intelligence.
*  The goal of making an artificial system that is exactly like the human brain is a goal that we probably known as going to pursue to the bitter end I suspect because.
*  If you want tools that do things better than humans you're not going to care whether it does something like humans so for example diagnosing cancer or predicting the weather why set humans as your benchmark.
*  But in in general I suspect you also believe that even if the human should not be a benchmark and we don't want to imitate humans in their system there's a lot to be learned about how to create an artificial intelligence system by studying the human.
*  Yeah I think that's right in the same way that to build flying machines we want to understand the laws of aerodynamics and including birds but not mimic the birds right but the same laws.
*  You have a view on AI artificial intelligence and safety that from my perspective is refreshingly rational or perhaps more importantly has elements of positivity to it which I think can be inspiring and empowering as opposed to paralyzing.
*  For many people including AI researchers the eventual existential threat of AI is obvious not only possible but obvious and for many others including AI researchers the threat is not obvious.
*  So Elon Musk is famously in the highly concerned about AI camp saying things like AI is far more dangerous than nuclear weapons and that AI will likely destroy human civilization.
*  So in February you said that if Elon was really serious about AI the threat of AI he would stop building self driving cars that he's doing very successfully as part of Tesla.
*  Then he said wow if even Pinker doesn't understand the difference between narrow AI like a car and general AI.
*  When the latter literally has a million times more compute power and open ended utility function humanity is in deep trouble.
*  So first what did you mean by the statement about Elon Musk should stop building self driving cars if he's deeply concerned.
*  Not the last time that Elon Musk has fired off an intemperate tweet.
*  Well we live in a world where Twitter has power.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah I think the the there are two kinds of existential threat that have been discussed in connection with artificial intelligence and I think that they're both incoherent.
*  One of them is a vague fear of AI takeover that it just as we subjugated animals and less technologically advanced peoples.
*  So if we build something that's more advanced than us it will inevitably turn us into pets or slaves or or domesticated animal equivalents.
*  I think this confuses intelligence with a will to power that it so happens that in the intelligence system we are most familiar with namely homo sapiens.
*  We are products of natural selection which is a competitive process and so bundled together with our problem solving capacity are a number of nasty traits like dominance and.
*  Exploitation and maximization of power and glory and resources and influence.
*  There's no reason to think that sheer problem solving capability will set that as one of its goals its goals will be whatever we set its goals as.
*  And as long as someone isn't building a megalomaniacal artificial intelligence and there's no reason to think that it would naturally evolve in that direction.
*  Now you might say well what if we gave it the goal of maximizing its own power source.
*  That's a pretty stupid goal to give a an autonomous system.
*  You don't give it that goal.
*  I mean that's just self evidently idiotic.
*  So if you look at the history of the world there's been a lot of opportunities where engineers could instill in a system destructive power and they choose not to because that's the natural process of engineering.
*  Well except for weapons and if you're building a weapon its goal is to destroy people and so I think there are good reasons to not not build certain kinds of weapons I think building nuclear weapons was a massive mistake.
*  But probably do you think.
*  So maybe pause on that because that is one of the serious threats.
*  Do you think that it was a mistake in a sense that it should have been stopped early on or do you think it's just an unfortunate event of invention that this was invented.
*  Well I think it's possible to stop I guess is the question.
*  It's hard to rewind the clock because of course it was invented in the context of World War Two and the fear that the Nazis might develop one first.
*  Then once it was initiated for that reason it was it was hard to turn off especially since winning the war against the Japanese and the Nazis was such an overwhelming goal of every responsible person that they were just nothing that people wouldn't have done then to ensure victory.
*  It's quite possible if World War Two hadn't happened that nuclear weapons wouldn't have been invented.
*  We can't know but I don't think it was by any means a necessity any more than some of the other weapon systems that were envisioned but never implemented like planes that would disperse poison gas over cities like crop dusters or systems to try to create earthquakes and tsunamis in enemy countries to weaponize the weather weaponized solar flares all kinds of crazy schemes that that we thought the better of.
*  I think analogies between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence are fundamentally misguided because the whole point of nuclear weapons is to destroy things.
*  The point of artificial intelligence is not to destroy things.
*  So the analogy is misleading.
*  So there's two artificial intelligence you mentioned the first one I guess was the highly intelligent or power hungry.
*  Yeah it's just that we design ourselves where we give it the goals goals are external to the means to attain the goals.
*  If we don't design an artificial intelligence system to maximize dominance then it won't maximize dominance.
*  It's just that we're so familiar with homo sapiens where these two traits come bundled together particularly in men that we are apt to confuse high intelligence with a will to power.
*  But that's just an error.
*  The other fear is that will be collateral damage that will give artificial intelligence a goal like make paper clips and it will pursue that goal so brilliantly that before we can stop it it turns us into paper clips.
*  I will give it the goal of curing cancer and it will turn us into guinea pigs for lethal experiments or give it the goal of world peace and its conception of world peace is no people therefore no fighting and so it will kill us all.
*  I think these are utterly fanciful in fact I think they're actually self defeating.
*  They first of all assume that we're going to be so brilliant that we can design an artificial intelligence that can cure cancer but so stupid that we don't specify what we mean by curing cancer in enough detail that it won't kill us in the process.
*  And it assumes that the system will be so smart that it can cure cancer but so idiotic that it doesn't can't figure out that what we mean by curing cancer is not killing everyone.
*  So I think that the the collateral damage scenario the value alignment problem is is also based on a misconception.
*  So one of the challenges of course we don't know how to build either system currently or are we even close to knowing of course those things can change overnight but at this time theorizing about is very challenging.
*  In either direction so that that's probably at the core of the problem is without that ability to reason about the real engineering things here at hand is your imagination runs away with things exactly but let me sort of ask what.
*  Do you think was the motivation the thought process of Elon Musk I build autonomous vehicles I study autonomous vehicles I study Tesla autopilot I think it is one of the greatest currently application large scale application of artificial intelligence in the world.
*  It has a potentially a very positive impact on society so how does a person who is creating this very good quote unquote narrow AI system also seem to be so concerned about this other general AI what do you think is the motivation there what do you think is the thing.
*  Well you probably have to ask him but there and he is notoriously flamboyant impulsive to the as we have just seen to the detriment of his own goals of the health of the company.
*  So I don't know what's going on on his mind you probably have to ask him but I don't think the and I don't think the distinction between special purpose AI and so called general AI is relevant that in the same way that special purpose AI is not going to do anything conceivable in order to attain a goal all engineering systems have to.
*  Are designed to trade off across multiple goals when we build cars in the first place we didn't forget to install breaks in because the goal of a car is to go fast it occurred to people yes you want to go fast but not always so you build in breaks to likewise if a car is going to be.
*  Autonomous that doesn't and program it to take the shortest route to the airport it's not going to take the diagonal and mow down people and trees and fences because that's the shortest route that's not what we mean by the shortest route when we program it and that's just what.
*  And and intelligent system is by definition it takes into account multiple constraints the same is true in fact even more true of so called general intelligence that is if it's genuinely intelligent it's not going to pursue some goal single mindedly omitting every other.
*  Consideration and collateral effect that's not artificial and general intelligence that's that's artificial stupidity.
*  I agree with you by the way on the promise of autonomous vehicles for improving human welfare I think it's spectacular and I'm surprised at how little press coverage notes that in the United States alone something like forty thousand people die every year on the highways.
*  Fastly more than are killed by terrorists and we spend we spent a trillion dollars on a war to combat deaths by terrorism but half a dozen a year.
*  I was every year and year out forty thousand people are massacred on the highways which could be brought down to very close to zero.
*  So I'm I'm I'm with you on the humanitarian benefit.
*  Let me just mention that it's as a person who's building these cars it is a little bit offensive to me to say that engineers would be clueless enough not to engineer safety into systems.
*  I often stay up at night thinking about those forty thousand people that are dying and everything I tried to engineer is to save those people's lives so every new invention that I'm super excited about every new.
*  And in all the deep learning literature and CVPR conferences and nips everything I'm super excited about is all grounded in making it safe and help people.
*  So I just don't see how that trajectory can all of a sudden slip into a situation where intelligence will be highly negative.
*  You and I you and I certainly agree on that and I think that's only the beginning of the potential humanitarian benefits of artificial intelligence.
*  There's been enormous attention to what are we going to do with the people whose jobs are made obsolete by artificial intelligence.
*  But very little attention given to the fact that the jobs are going to be made obsolete are horrible jobs.
*  The fact that people aren't going to be picking crops and making beds and driving trucks and mining coal.
*  These are soul deadening jobs and we have a whole literature sympathizing with the people stuck in these menial mind deadening dangerous jobs.
*  If we can eliminate them this is a fantastic boon to humanity.
*  Now granted we solve one problem and there's another one namely how do we get these people a decent income.
*  But if we're smart enough to invent machines that can make beds and put away dishes and handle hospital patients.
*  I think we're smart enough to figure out how to redistribute income to proportion some of the vast economic savings to the human beings who will no longer be needed to make beds.
*  OK Sam Harris says that it's obvious that eventually AI will be an existential risk.
*  He's one of the people who says it's obvious.
*  We don't know when the claim goes but eventually it's obvious and because we don't know when we should worry about it now.
*  It's a very interesting argument in my eyes.
*  So how do you how do we think about time scale.
*  How do we think about existential threats when we don't really we know so little about the threat.
*  Unlike nuclear weapons perhaps about this particular threat that it could happen tomorrow.
*  Right.
*  So but very likely won't.
*  Yeah.
*  They're likely to be 100 years away.
*  So how do do we ignore it.
*  Do how do we talk about it.
*  Do we worry about it.
*  How do we think about those.
*  What is it.
*  A threat that we can imagine.
*  It's within the limits of our imagination but not within our limits of understanding to sufficient to accurately predict it.
*  But what is what is the it that we're sorry.
*  A.I. A.I. being the existential threat.
*  A.I.
*  How like enslaving us or turning us into paper clips.
*  I think the most compelling from the Sam Harris perspective would be the paper clip situation.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean I just think it's totally fanciful.
*  I mean it is.
*  Don't build a system.
*  Don't give it.
*  Don't.
*  First of all the code of engineering is you don't implement a system with massive control before testing it.
*  Now perhaps the culture of engineering will radically change.
*  Then I would worry.
*  I don't see any signs that engineers will suddenly do idiotic things like put a electric power plant in control of a system that they haven't tested first.
*  Or all of these scenarios not only imagine a almost a magically powered intelligence you know including things like cure cancer which is probably an incoherent goal because there's so many different kinds of cancer or bring about world peace.
*  I mean how do you even specify that as a goal.
*  But the scenario is also imagine some degree of control of every molecule in the universe which not only is itself unlikely but we would not start to connect these systems to infrastructure without without testing as we would any kind of engineering system.
*  Now maybe some engineers will be irresponsible and we need legal and regulatory and legal responsibility implemented so that engineers don't do things that are stupid by their own standards.
*  But the I've never seen enough of a plausible scenario of existential threat to devote large amounts of brainpower to to forestall it.
*  You believe in the sort of the power on mass of the engineering of reason as you argue in your latest book of reason the science to sort of be the very thing that guides the development of new technology so it's safe and also keeps us safe.
*  Yeah it's the same granted the same culture of safety that currently is part of the engineering mindset for airplanes for example.
*  So yeah I don't think that that that should be thrown out the window and that untested all powerful systems should be suddenly implemented but there's no reason to think they are and in fact if you look at the.
*  Progress of artificial intelligence it's been it's been impressive specially in the last 10 years or so but the idea that suddenly there'll be a step function that all of a sudden before we know it it will be.
*  All powerful that there'll be some kind of recursive self improvement some kind of food is also fanciful we certainly by the technology that we.
*  That were now impresses us such as deep learning where you train something on hundreds of thousands or millions of examples they're not hundreds of thousands of problems of which curing cancer is.
*  Typical example and so the kind of techniques that have allowed AI to increase in the last five years or not the kind that are going to lead to this fantasy of.
*  Of exponential sudden self improvement so it's I think it's kind of a magical thinking it's not based on our understanding of how I actually works.
*  Now give me a chance here so you said fanciful magical thinking in his Ted talk Sam Harris says that thinking about AI killing all human civilization is somehow fun intellectually.
*  Now I have to say the scientists engineer I don't find it fun but when i'm having beer with my non AI friends.
*  There is indeed something fun and appealing about it like talking about an episode of black mirror considering if a large meteor is headed towards or we were just told a large meteor is headed towards earth something like this and can you relate to this sense of fun and do you understand the psychology of it.
*  Yes, great good question I personally don't find it fun I find it kind of actually a waste of time because there are genuine threats that we ought to be thinking about like like pandemics like like cyber security vulnerabilities.
*  Like the possibility of nuclear war and certainly climate change this is enough to fill many conversations without and I think there I think Sam did put his finger on something namely that there is a community.
*  Sometimes called the rationality community that delights in using its brain power to come up with scenarios that would not occur to mere mortals to less cerebral people.
*  So there is a kind of intellectual thrill in finding new things to worry about that no one has worried about yet I actually think though that it's not only is it is it kind of fun that doesn't give me particular pleasure.
*  But I think there is there can be a pernicious side to it namely that you overcome people with such dread such fatalism that there's so many ways to to to die to annihilate our civilization.
*  That we may as well enjoy life while we can there's nothing we can do about it if climate change doesn't do us in then runaway robots will so let's enjoy ourselves now we got to prioritize we have to.
*  Look at threats that are close to certainty such as climate change and distinguish those from ones that are merely imaginable but with infinitesimal probabilities and we have to.
*  Take into account people's worry budget you can't worry about everything and if you so dread and fear and terror and and fatalism it can lead to a kind of numbness well they just these problems are overwhelming and the engineers are just going to kill us all.
*  So let's either destroy the entire infrastructure of science technology or let's just enjoy life while we can.
*  So there's a certain line of worry which I'm worried about a lot of things in here and there's a certain line of worry when you cross you a lot across that it becomes paralyzing fear as opposed to productive fear and that's kind of what.
*  The highlighting the exactly right and we've seen some we know that human effort is not well calibrated against risk in that because a basic tentative cognitive psychology is that.
*  Perception of risk and hence perception of fear is driven by imaginability not by data and so we miss allocate fast amounts of resources to avoiding terrorism which kills on average about six Americans a year with a one exception of 9 11.
*  We invade countries we invent entire new departments of government with mass massive expenditure resources and lives to defend ourselves against a trivial risk.
*  Whereas guaranteed risks you mentioned as one of them you mentioned traffic fatalities and even risks that are.
*  Not here, but are plausible enough to worry about like pandemics like nuclear war receive far too little attention the in presidential debates there's no discussion of how to minimize the risk of nuclear war lots of discussion of terrorism, for example.
*  And so we I think it's essential to calibrate our budget of fear worry concern planning to the actual probability of harm.
*  Yep so let me ask this then this question so speaking of imaginability you said it's important to think about reason and one of my favorite people who who likes to dip into the outskirts of reason through fascinating exploration of his imagination is Joe Rogan.
*  Oh yes.
*  You so who has through reason used to believe a lot of conspiracies and through reason has stripped away a lot of his beliefs in that way so it's fascinating actually to watch him through rationality kind of throw away the ideas of big foot and 9 11 i'm not sure exactly trails I don't know what he believes in yes okay.
*  But you no longer know that's right no he's he's become a real force for for good.
*  So you were on the Joe Rogan podcast in February and had a fascinating conversation but as far as I remember didn't talk much about artificial intelligence I will be on this podcast in a couple weeks Joe is very much concerned about existential threat of AI I'm not sure if you're.
*  This is why I was hoping that you'll get into that topic and in this way he represents quite a lot of people who look at the topic of AI from 10,000 foot level so as an exercise of communication you said it's important to be rational and reason about these things let me ask if you were to coach me as an AI researcher about how to speak to Joe and the general public about AI what would you advise.
*  Well I'd the short answer would be to read the sections that I wrote in enlightenment about AI but a longer reason would be I think to emphasize and I think you're very well positioned as an engineer to remind people about the culture of engineering that it really is safety oriented.
*  That another discussion in enlightenment now I plot rates of accidental death from various causes plane crashes car crashes occupational accidents even death by lightning strikes and they all plummet because the culture of engineering is how do you squeeze out the lethal risks death by fire death by drowning.
*  Death by asphyxiation all of them drastically declined because of advances in engineering that I gotta say I did not appreciate until I saw those graphs and it is because exactly people like you who stamp and I think oh my God is what am I what am I what I'm inventing likely to hurt people and to deploy ingenuity to prevent that from happening now I'm not an engineer although I spent 22 years at MIT so I know something about the culture of engineering my understanding is that.
*  This is the way this is what you think if you're an engineer and it's essential that that culture not be suddenly switched off when it comes to artificial intelligence so I mean that that could be a problem but is there any reason to think it would be switched off I don't think so and one there's not enough engineers speaking up for this way for this the excitement for the positive view of human nature what you're trying to create is the positivity like everything we try to invent is trying to do good for the world but let me ask you
*  about the psychology of negativity it seems just objectively not considering the topic it seems that being negative about the future makes you sound smarter than being positive about the future irregardless the topic am I correct in this observation and if you if so why do you think that is yeah I think I think there is that that phenomenon that as Tom Lehrer the satirist said always predict the worst and you'll be hailed as a prophet it may be part of our overall negativity bias.
*  We are as a species more attuned to the negative than the positive we dread losses more than we enjoy gains and that may might open up a space for.
*  Profits to remind us of harms and risks and losses that we may have overlooked so I think there there there is that asymmetry so you've written some of my favorite books all over the place so starting from enlightenment now to the bettering ages of our nature blank slate how the mind works the one about language.
*  Language instinct.
*  Bill Gates big fan to set of your most recent book that it's my new favorite book of all time.
*  So for you as an author what was the book early on in your life that had a profound impact on the way you saw the world.
*  Certainly this book enlightenment now is influenced by David Deutsch's the beginning of infinity rather deep reflection on knowledge and the power of knowledge to improve the human condition.
*  The end with bits of wisdom such as that problems are inevitable but problems are solvable given the right knowledge and that solutions create new problems have to be solved in their turn.
*  That's a kind of wisdom about the human condition that influenced the writing of this book.
*  There's some books that are excellent but obscure some of which I have on my page of my website I read a book called the history of force.
*  Self published by a political scientist named James pain on the historical decline of violence and that was one of the inspirations for the better angels of our nature.
*  What about early on if you look back when you were maybe a teenager.
*  I loved a book called 123 infinity when I was a young adult I read that book by George Gamow the physicist very accessible and humorous explanations of relativity of number theory of dimensionality high.
*  I love the time life science series these are books that arrive every month that my mother subscribe to each one on a different topic.
*  One would be on electricity one would be on forests one would be on evolution and then one was on the mind and I was just intrigued that there could be a science of mind and that that book I would say it is an influence.
*  That's when you fell in love with the idea of studying the mind.
*  Was that the thing that grabbed you?
*  It was one of the things I would say.
*  I read as a college student the book reflections on language by Noam Chomsky who spent most of his career here at MIT.
*  Richard Dawkins two books the blind watchmaker and the selfish gene were enormously influential.
*  Partly for mainly for the content but also for the writing style that the ability to explain abstract concepts in lively prose.
*  Stephen Jay Gould's first collection ever since Darwin also an excellent example of lively writing.
*  George Miller psychologist that most psychologists are familiar with came up with the idea that human memory has a capacity of seven plus or minus two chunks.
*  That's probably his biggest claim to fame but he wrote a couple of books on language and communication that I read as an undergraduate.
*  Again beautifully written and intellectually deep.
*  Wonderful Stephen thank you so much for taking the time today.
*  My pleasure thanks a lot Lex.
*  you
