# Jennifer Burns: Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand, Economics, Capitalism, Freedom | Lex Fridman Podcast #457
**Lex Fridman:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4)
*  The following is a conversation with Jennifer Burns, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=0.0s)]
*  a historian of ideas, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  including the evolution of economic, political, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6.32s)]
*  and social ideas in the United States [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8.88s)]
*  in the 20th century to today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11.56s)]
*  She wrote two biographies, one on Milton Friedman [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=15.08s)]
*  and the other on Ayn Rand, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=18.84s)]
*  both of which I highly recommend. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  This was a super technical [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=24.0s)]
*  and super fascinating conversation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  At the end, I make a few comments [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  about my previous conversation with President Zelensky, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=31.48s)]
*  for those of you who may be interested. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=35.68s)]
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=38.88s)]
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=40.64s)]
*  in the description. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=42.84s)]
*  And now, dear friends, here's Jennifer Burns. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=44.04s)]
*  You have written two biographies, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=48.72s)]
*  one on Milton Friedman and one on Ayn Rand. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=50.4s)]
*  So if we can, we will focus on each one separately, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=54.44s)]
*  but first let's talk about the ideas [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=58.2s)]
*  that two of them held in common, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=59.64s)]
*  the value of individual freedom, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=61.32s)]
*  skepticism of collectivism, and the ethics of capitalism. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  Can you talk about the big picture ideas they converge on? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=71.0s)]
*  in the biggest picture, they're both individualists, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=74.2s)]
*  and they're skeptical of collectivities and collectivism. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=77.72s)]
*  So their unit of analysis is the individual, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  what's good for the individual, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  what works for the individual, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=85.76s)]
*  and their understanding of society kind of flows from that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=87.04s)]
*  They also both use this focus on individualism [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=90.48s)]
*  to justify and to support capitalism [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=94.72s)]
*  as a social and economic system. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=97.92s)]
*  So we can put them in a similar category. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=100.18s)]
*  We can call them individualists. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=102.48s)]
*  We could call them libertarians of a sort, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=104.12s)]
*  but they're also really different [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=107.0s)]
*  in how they approach capitalism, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=108.4s)]
*  how they approach thinking. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=110.4s)]
*  You know, Ayn Rand developed her own moral [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=112.4s)]
*  and philosophical system to justify individualism [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=115.76s)]
*  and to connect the individual to capitalism [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  and to support capitalism as a social and economic system. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=121.84s)]
*  Friedman struggles a bit more [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  with how to justify capitalism, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  and he'll ultimately come down to freedom as his core value, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=129.84s)]
*  like his god, as he says. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  And so freedom does connect back to the individual, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=135.84s)]
*  but he's not justifying capitalism for his own sake. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=138.88s)]
*  He's justifying it for its ability to underwrite freedom [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=141.56s)]
*  in a social sense and also in the individual sense. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=146.48s)]
*  At a high level, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  are there interesting differences between them? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=149.88s)]
*  You already mentioned a few, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=151.48s)]
*  maybe in terms of who they are personally, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=152.82s)]
*  maybe in terms of how they approach [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=155.16s)]
*  the justification for capitalism, maybe other ways. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=156.61999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=159.32s)]
*  So beyond this idea that Milton Friedman [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=160.16s)]
*  takes a while to come to his justification of capitalism, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=163.72s)]
*  whereas Ayn Rand kind of has it from the start. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=166.64s)]
*  She really focuses on the core quality [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  of rationalism and rationality. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=172.04s)]
*  Rationality is the defining feature of human beings. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=174.48s)]
*  And so she works from there, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=178.0s)]
*  whereas Friedman, Milton Friedman, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=180.92s)]
*  eventually converges on this idea of freedom. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  So that's one part of it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=186.12s)]
*  The other is their intellectual styles [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=187.16s)]
*  are really, really different. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=189.04s)]
*  Their interpersonal styles are really different. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=190.16s)]
*  So Friedman has big ideas, big principles that guide him, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  but he's also deeply empirical. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=195.86s)]
*  He spends most of his career doing historical research, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=197.84s)]
*  economic research, pulling data [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=201.26s)]
*  from how people actually make economic decisions [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=203.12s)]
*  and live in the world and using them to test [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=206.16s)]
*  and refine his theories. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  Where Rand, to some degree, we could say she's empirical [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  in that she lives through the Russian Revolution [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=213.18s)]
*  and takes a very big lesson from that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=215.16s)]
*  But her style of thinking is really first principles, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  an axiomatic approach, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=222.16s)]
*  going from the basic idea of rationality [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=224.32s)]
*  and then playing it out in different spheres. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=227.68s)]
*  So those are just very different intellectual approaches. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=230.9s)]
*  And then they lead in some ways [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=233.64s)]
*  to really different ways of thinking about [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=235.96s)]
*  how you get things done in the world. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=239.38s)]
*  Ayn Rand is a purist. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=242.04s)]
*  She wants to start with the pure belief. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=243.54s)]
*  She doesn't want it to be diluted. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=246.24s)]
*  One of her favorite sayings was, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=248.96s)]
*  you know, it's earlier than you think. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=250.92s)]
*  In other words, we're still moving towards a place [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=252.74s)]
*  where we can really hold and express these ideals purely. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=254.96s)]
*  Friedman, although he didn't use this terminology, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=259.02s)]
*  he was much more half a loaf guy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=261.22s)]
*  You know, like, I'll take what I can get [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  and then I'll try to move to where I really wanna be. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=265.26s)]
*  But he is able to compromise, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=267.66s)]
*  especially when he moves from being an economist [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=269.48s)]
*  into being more of a political thinker. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=272.18s)]
*  And so that's a really different intellectual style. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=275.6s)]
*  And then it also plays out in their lives [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=278.58s)]
*  in that Ayn Rand is incredibly schismatic. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=280.42s)]
*  I mean, she wants her friends to believe what she believes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=284.3s)]
*  And support what she supports. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=288.02s)]
*  And she's willing to break a relationship [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=290.29999999999995s)]
*  if it doesn't match. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=292.14s)]
*  Milton Friedman, he also does tend to have friends [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=294.14s)]
*  who agree with him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=297.38s)]
*  Yet he's always willing to debate his opponents [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=299.58s)]
*  and he's willing to do so with a smile on his face. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=303.09999999999997s)]
*  You know, he's the kind of, he's the happy warrior. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=305.5s)]
*  And he actually will win a lot of debates [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  simply by his emotional affect [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=310.14s)]
*  and his cheerfulness and his confidence. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=312.28s)]
*  Where Rand will lose debates [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=314.74s)]
*  because she gets so angry in the face of disagreement. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=316.26s)]
*  So yeah, they have a lot of similarities [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=319.06s)]
*  and a lot of differences. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=322.42s)]
*  And it's been really fascinating to kind of dive deep [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=323.42s)]
*  into both of them. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=325.58s)]
*  I just re-listen to Ayn Rand's, I think last lecture, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=326.62s)]
*  or at least it's called that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=331.02s)]
*  And just the confrontational nature [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=332.58s)]
*  of how she answers questions [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=336.94s)]
*  or how she addresses critics and so on. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=339.62s)]
*  There is a kind of charisma to that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  So I think both of them are very effective [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=345.3s)]
*  at winning over sort of popular support, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=347.42s)]
*  but in very different styles. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=351.54s)]
*  It seems like Ayn Rand is very cranky, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=352.74s)]
*  but there's, I mean, it's the most charismatic cranky person [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  I think I've ever listened to. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=358.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, people talked about her, meeting her [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=360.22s)]
*  and coming to believe in her ideas [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=364.66s)]
*  in a similar way as they did with Marxism [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=368.3s)]
*  in that suddenly everything made sense. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=370.90000000000003s)]
*  And that when they came to believe in objectivism, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=373.58s)]
*  they felt they had this engine [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=376.02s)]
*  for understanding the entire world. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=377.14s)]
*  Now, after a while, for most people, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=379.3s)]
*  that then became confining, but yeah, that certainty. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  And Friedman had some of that as well. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=384.7s)]
*  He clothed it differently. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=387.34s)]
*  He clothed it in happiness where Rand kind of closed it, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=388.86s)]
*  as you said, in crankiness or anger. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=391.78s)]
*  I mean, there's also an arc to Rand. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=393.94s)]
*  She gets kind of angrier and angrier and crankier [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=395.62s)]
*  and crankier over the course of her life. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=398.02s)]
*  What I enjoyed about my research is I was able to get [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=400.34s)]
*  into this early moment when she was different [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=402.3s)]
*  and a little more open. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  And then I kind of watched her close [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=406.1s)]
*  and her harden over time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=408.90000000000003s)]
*  Would it be fair to say that Milton Friedman [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=410.94s)]
*  had a bit more intellectual humility [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=414.04s)]
*  where he would be able to sort of evolve over time [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=416.14s)]
*  and be convinced by the reality of the world [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=419.42s)]
*  to change sort of the nuances of policies, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=423.1s)]
*  the nuances of how he thought about economics [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=426.14s)]
*  or about the world. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=429.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=430.78000000000003s)]
*  Friedman believed in being able to say I was wrong. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=432.82s)]
*  And there are some things he said he was wrong about, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=434.94s)]
*  we'll delve more into monetarism and monetary policy, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=437.46s)]
*  but he was able to talk about the ways his ideas [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=440.86s)]
*  hadn't mapped onto the world the way he thought they would. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=444.42s)]
*  He does a really interesting interview at the end [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=447.7s)]
*  of his life where he's beginning to voice some doubts [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=450.1s)]
*  about globalization, which was he was sort of a prophet [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=453.68s)]
*  of globalization, a cheerleader of globalization. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=457.06s)]
*  He really thought it would lead to a better world [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=459.1s)]
*  in all respects. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=460.78s)]
*  And towards the end of his life, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=462.14s)]
*  it's about two years before he dies, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  there's a note of doubt about how globalization unfolded [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=464.7s)]
*  and what it would mean, particularly for the American worker. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=468.65999999999997s)]
*  And so you can see him still thinking. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=471.9s)]
*  And that to me, I had sort of assumed [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=473.94s)]
*  he became crankier and crankier [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=476.73999999999995s)]
*  and more and more set in his ways. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=478.35999999999996s)]
*  And of course there's a phase where he does become that way, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=479.82s)]
*  especially since he's in the public eye [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=482.41999999999996s)]
*  and there's not room for nuance. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=483.9s)]
*  But to find in the last years of his life, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=485.78s)]
*  him being so reflective, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=488.4s)]
*  that was absolutely not something Rand could do. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=490.2s)]
*  I think there's a thread throughout this conversation [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=493.08s)]
*  where we should actually also say [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=495.56s)]
*  that you're kind of a historian of ideas. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  I am a historian of ideas, yes. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=501.2s)]
*  And so we're talking about today in part [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=502.88s)]
*  about two people who kind of fought for ideas, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=507.17999999999995s)]
*  for an idea like we've mentioned freedom for capitalism. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=511.41999999999996s)]
*  And they did it in very different ways. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  And it's so interesting to see sort of the impact [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=517.76s)]
*  they both had and how their elucidation explanation [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=520.6s)]
*  of those ideas like reverberated throughout society [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=527.0400000000001s)]
*  and how we together as a society figure out what works, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=530.24s)]
*  the degree to which they have influence on the public, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  the degree to which they have influence [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=537.58s)]
*  on individual administrations [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=538.88s)]
*  like the Reagan administration, Nixon and so on, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=540.36s)]
*  and how it might return like fade away [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=542.76s)]
*  and then come back in the modern times. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=546.04s)]
*  And it's so interesting if you just see this whole world [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=548.0s)]
*  as a game of ideas where we were like pushing and pulling [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=551.36s)]
*  and trying to figure stuff out. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=556.56s)]
*  A bunch of people got real excited [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=560.24s)]
*  over a hundred years ago about communism [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=562.76s)]
*  and then they try stuff out [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=564.6999999999999s)]
*  and then the implementation broke down [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=565.9599999999999s)]
*  and we keep playing with ideas. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=569.12s)]
*  So these are the two greats of playing with ideas. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=571.3199999999999s)]
*  I think that's a thread that just runs through this. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=576.72s)]
*  Yeah, and of kind of pushing back against that movement [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=578.08s)]
*  towards communism, social democracy. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  But one difference that I really should emphasize, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=584.48s)]
*  Rand is a writer of fiction. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=587.84s)]
*  She's a philosopher, but she's also a writer of fiction. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=589.96s)]
*  So she is working almost in the mythic register, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=592.12s)]
*  much more in a psychological register. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=596.48s)]
*  She's creating characters that people identify with [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=598.4399999999999s)]
*  and people relate to experiences they've had. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=601.32s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons she hits so deep [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=605.18s)]
*  and she's also offering people, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=607.0999999999999s)]
*  I read all the fan letters to her. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=609.02s)]
*  People would say things like, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=610.5799999999999s)]
*  I read the fountainhead and now I'm getting a divorce. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=612.8599999999999s)]
*  Having just these incredible realizations. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=618.5s)]
*  Milton Friedman didn't get such things. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=622.26s)]
*  Milton Friedman didn't get such things. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=623.66s)]
*  Or I'll meet someone and they'll say to me, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=625.02s)]
*  Ayn Rand is the reason I went to medical school. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=628.9399999999999s)]
*  A woman said this to me a few years back. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=632.9799999999999s)]
*  It never even occurred to me that I could be a doctor [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=635.54s)]
*  until I read Ayn Rand and I said, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=636.78s)]
*  I'm gonna go to medical school. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=638.46s)]
*  And so she has that really intense impact on people. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=639.86s)]
*  So she thought of herself as rational. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=642.78s)]
*  She thought of rationality as kind of what she was doing, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=646.1s)]
*  but she was actually doing a kind of mytho poetic [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=650.1s)]
*  psychological work as well. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=653.9s)]
*  Whereas Friedman on the one hand was much more rational. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=655.82s)]
*  And there's a whole set of economic thinking [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=659.1s)]
*  and he provides a rational framework [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=661.14s)]
*  for understanding the world. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=664.02s)]
*  And it's the framework of neoclassical economics. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=665.5799999999999s)]
*  At the same time, he does pull on mythologies [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=669.54s)]
*  of the idea of America in the Gilded Age, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=672.66s)]
*  the frontier mythology, the individual immigrant, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=675.78s)]
*  the settler mythology. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=679.14s)]
*  He pulls on these, but he doesn't create them. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=680.22s)]
*  And he's more kind of playing a tune he already has. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=683.54s)]
*  Whereas I think Rand really does something [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=688.62s)]
*  a little bit deeper in her ability to reach [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=691.1s)]
*  into people's psyche and then take that emotional, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=693.1s)]
*  psychological experience and fuse it [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=697.14s)]
*  to an intellectual world and a political world. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=700.4200000000001s)]
*  And that's really what makes her so powerful. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=703.02s)]
*  And so I think she comes back in to relevancy [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=706.22s)]
*  in a different way than Friedman does, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=710.02s)]
*  because I think in some ways she's tapped [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=712.38s)]
*  into a kind of more universal human longing [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=713.94s)]
*  for independence and autonomy and kind of self creation [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=717.78s)]
*  and self discovery. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=721.0600000000001s)]
*  Nevertheless, there's still pragmatic ideas [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=723.14s)]
*  that are still important today from Milton Friedman, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=726.62s)]
*  even just in the economics level. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=730.0600000000001s)]
*  So let's dig in. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=731.74s)]
*  Let me try, I took some notes. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=734.98s)]
*  Let me try to summarize who Milton Friedman is [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=736.82s)]
*  and then you can correct me. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=739.5400000000001s)]
*  Okay, so he is widely considered to be one of the greatest [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=741.38s)]
*  and most influential economists in history, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=745.98s)]
*  not just the 20th century, I think ever. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=748.14s)]
*  He was an advocate of economic freedom, like we said, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=750.58s)]
*  and just individual freedom in general. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=753.86s)]
*  He strongly advocated for free market capitalism [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=757.0200000000001s)]
*  and limited government intervention in the economy. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=759.9000000000001s)]
*  Though you do give, I've listened to basically everything [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=763.4200000000001s)]
*  you have on the internet. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=766.1800000000001s)]
*  You give some more depth and nuance on his views on this [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=767.62s)]
*  and in your books. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=770.5s)]
*  He led the famed Chicago School of Economics [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=772.5400000000001s)]
*  and he won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=777.1s)]
*  He greatly influenced economic policies [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=781.3000000000001s)]
*  during the Reagan administration and other administrations. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=783.62s)]
*  He was an influential public intellectual, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=787.0600000000001s)]
*  highly influential, not just among economists. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=789.94s)]
*  He lived 1912 to 2006. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=793.0600000000001s)]
*  So that means he lived and worked through [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=797.02s)]
*  some major world events where his ideas [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=800.0600000000001s)]
*  were really important. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=802.14s)]
*  The Great Depression with the New Deal, World War II, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  with the post-war reconstruction, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=807.94s)]
*  the rise and fall of the Bretton Woods monetary system, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=809.82s)]
*  as we may talk about, the Cold War [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=813.74s)]
*  and all the conflicts involved in that, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=817.26s)]
*  sort of the tensions around communism and so on. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=819.26s)]
*  So the fall of the Soviet Union. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=821.82s)]
*  And also he has some interesting relationships [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=824.4200000000001s)]
*  to China's economic transformation since the 1970s, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=826.38s)]
*  the stagflation of the 1970s, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=831.4200000000001s)]
*  and I'm sure there's a lot more. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=833.7s)]
*  Can you maybe continue this thread [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=836.5s)]
*  and give a big picture overview [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=840.18s)]
*  of the ideas he is known for? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=841.38s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=843.38s)]
*  And that's a great summary. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=844.22s)]
*  You learn fast. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=845.82s)]
*  So let me start with the economics [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=847.3s)]
*  and then I can kind of transition [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=850.54s)]
*  to how he used those economic ideas [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=853.22s)]
*  to become a real voice in the American conservative movement, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=855.58s)]
*  the American political realm. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=859.5s)]
*  So I'll kind of highlight four ideas [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=860.62s)]
*  or contributions or episodes. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=865.14s)]
*  One was his work with Anna Schwartz [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=867.86s)]
*  in revising our understanding of the Great Depression. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=870.02s)]
*  And that's tightly related to the second, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=873.06s)]
*  which is the school of monetarism [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=874.98s)]
*  that he and Schwartz really become founders of. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=876.9399999999999s)]
*  Then there is the prediction of stagflation [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=880.9399999999999s)]
*  and the explanation of that in the 1970s, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=886.18s)]
*  which really is one of these sort of career-making predictions. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=888.86s)]
*  And we can dig into that. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=894.14s)]
*  And then in terms of technical economics, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=895.3000000000001s)]
*  he's known for the permanent income hypothesis, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=897.62s)]
*  which he develops with a group of female collaborators [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=901.1s)]
*  that I can talk about. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=904.0600000000001s)]
*  So those are kind of four technical pieces [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=904.9s)]
*  and being really brought together [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=907.54s)]
*  in what becomes the Chicago School of Economics. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=910.5s)]
*  He's undoubtedly the head and the leader [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=913.1800000000001s)]
*  of the Chicago School of Economics. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=915.54s)]
*  There's an earlier generation that he learns from. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=917.54s)]
*  There's his generation. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=920.4200000000001s)]
*  There's also a Chicago School of Law and Economics [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=922.94s)]
*  that's really profoundly influential. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=925.82s)]
*  And then there'll be kind of a third generation [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=928.14s)]
*  that he's somewhat distinct from, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=930.4200000000001s)]
*  but that goes on to really shape economics. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=932.34s)]
*  But let me go back to these kind of four pieces [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=934.74s)]
*  and let me start with Great Depression. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=937.58s)]
*  So Milton Friedman actually lives through [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=940.7s)]
*  the Great Depression. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=944.1800000000001s)]
*  He's in college when it hits. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=945.66s)]
*  And he is, so he's in college, it's 1928 to 1932. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=947.94s)]
*  And he's aware of the depression and he's deciding, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=953.22s)]
*  should I study mathematics or should I study economics? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=957.94s)]
*  And he's had some good economics teachers, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=961.3000000000001s)]
*  but it's really the context. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=964.1400000000001s)]
*  It's looking around at the slow dissolving [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=966.58s)]
*  of economic prosperity. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=969.7800000000001s)]
*  So he decides to go to Chicago. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=971.4200000000001s)]
*  He decides to study economics. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=972.7800000000001s)]
*  And what's really interesting is that the Great Depression [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=974.82s)]
*  is so unexpected, it's unpredicted, it's unprecedented, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=979.58s)]
*  and economists are really struggling [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=984.9000000000001s)]
*  to know how to respond to it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=986.9000000000001s)]
*  And so he's gonna arrive at the University of Chicago [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=988.5s)]
*  when the field is struggling to know what to do. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=992.0200000000001s)]
*  So he's in this kind of really open space [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=994.9000000000001s)]
*  where the institutional economics of the 1920s [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=997.74s)]
*  has failed to predict, which was focused on business cycles. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1001.46s)]
*  This is the irony, their big thing was charting [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1004.5s)]
*  and understanding business cycles. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1006.94s)]
*  And then we have the biggest business cycle of all time [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1008.58s)]
*  and they haven't seen it coming [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1011.54s)]
*  and they don't have a good explanation for it. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1012.86s)]
*  And what he will get at Chicago is the remnants [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1015.1s)]
*  of the monetary understanding of the economy. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1021.86s)]
*  And so his teachers, they don't know exactly what's going on, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1025.02s)]
*  but they look first to the banking crisis. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1029.62s)]
*  They look first to the, in 1933, it's bank runs, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1033.1s)]
*  failures of maybe it's up to a third of American banks, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1037.1399999999999s)]
*  it's huge, thousands of banks are failing per week. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1039.82s)]
*  So they're focused on that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1042.1799999999998s)]
*  So that's the first kind of imprint he will have. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1043.3799999999999s)]
*  The Great Depression has something to do [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1046.54s)]
*  with a banking system. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1048.34s)]
*  The second imprint he will have is that all of his professors [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1050.1s)]
*  are profoundly concerned about the social crisis. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1053.44s)]
*  They want relief programs, they want them now, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1056.78s)]
*  they want bank regulation and financial reform. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1060.06s)]
*  They're very active. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1062.42s)]
*  This is not laissez faire by any stretch of the imagination. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1063.5s)]
*  So Friedman has that imprinting and then about, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1066.7s)]
*  so that's he gets there in 32, 36, 37, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1071.22s)]
*  the ideas of John Maynard Keynes from Britain, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1075.5s)]
*  which has a different explanation. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1078.26s)]
*  Keynes has a different explanation of the Great Depression [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1079.8600000000001s)]
*  will kind of make landfall in American economics [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1081.8200000000002s)]
*  and be very profoundly influential [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1084.8600000000001s)]
*  on most American economists, but Friedman already, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1087.18s)]
*  it's too late for Friedman. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1090.7s)]
*  He already has a different perspective. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1091.86s)]
*  So Keynesianism unfolds. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1093.86s)]
*  I can say more about that, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1096.4599999999998s)]
*  but it basically leads to more active federal government [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1098.1799999999998s)]
*  participation in the economy. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1103.54s)]
*  And what underlies a lot of that, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1105.62s)]
*  it's adaptation in America, particularly, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1108.4599999999998s)]
*  is the idea that capitalism has failed. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1111.1s)]
*  Capitalism has revealed itself to have a profound flaw [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1114.8799999999999s)]
*  in that it's cycles of boom and bust, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1119.88s)]
*  create social instability, chaos. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1124.2800000000002s)]
*  It needs to be tamed. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1126.6000000000001s)]
*  It needs to be regulated. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1127.6000000000001s)]
*  And so that becomes the kind of baseline of politics [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1129.24s)]
*  in the United States, the understanding of the New Deal, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1134.4s)]
*  the understanding of the Democratic Party, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1137.16s)]
*  even to some extent, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1138.96s)]
*  the understanding of the Republican Party. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1139.8000000000002s)]
*  And Friedman never quite sure about that. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1141.22s)]
*  He has a hunch that there's something else going on [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1145.0s)]
*  and he does not buy that capitalism [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1147.0800000000002s)]
*  has sort of ground to a halt. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1149.02s)]
*  Or the other idea is that capitalism has gone through [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1150.58s)]
*  some sort of phase transition. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1153.78s)]
*  And it worked great maybe while we had a frontier. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1156.22s)]
*  This is a very serious argument that people are making. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1159.78s)]
*  United States used to have a frontier, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1162.46s)]
*  a place where Europeans hadn't fully settled. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1164.84s)]
*  Of course, they're pushing out the native tribes. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1167.9s)]
*  That's another story. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1170.22s)]
*  But that this frontier is the engine of economic growth [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1171.06s)]
*  and the frontier is now over, it's closed, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1174.66s)]
*  and we're gonna stagnate. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1176.74s)]
*  There's a theory of secular stagnation. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1178.06s)]
*  And so to deal with secular stagnation, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1180.26s)]
*  we're just gonna have to have a more active state. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1182.34s)]
*  So Friedman is suspicious of all these assumptions. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1184.86s)]
*  And he has this idea that it has something to do with money. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1187.96s)]
*  Money is somehow important. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1191.72s)]
*  And so he joins together with Anna Schwartz, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1192.98s)]
*  who is an economist. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1196.8999999999999s)]
*  She doesn't at this time hold a PhD. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1198.94s)]
*  She's working for the National Bureau of Economic Research. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1201.12s)]
*  And they come together to do this study of money [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1203.62s)]
*  in the US economy. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1205.74s)]
*  And it takes them 12 years to write the book. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1207.3s)]
*  And they're releasing their ideas and they're arguing. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1210.74s)]
*  And Friedman is writing papers, giving talks, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1213.7s)]
*  saying money's really important. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1216.7s)]
*  And nobody's really believing him. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1220.1399999999999s)]
*  He's a crank. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1221.58s)]
*  He's at Chicago. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1222.3999999999999s)]
*  He's out, you know, Chicago is a well-known university, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1223.24s)]
*  but he's sort of considered a crank. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1226.3999999999999s)]
*  And then in 63, he and Anna Schwartz publish this book [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1228.5s)]
*  and it's, you know, 800 pages. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1231.62s)]
*  It's a reinterpretation of the history of the United States [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1234.74s)]
*  through money. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1236.98s)]
*  Like the central character is money, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1238.22s)]
*  whether it's specie, greenback, or the US currency. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1240.34s)]
*  And they have a whole chapter on the Great Depression. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1243.7s)]
*  And they, what they've literally done, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1245.54s)]
*  Schwartz has done most of this. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1247.74s)]
*  They've gone, Schwartz has gone to banks and said, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1249.18s)]
*  "'Show me your books." [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1251.7s)]
*  And then she's added up column by column. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1252.54s)]
*  How much money is in your vault? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1255.02s)]
*  How much money is on deposit? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1256.46s)]
*  How much money is circulating? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1258.18s)]
*  And so they literally have graphs. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1259.7s)]
*  You can see them in the book of how much money [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1261.34s)]
*  has been circulating in the US [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1264.02s)]
*  at various different points in time. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1265.6200000000001s)]
*  And when they get to the Great Depression, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1267.74s)]
*  they find the quantity of money available [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1268.58s)]
*  and the economy goes down by a third. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1271.4199999999998s)]
*  And in some ways, this is completely obvious [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1273.6999999999998s)]
*  because so many banks have failed [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1276.62s)]
*  and we don't have any type of bank insurance at that point. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1280.4199999999998s)]
*  So if your bank goes under, your savings are there, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1285.34s)]
*  the money essentially vanishes. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1287.28s)]
*  And it's fractional reserve banking, right? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1289.06s)]
*  So you've put in, they can loan up to 90% on their deposits. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1290.54s)]
*  And so Friedman and Schwartz present this argument [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1294.94s)]
*  that what really made the Great Depression so bad [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1299.46s)]
*  was this drop in the amount of money, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1303.0800000000002s)]
*  the 30% drop in the money. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1304.9s)]
*  They called the great contraction. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1306.2s)]
*  And then they go further and they say, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1308.22s)]
*  well, how did this happen and why? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1309.46s)]
*  And they pinpoint the Federal Reserve, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1311.8600000000001s)]
*  which is a fairly new institution at that time. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1315.46s)]
*  And they say, what did the Federal Reserve do? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1317.8200000000002s)]
*  The lender of last resort, what did it do in the face [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1320.18s)]
*  of what they're depicting is a massive, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1322.58s)]
*  unprecedented liquidity crisis. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1324.6599999999999s)]
*  And they find it's not really doing much. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1326.4399999999998s)]
*  And they really dig into the details [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1329.54s)]
*  and they find that the Federal Reserve [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1331.46s)]
*  has gone through a sort of personnel change. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1335.3s)]
*  And some of the key leaders in the 1920s, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1337.22s)]
*  Benjamin Strong is one of them, he's now deceased. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1339.9399999999998s)]
*  And the dominance of the New York Federal Reserve, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1343.1399999999999s)]
*  which in their telling, is global, it's interconnected, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1345.9399999999998s)]
*  it's seen a lot of financial things come and go. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1350.78s)]
*  And they believe that the New York Fed [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1353.54s)]
*  had the understanding to recognize [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1356.02s)]
*  this is a liquidity crisis. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1358.06s)]
*  We should be very generous. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1359.22s)]
*  We should support all the banks. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1360.62s)]
*  Their influence has diminished for the kind of banks [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1362.54s)]
*  that are more, they don't say like the rubes and the hicks, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1365.44s)]
*  but it basically is. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1368.82s)]
*  It's like, the people in charge [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1369.7s)]
*  don't know what they're doing. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1371.26s)]
*  And so the Fed pursues this kind of policy [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1372.1s)]
*  of masterly inactivity. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1374.94s)]
*  They don't see it as a problem. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1376.24s)]
*  They don't do much. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1377.86s)]
*  There's an enormous liquidity crisis. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1378.82s)]
*  And that's their version [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1381.1399999999999s)]
*  of what the Great Depression is all about. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1384.98s)]
*  That it's a financial system meltdown. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1387.1799999999998s)]
*  It's a liquidity crisis. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1389.62s)]
*  And that in some ways, well, in many ways, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1391.5s)]
*  they argue very strong counterfactual argument. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1394.72s)]
*  The Federal Reserve could have prevented it, and it did not. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1397.84s)]
*  And so it becomes then an institutional failure [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1401.3s)]
*  and a political failure, not a failure of capitalism. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1405.1399999999999s)]
*  And so this book comes out, it's a blockbuster. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1409.8s)]
*  And even those economists who've been like, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1413.52s)]
*  Friedman is a crank, I don't buy it, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1416.12s)]
*  are like, Friedman and Schwartz are onto something. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1418.68s)]
*  Milton Friedman on a Schwartz are onto something. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1421.96s)]
*  And so that really changes the game. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1423.9199999999998s)]
*  And this is also one of his most influential contributions [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1426.72s)]
*  because Friedman and Schwartz becomes the playbook [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1432.76s)]
*  for the Federal Reserve. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1435.6399999999999s)]
*  And we have lived through this, right? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1437.24s)]
*  In the financial crisis, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1439.16s)]
*  the Federal Reserve is ready to loan. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1440.52s)]
*  COVID, the Federal Reserve does all kinds of new things [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1443.0s)]
*  because no Federal Reserve chair wants to be [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1446.28s)]
*  in Friedman and Schwartz 2.0 that somebody writes, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1449.76s)]
*  or they're the bad guy who left the economy meltdown. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1453.2s)]
*  So, the specifics of what they say to do [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1456.16s)]
*  have obviously evolved as the system has changed. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1459.52s)]
*  But this is a playbook for how to deal with economic crisis. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1462.44s)]
*  It's Friedman and Schwartz. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1466.52s)]
*  And so it's absolutely fundamental [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1467.56s)]
*  and that is really going to be the place he makes his mark. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1470.04s)]
*  There's a lot of things to say here. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1474.0s)]
*  So first, the book we're talking about [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1475.56s)]
*  is the monetary history of the United States [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1476.8799999999999s)]
*  in part for which Milton Friedman won the Nobel Prize. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1479.84s)]
*  You've also mentioned the influence of the Great Depression. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1483.52s)]
*  If you could even just rewind to that. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1485.6399999999999s)]
*  So he went to, I guess, college in Rutgers. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1488.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1490.76s)]
*  And he was, you know, mathematical proclivities. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1491.6s)]
*  So he was kind of wanted to be a mathematician. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1496.24s)]
*  And so it's kind of a cool crossroads. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1499.16s)]
*  It's interesting how the right time, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1503.24s)]
*  the right person arrives, right? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1506.16s)]
*  So you described this really well that, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1509.0s)]
*  so he had this choice to be a mathematician or an economist. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1512.1200000000001s)]
*  An economist is the University of Chicago, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1514.72s)]
*  mathematician is Brown University, whichever. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1516.4s)]
*  And then this is also the beginnings, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1519.32s)]
*  as you've described, of mathematical economics. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1524.08s)]
*  So he fits in nicely into this using, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1528.3999999999999s)]
*  I think you said the number of equations started going up [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1532.76s)]
*  per paper, which is a really nice way to put it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1535.24s)]
*  So really the right person at the right time [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1537.76s)]
*  to try to solve this puzzle of the economy melting down. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1542.08s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1545.84s)]
*  Just one human, it's just from just zooming in on a single [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1546.68s)]
*  human making a decision about life. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1550.84s)]
*  And it's hard to know when you're in it [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1554.48s)]
*  that the world is melting down from an economics perspective. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1558.0s)]
*  And that I could do something about this [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1561.6s)]
*  to figure out what it is. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1564.8s)]
*  And also I'm going to reject the mainstream narrative [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1566.1599999999999s)]
*  about why this happened. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1569.36s)]
*  Yeah, so the other piece of the puzzle, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1571.1599999999999s)]
*  when he goes to Rutgers, he thinks he'll be an actuary. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1573.6799999999998s)]
*  So Milton Friedman's family, his parents are immigrants, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1575.9599999999998s)]
*  Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1579.96s)]
*  They're pretty atypical in that they don't stay in New York [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1582.28s)]
*  and they move to Broadway, New Jersey, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1586.68s)]
*  and they put together a fairly middle-class life [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1589.48s)]
*  as kind of, they have a shop, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1592.32s)]
*  they do some wholesale buying and selling. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1594.3600000000001s)]
*  And then his father dies when he's 16. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1595.92s)]
*  His life becomes more precarious, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1598.16s)]
*  but it's never as precarious as he makes it out to be. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1600.92s)]
*  He's got three older sisters, they earn a good living. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1603.28s)]
*  Incidentally, they all have better grades in high school [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1605.76s)]
*  than he does, but he's the one that goes to college. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1608.28s)]
*  And, but it's actually really important [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1610.92s)]
*  that he loses his father figure [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1614.52s)]
*  because he's then looking for other father figures. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1617.08s)]
*  And he meets two at Rutgers. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1619.8799999999999s)]
*  One is Arthur Burns, who will go on to have [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1621.56s)]
*  a huge influence in his career. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1624.3999999999999s)]
*  No relation to me, by the way. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1626.3999999999999s)]
*  But Arthur Burns is like him, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1629.48s)]
*  a fellow Jewish immigrant boy on the make. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1631.8799999999999s)]
*  He's older and he's making a career as an economist. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1634.72s)]
*  And then there's Homer Jones, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1637.88s)]
*  who has gone to the University of Chicago [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1639.1200000000001s)]
*  and is studying with Frank Knight at Chicago [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1642.0s)]
*  and says, you have to go to Chicago. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1643.96s)]
*  So he has these two mentors. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1645.88s)]
*  And Burns in particular suggests, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1647.3600000000001s)]
*  oh, I could be an economist, that could be my career path. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1650.0400000000002s)]
*  The idea to be an actuary for an insurance company, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1653.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure where he got that idea, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1656.5600000000002s)]
*  but he just thought that was something he could do [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1657.88s)]
*  as someone who was good at math. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1660.0800000000002s)]
*  And so the college really opens the perspective, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1661.2800000000002s)]
*  opens the door. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1664.0s)]
*  And then I think it's really key that again, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1665.4s)]
*  he doesn't get an explanation [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1668.16s)]
*  that he buys for the Great Depression. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1672.2s)]
*  So then he's looking for one. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1674.12s)]
*  And the math part is really interesting aspect [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1675.8s)]
*  of his career. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1679.36s)]
*  Now he actually comes to Chicago [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1680.6s)]
*  to study with the mathematical economist, Henry Schultz. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1684.52s)]
*  But he gets there and he thinks Schultz is kind of dumb. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1688.56s)]
*  He really does. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1692.92s)]
*  He's incredibly arrogant. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1693.92s)]
*  And he just thinks this guy's not that smart. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1695.48s)]
*  And it seems that, I mean, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1697.88s)]
*  Schultz did some really important work [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1699.56s)]
*  in the early stages of mathematical economics, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1701.16s)]
*  but a lot of the oral histories about him are like, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1703.4s)]
*  yeah, he wasn't that bright. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1705.52s)]
*  So Friedman's maybe onto something. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1707.3200000000002s)]
*  So he falls into the set of students [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1709.72s)]
*  who are really enthralled [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1714.56s)]
*  with his other professor, Frank Knight. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1715.88s)]
*  And Frank Knight is against math and economics. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1718.1200000000001s)]
*  Frank Knight is like a neoclassical economist, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1721.2s)]
*  not a mathematical economist. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1723.76s)]
*  He's an old school liberal. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1725.48s)]
*  He's really concerned about liberal democracy, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1727.1200000000001s)]
*  economic liberalism. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1731.64s)]
*  And Friedman is very deeply influenced by Knight. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1732.88s)]
*  And he continues to pursue mathematical economics. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1736.3600000000001s)]
*  So he'll go for part of his graduate career. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1738.68s)]
*  He goes to Columbia University [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1741.56s)]
*  where he actually gets his PhD from. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1744.08s)]
*  And he works with a mathematical economist there. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1745.68s)]
*  And so he comes out trained [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1749.2s)]
*  in what will eventually be econometrics, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1750.96s)]
*  and statistics and economics, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1753.96s)]
*  his early publications are in statistics, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1755.48s)]
*  but it's not really where his intellectual heart and soul [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1757.28s)]
*  are. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1760.72s)]
*  And eventually he will turn very profoundly [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1761.56s)]
*  against mathematics and economics [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  and become a sort of heterodox strain [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1766.24s)]
*  throughout 20th century economics. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1768.32s)]
*  It says, simple models are better. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1769.8s)]
*  We need to work on empirical, work off empirical data, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1774.1200000000001s)]
*  not construct elegant models. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1778.2s)]
*  And becomes really sort of counter-cultural [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1781.6s)]
*  within economics in that way. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1784.28s)]
*  And the test of a good model [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1785.76s)]
*  is it should actually predict stuff that happens. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1787.24s)]
*  It should predict stuff that happens. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1789.76s)]
*  It should tie back to what's going on. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1791.04s)]
*  I'm wondering which direction to go. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1793.8799999999999s)]
*  So first, actually, if we could zoom out [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1795.24s)]
*  on the different schools of economics. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1796.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1799.0s)]
*  Just the basics. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1799.84s)]
*  You mentioned neoclassical, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1800.68s)]
*  we mentioned Keynesian economics, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1802.08s)]
*  we mentioned, what else did we mention? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1804.28s)]
*  Well, the Chicago School of Economics. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1806.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1808.0s)]
*  Austrian economics fit into that pile [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1809.72s)]
*  and Marxian economics. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1811.84s)]
*  And can we just even just linger [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1813.6799999999998s)]
*  and try to redefine Keynesian economics [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1815.9199999999998s)]
*  and Chicago School of Economics [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1818.6s)]
*  and neoclassical economics and Austrian economics? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1820.6s)]
*  Because there's some overlap and tension. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1824.56s)]
*  Okay, so schools of economics. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1827.56s)]
*  So we could start with classical economics. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1830.12s)]
*  Classical economics, we could think of, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1833.32s)]
*  Adam Smith is kind of your classic classical economist, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1835.48s)]
*  the founder of the discipline. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1838.72s)]
*  Classical economics does not really use math, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1840.56s)]
*  is very close to political economy. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1844.52s)]
*  It's concerned with, as Smith puts it, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1846.92s)]
*  the wealth of nations. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1851.1200000000001s)]
*  It's concerned to some degree with distribution. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1852.24s)]
*  It's concerned to some degree [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1854.48s)]
*  with what makes a good political system. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1855.76s)]
*  And what tends to really define classical economics [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1858.4s)]
*  when you're looking from a great distance [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1864.52s)]
*  is what's called the labor theory of value. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1866.16s)]
*  So where does value come from in classical economics? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1868.76s)]
*  It comes from the labor that a person puts into it. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1872.68s)]
*  So maybe this in some way comes from Locke's notion [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1877.5600000000002s)]
*  of property that you kind of mingle, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1881.8000000000002s)]
*  your labor with the natural world. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1883.96s)]
*  We can say labor theory of value. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1885.8000000000002s)]
*  So classical economics concerned with, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1887.48s)]
*  Smith is arguing against mercantilism for more free trade. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1891.2s)]
*  Often goes by the name of political economy [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1896.16s)]
*  to show it's more capacious. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1898.2s)]
*  It's thinking of politics and economics. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1899.5600000000002s)]
*  You can still read these books today. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1902.8000000000002s)]
*  The sentences are long, the words are different, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1905.6000000000001s)]
*  but you can still follow along. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1907.3200000000002s)]
*  So the real big transition from classical economics [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1909.24s)]
*  and political economy to economics, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1913.46s)]
*  as it's understood today, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1916.0400000000002s)]
*  comes with the marginal revolution. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1917.1200000000001s)]
*  And the marginal revolution is a scientific revolution [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1919.6000000000001s)]
*  that happens in a couple of different places [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1922.44s)]
*  simultaneously, right? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1925.0400000000002s)]
*  This is one of these things that you see [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1926.92s)]
*  in the history of science. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1927.76s)]
*  Like, there'll be some breakthrough. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1928.68s)]
*  Like Darwin has a breakthrough, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1930.68s)]
*  but like somebody else has sort of the same breakthrough [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1932.12s)]
*  at the same time, totally, you know, differently. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1934.0s)]
*  So there's a version of marginalism that's continental. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1936.3999999999999s)]
*  There's a version in the German speaking lands [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1941.48s)]
*  and in the French speaking lands and in Britain. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1943.28s)]
*  And they all kind of come together. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1945.72s)]
*  And the shift is in the theory of value. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1947.6s)]
*  So the theory of value in marginalism [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1951.74s)]
*  is on the margin. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1955.24s)]
*  So say you have one apple and you want a second one, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1957.56s)]
*  how much is going from one apple to two apple worth for you? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1962.56s)]
*  Probably quite a bit. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1968.2s)]
*  If you had 10 apples, maybe going to 11 apples [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1969.58s)]
*  doesn't matter that much. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1972.8s)]
*  The marginal value is less. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1973.8s)]
*  So what marginalism does though, most importantly, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1975.96s)]
*  is it opens the door to math and economics, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1979.44s)]
*  because it means you can graph this now. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1983.12s)]
*  You can depict this relationship graphically. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1985.6799999999998s)]
*  And there's some really interesting work [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1990.0s)]
*  in the history of economics that shows a lot of the people [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1991.9399999999998s)]
*  who developed marginalism were looking to physics [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1995.08s)]
*  as a model, physics, the queen of the sciences. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=1999.56s)]
*  And so they were thinking, they imported terms [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2002.28s)]
*  from the natural world to describe the social world [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2006.52s)]
*  through the lens of economics. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2009.4799999999998s)]
*  Terms like equilibrium. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2011.16s)]
*  So the idea being that if you looked at a market, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2013.8400000000001s)]
*  a market would reach equilibrium [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2016.98s)]
*  when everybody has bought and sold all that they want, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2020.72s)]
*  or the price will settle at an equilibrium price [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2023.76s)]
*  when it's really the demand and supply are matching up. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2026.96s)]
*  And some of these ideas are things we would pick up [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2030.0800000000002s)]
*  at a microeconomics class? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2032.96s)]
*  Oh yes, this is still out there. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2035.1200000000001s)]
*  This is sort of the basic foundation [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2037.74s)]
*  of microeconomics, marginal analysis. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2040.34s)]
*  And so in the German speaking intellectual tradition, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2043.36s)]
*  this is the root of Austrian economics. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2047.26s)]
*  And people picking up the marginal revolution [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2050.46s)]
*  in the German speaking lands are opposed to the historicists [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2052.84s)]
*  who are thinking in a more evolutionary way [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2057.06s)]
*  about how societies kind of grow and change. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2060.34s)]
*  And they have a vision of economic ideas [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2064.22s)]
*  as applying differently to different types [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2069.22s)]
*  of social arrangements. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2072.4199999999996s)]
*  Or the marginalists, remember, are inspired by physics. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2074.1s)]
*  And this is a set of natural laws that applies anywhere [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2077.74s)]
*  to any sort of human society. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2082.1s)]
*  So that's his first really big fissure [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2084.62s)]
*  that we'll see again and again. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2086.9399999999996s)]
*  Are you historically minded? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2088.66s)]
*  Do certain traits of economic life in here, adhere, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2090.68s)]
*  and become expressed in certain types of societies? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2097.04s)]
*  Or are there universal economic laws [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2099.2s)]
*  that flow through any type of society? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2101.2799999999997s)]
*  So that's kind of a juncture, a break. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2103.3599999999997s)]
*  And so marginalism, first people start using really geometry [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2105.9199999999996s)]
*  to kind of graph things, but marginalism is also opening up [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2111.2s)]
*  to the possibility of calculus [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2114.44s)]
*  and the possibility of creating models. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2116.3799999999997s)]
*  But at that point in time, late 19th century, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2118.04s)]
*  a model is something like a physicist does. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2121.12s)]
*  Like think of like an inclined plane [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2123.84s)]
*  and how fast does the ball roll from one to the other? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2125.48s)]
*  It's a physical representation of the world. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2127.54s)]
*  And eventually economists will start to create [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2130.04s)]
*  mathematical representations of the world. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2132.16s)]
*  But we're not quite there yet. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2134.8s)]
*  So we're late 19th century, we have this fissure, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2135.92s)]
*  we have this introduction of marginal analysis [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2139.16s)]
*  that marks the juncture from classical economics [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2141.58s)]
*  to economics. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2144.52s)]
*  So let's say now we have economics, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2145.9s)]
*  but we still have this fissure between historical thinking [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2148.1s)]
*  and let's call it natural law thinking. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2151.14s)]
*  That's not quite right, but physical laws versus contingency. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2154.78s)]
*  And then in the United States, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2160.5s)]
*  this ends up mapping onto debates about capitalism. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2161.7400000000002s)]
*  And so more historically minded economists [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2165.14s)]
*  tend to be interested in the progressive movement, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2169.7000000000003s)]
*  which is invested in taming and regulating [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2172.66s)]
*  industrial capitalism and changing its excesses. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2176.86s)]
*  Factory safety laws, wage laws, working conditions laws. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2180.94s)]
*  Yet in general, American economists [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2186.58s)]
*  all use marginal analysis just in different ways. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2189.64s)]
*  The ones who are more drawn to marginal analysis [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2192.9s)]
*  become known as neoclassical economists. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2195.66s)]
*  They're neoclassical, the neo is because they're using [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2198.9s)]
*  marginal analysis, the classical is because [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2201.86s)]
*  they don't think we need to change the way [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2204.5s)]
*  the economy operates or the government operates. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2207.06s)]
*  They're not progressive. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2208.86s)]
*  Whereas the progressives are saying things like [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2209.9s)]
*  the we need to use social control. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2212.8s)]
*  The state and the people collectively and democratically [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2217.1400000000003s)]
*  need to control the way economics unfolds [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2219.6200000000003s)]
*  and make sure things are fair and equal. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2224.56s)]
*  So that school of thought becomes known [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2226.86s)]
*  as institutional economics in the United States [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2229.94s)]
*  by the 20th century. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2232.78s)]
*  So it's part of the progressive movement, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2234.2200000000003s)]
*  late 19th century into the 20th century, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2236.0600000000004s)]
*  it really becomes institutional economics. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2238.6600000000003s)]
*  And it's quite dominant and the neoclassical economists [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2241.0600000000004s)]
*  are still there, but they're very much a minority. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2244.02s)]
*  And Frank Knight, Milton Friedman's teacher [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2246.7400000000002s)]
*  is one of the minority neoclassical economists [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2249.5800000000004s)]
*  and the institutionalists are much more progressive still. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2252.98s)]
*  Is it fair to say that the neoclassical folks [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2258.3s)]
*  and even the classical folks versus the institutional [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2261.38s)]
*  economics folks, they have a disagreement [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2264.18s)]
*  about how much government intervention [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2267.7s)]
*  that should be in the economy. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2269.78s)]
*  So neoclassical is less intervention [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2271.42s)]
*  and then institutional economists, the progressive folks, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2274.46s)]
*  has more intervention. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2277.66s)]
*  Yes, yes, exactly right. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2278.62s)]
*  So this is the situation in the 1920s, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2280.54s)]
*  but the other piece I should mention [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2284.86s)]
*  is the first generation of progressive economists [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2288.2200000000003s)]
*  were very radical. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2291.1800000000003s)]
*  They were closely allied with the socialist movement, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2292.78s)]
*  with labor radicalism, and many of them lost their jobs [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2295.94s)]
*  at universities. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2299.6200000000003s)]
*  This is kind of connects to the early, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2300.7000000000003s)]
*  the dawn of academic freedom. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2302.38s)]
*  This is before academic freedom. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2303.6600000000003s)]
*  And they became, they were chastened. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2305.58s)]
*  They became much more mainstream. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2307.98s)]
*  By the time we get to the 1920s, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2309.98s)]
*  we don't really have radical critiques [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2311.54s)]
*  of society coming from economists. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2314.02s)]
*  Much smaller profession, much less important [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2316.42s)]
*  than it is today, and fairly peaceful [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2319.38s)]
*  because the 1920s are a fairly peaceful decade [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2323.82s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2326.46s)]
*  So this is a situation when the Great Depression hits. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2327.74s)]
*  And as I mentioned before, the head, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2331.34s)]
*  the kind of most important institutional economist [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2334.94s)]
*  is Wesley Mitchell. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2337.14s)]
*  And he has said, he's written a whole book [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2338.9s)]
*  on business cycles, but he doesn't see [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2342.74s)]
*  this business cycle coming and it hits [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2345.4199999999996s)]
*  and he doesn't have a good explanation for it. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2347.22s)]
*  Now, perhaps the preeminent neoclassical economist [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2349.18s)]
*  was Irving Fisher. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2351.66s)]
*  Now Irving Fisher is big into the stock market [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2353.9399999999996s)]
*  and Irving Fisher says sometime in late summer, 1929, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2356.4599999999996s)]
*  stocks are going ever higher [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2360.7s)]
*  and will continue to go ever higher forever. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2363.8999999999996s)]
*  And so he loses his reputation after the stock market crash. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2366.8599999999997s)]
*  So Milton Friedman is stepping into a field [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2371.1800000000003s)]
*  in which the greats have been discredited [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2373.46s)]
*  and there's an enormous economic crisis all around. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2375.5400000000004s)]
*  And everybody's struggling to figure out [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2378.2200000000003s)]
*  why the crisis happened. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2380.5s)]
*  Yes, and the other thing he's stepping into [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2382.02s)]
*  is a world where in the United States, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2384.1400000000003s)]
*  there's a great deal of anger at capitalism, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2387.1400000000003s)]
*  at the system, unemployed people on the street. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2390.86s)]
*  In Europe, there's rising fascist movements. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2393.34s)]
*  In Asia, there's rising fascist movements. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2396.5s)]
*  And so everyone's very concerned about this. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2399.06s)]
*  And Friedman is seeing a lot of this [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2402.3s)]
*  through the lens of Frank Knight, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2404.54s)]
*  who feels like we are maybe reaching the end [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2406.1s)]
*  of what he calls liberalism. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2409.2599999999998s)]
*  He calls himself an old fashioned liberalism. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2411.06s)]
*  We're reaching the end of representative [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2412.82s)]
*  democratic government because representative [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2414.74s)]
*  democratic government cannot solve these social problems. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2416.82s)]
*  And capitalism as it has developed, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2420.58s)]
*  Knight is very pro-capitalist, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2424.58s)]
*  but he says it's generating inequality [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2426.14s)]
*  and this is putting too many strains on the system. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2428.38s)]
*  So Knight will become one of the people [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2431.2200000000003s)]
*  who helps Friedman think, how do I develop [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2434.1800000000003s)]
*  a new theory of capitalism that works [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2437.2200000000003s)]
*  in an era of mass democracy, where people can vote [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2441.2200000000003s)]
*  and people can express at the ballot box [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2445.2200000000003s)]
*  their unhappiness with what's happening economically. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2447.34s)]
*  And so this larger movement will generate [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2450.7000000000003s)]
*  of which F.A. Hayek is a part, Friedman is a part, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2452.9s)]
*  and that becomes the very early stirrings [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2457.34s)]
*  of trying to think about a new sort of liberalism, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2459.46s)]
*  which will eventually be called neoliberalism. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2462.86s)]
*  Okay, so if we can just linger on the definitions of things. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2465.26s)]
*  So we mentioned what neoclassical is [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2468.5s)]
*  and the institutional economics is. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2471.46s)]
*  What's Kenzian economics? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2474.26s)]
*  And the Chicago School of Economics, I guess, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2476.7400000000002s)]
*  is a branch of neoclassical that's a little bit more [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2480.06s)]
*  empirical versus maybe model-based. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2482.82s)]
*  And Kenzian is very model-heavy, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2486.8199999999997s)]
*  more intervention of government. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2489.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2491.5s)]
*  So the real battle is Kenzian versus everybody else. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2492.58s)]
*  That is what eventually comes to pass in the United States [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2496.66s)]
*  and in the kind of overall developed, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2499.7799999999997s)]
*  in the kind of developed profession of economics. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2502.7799999999997s)]
*  The other piece of the puzzle here [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2505.22s)]
*  is the introduction of mathematics. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2506.5s)]
*  And it's been around the edges, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2508.3399999999997s)]
*  but it will pick up speed in the 1930s, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2510.58s)]
*  like the econometrics society is founded, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2513.58s)]
*  they start publishing. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2517.34s)]
*  People start using more statistical [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2518.18s)]
*  and mathematical tools to think about economics. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2521.14s)]
*  And they're given a boost sort of inadvertently [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2524.38s)]
*  by the rise of Kenzian economics. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2526.34s)]
*  So Kenz is trained in the neoclassical tradition. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2528.42s)]
*  He's an absolutely fascinating figure. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2533.34s)]
*  He's been there in peace negotiations at Versailles. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2535.54s)]
*  He basically calls World War II. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2538.7s)]
*  He's like, hey, we're gonna have another war here [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2540.98s)]
*  caused by Germany because this peace treaty [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2544.18s)]
*  has been done in such a vindictive way. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2547.46s)]
*  And people have made such bad decisions. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2549.3s)]
*  He's there, he sees it happening. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2550.86s)]
*  And so when the Great Depression unfolds, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2552.54s)]
*  he basically comes up with a new theory [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2556.38s)]
*  for explaining what's going on. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2558.9s)]
*  And the previous neoclassical understanding [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2560.74s)]
*  is sort of things go up and things go down. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2564.22s)]
*  And when they go down, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2567.06s)]
*  there's a natural mechanism to bring them back up. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2568.02s)]
*  So when the economy is going down, prices are going down, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2570.26s)]
*  wages are going down, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2573.5s)]
*  everybody's losing money, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2575.54s)]
*  but eventually firms are going to realize, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2576.7s)]
*  hey, I can hire people cheap. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2579.54s)]
*  Hey, I can buy stuff cheap. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2581.7s)]
*  I don't have a lot of competition. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2583.74s)]
*  Maybe I should get in the game here. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2584.94s)]
*  And then others will start to get in [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2586.38s)]
*  and then you regenerate prosperity in that way. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2587.62s)]
*  And so Kenz says, sure, that's one theory, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2590.14s)]
*  but something different is happening right now. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2594.9s)]
*  Part of why it's happening is because we have, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2597.2599999999998s)]
*  the working class is more empowered now. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2601.2599999999998s)]
*  They're not simply gonna just take low wages [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2603.34s)]
*  and ride them down to the floor. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2605.82s)]
*  We might not hit the floor. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2607.02s)]
*  But also he says people might become too anxious to spend. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2608.5s)]
*  They might not want to invest. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2615.42s)]
*  And, you know, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2617.82s)]
*  Kenz has these discussions of animal spirits, right? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2618.82s)]
*  He's still enough of a political economist to think, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2621.86s)]
*  not just in terms of human rationality, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2625.46s)]
*  but what are some other things going on in human beings? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2627.3s)]
*  And people might decide to sit on their money. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2629.58s)]
*  They might not invest it. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2632.42s)]
*  And so what happens then is you could get stuck [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2634.02s)]
*  in a bad equilibrium. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2637.46s)]
*  So in the neoclassical model of equilibrium [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2639.54s)]
*  kind of restarts and resets itself. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2641.98s)]
*  And he says, no, we could get stuck here. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2643.86s)]
*  We could get stuck in the depression. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2645.34s)]
*  And in that case, what has to happen, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2646.78s)]
*  he says the government stimulates investment [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2649.54s)]
*  and the government itself invests. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2652.62s)]
*  And then he argues that, you know, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2655.2200000000003s)]
*  this is a student of his, Richard Kahn says, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2657.3s)]
*  you know, as the government invests a dollar, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2659.2200000000003s)]
*  it has like a multiplier effect. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2661.18s)]
*  A dollar spent by the government kind of ramifies out [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2662.94s)]
*  throughout the economy. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2665.3399999999997s)]
*  So it takes the government and puts it in this center, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2666.54s)]
*  as opposed to say the banking system [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2670.5s)]
*  or the financial system, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2672.2599999999998s)]
*  which would be the more Friedman analysis. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2673.3399999999997s)]
*  And for many economists of Friedman's generation, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2675.2999999999997s)]
*  and he's a weird generation, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2679.3399999999997s)]
*  because the generation that becomes dominant [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2680.46s)]
*  is just like four years older, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2683.4199999999996s)]
*  the men who become Keynesian economics, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2685.62s)]
*  but that four years is really important [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2687.22s)]
*  because they come in to graduate school in economics [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2688.9s)]
*  and they get exposed to the new ideas of John Maynard Keynes. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2691.6600000000003s)]
*  And they, you know, I think it's Paul Samuelson calls it, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2694.62s)]
*  like it was like a South Sea virus [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2698.38s)]
*  that attacked all of the younger economists [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2700.58s)]
*  immediately succumbed and like no one under 50 [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2704.94s)]
*  ever got the disease, right? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2707.82s)]
*  Cause their thinking's already set. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2709.1s)]
*  And so Keynesianism, Keynes himself is very suspicious [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2710.7000000000003s)]
*  of math and economics. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2716.46s)]
*  And he and Friedman is fascinating. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2718.54s)]
*  One of the first books by Jan Tingerman, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2720.2999999999997s)]
*  a Dutch economist to use math and economics, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2722.98s)]
*  he used huge volumes. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2725.8599999999997s)]
*  Volume one, Keynes pans it. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2727.46s)]
*  Volume two, Friedman pans it. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2730.98s)]
*  So they're in the same page, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2733.1s)]
*  but what happens is as Keynesianism arrives [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2734.5s)]
*  in the United States, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2737.3399999999997s)]
*  Franklin Roosevelt is not really a Keynesian, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2738.8599999999997s)]
*  he's kind of an accidental or experimental Keynesian. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2742.06s)]
*  And there's a bunch of different ideas [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2746.26s)]
*  in the United States that are very similar to Keynesianism. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2748.26s)]
*  They're not theorized, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2751.7000000000003s)]
*  but they're similar ideas [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2752.6200000000003s)]
*  that the government has to do something. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2753.6600000000003s)]
*  So this all comes together [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2755.46s)]
*  and American economists realize [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2756.86s)]
*  that you can construct models in the Keynesian perspective. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2760.1000000000004s)]
*  And if you can use numbers in these models, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2765.5800000000004s)]
*  you can go to Washington DC with numbers. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2770.1400000000003s)]
*  And you seem like you have a lot more authority. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2773.7s)]
*  And so math becomes really twinned into Keynesian economics. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2777.98s)]
*  So the numbers are used as a kind of a symbol of expertise. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2784.2599999999998s)]
*  We really know what the hell is going on [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2789.5s)]
*  because we have some numbers, right? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2791.5s)]
*  Right, and we can create a model. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2792.8199999999997s)]
*  And so we can say, okay, in the model, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2794.3399999999997s)]
*  the interest rate is here and taxes are here. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2796.22s)]
*  So let's play with government spending. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2798.5s)]
*  Let's make it up, let's make it down. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2800.54s)]
*  And then we can get an estimation. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2802.02s)]
*  And it'll spit out, here's predicted GDP. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2804.38s)]
*  So the other piece of the Keynesian revolution [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2806.38s)]
*  is it really gets people thinking kind of holistically [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2809.3s)]
*  about the economy as one conceptual unit. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2812.94s)]
*  And you then have what Paul Samuelson [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2818.22s)]
*  will end up calling the neoclassical synthesis. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2822.7799999999997s)]
*  And this was still in economics today. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2825.1s)]
*  If you take micro, you're gonna get supply and demand, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2826.86s)]
*  scarcity, marginal analysis. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2830.5s)]
*  If you take macro, you're gonna get [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2832.42s)]
*  a very different approach and that's more Keynesian based. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2834.26s)]
*  And so the idea is that, and this makes sense. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2838.02s)]
*  I mean, you can think of this from statistics, right? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2840.78s)]
*  The way things act individually versus [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2842.58s)]
*  when they're all added together can be very different. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2845.62s)]
*  So there's this kind of uneasy piece [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2847.78s)]
*  where economists are using kind of neoclassical tools [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2850.38s)]
*  to analyze individual behavior [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2854.66s)]
*  and individual market behavior. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2856.5s)]
*  And they're shifting to a different paradigm [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2857.78s)]
*  when they think about the economy as a whole. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2859.34s)]
*  And in this paradigm of the economy as a whole, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2861.1s)]
*  the federal budget, the taxing and spending power [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2863.94s)]
*  of the federal government become paramount. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2866.7799999999997s)]
*  And that is called the fiscal revolution. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2869.2999999999997s)]
*  And that's really the essence of Keynesianism. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2871.66s)]
*  But the key thing to remember is that Keynesianism [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2874.38s)]
*  and Keynes are different. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2879.2999999999997s)]
*  And there's this famous episode where John Maynard Keynes [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2881.2599999999998s)]
*  comes to DC and he goes to dinner and he comes back [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2884.06s)]
*  and he says to one of his friends in London, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2887.96s)]
*  so yeah, it was really interesting. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2889.58s)]
*  I was the only non-Keynesian there. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2891.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2894.94s)]
*  So Keynesianism is more government intervention, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2896.74s)]
*  fiscal policy, so put the government at the center [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2900.86s)]
*  of influencing the economy. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2905.66s)]
*  And then the different flavors of whether it's [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2908.08s)]
*  Austrian economics or Chicago School of Economics [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2911.2599999999998s)]
*  is saying no, we have to put less government intervention [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2914.7s)]
*  and trust the market more. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2919.02s)]
*  And the formulation of that from Milton Friedman [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2921.94s)]
*  is trust the money more, not trust, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2924.38s)]
*  but the money supply is the thing [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2928.22s)]
*  that should be focused on. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2930.58s)]
*  Yes, so the Austrians and the Chicago Schools [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2932.34s)]
*  see economic prosperity and growth [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2936.02s)]
*  comes from individual initiative, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2939.88s)]
*  individual entrepreneurship, kind of private sources. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2942.64s)]
*  The private market is what drives economic growth, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2945.34s)]
*  not the public sector. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2947.56s)]
*  And so for Friedman then, the question is, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2949.48s)]
*  what is a government's role? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2952.48s)]
*  And because he's lived through the Great Depression, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2954.36s)]
*  he's not laissez faire and he won't ever be laissez faire. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2957.36s)]
*  Now interestingly, Hayek living through the Great Depression [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2960.92s)]
*  at first is laissez faire and he's like, sure, let it rip. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2964.52s)]
*  And things get so bad that Hayek's like, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2969.32s)]
*  okay, that's not gonna work. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2972.16s)]
*  Can we actually define laissez faire? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2973.6s)]
*  So what do we mean, what's the free market, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2975.12s)]
*  what's laissez faire, what's the extreme version here? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2977.7599999999998s)]
*  So yeah, laissez faire means leave a be in France. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2980.04s)]
*  It's more often used as an insult than as an actual. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2983.6s)]
*  Very few people are completely and totally laissez faire. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2988.24s)]
*  That would be like the pure laissez faire [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2991.44s)]
*  would be the sort of pure, maybe pure anarchist position, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2993.52s)]
*  like the state does nothing or the state isn't even there. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=2996.7999999999997s)]
*  But it tends to, if I could maybe make it more precise, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3000.44s)]
*  it would be focused on freedom of contract, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3004.2999999999997s)]
*  would be essential. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3006.86s)]
*  And that means like the buyer of labor [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3008.2200000000003s)]
*  and the seller of labor must have absolute freedom [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3013.1s)]
*  to contract. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3016.38s)]
*  So that means no minimum wage law, no working hours law, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3017.6200000000003s)]
*  no employment law, things like that. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3022.5s)]
*  That was, and this is all pre-progressive movement. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3024.7000000000003s)]
*  A lot of things are that way, right? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3027.7400000000002s)]
*  You imagine you're in 19th century America [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3029.2200000000003s)]
*  and you have a farm and you hire someone [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3032.1800000000003s)]
*  to help you on the farm. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3033.78s)]
*  You offer the money, they take it. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3035.26s)]
*  If they fall off a ladder and break their back, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3037.78s)]
*  maybe you help them out, maybe you don't, right? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3040.1600000000003s)]
*  But there's not a whole apparatus of legal liability [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3041.7400000000002s)]
*  and safety and things like that. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3044.6600000000003s)]
*  So that would be one piece. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3047.1400000000003s)]
*  Another piece of laissez faire [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3048.2000000000003s)]
*  would be free trade amongst nations. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3049.98s)]
*  So no regulation of who can invest in a nation [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3054.5s)]
*  or who can take money out of a nation. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3058.42s)]
*  So Nippon Steel could come and invest in US Steel [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3061.1400000000003s)]
*  and there would be no grounds in which to reject that. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3064.7s)]
*  Or you could, as a billionaire in the United States, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3068.06s)]
*  relocate you and all your money to another country [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3071.62s)]
*  and the United States couldn't try to keep you [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3074.3399999999997s)]
*  and nobody else could stop you from coming in. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3076.2599999999998s)]
*  And so, and then in the context of economic crisis, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3080.14s)]
*  laissez faire would not encompass centrally provided relief [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3084.2999999999997s)]
*  because in the pure theory, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3089.82s)]
*  again, very seldom applied purely, but in the pure theory, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3093.46s)]
*  the wages need to come down far enough [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3098.1000000000004s)]
*  and people need to be desperate enough [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3100.32s)]
*  to start taking work and to start the machine again. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3102.54s)]
*  So the theory would be if you give people relief, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3106.6600000000003s)]
*  they might not go back to work. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3109.54s)]
*  Now, almost nobody says that in the Great Depression [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3111.34s)]
*  because the situation is so bad and it's, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3114.86s)]
*  you know, people are starving on the street [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3118.86s)]
*  and people feel for humanitarian ethical reasons, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3120.46s)]
*  it's not okay to say that. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3123.7400000000002s)]
*  The Austrians though, at first, Hayek and Lionel Robbins [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3125.38s)]
*  are like, this is a business cycle [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3128.76s)]
*  and it needs to run its course [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3130.26s)]
*  and it will be detrimental if we intervene. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3131.82s)]
*  And then pretty soon, Hayek has to change his tune. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3134.56s)]
*  So the Austrians are the most hardcore [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3137.98s)]
*  in terms of laissez faire. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3140.18s)]
*  Absolutely, and so Hayek will make the turn [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3141.3s)]
*  towards accepting more of a state [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3144.86s)]
*  and then we'll come to talk about how the state needs [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3147.1s)]
*  to support what he calls a competitive order. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3150.22s)]
*  But his mentor, Ludwig von Mises, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3153.3399999999997s)]
*  still remains very hardcore and is not really open [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3156.46s)]
*  to things like unemployment insurance [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3160.46s)]
*  or other state-based interventions. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3162.9s)]
*  What does von Mises say about like human suffering [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3166.3399999999997s)]
*  that's witnessed in the Great Depression, for example? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3169.36s)]
*  Like what are we supposed to, as economists, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3171.66s)]
*  as humans that define policy, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3174.62s)]
*  what are we supposed to see [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3177.48s)]
*  when people are like suffering at scale? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3178.4s)]
*  Yeah, I wish I knew and answer that question. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3181.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't know enough about von Mises [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3183.76s)]
*  and his reaction in the Great Depression. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3186.4s)]
*  I think I would hazard that he would look more [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3188.8s)]
*  to the down the road and say, well, if you start here, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3194.76s)]
*  you're gonna go places that are bad. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3198.36s)]
*  But I don't factually know what he said in response. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3200.98s)]
*  I do know that Hayek's position doesn't last very long. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3205.12s)]
*  It's not a position you can hold to. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3208.16s)]
*  Maybe you could hold to it in other cycles. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3210.44s)]
*  The other thing that was interesting [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3213.3199999999997s)]
*  is I found very few Americans saying this. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3215.3199999999997s)]
*  Most who were were kind of small town electeds [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3220.12s)]
*  or the most famous is Andrew Mellon, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3223.8399999999997s)]
*  quoted by Herbert Hoover. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3227.0s)]
*  So not directly, we don't have him on record saying this, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3228.3199999999997s)]
*  but apparently Hoover records in his memoirs [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3232.36s)]
*  that Mellon said something like liquidate real estate, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3235.08s)]
*  liquidate stocks, purge the rottenness out of the system. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3240.28s)]
*  People will live a healthier life. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3244.0s)]
*  And certainly they were members of the Federal Reserve [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3246.6800000000003s)]
*  who felt like it would create, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3249.92s)]
*  they didn't say moral hazard, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3252.88s)]
*  but it would create what we now call moral hazard, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3254.1600000000003s)]
*  bad habits, where we to intervene and to save failing banks [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3256.2200000000003s)]
*  because failing banks need to be taught a lesson. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3259.72s)]
*  They need to be taught discipline. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3262.8399999999997s)]
*  And so a lot of people, I think, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3264.3599999999997s)]
*  saw it in the context of discipline. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3265.56s)]
*  This is discipline. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3267.68s)]
*  And if you remove the discipline, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3269.2799999999997s)]
*  you'll be taking away something fundamental in society. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3272.16s)]
*  So Milton Friedman never quite went [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3274.8399999999997s)]
*  all the way to laissez faire. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3276.8799999999997s)]
*  No, no, he didn't see that. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3278.3599999999997s)]
*  And what's really interesting is [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3280.08s)]
*  the number of incredibly radical proposals [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3282.72s)]
*  that he and his teachers were floating. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3284.8399999999997s)]
*  So I've mentioned Frank Knight, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3287.4399999999996s)]
*  another really important influence on Friedman [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3289.4s)]
*  was Henry Simons, who was a junior professor at Chicago. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3292.28s)]
*  And Simons had this idea for what he called 100% money, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3297.28s)]
*  which would be a law that says banks have to hold [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3302.36s)]
*  100% of the deposits they receive. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3306.6400000000003s)]
*  They can't loan them out on the margin. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3308.84s)]
*  So this would completely and totally [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3311.1200000000003s)]
*  have overhauled the US banking system. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3312.96s)]
*  And he would have said, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3314.6400000000003s)]
*  there's a category of things called banks [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3315.88s)]
*  where you get deposits, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3317.5s)]
*  and then there's gonna be a category of sort of, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3318.48s)]
*  he didn't say investment banks, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3320.52s)]
*  but investment vehicles that will invest. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3321.72s)]
*  So similar to what did happen in some ways [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3324.04s)]
*  in the banking reforms in that, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3327.04s)]
*  in the 1930s, the investment banks were split [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3329.28s)]
*  from the deposit banks, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3332.92s)]
*  and the banks that took deposits [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3334.48s)]
*  were much more highly regulated [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3336.12s)]
*  and they were supported by the FDIC. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3337.36s)]
*  But the point being the Chicago school [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3339.04s)]
*  had these very radical proposals for reform, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3341.56s)]
*  go off the gold standard, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3344.4s)]
*  restrict the currency, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3346.6s)]
*  change the banks, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3348.28s)]
*  immediately relief payments now. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3350.0800000000004s)]
*  What is important to note though, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3352.76s)]
*  is that they thought of all of those [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3355.36s)]
*  as emergency measures to get through the emergency, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3357.2400000000002s)]
*  not as permanent alterations in the state [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3360.7400000000002s)]
*  of what had to be and not permanent alterations [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3364.0s)]
*  between state and market. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3367.76s)]
*  Where the Keynesian assumption is things have changed, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3369.46s)]
*  times have changed, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3372.2000000000003s)]
*  we're in a new dispensation [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3373.32s)]
*  and we need a new relationship. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3375.0400000000004s)]
*  So Friedman is very, Milton Friedman is very open [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3377.0s)]
*  to doing things differently in a state of emergency. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3381.56s)]
*  He will have different ideas during World War II [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3385.3s)]
*  than any other time. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3388.56s)]
*  And that's why I argue, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3389.7s)]
*  I think he would have been supportive [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3390.58s)]
*  of at least the first rounds of coronavirus relief, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3392.88s)]
*  because I think he would have put [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3395.66s)]
*  his emergency thinking hat on. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3397.0s)]
*  So in that way, he was definitely more flexible. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3399.44s)]
*  You mentioned Hayek, who is this guy? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3403.44s)]
*  What's his relationship to Milton Friedman [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3406.84s)]
*  in the space of ideas [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3409.44s)]
*  and in the context of the Great Depression? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3411.16s)]
*  Can we talk about that a little bit? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3413.48s)]
*  Sure, so F. A. Hayek is an Austrian economist [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3415.04s)]
*  who takes up a posting in London [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3419.0s)]
*  and he's a mentee of Ludwig von Mises. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3421.84s)]
*  He's writing about business cycles, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3428.2000000000003s)]
*  Austrian capital theory [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3430.88s)]
*  and the depression hits [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3433.0s)]
*  and he's one of the few economists [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3434.32s)]
*  who in the beginning really is not calling [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3438.0s)]
*  for much intervention. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3440.16s)]
*  Although as he realizes how politically unpalatable that is, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3441.36s)]
*  he will develop a more softened version [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3445.4s)]
*  of Austrian economics that has room [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3447.36s)]
*  for a whole range of social services. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3449.84s)]
*  What's significant about Hayek [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3452.08s)]
*  is that he is also watching what's happening in Austria, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3453.84s)]
*  what's happening in Germany, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3456.72s)]
*  and he's really worried the same thing is going to happen [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3458.32s)]
*  to the Western democracies. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3462.16s)]
*  And he sees the root cause of this is socialism, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3463.72s)]
*  the shift towards an expanded role for government, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3467.2s)]
*  which we've been talking about [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3469.72s)]
*  is happening in the United States, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3470.7999999999997s)]
*  it's also happening in Britain. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3472.04s)]
*  And so he writes this book that becomes incredibly famous, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3474.04s)]
*  The Road to Serfdom, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3477.2799999999997s)]
*  basically saying taking these steps [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3479.04s)]
*  towards a planned economy [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3481.48s)]
*  or an economy that's a modified form of capitalism [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3483.3999999999996s)]
*  is going to, could, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3486.04s)]
*  he's very clear that this is not an inevitability, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3488.0s)]
*  but if the same steps are taken [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3490.2s)]
*  and people follow the same line of thinking, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3492.84s)]
*  we may end up in a sort of coercive totalitarian state. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3494.08s)]
*  So this becomes enormously popular in the United States. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3498.2s)]
*  First of all, he's in good touch with Friedman's teachers, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3502.12s)]
*  even before this book comes out. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3505.24s)]
*  They see them as kindred spirits, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3507.08s)]
*  Frank Knight is in touch with him, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3508.88s)]
*  Henry Simons is in touch with him. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3510.16s)]
*  They all see themselves as liberals, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3512.08s)]
*  they call themselves old fashioned, unreconstructed liberals. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3513.64s)]
*  And so even before he becomes famous, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3517.2s)]
*  Hayek will be trying to kind of organize thinkers [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3519.28s)]
*  and intellectuals who he believes shares his values [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3523.0400000000004s)]
*  of what we would call today classical liberalism [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3527.0400000000004s)]
*  and to kind of create a counter consensus [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3529.52s)]
*  to the one that's gathering. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3531.92s)]
*  Now, Hayek also chooses not to argue against Keynes, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3533.6000000000004s)]
*  and he feels that this is a huge missed opportunity [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3538.44s)]
*  that he should have staked out the case against Keynes [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3541.48s)]
*  and that because he did not, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3544.2000000000003s)]
*  people come to believe there is no case against Keynes. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3546.2400000000002s)]
*  And Keynes is literally unanswerable. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3549.36s)]
*  So Hayek will have this great regret. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3551.0s)]
*  He will channel some of his regrets [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3554.0s)]
*  into sort of community building, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3555.88s)]
*  specifically developing the Mont Pelerin Society. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3558.1600000000003s)]
*  And it will fall to Friedman [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3562.4s)]
*  to really make that case against Keynes. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3564.28s)]
*  But Hayek will end up at Chicago [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3568.32s)]
*  and Hayek really influences Friedman to think about [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3570.7200000000003s)]
*  what Hayek calls the competitive order [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3574.4s)]
*  and how the state can and must maintain [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3577.28s)]
*  the competitive order. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3582.0s)]
*  That is the system of laws, of norms, of practices [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3583.6800000000003s)]
*  that makes it possible for markets to function. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3588.12s)]
*  And this is one of these key differentiators [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3591.04s)]
*  between the older philosophy of laissez-faire [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3593.36s)]
*  and the newer reconceptualization of liberalism, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3596.88s)]
*  which says, yes, we need a state. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3600.28s)]
*  We need a state that's not intervening in markets [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3603.12s)]
*  under social democratic auspices, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3606.96s)]
*  but is structuring and supporting markets [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3608.7999999999997s)]
*  so that they can function with maximum freedom, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3611.56s)]
*  keeping in mind that if there aren't [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3615.2s)]
*  basic social supports needed, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3617.72s)]
*  the market is apt to generate the type of either inequality [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3620.04s)]
*  or social instability [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3623.7999999999997s)]
*  that will call the whole system into question. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3625.64s)]
*  So Hayek is really key in promoting this modified liberalism. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3628.16s)]
*  But from being a very prominent economist [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3632.3599999999997s)]
*  in the 1920s and 1930s, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3635.44s)]
*  as mathematics becomes the language of economics, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3637.3199999999997s)]
*  Hayek is completely left out in the cold. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3642.3199999999997s)]
*  Now, Friedman to some degree is left out in the cold, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3644.56s)]
*  but Friedman at least has proved the mathematical economists [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3646.92s)]
*  that he knows what they're up to [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3650.72s)]
*  and he's rejecting it from a position [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3652.04s)]
*  of expertise and knowledge. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3654.3199999999997s)]
*  And he literally drives the mathematical economists [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3656.48s)]
*  out of Chicago. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3659.96s)]
*  They're clustered in a group called the Coles Commission [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3660.8s)]
*  and he makes their life hell. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3663.1600000000003s)]
*  They flee, they flee the Friedman onslaught. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3665.1600000000003s)]
*  But then when Hayek arrives at the University of Chicago, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3670.0800000000004s)]
*  he would like to be considered for a position [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3673.7200000000003s)]
*  in the economics department. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3675.6400000000003s)]
*  And Milton Friedman says, no way, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3676.88s)]
*  you're not really an economist because you're not empirical, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3679.28s)]
*  because you just developed these theories. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3682.32s)]
*  So he has an appreciation for Hayek as a social thinker, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3684.92s)]
*  but not as an economist. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3690.12s)]
*  So what Friedman decides to do, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3691.36s)]
*  his answer to Keynes will be deeply empirical, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3693.2000000000003s)]
*  but it will also be theoretical [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3696.8s)]
*  and it will create an alternative intellectual world [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3698.4s)]
*  and approach for economists who aren't satisfied [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3702.6s)]
*  with Keynesianism. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3706.0s)]
*  And almost single-handedly, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3707.16s)]
*  Friedman will introduce sort of political [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3709.56s)]
*  and ideological diversity into the field of economics, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3712.64s)]
*  because from his beachhead in Chicago, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3716.04s)]
*  he will develop the theory of monetarism. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3718.6s)]
*  So what is monetarism? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3722.2s)]
*  The easy way to summarize it [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3723.7599999999998s)]
*  is this famous dictum of Milton Friedman's. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3727.2s)]
*  Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3730.2s)]
*  And it's fascinating that he becomes an expert [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3734.48s)]
*  in inflation because the first research [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3738.24s)]
*  and the first major research product of monetarism [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3741.64s)]
*  is that theory of the Great Depression [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3745.36s)]
*  in a monetary history of the United States. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3747.18s)]
*  And that is the theory of a deflation, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3748.7799999999997s)]
*  all prices going down. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3750.98s)]
*  And he will go back to an idea [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3753.02s)]
*  that Irving Fisher had popularized, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3756.22s)]
*  but a very old idea, almost a truism, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3758.58s)]
*  the quantity theory of money, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3760.8999999999996s)]
*  which says the price level is related [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3763.1s)]
*  to the amount of money circulating in an economy. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3765.8599999999997s)]
*  So if you have more money, prices go up. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3769.68s)]
*  If you have less money, prices go down. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3771.3399999999997s)]
*  Now, this seems like very basic [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3773.68s)]
*  and almost too basic to bear repeating, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3775.68s)]
*  but Friedman is saying this very basic relationship [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3778.8999999999996s)]
*  holds true even in an advanced industrial economy. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3782.08s)]
*  And that is what people have started to doubt. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3786.12s)]
*  And if you think about money, you think about banks, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3789.68s)]
*  you don't think necessarily about the federal budget, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3792.8399999999997s)]
*  spending and taxation. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3796.24s)]
*  And what you see happens in American economics, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3797.7999999999997s)]
*  the textbooks previous to the Keynesian Revolution, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3801.04s)]
*  they spent a lot of time on money. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3804.36s)]
*  They spent a lot of time on interest rates. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3805.6s)]
*  You can do word counts [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3807.28s)]
*  and other scholars have done the word counts. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3808.72s)]
*  And then word count for money after World War II [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3811.38s)]
*  just plummets and you start seeing things [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3813.92s)]
*  like taxation, budget, those things go up. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3816.44s)]
*  So what happens is the economics profession [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3819.7599999999998s)]
*  shifts its attention. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3823.48s)]
*  It just looks away from money to other things. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3824.6s)]
*  And Friedman is one of the few who's saying, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3827.8s)]
*  no, money still matters, money still counts. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3829.48s)]
*  And it's a very counterintuitive argument to make. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3834.1800000000003s)]
*  It's a very historical argument to make. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3837.5s)]
*  And this is absolutely fascinating to me. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3839.6600000000003s)]
*  With Anna Schwartz, he develops this 150 year timeframe. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3842.42s)]
*  He also has students working on episodes of hyperinflation [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3846.9s)]
*  in different periods of time. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3850.82s)]
*  He's also looking back to like ancient history, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3852.1400000000003s)]
*  inflationary episodes there. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3855.3s)]
*  And he's saying this is a law of economics. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3856.98s)]
*  This is something that recurs throughout time. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3860.96s)]
*  It's not historical, right? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3862.98s)]
*  It's not contingent. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3864.26s)]
*  It's a law of economics. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3865.62s)]
*  And his Keynesian counterpoints are saying, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3867.34s)]
*  no, that's not relevant any longer. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3871.96s)]
*  Maybe once it was relevant, but it's not relevant today. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3873.98s)]
*  Now, in some ways they have a point [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3876.94s)]
*  because in order to pay for World War II, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3879.3s)]
*  the federal government sells a lot of bonds. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3884.08s)]
*  It issues a lot of debt. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3887.46s)]
*  And it wants to pay this debt back at a low interest rate [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3889.5s)]
*  and it wants people to keep buying it. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3893.7s)]
*  It wants the low interest rate to be competitive [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3896.14s)]
*  with other interest rates. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3899.36s)]
*  So once in general, low interest rates throughout [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3900.42s)]
*  the economy and the Federal Reserve has been so discredited [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3902.7s)]
*  by the Great Depression that the Treasury basically runs [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3906.78s)]
*  a Federal Reserve and says, keep interest rates low. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3910.06s)]
*  And so that's what it's doing. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3913.64s)]
*  And so the Federal Reserve has stopped [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3915.06s)]
*  being an independent entity. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3917.1s)]
*  It's just a sub sort of Department of the Treasury. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3919.6600000000003s)]
*  But in 1951, they negotiate what's called [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3922.2200000000003s)]
*  the Treasury Fed Accord. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3925.38s)]
*  And the Federal Reserve gets its independence, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3927.54s)]
*  but it doesn't really use it. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3931.1400000000003s)]
*  But statutorily, it now has it. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3932.82s)]
*  And so most economists are just observing [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3935.38s)]
*  a regime in which the Federal Reserve has no power, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3939.34s)]
*  a regime in which there is really little inflation. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3941.9s)]
*  The inflation that is seen is post, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3944.34s)]
*  there's a little burst of inflation in the Korean War. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3946.66s)]
*  And they're saying inflation's not really important. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3949.14s)]
*  It's not really relevant and money's not really relevant [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3951.5s)]
*  and important. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3953.94s)]
*  And so to break through and to make the argument, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3954.7799999999997s)]
*  that's why Friedman and Schwartz go to history. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3957.7799999999997s)]
*  And they're able to make that argument for history. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3960.8599999999997s)]
*  So then Friedman is coming out with a variety of papers [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3963.9s)]
*  that are saying, when I look at economic fluctuations, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3967.6s)]
*  he maps them side by side to fluctuations [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3972.1s)]
*  in the money supply and says, look, they fit. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3974.5s)]
*  And other economists, remember, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3976.98s)]
*  they're building complicated mathematical models. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3978.66s)]
*  And Friedman's doing extremely simple stuff. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3981.22s)]
*  And they just think it's dumb, it's not interesting, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3983.92s)]
*  it's not true, they just, they don't buy it at all. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3986.9s)]
*  And so, but after a monetary history of the United States, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3989.98s)]
*  they have to pay attention. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3994.08s)]
*  So it's really in those years, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3995.6s)]
*  Friedman is hammering this idea of monetarism [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3997.38s)]
*  and it starts to become something respectable. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=3999.5s)]
*  It's bordering on respectable for other economists [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4005.3s)]
*  to look to and think about. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4007.1s)]
*  And that's really the beginning [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4008.54s)]
*  of the kind of Keynesian monetarist split, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4010.34s)]
*  where if you start to give Friedman any credence, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4012.86s)]
*  you're heading towards a monetarist position. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4016.02s)]
*  Now, at the same time, Friedman comes out very publicly [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4018.26s)]
*  in 1964 as a supporter of Barry Goldwater. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4023.26s)]
*  And Keynesian economics has found a home [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4026.78s)]
*  in the Democratic party. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4030.1s)]
*  It's probably brightest moment in the sun [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4031.98s)]
*  is the administration of John F. Kennedy, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4035.1800000000003s)]
*  who brings in a lot of Harvard and Yale professors [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4036.46s)]
*  to the Council of Economic Advisors. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4039.5800000000004s)]
*  He proposes a series of spending programs [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4041.2200000000003s)]
*  that are really guided by the Keynesian philosophy. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4044.9s)]
*  And Barry Goldwater is tremendously controversial, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4047.6400000000003s)]
*  part for his votes against civil rights, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4051.7400000000002s)]
*  which Friedman really supports, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4053.86s)]
*  part because he's the hardcore libertarian [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4055.2200000000003s)]
*  in an age when that's not in the political mainstream [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4058.0600000000004s)]
*  or not discussed in the political mainstream. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4061.1800000000003s)]
*  He's just tremendously unpopular, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4063.82s)]
*  particularly in all the educated precincts [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4065.46s)]
*  where Friedman lives. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4067.8s)]
*  So Friedman is like an outcast on a pariah [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4068.64s)]
*  for his support of Goldwater. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4071.42s)]
*  And so that actually really affects monetarism [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4073.38s)]
*  because people feel that this is now becoming a package deal. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4075.94s)]
*  And so there's a great reluctance to embrace [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4080.62s)]
*  Friedman's ideas because it seems like [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4083.26s)]
*  he would then have to embrace his politics. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4085.26s)]
*  So it's associated with conservatism. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4089.5s)]
*  So this is the years when conservatism, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4092.62s)]
*  there is a movement that calls itself conservatism. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4095.92s)]
*  And Friedman is very tightly allied with this movement [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4098.78s)]
*  from the beginning, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4101.54s)]
*  partly through his friendship with William F. Buckley. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4102.66s)]
*  And a lot of people say to me, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4106.3s)]
*  yeah, but Friedman's not conservative. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4107.34s)]
*  And this is like a bigger, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4109.9s)]
*  you have a whole separate podcast on this. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4111.62s)]
*  But for now, I'll just say that conservative [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4113.34s)]
*  in the United States becomes a political brand [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4116.96s)]
*  that contains elements of conservatism [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4120.34s)]
*  that are recognizable across time and space, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4123.34s)]
*  embrace of tradition, for comfort with hierarchy, et cetera. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4126.06s)]
*  And it also has something new and different, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4130.820000000001s)]
*  which is Friedman's ideas about [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4133.22s)]
*  Milton Friedman's advocacy of more free markets, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4136.38s)]
*  less government regulation, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4139.12s)]
*  and the benefits of capitalism and the benefits of freedom. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4140.5s)]
*  And that gets folded into American conservatism [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4143.1s)]
*  in part because Milton Friedman [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4146.18s)]
*  is such a powerful intellectual figure. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4147.98s)]
*  And after his advocacy, Goldwater, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4150.419999999999s)]
*  media realizes this guy's really smart. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4153.459999999999s)]
*  He has really interesting things to say. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4156.459999999999s)]
*  He makes great copy. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4157.9s)]
*  He makes a great guest. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4158.98s)]
*  And he starts writing a column for Newsweek Magazine, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4160.12s)]
*  which is a very big deal [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4163.48s)]
*  in a much more consolidated media environment. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4164.9s)]
*  And he's quoted in all the newspapers. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4167.9s)]
*  And so his public profile really starts to rise [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4169.5s)]
*  right as he's pushing monetarism [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4172.259999999999s)]
*  as an alternative to the Keynesian synthesis. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4175.82s)]
*  Can we just linger on what is monetarism? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4178.94s)]
*  Yes, okay, I didn't get into it. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4182.82s)]
*  So like what, okay, the money supply. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4184.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4187.139999999999s)]
*  So money is this thing that, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4187.98s)]
*  you can think of it like a notion [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4190.66s)]
*  where people buy and sell stuff. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4193.46s)]
*  And there's this fascinating complex dynamical system [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4196.66s)]
*  of people contracting with each other [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4200.0599999999995s)]
*  in this beautiful way. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4203.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's so many pothead questions [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4205.12s)]
*  I wanna ask here about the nature of money. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4206.04s)]
*  I mean, money is fascinating in that way. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4209.28s)]
*  And I think for Milton Friedman, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4211.4s)]
*  trusting the flow of money is really important. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4215.16s)]
*  And there's the signals that pricing [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4218.959999999999s)]
*  and money in general provides is really important. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4221.5599999999995s)]
*  So yeah, and some of this, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4225.4s)]
*  I could take some of this back again to Frank Knight. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4227.44s)]
*  So one thing Frank Knight said to all his students [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4230.16s)]
*  was the market is the best allocation mechanism we have. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4233.04s)]
*  The market is what allocates resources [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4238.72s)]
*  in a situation of scarcity. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4241.76s)]
*  The market allocates them the best. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4243.66s)]
*  And Hayek will add to that by saying [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4246.0s)]
*  prices are information signals [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4248.16s)]
*  and a price sends information to buyers and sellers [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4251.68s)]
*  about how they should act. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4254.48s)]
*  And these are the two of the strongest arguments [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4256.16s)]
*  for why the government should not intervene [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4258.76s)]
*  in the price system [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4261.32s)]
*  because it will blur information [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4263.679999999999s)]
*  or because it will allocate less efficiently [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4264.98s)]
*  than market allocation will. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4267.74s)]
*  And so what Friedman is really gonna add to that [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4269.94s)]
*  is maybe going up a level and thinking in the macro [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4273.139999999999s)]
*  about the whole economy [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4276.46s)]
*  and how money circulates through that economy as a whole. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4278.0199999999995s)]
*  And so what he and Anna Schwartz do [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4283.7s)]
*  is they construct what are called monetary aggregates. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4286.5s)]
*  This is adding together, say, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4290.74s)]
*  all the money that's on deposit in banks [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4292.54s)]
*  and all the money that's believed to be circulating [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4295.5s)]
*  in people's wallets. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4297.94s)]
*  And you also have to really go back in time. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4298.9s)]
*  We don't have credit cards. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4303.139999999999s)]
*  There is a stock market, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4306.42s)]
*  but it's tiny in terms of the number of people who invest. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4307.54s)]
*  There aren't mutual funds. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4310.46s)]
*  When travelers checks are introduced, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4314.46s)]
*  this is like a big deal. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4316.12s)]
*  So we have a very simple monetary system. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4318.02s)]
*  And so Schwartz and Milton Friedman [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4320.820000000001s)]
*  start measuring what they call the monetary aggregates. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4323.820000000001s)]
*  They focus on M1 and M2, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4326.18s)]
*  and their favorite aggregate is M2, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4328.820000000001s)]
*  which I believe is encompassing sort of deposits [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4331.26s)]
*  and circulating medium. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4334.02s)]
*  The other thing to recall, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4336.3s)]
*  there's some fine distinctions between [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4338.38s)]
*  money in savings accounts and money in checkings accounts. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4343.4800000000005s)]
*  Money in savings accounts can earn interest [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4348.7s)]
*  and is generally believed not to circulate, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4351.98s)]
*  or money in checking accounts does not at that time [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4354.9s)]
*  bear interest and cannot legally bear interest, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4358.339999999999s)]
*  and so is thought of as circulating. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4360.54s)]
*  And then there's different institutional architectures [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4362.54s)]
*  of postal savings banks and credit unions. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4364.82s)]
*  But Friedman is, one, taking the focus [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4368.259999999999s)]
*  to these aggregate amounts of money and saying, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4370.96s)]
*  these really have a lot to do [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4374.320000000001s)]
*  with economic booms and busts. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4377.28s)]
*  When we have an expansion in the amount of available money, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4380.0s)]
*  we see an expansion in economic activity. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4383.72s)]
*  When we have a contraction in available money, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4386.52s)]
*  we have a contraction. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4388.92s)]
*  And so he says, at this stage, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4390.76s)]
*  the government, through the mechanism of the Federal Reserve [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4395.06s)]
*  and its influence on interest rates, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4399.360000000001s)]
*  can either make money more cheaply available [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4401.96s)]
*  and more freely available in the economy, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4405.72s)]
*  or can make money more expensive and slow things down. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4408.36s)]
*  But the central core idea of monetarism [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4412.82s)]
*  is this is potentially very bad. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4415.8s)]
*  If the government can hit the gas and then hit the brake [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4418.6s)]
*  and hit the gas and hit the brake [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4422.4s)]
*  based on, say, what a politician wants [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4425.08s)]
*  or what somebody at the Federal Reserve wants, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4428.52s)]
*  you have a lot of instability in the system. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4430.84s)]
*  And so one of the core policy proposals of monetarism [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4433.4800000000005s)]
*  is let's grow the money supply at a steady rate. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4438.32s)]
*  And in the beginning, Friedman just says K%. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4442.92s)]
*  He doesn't even put a number on it [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4446.08s)]
*  because he says the number doesn't matter. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4448.6s)]
*  What matters is the steadiness in the growth rate [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4450.52s)]
*  because if it's a steady growth rate, it will fade away [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4453.08s)]
*  and then people will make economic decisions [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4457.400000000001s)]
*  based on the fundamentals, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4460.22s)]
*  not based on what they think is gonna happen, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4462.22s)]
*  not based on hedging against inflation [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4465.34s)]
*  or hedging against deflation. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4468.38s)]
*  They'll just be able to function. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4470.52s)]
*  So this is sort of the paradox of monetary policy. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4473.400000000001s)]
*  When it's happening right, you don't see it, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4477.18s)]
*  you don't notice it. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4480.42s)]
*  When it's happening wrong, Friedman argues, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4481.7s)]
*  it can just fundamentally destabilize everything. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4483.780000000001s)]
*  It can cause a Great Depression, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4486.34s)]
*  can cause an artificial boom. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4488.06s)]
*  And so he's taking monetary policy [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4490.900000000001s)]
*  at a time when most economists think [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4492.820000000001s)]
*  it's completely irrelevant and saying, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4494.42s)]
*  this is the central game of the economy. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4496.02s)]
*  Now we live in a world where we believe this [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4499.18s)]
*  and the Federal Reserve chair can't open their mouth [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4502.26s)]
*  without headlines being generated. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4505.740000000001s)]
*  But Friedman is saying this at a time [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4508.3s)]
*  when the Federal Reserve is like a mysterious [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4510.1s)]
*  and secretive organization. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4512.42s)]
*  It's not well known, it's not deeply appreciated. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4515.06s)]
*  Some of the only people who appreciate the Fed's power [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4517.92s)]
*  are like hardcore rural populists who have constituents [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4520.68s)]
*  who think the banks and money power are the problem, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4526.4800000000005s)]
*  who are like throwbacks from the frontier days. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4529.64s)]
*  So Friedman in the beginning has no constituency [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4531.88s)]
*  for this policy, he has no constituency for this analysis. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4535.6s)]
*  And so just going back to summarize monetarism, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4540.28s)]
*  it's using the quantity theory of money [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4543.4s)]
*  to analyze the macro economy. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4547.08s)]
*  It's proposing a policy of slow and steady growth [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4549.8s)]
*  in the money supply. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4554.08s)]
*  And then it is arguing that inflationary episodes [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4555.8s)]
*  when they emerge are profoundly driven [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4559.64s)]
*  by changes in the money supply, not by anything else. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4562.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, and going even up a level as we started, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4566.96s)]
*  how epic is it to develop this idea, to hold this idea, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4572.64s)]
*  and then to convince the United States of this idea [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4578.8s)]
*  that money matters, that today we believe [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4582.68s)]
*  is mostly correct for now. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4585.96s)]
*  And so just this idea that goes against the experts [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4591.16s)]
*  and then eventually wins out and drives so much [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4595.360000000001s)]
*  of the economy, the biggest, the most powerful economy [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4599.26s)]
*  in the world, so fascinating. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4602.5s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, that's a fascinating story. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4603.9400000000005s)]
*  And so what happens is Friedman has advanced [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4606.26s)]
*  all these ideas, he's roiled the economics profession, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4608.820000000001s)]
*  he's built a political profile. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4612.16s)]
*  And then he becomes the head [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4614.7s)]
*  of the American Economics Association. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4617.46s)]
*  And he is asked in that role to give a presidential address. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4619.34s)]
*  And so he gives his presidential address, December, 1967. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4622.900000000001s)]
*  And he says, I'm gonna talk about inflation, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4627.32s)]
*  and I'm gonna talk about the trade-off [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4631.48s)]
*  between inflation and unemployment. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4634.28s)]
*  And this is what's generally known as the Phillips curve. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4636.5599999999995s)]
*  And the Phillips curve in its original form [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4639.639999999999s)]
*  is derived of post-World War II data. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4641.9s)]
*  So it's derived of about 12 years of data. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4644.84s)]
*  And it shows that when inflation goes up, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4647.16s)]
*  unemployment goes down. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4651.58s)]
*  And the idea would make sense [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4653.679999999999s)]
*  that as the economy is heating up [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4656.7s)]
*  and lots of things are happening, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4658.46s)]
*  more and more people are getting hired. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4659.86s)]
*  And so this relationship has led policymakers to think [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4661.86s)]
*  that sometimes inflation is good. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4666.74s)]
*  And if you want to lower unemployment, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4669.0199999999995s)]
*  you could let inflation kind of go a little bit. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4670.98s)]
*  And in accrued forms, it becomes to seem like a menu. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4674.9s)]
*  Like you could take your model and you could plug in, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4679.42s)]
*  I want this much unemployment. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4682.62s)]
*  And it would say, well, great, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4685.1s)]
*  this is how much inflation you should do. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4686.14s)]
*  And so then you would target that inflation rate. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4687.620000000001s)]
*  So Friedman gets up and he says, this is wrong. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4690.1s)]
*  This might work in the short term, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4694.5s)]
*  but it's not gonna work in the long term [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4696.46s)]
*  because in the long term, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4698.42s)]
*  inflation has, first of all, it has a momentum of its own. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4700.780000000001s)]
*  Once it gets going, it tends to build on itself, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4704.0s)]
*  the accelerationist thesis, it accelerates. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4707.18s)]
*  And once inflation gets going, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4710.18s)]
*  and the reason it gets going is because workers [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4712.9400000000005s)]
*  go to the store and they see the price level has gone up, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4718.700000000001s)]
*  things have cost more. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4721.14s)]
*  They ask for the wages to go up. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4722.660000000001s)]
*  Then people, eventually the wages will go up too high [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4724.700000000001s)]
*  and they will no longer be hireable [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4730.660000000001s)]
*  or companies will decide at these high wages, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4732.58s)]
*  I can't hire as many workers, I'd better lay off. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4734.4800000000005s)]
*  So if inflation keeps going, eventually over the long term, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4736.8s)]
*  it will result in high unemployment. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4740.38s)]
*  So he says, theoretically, you could end up in a situation [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4742.86s)]
*  where you have high inflation and high unemployment. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4745.9400000000005s)]
*  This hasn't been seen, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4748.9800000000005s)]
*  but he says theoretically this could happen. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4749.82s)]
*  And then he goes and he says, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4751.46s)]
*  and the government has started expanding the money supply, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4753.9800000000005s)]
*  started expanding the money supply in 1966. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4756.900000000001s)]
*  So we're gonna get a bunch of inflation [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4759.9400000000005s)]
*  and then we're gonna get a bunch of unemployment. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4762.82s)]
*  And he estimates about how long it will take. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4765.22s)]
*  And then he says, once this all happens, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4768.14s)]
*  it will take about 20 years to get back to normal. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4769.86s)]
*  And he predicts the stagflation of the 1970s. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4773.94s)]
*  Stagflation of the 1970s. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4777.98s)]
*  Again, sure is that for an economist. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4778.82s)]
*  Again, against the mainstream belief [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4781.099999999999s)]
*  represented by the Phillips curve. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4785.5s)]
*  Yeah, and what really makes it happen [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4787.5s)]
*  is that many of the economists [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4790.5s)]
*  who most deeply dislike Friedman [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4792.5s)]
*  and most deeply dislike his politics in the 1970s [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4794.54s)]
*  as they're running their models, [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4798.7s)]
*  they start to say Friedman's right. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4800.02s)]
*  They start to see in the data that he's right. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4801.62s)]
*  And a very parallel process happens in Britain. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4804.16s)]
*  Britain is going through a very similar burst of spending, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4807.02s)]
*  burst of inflation. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4809.9400000000005s)]
*  And so Friedman is vindicated in a very profound way [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4810.9800000000005s)]
*  in the way that he himself said [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4814.740000000001s)]
*  would be the ultimate vindication, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4816.240000000001s)]
*  which is my theory should predict. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4817.54s)]
*  So that prediction of stagflation [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4819.820000000001s)]
*  is really the sort of final breakthrough of his ideas [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4823.780000000001s)]
*  and also their importance to policy [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4827.36s)]
*  and to thinking about how we should intervene [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4831.719999999999s)]
*  or not in the economy [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4834.84s)]
*  and what the role of the Federal Reserve is. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4835.719999999999s)]
*  Because he's saying the Federal Reserve [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4837.38s)]
*  is incredibly powerful. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4838.84s)]
*  And finally people start to believe him. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4840.679999999999s)]
*  And I don't know if we said, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4843.88s)]
*  but to make clear, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4845.0s)]
*  stagflation means high unemployment and high inflation, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4846.32s)]
*  which is a thing like you mentioned was not seen before [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4850.5199999999995s)]
*  and he predicted accurately. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4854.44s)]
*  And it also disproves the sort of the relationship, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4856.0s)]
*  the inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4859.84s)]
*  Yeah, now I should say the Phillips curve [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4864.96s)]
*  is still out there. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4867.12s)]
*  It's been expectations augmented [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4868.44s)]
*  and it is relevant in the short term. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4870.86s)]
*  But Friedman's warning is still very much apt [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4875.0s)]
*  that if you get too focused on unemployment, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4879.04s)]
*  you can let inflation out of the bag. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4882.54s)]
*  And so until very recently, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4884.52s)]
*  the Federal Reserve's tradition has been focusing [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4886.72s)]
*  on inflation, believing that's fundamental [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4890.02s)]
*  and that will keep unemployment low [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4892.4800000000005s)]
*  rather than trying to lower unemployment [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4894.8s)]
*  at the cost of raising inflation. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4897.120000000001s)]
*  Can we go back to Frank Knight [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4899.4400000000005s)]
*  and the big picture thing we started with, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4901.76s)]
*  which is the justification of capitalism. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4904.080000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4906.240000000001s)]
*  So as you mentioned, Milton Friedman searched [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4907.080000000001s)]
*  for a moral justification of capitalism. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4908.84s)]
*  Frank Knight was a big influence on Milton Friedman [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4911.64s)]
*  and including on this topic of understanding [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4916.240000000001s)]
*  the moral justification of capitalism. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4920.0s)]
*  I think you spoke about Knight's case for capitalism [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4921.76s)]
*  was grounded in the idea that the ability to act [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4925.200000000001s)]
*  in the face of uncertainty creates profit. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4928.0s)]
*  And it should because taking risks should be rewarded. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4931.1s)]
*  So like this idea that taking risks [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4934.280000000001s)]
*  in the face of uncertainty should create profit [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4937.06s)]
*  and that becomes a justification [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4939.96s)]
*  that the ethics of capitalism. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4943.2s)]
*  Can you just speak to that? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4945.7s)]
*  Yeah, so Knight is talking about [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4946.76s)]
*  where does profit come from? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4949.04s)]
*  And to his mind, it comes from the entrepreneurial function [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4950.68s)]
*  and the risk-taking function. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4953.84s)]
*  And so he kind of weaves that into why, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4955.78s)]
*  capitalism works best [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4959.56s)]
*  and why it's the most effective allocation machine [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4962.92s)]
*  and why it assigns responsibility [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4965.62s)]
*  in a way he believes that a socialist system never could. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4968.56s)]
*  Now, Knight though is not a booster of capitalism. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4971.76s)]
*  It could be in part because he's just a darkly pessimistic [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4975.200000000001s)]
*  kind of depressive guy. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4978.240000000001s)]
*  And so he's afraid that capitalism is gonna collapse [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4979.4800000000005s)]
*  and socialism or fascism is gonna take over or communism. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4983.22s)]
*  And so he kind of descends into darkness there. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4987.280000000001s)]
*  Friedman as the more optimist believes with Hayek [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4990.6s)]
*  that you can develop a different approach to capitalism [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4994.8s)]
*  that would preserve the price system, preserve allocation, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=4999.36s)]
*  but build in social supports, build in a social minimum, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5001.36s)]
*  things like this. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5004.5599999999995s)]
*  But there's a moment in his career [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5005.4s)]
*  where he's really struggling to figure out [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5007.16s)]
*  how do I make this case for capitalism? [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5008.879999999999s)]
*  And basically the whole sort of conservative movement [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5010.639999999999s)]
*  or people who we later call the conservative movement [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5013.5199999999995s)]
*  are struggling to make this case. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5015.36s)]
*  And he starts thinking about what makes capitalism work [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5017.48s)]
*  is that if you put forth effort, you get a reward. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5021.639999999999s)]
*  So then you could say, well, people get what they deserve [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5024.62s)]
*  under capitalism. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5026.84s)]
*  But then he kind of stops and he says, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5027.68s)]
*  that's not really true because we're born [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5029.360000000001s)]
*  with such different endowments [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5032.32s)]
*  and there's a huge quotient of luck, right? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5033.64s)]
*  So some people are just in the right position [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5035.96s)]
*  and some people aren't. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5037.64s)]
*  So if I say capitalism is moral [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5038.56s)]
*  because people get what they deserve, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5042.56s)]
*  that's not really true. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5044.900000000001s)]
*  And he also kind of has like an ethical reaction, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5046.56s)]
*  which he ends up calling like an aesthetic reaction. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5050.6s)]
*  He's kind of like, it just doesn't feel right to say that. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5052.88s)]
*  And so he struggles for a while with like, what do I say? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5056.44s)]
*  And then he basically says, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5059.32s)]
*  capitalism, it can't be the core. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5060.879999999999s)]
*  Discipline of the market can't be the core to your ethics. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5064.0s)]
*  It has to be something else. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5066.46s)]
*  So that's when he will decide it's freedom, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5067.44s)]
*  is individual freedom. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5069.74s)]
*  That's really the ethical core [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5071.28s)]
*  and capitalism makes individual freedom possible [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5072.96s)]
*  because capitalism is dedicated to maximizing that. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5075.839999999999s)]
*  And so the defense of capitalism comes through freedom. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5078.799999999999s)]
*  And at his stage in history, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5084.24s)]
*  he's able to set aside nice worry about inequality [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5087.08s)]
*  and say, when I look at the data, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5090.6s)]
*  and this is true for the macro data at mid-century, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5092.42s)]
*  incomes are actually converging, right? [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5096.28s)]
*  And it also, if you look historically, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5098.4400000000005s)]
*  if a country goes from say a more feudal agrarian society [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5100.16s)]
*  to more market-based society, incomes will converge. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5104.360000000001s)]
*  Now then they might start to diverge, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5107.5s)]
*  but Friedman's in the moment [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5108.9800000000005s)]
*  when he's seeing the convergence. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5110.06s)]
*  And so that's what he's really focused on. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5111.94s)]
*  So he believes he can justify capitalism [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5114.139999999999s)]
*  through the ethic of freedom. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5117.339999999999s)]
*  And he also believes that inequality is a problem [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5119.0599999999995s)]
*  that can be addressed through specific policies [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5123.5s)]
*  and it's not a fundamental feature of capitalism. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5126.0199999999995s)]
*  In other words, he doesn't see capitalism [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5128.54s)]
*  as an engine of inequality the way that Frank Knight did [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5130.24s)]
*  and the way that maybe some critics on the left would. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5133.379999999999s)]
*  How did he conceive of freedom? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5136.259999999999s)]
*  So individual freedom, economic freedom, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5138.78s)]
*  political freedom, civil freedom, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5142.22s)]
*  what was the tension, the dynamic [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5143.86s)]
*  between those different freedoms for him? [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5145.7s)]
*  So he really begins focusing on economic freedom [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5147.82s)]
*  and he says it's really important to focus [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5150.9s)]
*  on economic freedom because in the United States, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5153.48s)]
*  we don't value it enough. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5156.22s)]
*  So by economic freedom, he means the ability [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5157.7s)]
*  to keep what you've earned, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5160.58s)]
*  the ability to make decisions about your business, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5164.66s)]
*  the ability to make decisions about the work that you do. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5166.74s)]
*  So this will translate into things like [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5169.06s)]
*  there shouldn't be a minimum wage. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5171.740000000001s)]
*  He believes the minimum wage has bad social effects, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5173.34s)]
*  but he also believes you should be free to accept a job [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5175.660000000001s)]
*  at a wage that you yourself have determined [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5178.4400000000005s)]
*  is acceptable to you. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5180.700000000001s)]
*  And there should be very minimal regulation, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5183.1s)]
*  questions around safety and other things [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5186.700000000001s)]
*  because the market will ultimately, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5188.54s)]
*  if you create an unsafe product, it won't sell [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5190.06s)]
*  and that's sort of your incentive. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5192.76s)]
*  So he really centers economic freedom [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5195.22s)]
*  because he thinks especially, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5198.38s)]
*  and he's really speaking from his vantage point [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5199.82s)]
*  in the universities and speaking to the kind [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5202.06s)]
*  of liberal consensus of the 50s and 60s, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5203.900000000001s)]
*  he thinks economic freedom has been undervalued [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5206.54s)]
*  in the American context. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5209.1s)]
*  So he really wants to push that forward. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5210.08s)]
*  He's really kind of taking political freedom for granted. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5212.12s)]
*  Now later in his career, when he becomes famous, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5215.14s)]
*  he's traveling the world, he spends time in Chile [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5217.18s)]
*  and this country is now being ruled by a dictator, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5220.76s)]
*  Gustu Pinochet, who starts introducing economic freedom, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5224.3s)]
*  but there's no political freedom. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5227.74s)]
*  And Milton Friedman believes eventually these two things [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5229.54s)]
*  are gonna go together and tells Pinochet, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5232.0599999999995s)]
*  you've got economic freedom and eventually it's gonna bring, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5234.78s)]
*  it's gonna mean political freedom. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5237.76s)]
*  Pinochet is like, okay, fine, I'm not really interested [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5239.66s)]
*  in that, I wanna know what I should do about inflation. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5241.58s)]
*  But then when Milton Friedman leaves Chile, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5244.42s)]
*  he is attacked and vilified for having been a supporter. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5246.42s)]
*  He's interpreted that he's a supporter of the regime, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5250.94s)]
*  which he's not, but he realizes he has talked too much [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5253.86s)]
*  about economic freedom and he hasn't talked enough [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5256.62s)]
*  about political freedom. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5258.62s)]
*  He's kind of assumed political freedom [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5259.54s)]
*  because he's come from the American context. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5261.62s)]
*  So then he starts recalibrating them and saying, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5263.82s)]
*  you know what, if you don't have political freedom, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5266.82s)]
*  you're never gonna be able to hold on to economic freedom. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5268.86s)]
*  So he sees that they need to go together [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5271.5s)]
*  and they don't naturally go together. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5274.0599999999995s)]
*  And so he starts to become more clear [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5275.9s)]
*  in talking about political freedom. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5278.58s)]
*  Now let's fast forward to the end of his life [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5281.26s)]
*  and he's witnessing the emergence [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5283.5199999999995s)]
*  of what we call the Asian tiger. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5285.94s)]
*  So capitalist economies that are doing very well, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5287.259999999999s)]
*  but they don't have political freedom. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5291.86s)]
*  But then he observes, they don't have political freedom [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5294.259999999999s)]
*  and that you can't vote in a free and fair election, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5296.879999999999s)]
*  but they also don't have a STATC, they don't have a KGB, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5300.259999999999s)]
*  they're not hauling people off for their wrong opinions. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5303.7s)]
*  So then he says they have something called civic freedom. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5307.54s)]
*  And so he kind of defines this third sphere, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5310.78s)]
*  civic freedom of debate, discussion, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5312.78s)]
*  interpersonal relations, but you can't be political. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5316.0199999999995s)]
*  So this is a late in life edition. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5318.3s)]
*  I don't think it's fully theorized. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5322.38s)]
*  I think what it shows is that during the Cold War, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5324.099999999999s)]
*  he very much believed economic and political freedom, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5327.16s)]
*  capitalism and freedom, democracy, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5330.46s)]
*  the United States, capitalism, this all went together. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5334.34s)]
*  And he starts to see at the end of his life, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5337.36s)]
*  the emergence of different social systems [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5338.98s)]
*  that are using market trading and allocation, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5340.7s)]
*  but aren't giving people similar freedoms. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5343.34s)]
*  And he's kind of puzzling over that. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5345.9s)]
*  Now he always believes that China will democratize. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5347.5599999999995s)]
*  And he thinks China's on the path to democratization, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5351.0599999999995s)]
*  in part because Chile does democratize. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5354.26s)]
*  Eventually Pinochet is voted out [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5356.86s)]
*  and it's become a democratic capitalist [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5359.22s)]
*  and very prosperous country. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5361.74s)]
*  And he thinks that's exactly what's happening in China. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5362.94s)]
*  He sees Tiananmen and he doesn't live long enough [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5364.94s)]
*  to get to where we are now, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5368.44s)]
*  in which doesn't look like political or civic freedom [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5369.679999999999s)]
*  is coming to China anytime soon. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5372.98s)]
*  And he did oppose the dual track system of China, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5374.96s)]
*  meaning like the market is bottom up, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5378.46s)]
*  the government in China is top down, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5381.24s)]
*  and you can't have both. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5385.099999999999s)]
*  He thought you couldn't have both. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5386.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5388.44s)]
*  He thought eventually the market would triumph. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5389.28s)]
*  Well, that's a really powerful idea to say, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5391.679999999999s)]
*  okay, maybe there's not political freedom, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5393.839999999999s)]
*  but just hold onto the economic freedom. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5396.12s)]
*  And eventually that's going to give political freedom. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5399.12s)]
*  Is that correct to say like, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5402.12s)]
*  start to work on the economic freedom [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5403.92s)]
*  and the political freedom piece will take care of itself? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5406.639999999999s)]
*  That's what he believed. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5409.32s)]
*  That's what he believed. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5410.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's more complicated than that, right? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5411.42s)]
*  The people who gain out of a system of economic freedom [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5414.92s)]
*  could decide to collude in a system [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5418.219999999999s)]
*  where there isn't political freedom. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5420.7s)]
*  That's certainly a scenario. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5423.24s)]
*  But that was, again, that's that core idea of freedom, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5425.04s)]
*  and that core belief that people want freedom [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5428.88s)]
*  and that people are drawn to freedom. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5432.360000000001s)]
*  Just to go back to Frank Knight a little bit, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5434.780000000001s)]
*  he wrote an essay called The Ethics of Competition, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5436.8s)]
*  and the metaphor that economic life is a game, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5439.72s)]
*  and then maybe that extends to society as a whole. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5442.280000000001s)]
*  Like the entirety of it is a competitive game. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5444.4400000000005s)]
*  And Milton Friedman, I think, adapted some of this, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5449.360000000001s)]
*  appreciated some of this. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5452.8s)]
*  Can you speak to this metaphor? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5454.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think what the metaphor of the game does [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5455.280000000001s)]
*  is it asks you, okay, well, what are the rules then? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5458.0s)]
*  And let's focus on the rules that keep the game going. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5461.64s)]
*  So he didn't use the concept of an infinite game, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5465.64s)]
*  but I think that's an interesting one. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5467.820000000001s)]
*  A game that all the players are in [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5469.64s)]
*  and keep going again and again and again. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5471.14s)]
*  And so that helped Knight, along with Hayek, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5473.360000000001s)]
*  shift from the allocation question, who's getting what, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5477.8s)]
*  are things allocated fairly to the more structural question [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5482.84s)]
*  of like, what are the rules of the game [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5486.68s)]
*  that we need to keep this system going? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5488.400000000001s)]
*  And so for a while that led to the discussion of monopoly. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5491.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, we need rules against concentration, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5494.28s)]
*  or we need the rule of law. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5497.84s)]
*  Everyone needs to be treated equally. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5500.360000000001s)]
*  People need to know what they're up against. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5502.6s)]
*  And then going back to monetarism, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5506.92s)]
*  the core of monetarism is a rule. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5509.72s)]
*  Friedman called it a monetary growth rule. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5512.44s)]
*  And so again, what keeps the economic game going [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5515.32s)]
*  is a rule about how much the money grows [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5519.48s)]
*  that everybody knows. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5523.16s)]
*  Nobody's guessing. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5524.5599999999995s)]
*  Nobody's changing the rules to help their side [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5526.08s)]
*  or to help the people they're friendly with. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5528.639999999999s)]
*  We all know it's there. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5531.219999999999s)]
*  It's clear, it's easy. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5532.4s)]
*  And so that emphasis on rules, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5533.5599999999995s)]
*  I think really has a through line. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5536.879999999999s)]
*  It goes into Hayek's competitive order, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5538.48s)]
*  and then it goes into the monetary growth rule. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5540.72s)]
*  And then today, monetary policy makes use [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5543.400000000001s)]
*  of monetary policy rules. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5549.400000000001s)]
*  We have not abandoned discretion, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5551.04s)]
*  but rules are used as a heuristic or a check, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5553.360000000001s)]
*  and those come out of Friedman's thinking. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5556.04s)]
*  And so it's something, it's really profound, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5558.56s)]
*  and it was always counterposed to discretion, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5563.68s)]
*  which Friedman worried would be subject to capture [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5567.240000000001s)]
*  or political corruption if you had discretion [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5570.7s)]
*  in policymaking or if you had discretion [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5573.0599999999995s)]
*  in these very big areas. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5574.82s)]
*  Then people would stop competing against each other [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5577.5599999999995s)]
*  in a market, and they would turn their attention [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5580.94s)]
*  to getting control of the rules or the rule makers. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5583.86s)]
*  So if there's clear, transparent rules, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5587.9s)]
*  then you're free to play the game. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5591.38s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5593.66s)]
*  But then depending on the rules, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5595.34s)]
*  the game can turn out the equilibrium [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5597.38s)]
*  that it arrives at might be different. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5599.54s)]
*  So that speaks to the mechanism design, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5601.58s)]
*  the design of the rules. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5604.9s)]
*  Yeah, and that was, again, to go back to the idea [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5606.82s)]
*  separating new liberalism or neoliberalism [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5609.82s)]
*  from classical liberalism was more of a focus [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5613.34s)]
*  on what are the rules that are needed, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5615.34s)]
*  what is the competitive order that we wanna set out, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5617.38s)]
*  how do we design in social safeguards, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5620.66s)]
*  how do we think about it? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5624.06s)]
*  And so that shift towards monetary policy [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5625.06s)]
*  and focusing on stable monetary growth, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5629.22s)]
*  that becomes really important in the post-70s era [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5631.22s)]
*  as one of the basic rules [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5634.62s)]
*  of how capitalist economy should function. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5636.320000000001s)]
*  And it becomes really important because they see the example [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5638.54s)]
*  of, say, countries, most notably in Latin America, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5642.34s)]
*  where monetary rules weren't followed [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5645.26s)]
*  and different governments played politics [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5647.9800000000005s)]
*  with their currencies. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5651.4400000000005s)]
*  And that created huge upheaval and huge social loss, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5652.780000000001s)]
*  economic loss, just economic disaster. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5657.48s)]
*  So my friend, she's a poker player, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5660.5199999999995s)]
*  philosopher of sorts, great human being. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5662.959999999999s)]
*  She has a podcast called Win-Win [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5664.959999999999s)]
*  that everybody should listen to. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5667.5199999999995s)]
*  And the whole purpose of the podcast [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5668.919999999999s)]
*  and her whole way of being in spirit [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5671.0s)]
*  is to find win-win solutions. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5673.2s)]
*  So do you think of economic life [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5674.919999999999s)]
*  as having such win-win solutions? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5677.4s)]
*  So being able to find rules where everybody wins [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5680.799999999999s)]
*  or is it always going to be zero sum? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5684.5s)]
*  I definitely believe in win-win, but with a big asterisk. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5687.68s)]
*  Like you can have win-win, but it can feel like win-lose, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5691.4s)]
*  which is it's not just, are people getting more? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5696.12s)]
*  It has a lot to do with, do people feel they're getting more [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5700.48s)]
*  and do people feel they're getting what's fair and equal? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5703.68s)]
*  So you could have a situation, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5706.5199999999995s)]
*  for instance, if you look at the history [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5711.48s)]
*  of going back to Chile, it has steady growth, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5713.8s)]
*  steady income growth, steady diminution of inequality [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5718.04s)]
*  and a high level of discontent within the society [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5722.08s)]
*  and a high level of belief [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5725.04s)]
*  that the society is corrupt and unfair. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5726.64s)]
*  And that's what matters, how people feel about it, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5729.96s)]
*  how people perceive it matters. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5733.0s)]
*  And you can't, we saw this recently, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5735.4400000000005s)]
*  you can't just come out with a bunch of statistics [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5737.96s)]
*  and tell people you're winning in this game [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5740.280000000001s)]
*  if they feel like they're losing. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5743.16s)]
*  So that goes to all the non-rational factors [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5744.88s)]
*  and all the comparative factors that people have [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5747.96s)]
*  when they think about where they are [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5752.04s)]
*  vis-a-vis other people in society. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5754.32s)]
*  So we're just incredibly social creatures. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5756.36s)]
*  We're incredibly attuned to our status, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5758.16s)]
*  to rising and falling, to where we sit vis-a-vis others. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5761.08s)]
*  And so that absolutely has to be attended to. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5764.36s)]
*  It can't just be an economic analysis. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5767.2s)]
*  That's so interesting that the experience of the economy [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5769.68s)]
*  is different than the reality of the economy. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5773.64s)]
*  You know, on the topic of corruption, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5775.96s)]
*  I think the reality of corruption [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5778.56s)]
*  versus the perception of corruption [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5780.12s)]
*  is really important in a lot of these nations. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5783.4400000000005s)]
*  You take Ukraine, for example, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5785.320000000001s)]
*  the perception of corruption has a big impact on the economy. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5787.64s)]
*  You don't wanna invest, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5791.52s)]
*  you're very cautious as a business person. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5792.52s)]
*  The reality of corruption can be way different [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5794.88s)]
*  than the actual perception. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5796.76s)]
*  But if narratives stay cold, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5798.24s)]
*  it's a self-fulfilling prophecy [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5801.36s)]
*  that it has a big effect on the psychology [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5804.04s)]
*  of the people involved. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5806.639999999999s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5807.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this goes back to Keynes's analysis [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5808.5599999999995s)]
*  of the Great Depression, right? [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5811.5199999999995s)]
*  If people won't invest, if they're spooked, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5813.0s)]
*  if the investing classes are spooked, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5815.96s)]
*  you could be in real trouble. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5818.8s)]
*  And in some ways, this simple analysis of the problem [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5820.0s)]
*  and proposal of a solution was enough to restore [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5823.88s)]
*  eventually the path to economic prosperity, right? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5829.4800000000005s)]
*  That's Franklin Roosevelt, nothing to fear, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5831.64s)]
*  but fear itself. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5833.68s)]
*  You know, the sense of we know we have a future, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5834.72s)]
*  we have optimism, then you believe in it. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5837.08s)]
*  And to go back to like thinking about money, right? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5839.0s)]
*  Money works because we all believe in it. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5841.96s)]
*  You know, it's a form of social trust [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5844.36s)]
*  and it's a form of belief and faith in our society [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5846.64s)]
*  and in the other people in it. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5850.16s)]
*  And when that breaks down, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5851.84s)]
*  the money system will break down as well. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5853.08s)]
*  Is there something Milton Friedman said and thought about, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5854.72s)]
*  you know, how to control the psychology of humans at scale? [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5858.6s)]
*  No, I mean, what's interesting is he does talk, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5862.8s)]
*  especially in his later work, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5865.72s)]
*  he says we have fiat currency and this is an experiment, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5867.72s)]
*  you know, and we don't know how it's going to turn out [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5872.56s)]
*  and it's turning out okay right now, [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5875.44s)]
*  but we've always had a commodity based [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5877.08s)]
*  or backed currency of some form or another. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5879.4s)]
*  And this is the first time. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5882.04s)]
*  And so who really knows so far so good. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5885.0s)]
*  And he also is very attuned, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5889.4s)]
*  it's interesting in his later writings [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5891.32s)]
*  when he's thinking about this too, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5892.8s)]
*  sure, I could design a monetary system [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5894.76s)]
*  that would be different, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5897.4s)]
*  but when I look at history, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5898.24s)]
*  I see that monetary systems have always say, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5900.22s)]
*  incorporated the role of the state [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5902.86s)]
*  because it's so important to people. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5905.2s)]
*  And so therefore my theoretical designs [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5906.72s)]
*  really have to be tempered [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5909.6s)]
*  by what I've actually seen happen in history. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5910.68s)]
*  So maybe we could speak to this tension [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5913.4800000000005s)]
*  between how much government intervention is okay [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5916.76s)]
*  for Milton Friedman. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5920.16s)]
*  So he was against minimum wage, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5921.08s)]
*  but he was for guaranteed minimum income. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5922.96s)]
*  Can you explain actually the difference between the two? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5925.76s)]
*  Yeah, so this was one of the discoveries [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5928.16s)]
*  I made in my research. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5930.64s)]
*  I found a paper from 1938. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5931.6s)]
*  He wrote advocating what we would call today [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5933.4400000000005s)]
*  a universal basic income, a minimum income. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5935.92s)]
*  And he basically sees this as part of the effort [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5938.76s)]
*  to create a new liberalism, right? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5941.52s)]
*  And he basically says, we have advanced societies, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5944.320000000001s)]
*  we have prosperous societies, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5947.320000000001s)]
*  we have decided in keeping with our morals and our ethics [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5949.56s)]
*  that people should not be starving [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5952.96s)]
*  in an advanced society like this. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5955.08s)]
*  The question is, how are we gonna make that happen? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5956.88s)]
*  And he ended up believing the best thing to do [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5959.6s)]
*  was to put a floor under everybody. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5962.24s)]
*  And he said, you can get that based on your income. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5965.0s)]
*  If you have a lot of income, you don't get it. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5968.8s)]
*  If you have a little income, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5971.16s)]
*  you might get a little bit of it. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5972.68s)]
*  If you have no income, you get enough of it. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5973.72s)]
*  And he believed in the beginning, [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5976.44s)]
*  you should base that on what was required to buy food, right? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5978.0s)]
*  That that would be kind of an objective, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5981.72s)]
*  you could objectively determine the nutrition [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5983.2s)]
*  and the price of food. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5985.6s)]
*  And so that for him, it's important, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5986.64s)]
*  he says it's keeping with a liberal polity [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5989.8s)]
*  because it's not intervening in the price system, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5992.12s)]
*  it's not intervening in economic relations. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5995.24s)]
*  And it does not, in his view, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=5998.16s)]
*  require a bureaucracy to administer. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6000.32s)]
*  It is not in his view require that you qualify for it [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6002.84s)]
*  by virtue of being in a protected class. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6006.8s)]
*  You just get it as kind of part of your membership [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6009.5599999999995s)]
*  in this general citizenship body. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6013.64s)]
*  And so that to him was really different than a minimum wage [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6015.599999999999s)]
*  because it did not interfere with the work bargain. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6020.6s)]
*  His belief about minimum wages was specifically [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6025.04s)]
*  that it priced out unskilled labor. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6027.8s)]
*  That what an unskilled labor had to offer [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6030.76s)]
*  was a willingness to work for a very low wage. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6032.92s)]
*  And if you set the minimum wage too high, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6035.72s)]
*  businesses instead of hiring that higher-priced labor [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6038.72s)]
*  would not hire or like we could think of today, right? [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6042.76s)]
*  They put in an electronic checkout, you know, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6045.8s)]
*  or something like this [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6047.72s)]
*  where you don't actually need the labor. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6048.68s)]
*  So he really believed the minimum wage [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6050.4s)]
*  had that perverse incentive. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6052.28s)]
*  Now this is a live debate on what minimum wages do [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6054.48s)]
*  and there seems to be a level at which you can set them [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6058.599999999999s)]
*  that they can not have that perverse effect [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6061.32s)]
*  and in fact can kind of create people [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6064.16s)]
*  with more spending money that then powers the economy. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6066.28s)]
*  So he had a very sort of clinical analysis of that [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6068.58s)]
*  rather than an empirical one or a really abstract analysis. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6072.92s)]
*  But the minimum income is fascinating [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6076.4s)]
*  because it seems very leftist to us. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6079.72s)]
*  But what it is is it's purely individualistic [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6082.240000000001s)]
*  and it never really happened [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6086.06s)]
*  because it was so purely individualistic [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6088.0s)]
*  because American social policy typically identifies [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6091.08s)]
*  like this group of people is deserving [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6095.360000000001s)]
*  and we'll give them benefits. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6097.4800000000005s)]
*  So the classic example is soldiers, veterans. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6098.6s)]
*  Another example is mothers raising dependent children. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6101.4800000000005s)]
*  These people deserve money. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6105.4800000000005s)]
*  The rest of you, you better go out and work. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6106.88s)]
*  Friedman's proposal, it really caught on in the 60s. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6109.92s)]
*  It ultimately went nowhere, but it was no litmus test, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6112.4s)]
*  no income analysis, just we're gonna give you this much. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6116.759999999999s)]
*  Everyone's gonna get this much. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6120.92s)]
*  And he decided once mass taxation had come in, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6122.44s)]
*  you could do it through taxes [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6124.92s)]
*  and you could just rebate people [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6126.599999999999s)]
*  who didn't pay income taxes, got a rebate. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6127.9s)]
*  That actually came to pass. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6130.78s)]
*  It's the earned income tax credit [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6131.84s)]
*  and it's considered extremely successful by policy analysts. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6133.5199999999995s)]
*  It does what it's supposed to do. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6137.38s)]
*  It's not that expensive. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6138.7s)]
*  And so I see that as a kind of paradigm of his thinking [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6140.26s)]
*  in that instead of creating a bureaucracy [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6144.7s)]
*  that does some form of redistribution [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6148.58s)]
*  or instead of trying to intervene in the market for labor [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6150.52s)]
*  or the market for something else, the market for housing, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6154.4800000000005s)]
*  you provide a cash grant that people spend for themselves. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6157.6s)]
*  And so interestingly, that's what happened [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6161.9800000000005s)]
*  in the emergency situation of COVID, right? [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6164.900000000001s)]
*  That's exactly what people did. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6167.700000000001s)]
*  They followed that model. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6168.54s)]
*  We just get money out quick. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6169.46s)]
*  And there's a lot of discussion still about UBI [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6171.38s)]
*  as something that should be done. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6174.580000000001s)]
*  And I think it's always gonna be hard to pull off [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6176.34s)]
*  because I think Americans and their elected representatives [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6179.06s)]
*  don't wanna provide a universal benefit. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6184.06s)]
*  They wanna provide a targeted benefit [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6185.9800000000005s)]
*  because they believe there's like a moral component here. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6187.580000000001s)]
*  And Friedman advanced a policy that was really abstract [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6190.740000000001s)]
*  and really just kind of, it was devoid of judgment. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6195.34s)]
*  It was like pure and beautiful in that way, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6199.54s)]
*  but like utterly impractical. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6201.18s)]
*  And it really focused on not interfering with the market [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6203.06s)]
*  and the signals that the market provides. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6206.74s)]
*  Like it was really against price controls [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6208.860000000001s)]
*  for the same kind of reason. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6210.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6212.1s)]
*  You could say, okay, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6213.42s)]
*  but how does this not interfere with the market, right? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6214.78s)]
*  If you provide people with a minimum income, [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6217.1s)]
*  won't that change their incentives to work, et cetera? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6218.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's a big body of research on this. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6221.9800000000005s)]
*  Most of it seems to show, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6224.46s)]
*  one, it's way better than the current benefits cliff [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6227.18s)]
*  where you have to not work to get your benefits. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6230.66s)]
*  And any incentive impact on working [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6234.14s)]
*  seems to be much lower than would be expected. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6237.62s)]
*  But I'll let the economists and the social scientists [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6240.06s)]
*  fight that one out and figure it out empirically. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6244.78s)]
*  Hopefully we should be able to. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6246.62s)]
*  Yeah, there's been a bunch of studies. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6247.9800000000005s)]
*  It's interesting even just how you conduct studies like this, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6249.42s)]
*  how you do these kinds of experiments, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6252.34s)]
*  especially if you're empirically minded. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6254.9800000000005s)]
*  A lot of the studies I saw is pretty small. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6259.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6261.780000000001s)]
*  So how do you make big conclusions [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6262.62s)]
*  about how to run the world, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6265.38s)]
*  how to run the economies from such small studies? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6268.42s)]
*  It's all a fascinating experiment of ideas. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6271.820000000001s)]
*  And it's also inspiring to see individuals [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6275.860000000001s)]
*  and maybe small groups of individuals [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6280.780000000001s)]
*  like the Chicago School of Economics [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6283.14s)]
*  to sort of shake up what we believe [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6285.740000000001s)]
*  in how we run the world. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6289.22s)]
*  Yeah. Inspiring. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6291.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6292.18s)]
*  You call Milton Friedman the last great conservative. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6293.38s)]
*  Maybe to be a little bit sort of controversial [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6299.900000000001s)]
*  and make bold statements that get everybody excited. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6302.14s)]
*  But what do you mean by that [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6305.38s)]
*  and what makes a great conservative? [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6306.9400000000005s)]
*  So I was really thinking of that [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6309.34s)]
*  in terms of kind of American political identities [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6311.34s)]
*  and particularly the 20th century conservative movement, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6314.58s)]
*  which people are always saying, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6318.34s)]
*  this isn't conservatism. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6320.06s)]
*  And I was like, yes, in America, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6321.5s)]
*  conservatism is different. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6322.66s)]
*  It looks different. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6323.9800000000005s)]
*  It feels different. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6325.34s)]
*  Conservatism in America builds in a big component [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6326.3s)]
*  of what we could call libertarianism, pro-capitalism, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6329.62s)]
*  anti-government ideas. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6334.06s)]
*  And critics will say, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6335.66s)]
*  but conservatism is about conserving institutions [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6337.3s)]
*  and practices and it has a role for the state [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6340.82s)]
*  and an organic community. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6343.299999999999s)]
*  But in the United States, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6344.9s)]
*  it's always had since the 20th century, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6345.86s)]
*  also this anti-statist, let's let the market rip. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6348.5s)]
*  Let's not worry about what the market does [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6354.58s)]
*  to establish traditions. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6356.259999999999s)]
*  The market is our tradition. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6357.66s)]
*  Capitalism is our tradition. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6358.82s)]
*  So that was really synthesized. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6360.58s)]
*  Many people were there, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6363.78s)]
*  but Friedman and the importance of his books, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6364.86s)]
*  Free to Choose, Capitalism and Freedom, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6368.26s)]
*  the television series he did, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6371.62s)]
*  all of these were like core components [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6373.5s)]
*  of this American conservative synthesis as it evolved. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6375.74s)]
*  And I really see that as having broken down. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6379.26s)]
*  It is scattered into different pieces. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6382.26s)]
*  And we don't know where they're gonna come back together [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6385.74s)]
*  again, but Friedman's push for open global markets, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6388.58s)]
*  unfettered free trade, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6394.820000000001s)]
*  that's getting pushback on both the left and the right. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6395.86s)]
*  That I think is just a major sign [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6400.62s)]
*  that both parties have turned away from this vision. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6402.66s)]
*  I don't know what they've turned to, [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6405.099999999999s)]
*  but the way that Friedman brought these pieces together, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6407.74s)]
*  I think that political moment has passed. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6410.78s)]
*  So that's what I was trying to talk about [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6412.62s)]
*  with the book title. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6415.78s)]
*  There's another way though, [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6416.98s)]
*  in which I think of him also as a conservative, [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6417.9s)]
*  which is that within the field of economics, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6420.339999999999s)]
*  he went back to this older idea, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6423.7s)]
*  the quantity theory of money, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6425.38s)]
*  and said, this still has value. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6426.62s)]
*  This can be applied in the modern day. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6429.54s)]
*  It is something to teach us. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6431.66s)]
*  And he pushed back against this trend [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6433.42s)]
*  towards mathematicization. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6436.5s)]
*  So he kept writing books. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6437.9400000000005s)]
*  You can still pick up a Friedman book and read it. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6439.58s)]
*  Where's lots of economics, articles, and output. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6442.38s)]
*  It's like unreadable unless you're in the field. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6444.82s)]
*  And so I think in that way, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6446.9400000000005s)]
*  he was trying to conserve methodologically [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6448.34s)]
*  and intellectually the traditions of the field. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6452.74s)]
*  The work that he, and particularly Anna Schwartz, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6455.1s)]
*  did that literal counting of things [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6458.14s)]
*  and deep analysis of data from the field, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6460.58s)]
*  that was completely unfashionable in his time. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6463.46s)]
*  Now we've sort of gone back to it [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6465.740000000001s)]
*  with big data and with computers, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6467.1s)]
*  but he helped bring that forward and preserve that tradition. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6469.02s)]
*  So I think of him kind of intellectually as a conservative, [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6472.1s)]
*  if you think of the mode of his thought. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6476.02s)]
*  And so, I mean, what makes a great conservative [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6478.14s)]
*  is one who takes those older ideas [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6481.14s)]
*  and makes them fresh for a new time period. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6483.22s)]
*  I think that's exactly what he did. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6485.900000000001s)]
*  You've also spoken about the fact that [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6489.740000000001s)]
*  the times when he was sort of out in public, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6493.14s)]
*  there was more of an open battle of ideas [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6496.34s)]
*  where conservatism often had, you know, William F. Buckley. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6500.26s)]
*  He had a more vibrant, [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6504.860000000001s)]
*  deep debate over ideas where it seems less deep now. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6510.18s)]
*  I mean, that is the thing that it's hard, [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6516.54s)]
*  especially like for the students I teach today to be like, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6518.86s)]
*  there were arguments about ideas [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6522.34s)]
*  and conservatives want a bunch of them. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6524.22s)]
*  And that happened in the 70s, late 1960s to 1970s, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6526.66s)]
*  when they, one set of arguments was about economics. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6531.34s)]
*  Like, okay, this idea of stimulating the economy [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6534.14s)]
*  by spending more, it has a downside. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6537.06s)]
*  The downside's called inflation. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6539.1s)]
*  And the downside's called too much regulation. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6541.740000000001s)]
*  And you've gone too far in kind of bottling up [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6545.38s)]
*  the actual sources of economic growth and dynamism, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6549.38s)]
*  and we have to let those free. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6552.42s)]
*  In social policy, there was also a critique. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6554.900000000001s)]
*  You know, the great society had all these ways [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6557.5s)]
*  of ideas of ending poverty. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6560.14s)]
*  And people came and analyzed them and said, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6561.860000000001s)]
*  the programs aren't helping. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6564.38s)]
*  In some ways, you've actually created engines [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6565.9400000000005s)]
*  to trap people in poverty, [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6568.06s)]
*  because you've given them a benefit [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6569.34s)]
*  and said if they actually start to work, [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6571.46s)]
*  they lose the benefit. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6572.9400000000005s)]
*  You've created all these perverse incentives. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6574.22s)]
*  And these ideas were fought out, they were empirical, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6576.900000000001s)]
*  they were controversial, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6579.900000000001s)]
*  and they were based on really deep research [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6581.46s)]
*  and really deep argumentation. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6583.900000000001s)]
*  And so it seems that era has passed. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6585.38s)]
*  It seems like we're driven much more quickly [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6589.820000000001s)]
*  by moods rather than thought through ideas. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6595.54s)]
*  Right now, it seems like the ideas come after the, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6598.74s)]
*  they follow the political mood and try to put together [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6602.0599999999995s)]
*  the underpinning of it, where it really was the opposite [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6605.299999999999s)]
*  for much of the 20th century. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6608.46s)]
*  It does seem like we lead with emotional turmoil. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6609.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6613.0199999999995s)]
*  And the ideas follow versus lead with the ideas, [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6613.86s)]
*  and sort of the emotion of the masses respond. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6616.82s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6620.179999999999s)]
*  So if we think of the evolution of conservatism, [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6621.0199999999995s)]
*  it was a whole set of ideas that was crafted, refined. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6623.0199999999995s)]
*  The 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, sort of really found [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6627.5s)]
*  their emotional standard-bearer translator salesperson [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6631.74s)]
*  in Ronald Reagan, who incidentally had been following [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6636.3s)]
*  these ideas as they developed, [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6639.38s)]
*  and had been honing his ability to express them [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6640.78s)]
*  and apply them politically. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6643.42s)]
*  It's a very opposite if we look at Trump [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6645.42s)]
*  as the political definer of the era. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6648.02s)]
*  There's a set of ideas, but it was more attitudes, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6650.46s)]
*  impulses, vibes, and the ideas are coming after that, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6654.58s)]
*  trying to figure out how they patch on. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6658.46s)]
*  So it's interesting to watch to see that difference, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6660.7s)]
*  and I hazard that a lot of it just has to do [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6665.58s)]
*  with the immediacy of the media environment we're in, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6668.7s)]
*  and it's just power of the media messages [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6671.26s)]
*  to get out so fast. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6674.54s)]
*  What do you think Milton Friedman would say [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6677.0599999999995s)]
*  about Donald Trump, about him winning in 2024, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6678.82s)]
*  and just in general, this political moment? [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6685.42s)]
*  I think he would love Doge. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6687.82s)]
*  I think that's, you know, it goes without saying. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6689.5s)]
*  I think he would focus on that part, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6692.82s)]
*  because I think he would really love it. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6694.22s)]
*  He would be very alarmed by the idea of tariffs, [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6696.54s)]
*  and very alarmed by the return to protectionism. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6700.18s)]
*  I mean, I think he believed that part of what [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6703.42s)]
*  made the world peaceful in the second half [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6706.38s)]
*  of the 20th century, as opposed to during World War II, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6709.1s)]
*  was the world was knit together more by trade, [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6713.54s)]
*  and that was the great hope, [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6716.54s)]
*  that people traded with each other, they wouldn't fight. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6717.860000000001s)]
*  He was also a proponent of the free movement of capital. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6720.9400000000005s)]
*  He had absolutely opposed this idea [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6726.02s)]
*  that nipon steel wasn't allowed to invest [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6727.900000000001s)]
*  in the United States. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6730.9800000000005s)]
*  I think he would struggle, and he wholeheartedly [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6733.38s)]
*  embraced Reagan, and he worked to minimize [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6737.46s)]
*  the parts of the Reagan legacy he didn't like. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6740.22s)]
*  I think he would find it harder to embrace Trump, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6743.5s)]
*  because he's not of that style, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6745.54s)]
*  and he just had a different style, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6748.42s)]
*  but I'm guessing he would have come around through, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6749.9s)]
*  I think he would just say, okay, we have a chance [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6754.259999999999s)]
*  to reduce the size of government. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6756.9s)]
*  At the same time, those spending plans [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6758.259999999999s)]
*  of the Trump administration are not fiscally conservative [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6761.78s)]
*  in any way, and that was his concern, [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6764.94s)]
*  was not so much with debt, but with the feeling [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6768.139999999999s)]
*  that there's no mechanism to stop the growth of government, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6771.58s)]
*  that it just grows and grows and grows, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6774.62s)]
*  and so he ended up believing even deficits aren't so bad, [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6776.74s)]
*  because they make politicians cautious, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6781.5s)]
*  he thought, about continuing to spend. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6784.0599999999995s)]
*  But I have to believe he would be concerned [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6787.22s)]
*  about the potential threats to the US currency's position [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6789.82s)]
*  as the world's reserve currency, [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6794.82s)]
*  with increased levels of debt and spending. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6797.22s)]
*  He was concerned about low interest rates. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6801.74s)]
*  He died, I think it's 2004, 2006, [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6804.54s)]
*  but it was in the beginning, he didn't see the zero low bound, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6810.66s)]
*  but he saw low interest rates, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6813.38s)]
*  and he said, this isn't necessarily good. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6814.54s)]
*  Everyone's talking about low interest rates [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6816.66s)]
*  as if they're good, but there should be a price on capital, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6818.5s)]
*  there should be a price on this, it shouldn't be so low. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6822.58s)]
*  And so, he had some of still the kind of macro insights [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6825.58s)]
*  that I think are important. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6831.1s)]
*  You wrote the Wall Street Journal essay, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6832.46s)]
*  titled How Inflation Ended Neoliberalism [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6835.34s)]
*  and Re-elected Trump. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6838.66s)]
*  So can we weave that into this discussion [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6840.22s)]
*  in terms of inflation and Trump? [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6842.86s)]
*  What's the main idea of the essay? [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6847.54s)]
*  So the main idea is kind of looking back and saying, [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6849.22s)]
*  so today we have been living in a world [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6852.38s)]
*  where people have been focused on monetary policy, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6856.5s)]
*  steady monetary policy, free trade, reducing regulation. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6863.34s)]
*  This is all called the neoliberal era. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6867.1s)]
*  And my argument was a lot of that arose [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6869.98s)]
*  was driven by inflation. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6873.86s)]
*  So we have Milton Friedman predict inflation in 1967, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6875.5s)]
*  it starts breaking out in the 1970s, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6879.42s)]
*  Britain and the United States. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6881.78s)]
*  And every institution was designed around stable prices. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6883.58s)]
*  And once inflation broke out, prices were no longer stable. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6889.5s)]
*  So for example, tax rates weren't inflation adjusted. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6893.7s)]
*  So if your income went up because of inflation, [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6898.18s)]
*  you might bump from a low tax rate [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6902.0599999999995s)]
*  to an extremely high tax rate, [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6903.7s)]
*  but you don't actually have more money. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6905.14s)]
*  On paper, you have more money, but everything costs more. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6906.82s)]
*  So you don't actually have more money [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6909.26s)]
*  and your taxes have gone up. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6910.34s)]
*  That kicks off the taxpayer revolt. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6912.06s)]
*  There's a whole shift of American corporations [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6914.5s)]
*  towards focusing on financial investments [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6917.54s)]
*  because the tax breaks they used to get for depreciation [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6920.26s)]
*  for building new factories are not inflation adjusted. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6924.5s)]
*  So they no longer pay off in an inflationary environment. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6927.1s)]
*  And then when Paul Volcker comes in in 1980s, [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6930.38s)]
*  early 1980s and starts fighting inflation, [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6935.46s)]
*  really pushes up interest rates to bring down inflation. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6937.9800000000005s)]
*  And that completely reorders the banking sector [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6941.22s)]
*  because banks had statutory legal limits [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6944.22s)]
*  on the interest they could charge. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6948.54s)]
*  And once general market interest rates exceeded that, [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6949.9800000000005s)]
*  it was proliferation of new financial forms [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6954.14s)]
*  to take advantage of that. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6956.7s)]
*  So my point was the era we live in [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6958.1s)]
*  was ushered in by inflation. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6960.900000000001s)]
*  And then everyone turned against [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6964.740000000001s)]
*  all the formulations we had and said, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6967.18s)]
*  well, these have hollowed out our industrial base. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6969.26s)]
*  These have, we've got too much immigration. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6972.5s)]
*  We've got too much economic openness. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6976.74s)]
*  We need to reshore, we need to focus. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6978.860000000001s)]
*  We need to turn against all these things. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6980.7s)]
*  We need to spend more. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6981.9800000000005s)]
*  We've disinvested. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6983.54s)]
*  And the net result of that turning away, I argued [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6985.26s)]
*  is people forgot about inflation. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6990.26s)]
*  They really forgot it could ever exist. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6992.3s)]
*  And you had a whole set of theories on the left, [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6994.18s)]
*  modern monetary theory, and basically said, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6996.06s)]
*  we don't really need to worry about inflation. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6997.9s)]
*  We can spend what we want. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=6999.86s)]
*  And lo and behold, inflation came back. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7001.74s)]
*  And so my argument is that is now open the door [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7004.54s)]
*  to the presidency of Donald Trump, [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7008.62s)]
*  which is potentially a deeply transformative moment [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7010.259999999999s)]
*  that will change the size and shape of government [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7015.0599999999995s)]
*  that may change our foreign policy profoundly, [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7018.9s)]
*  that may change our immigration policy, [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7021.339999999999s)]
*  and we change the demographics of our country, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7025.0199999999995s)]
*  all of that in my thesis is that it's all been [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7027.1s)]
*  made possible by inflation. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7030.700000000001s)]
*  And so the great mistake of the past years [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7032.620000000001s)]
*  was to forget how fundamental inflation was [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7036.660000000001s)]
*  to the rise of the last political order [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7039.660000000001s)]
*  and to profoundly underestimate how much inflation [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7042.34s)]
*  would change the current political order. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7047.660000000001s)]
*  So I just think it's one of these things. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7050.14s)]
*  This is why I think you should study history, [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7052.660000000001s)]
*  because I think if you had studied history, [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7054.26s)]
*  you would be aware of this. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7055.66s)]
*  And it's so easy for people to forget, [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7057.18s)]
*  just like the banks forgot [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7060.42s)]
*  that interest rates could ever go up. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7062.0599999999995s)]
*  They got so used to it. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7063.7s)]
*  And it's only a 10, 15 year thing, [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7064.78s)]
*  but to them that seems like forever. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7067.38s)]
*  So I really do believe what history teaches you to do [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7068.9s)]
*  is just have a much vaster scope in your vision, [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7072.46s)]
*  and then take into account the possibilities [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7077.099999999999s)]
*  of so many things happening that are different [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7079.5s)]
*  than what's happening today. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7081.62s)]
*  And so I just hope we don't forget about inflation entirely, [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7082.82s)]
*  but here's the thing, it is quite a strong chance [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7086.62s)]
*  that Trump's policies will initiate even worse inflation, [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7089.86s)]
*  and then they will prove to be his undoing. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7094.259999999999s)]
*  So the ironies of inflation could be continuing. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7097.299999999999s)]
*  Like you said, Milton Friedman would be a big fan of Doge. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7101.299999999999s)]
*  So if he was still here today, [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7104.82s)]
*  and rolled with Elon Musk and Vivek, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7107.42s)]
*  what advice would he give? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7110.0599999999995s)]
*  What do you think he would focus on [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7111.7s)]
*  in terms of where to cut, how to cut, [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7114.139999999999s)]
*  how to think about cutting? [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7116.62s)]
*  His signature policy move, I talk about this, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7119.66s)]
*  is taking the price mechanism [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7121.86s)]
*  and trying to make that into the policy. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7125.38s)]
*  And that seems sort of obvious to us today, [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7129.18s)]
*  but in the era that he came in, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7132.58s)]
*  so there would be rent controls. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7134.42s)]
*  Let's take away rent controls. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7137.139999999999s)]
*  Let's let housing prices set themselves. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7138.34s)]
*  Or he was very against national parks. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7140.54s)]
*  I actually think the national parks are good, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7143.58s)]
*  so I hope the Doge people don't take this up. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7145.42s)]
*  But rather than an allocation to fund the national parks, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7147.42s)]
*  they should be funded by the revenue that they bring in [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7151.7s)]
*  when people visit them. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7154.42s)]
*  And so I think he was always looking to, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7155.66s)]
*  let's let prices make the decisions here. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7158.62s)]
*  So I think that would be one of the key pieces. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7160.54s)]
*  The other thing I think he'd really be thinking about, [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7163.58s)]
*  he wrote about this a lot about occupational licensure [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7165.82s)]
*  and barriers to entry. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7170.14s)]
*  And he felt like one of the worst things that government does, [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7171.700000000001s)]
*  and sometimes it's private entities that do this, [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7175.02s)]
*  is create barriers to entry [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7177.38s)]
*  to protect industries and markets. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7179.14s)]
*  So he talked about this in the case of the medical profession, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7181.42s)]
*  which I think is actually not a good example, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7184.42s)]
*  because I think we all have a collective investment [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7186.660000000001s)]
*  in having medical doctors be highly trained. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7189.660000000001s)]
*  But so for instance, you could look at nail technicians [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7192.42s)]
*  or hair cutting. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7196.46s)]
*  There's often these licensing requirements, [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7197.38s)]
*  or there's a sort of big kerfuffle. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7199.22s)]
*  I think it's the DC passed a law that to run a childcare center, [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7200.66s)]
*  you have to have a college degree. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7204.14s)]
*  Well, what does that do? [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7205.3s)]
*  I mean, that disenfranchises a whole bunch [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7206.14s)]
*  of would-be entrepreneurs who don't happen [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7207.9400000000005s)]
*  to have a college degree, [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7209.46s)]
*  but probably could be really good [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7210.3s)]
*  at this particular business. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7211.38s)]
*  So I think he would be saying, [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7212.9800000000005s)]
*  look out for where private interests have used the state [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7215.9800000000005s)]
*  to protect themselves and clear away those types of barriers [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7219.42s)]
*  and let competition through prices guide outcomes. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7224.7s)]
*  Yeah, so open up for more competition [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7230.22s)]
*  and allow for more signals from the market [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7232.26s)]
*  to drive decisions and so on. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7236.5s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7237.9800000000005s)]
*  Which would actually naturally lead [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7238.9800000000005s)]
*  to cutting a lot of the bureaucracy of government. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7241.58s)]
*  I think the other thing he would probably be arguing for [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7246.78s)]
*  is again, go back to the design of the minimum income [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7249.9s)]
*  or the negative income tax, [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7252.66s)]
*  that there's a way he ultimately decided [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7254.46s)]
*  to run it through the tax system, right? [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7258.0199999999995s)]
*  The government's already collecting this data. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7259.42s)]
*  They already have your information [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7261.78s)]
*  and they can just send the money out through the system [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7263.18s)]
*  rather than having a social bureaucracy [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7265.94s)]
*  where you have to come in in person, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7268.0199999999995s)]
*  you have to fill out forms, you have to document, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7269.54s)]
*  do you own a car, what's your income, [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7272.54s)]
*  who lives in the household? [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7274.86s)]
*  So I think he would say, and his analysis of that [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7276.74s)]
*  who that really benefited was the bureaucracy [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7279.7s)]
*  that processed that paper, that implemented those norms [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7285.02s)]
*  and that if you could pull that away, [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7289.34s)]
*  you could get help out where it was needed much quicker [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7291.5s)]
*  without having this drag of people doing [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7294.62s)]
*  sort of unproductive work of administering these systems. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7297.14s)]
*  So I think trying to cut administrative overhead [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7299.820000000001s)]
*  and what he didn't have then, which we have now, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7301.7s)]
*  is the technology that we have and the ability [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7304.5s)]
*  to send benefits out via smartphone [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7307.98s)]
*  or just to move so much faster [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7310.0599999999995s)]
*  and to handle information on a mass scale so much faster. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7313.62s)]
*  It's painful, but I think one of the big things you can do [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7318.139999999999s)]
*  is just that, which is digitalize. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7320.82s)]
*  I don't know if that's a word, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7324.179999999999s)]
*  but just convert everything to where the speed of signal [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7325.5s)]
*  can be instantaneous. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7331.62s)]
*  So there's no paperwork, it goes immediately. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7333.54s)]
*  And then that means that the pricing signals [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7338.46s)]
*  and all these kinds of things [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7342.54s)]
*  are just immediately available to people. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7344.38s)]
*  That seems to be the low hanging fruit. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7346.62s)]
*  Government IT systems could be vastly improved to mon. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7348.22s)]
*  But that would result again [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7353.38s)]
*  with a lot of people getting fired. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7354.66s)]
*  And I think somebody submitted a question for me saying, [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7358.34s)]
*  where's, what are your thoughts [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7362.82s)]
*  as a person who cares about compassion, [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7365.299999999999s)]
*  what are your thoughts about government employees, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7366.9s)]
*  which there's a lot of, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7369.339999999999s)]
*  that are going to be hurt by Doge? [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7371.299999999999s)]
*  And it's always a really difficult question. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7376.339999999999s)]
*  A lot of people get fired to make room for a new system [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7379.5s)]
*  that's going to lead to a lot of pain. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7383.74s)]
*  There is gonna be a lot of pain. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7385.82s)]
*  I don't know what the solution is. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7387.7s)]
*  I think that's also part of why Friedman favored [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7389.3s)]
*  a minimum income. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7394.3s)]
*  He talked about it being sort of countercyclical. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7395.18s)]
*  In other words, when things were really bad, [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7397.38s)]
*  the spending level on it would naturally go up. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7401.820000000001s)]
*  This is what economists today call an automatic stabilizer. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7403.860000000001s)]
*  And then when it's not needed, the cost of it goes down. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7408.14s)]
*  I mean, maybe there's a way to make it, [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7413.22s)]
*  sweeten it with honey and have people take buyouts [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7414.9400000000005s)]
*  or things like that. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7416.9400000000005s)]
*  That would certainly be a way better way to go. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7417.78s)]
*  I did a podcast with Javier Malay. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7421.139999999999s)]
*  He has consistently praised Milton Friedman [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7423.38s)]
*  and cited him as one of his inspirations. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7426.0199999999995s)]
*  So what do you think Milton Friedman would say [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7428.0199999999995s)]
*  about what's going on in Argentina [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7432.139999999999s)]
*  and what Javier Malay is trying to do in Argentina? [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7434.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think he would appreciate it. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7436.9s)]
*  I mean, I think Malay is much more [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7438.38s)]
*  of an Austrian inspired thinker, [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7440.62s)]
*  but I think he definitely appreciates Friedman. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7443.58s)]
*  And on the macro level, Friedman always understood [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7445.58s)]
*  it's really painful to treat inflation, [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7449.06s)]
*  but the more you put it off, the harder it is. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7452.78s)]
*  So I think he would be trying to get him, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7455.9400000000005s)]
*  as he's doing to just message that short-term pain, [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7459.42s)]
*  long-term gain. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7464.22s)]
*  I think he'd be very supportive. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7465.7s)]
*  I think he'd be thrilled to see also that Malay [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7467.06s)]
*  is very good at explaining these abstract ideas [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7469.78s)]
*  and putting his policies in a framework [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7472.02s)]
*  of the bigger picture. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7474.02s)]
*  That was really meaningful to Friedman. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7476.14s)]
*  I don't know how politically persuasive it is overall. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7477.900000000001s)]
*  Malay's very intense. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7483.14s)]
*  He doesn't have the same sort of gifts of salesmanship [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7484.38s)]
*  and setting people at ease that say someone [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7488.7s)]
*  like Ronald Reagan had, but it seems to be [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7490.26s)]
*  that's what his country was calling for right now. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7492.06s)]
*  Yeah, he is more chainsaw, less like warm blanket. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7496.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7499.7s)]
*  Javier recollects this line from Milton Friedman. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7502.66s)]
*  I don't know if this is accurate, [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7505.62s)]
*  but if you strive for equality over freedom, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7506.66s)]
*  you often get neither, but if you strive for freedom, [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7509.46s)]
*  you often get both. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7511.98s)]
*  Do you think there's truth to this? [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7513.54s)]
*  I think on the big picture, definitely. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7516.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, we've seen focusing too much on equality. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7518.86s)]
*  It can be, because equality is such an alluring word, [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7524.86s)]
*  it can lead you to downgrade all kinds of other things [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7528.62s)]
*  that are really important, but I really think [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7531.099999999999s)]
*  it depends on how you're defining freedom. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7533.46s)]
*  I mean, the statement is too big and too broad, right? [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7535.66s)]
*  So, if you're talking about freedom, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7539.46s)]
*  if by freedom you mean not having to pay taxes [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7545.099999999999s)]
*  if you're successful, I think that can have all kinds [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7549.82s)]
*  of knock-on effects, right? [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7553.58s)]
*  The idea that people are able to prosper [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7554.82s)]
*  when they're educated. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7557.86s)]
*  Where is education gonna come from? [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7559.38s)]
*  How is that gonna be paid for and supported? [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7562.0599999999995s)]
*  And again, to go back to Knight, [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7564.339999999999s)]
*  if you're generating too much inequality [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7567.139999999999s)]
*  or people are feeling that you're generating [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7570.339999999999s)]
*  too much inequality, sometimes they value that more [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7572.219999999999s)]
*  than they value freedom. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7575.74s)]
*  And so, I think the balance, I think there has to be more [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7576.82s)]
*  of a balance and it's just, it's hard to make [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7580.259999999999s)]
*  such global statements. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7583.46s)]
*  You have to break them down into what actually do you mean? [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7584.94s)]
*  But again, Malay is coming from a very different context, [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7588.54s)]
*  a very different country that has seen so much upheaval, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7591.9s)]
*  so much government intervention, so much inflation, [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7595.74s)]
*  so much political turmoil. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7598.139999999999s)]
*  He's probably thinking about it differently [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7601.5s)]
*  than Friedman was thinking about it. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7603.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there was, there probably still is [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7604.7s)]
*  a real threat of hyperinflation. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7607.74s)]
*  There seems to be a very high level of corruption [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7609.9s)]
*  or the capacity for corruption. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7612.78s)]
*  So, it's a really messy situation. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7614.179999999999s)]
*  So, Javier Malay likes to recollect this great line [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7617.1s)]
*  from Milton Friedman that if you strive for equality [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7621.38s)]
*  over freedom, you often get neither, [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7624.46s)]
*  but if you strive for freedom, you often get both. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7626.820000000001s)]
*  Do you think there's truth to this? [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7630.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think in the macro, for sure, I mean, [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7633.58s)]
*  we've seen if you really put equality as your goal, [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7636.02s)]
*  it's such a seductive ideal and people believe in it so much [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7639.660000000001s)]
*  that they can carry out horrible crimes [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7644.38s)]
*  in the name of equality. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7647.78s)]
*  But then focusing on freedom, these words are too big. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7649.38s)]
*  They're so hard to define. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7653.22s)]
*  And so, I think you have to ask sort of like, [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7655.1s)]
*  what is the freedom you're talking about, right? [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7656.58s)]
*  If you're talking about the freedom of ordinary people [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7658.42s)]
*  to be entrepreneurial, to make their own way, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7661.38s)]
*  to start new things, to continue what they're doing, [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7665.02s)]
*  to keep what they've earned, for sure, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7667.5s)]
*  I think that can increase the equality overall. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7668.900000000001s)]
*  If you're talking about lower taxes, [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7672.34s)]
*  if freedom is just a code for lower taxes, [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7675.7s)]
*  there has to be, I mean, lower taxes in general, great, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7678.22s)]
*  but if you're one of the top generators of wealth, [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7681.9400000000005s)]
*  there has to be some way to ensure that, say, education, [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7685.82s)]
*  right, people prosper when they're well-educated. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7690.54s)]
*  That's when economies do better. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7693.3s)]
*  Education is generally state-funded [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7694.7s)]
*  and you need some way to support that [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7696.9800000000005s)]
*  and provide for those institutions that structure society [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7699.0199999999995s)]
*  that make competition possible. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7702.94s)]
*  So, I think it's just a really broad statement. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7705.179999999999s)]
*  Again, Millet is coming from a really different context. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7708.94s)]
*  He's coming from the South American context, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7712.58s)]
*  from such upheaval, such economic devastation [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7715.0599999999995s)]
*  in pursuit of the goal of equality [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7718.379999999999s)]
*  that I think trying to rebalance [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7721.299999999999s)]
*  with that emphasis on freedom, [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7722.94s)]
*  I definitely see where he's coming from. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7724.139999999999s)]
*  If we can pivot a little bit, we've talked about Reagan. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7726.58s)]
*  What are some interesting stories [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7730.0199999999995s)]
*  about how Milton Friedman navigated the Reagan [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7731.54s)]
*  and maybe even the Nixon administrations [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7734.26s)]
*  and how he was able to gain influence? [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7736.7s)]
*  Well, the Nixon administration is an interesting case [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7740.54s)]
*  because, so I've been talking about inflation [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7743.22s)]
*  and the different consequences it had. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7746.22s)]
*  One consequence it had is that it began to undermine [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7749.42s)]
*  the Bretton Woods currency system [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7752.46s)]
*  that was established in the wake of World War II. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7754.06s)]
*  Bretton Woods, what it did basically, [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7757.3s)]
*  it ended up inadvertently putting the US dollar [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7759.42s)]
*  at the center of the world economic system. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7763.06s)]
*  But under Bretton Woods, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7764.9400000000005s)]
*  countries of the industrialized West [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7767.06s)]
*  agreed to trade their currency [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7768.5s)]
*  in set ratios that government set. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7770.86s)]
*  So, a franc was worth so many dollars [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7772.74s)]
*  or a German mark was worth so many francs. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7776.34s)]
*  And then also under this system, [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7778.34s)]
*  countries could come to the United States [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7780.78s)]
*  and they could trade the dollars that they held for gold [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7782.58s)]
*  because the US was on a sort of modified gold standard. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7787.62s)]
*  There was a ratio of gold to paper money. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7790.82s)]
*  And so the system was set up and very quickly, [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7794.86s)]
*  most countries were, the dollar was at the heart of it [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7799.18s)]
*  in that the converting into and out of dollars [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7803.26s)]
*  was really the mechanism of trade [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7805.94s)]
*  for many of these countries. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7807.5s)]
*  So, Friedman said, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7808.54s)]
*  what we should have is floating exchange rates. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7811.58s)]
*  This is an idea, again, [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7815.34s)]
*  of instead of having a top-down design of policy, [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7817.5s)]
*  an administered policy, we will have policy set by prices. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7821.74s)]
*  And you should be able to trade currencies on an open market. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7825.3s)]
*  They should trade and they should fluctuate [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7828.22s)]
*  and that would be fine. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7829.74s)]
*  Totally outlandish idea. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7831.3s)]
*  But he was pinpointing the fact [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7833.94s)]
*  that Bretton Woods had an instability [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7835.78s)]
*  and that instability began to emerge [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7839.38s)]
*  in the time of inflation. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7840.38s)]
*  So you have more and more dollars being printed. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7842.1s)]
*  Their worth, less and less. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7846.58s)]
*  If European nations keep trading their currency for dollars, [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7849.1s)]
*  they're gonna be importing inflation [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7854.54s)]
*  into their own economies. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7856.42s)]
*  So they say, we don't want these dollars, [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7857.7s)]
*  we'd like some gold instead. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7860.62s)]
*  And they have the right to go to the treasury, [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7862.3s)]
*  send in an order and get gold out. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7864.42s)]
*  And so they start doing this more and more [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7867.54s)]
*  and it becomes, it's called the gold drain [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7870.62s)]
*  and the United States starts running out of gold. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7873.34s)]
*  They're aware this is happening through the 60s, [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7876.94s)]
*  they're trying various things to fix it. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7879.06s)]
*  And when Nixon comes into office in 68, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7881.86s)]
*  Friedman sends him a memo and it says, [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7888.1s)]
*  this is gonna be a real problem. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7892.94s)]
*  He says something like, this is a running sore [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7895.1s)]
*  and you have to lance it right away. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7899.860000000001s)]
*  Some very graphic metaphor. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7902.06s)]
*  Otherwise it's gonna explode. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7905.42s)]
*  And Nixon just files the memo away. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7907.700000000001s)]
*  Nixon loved people to think he was influenced by [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7910.900000000001s)]
*  and following the wisdom of Milton Friedman, [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7914.820000000001s)]
*  but he didn't actually want to do that. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7917.5s)]
*  He just wanted the political benefit that came from it. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7919.54s)]
*  So then comes the moment where the US Treasury Department [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7922.66s)]
*  realizes we're going to run out of gold. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7928.98s)]
*  What should we do? [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7932.3s)]
*  And everybody decamps to Camp David [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7933.139999999999s)]
*  and Nixon decides we're just gonna stop [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7935.58s)]
*  redeeming currency for gold. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7940.139999999999s)]
*  It's called slamming the gold window shut, done. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7942.139999999999s)]
*  And he also at that same meeting [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7945.46s)]
*  decides to institute price controls. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7948.3s)]
*  He does a whole bunch of stuff. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7951.0599999999995s)]
*  It's an emergency. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7952.3s)]
*  He calls it the new economic plan, [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7953.42s)]
*  which is an unconscious echo [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7955.18s)]
*  of the Soviet new economic plan. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7956.74s)]
*  So a problematic name, a problematic policy. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7958.54s)]
*  And Friedman is livid at the price controls, [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7962.46s)]
*  but he's like, actually, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7965.18s)]
*  it's great that you closed the gold window. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7966.9800000000005s)]
*  Let's go all the way to floating exchange rates. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7968.72s)]
*  And this idea was heresy within the Treasury Department. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7971.22s)]
*  Everyone's very committed to the idea [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7974.72s)]
*  of the gold standard, convertibility, possibility. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7978.1s)]
*  United States at the core of the financial system, [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7981.5s)]
*  kind of hem and haw. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7984.3s)]
*  But at this point, Friedman has a very close relationship [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7985.6s)]
*  with George Shultz. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7988.08s)]
*  And George Shultz is a high level appointee [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7989.54s)]
*  who will eventually, [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7992.9400000000005s)]
*  over the course of the next administration, [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7994.5s)]
*  become the Treasury Secretary. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7996.02s)]
*  And so Friedman is feeding Shultz all his ideas [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=7997.5s)]
*  about how we should move to floating exchange rates, [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8002.1s)]
*  how we shouldn't try to reconstruct Bretton Woods. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8004.88s)]
*  And the people in Treasury, [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8007.78s)]
*  it's funny, so I've read some of their accounts [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8010.34s)]
*  and actually Paul Volcker is in the Treasury Department [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8011.820000000001s)]
*  at this time. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8013.9800000000005s)]
*  And he can kind of sense that Friedman is in here somewhere, [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8014.820000000001s)]
*  like feeding his boss ideas. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8018.1s)]
*  He doesn't quite know. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8020.5s)]
*  And in the oral history, [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8021.9400000000005s)]
*  Shultz talks about this quite a bit. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8023.820000000001s)]
*  So at any rate, Friedman exerts [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8025.820000000001s)]
*  this behind the scenes influence. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8027.780000000001s)]
*  And what Shultz does is just kind of [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8029.4800000000005s)]
*  lets Bretton Woods fade away. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8032.26s)]
*  He doesn't make grand pronouncements. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8034.18s)]
*  It just slowly, the world shifts to a regime. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8036.18s)]
*  For a while it was like a regime of steady prices, [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8043.780000000001s)]
*  and then they call it a steady regime of changing prices [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8046.14s)]
*  or whatever. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8048.34s)]
*  The language changes, the reality changes, [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8049.18s)]
*  and they kind of end up where they are. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8051.14s)]
*  So that's a real measure of Friedman's influence. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8052.700000000001s)]
*  If there had been another economist in Shultz's ear [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8055.860000000001s)]
*  that said, no, catastrophe is imminent. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8058.38s)]
*  We have to go back to Bretton Woods. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8060.900000000001s)]
*  He probably would have worked harder. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8062.700000000001s)]
*  The US government would have worked harder. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8064.14s)]
*  And so that becomes one of these pieces of globalization. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8066.22s)]
*  And what people don't realize is there used to be, [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8070.58s)]
*  in addition to these floating set capital ratios, [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8073.72s)]
*  you couldn't bring capital in and out of different countries. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8076.34s)]
*  You had to register, you couldn't invest. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8078.46s)]
*  Where all these rules and strictures [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8080.700000000001s)]
*  and the falling of Bretton Woods really blows that all open. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8082.26s)]
*  It's a precursor to globalization. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8085.34s)]
*  So Friedman is right there. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8087.1s)]
*  Now he's very ambivalent about Nixon. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8089.42s)]
*  He sees that Nixon is not an honest person. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8092.9s)]
*  He thinks he's very intelligent. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8096.0599999999995s)]
*  And Nixon's dream is to create a new centrist majority. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8098.82s)]
*  So he does many things to go back on his [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8103.0199999999995s)]
*  supposed economic principles and ideals. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8106.66s)]
*  Friedman does not like this. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8108.94s)]
*  He doesn't like the price controls. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8109.94s)]
*  He's in communication with his old mentor, Arthur Burns, [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8111.82s)]
*  who's now the chair of the Federal Reserve. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8115.0199999999995s)]
*  And Burns is basically doing everything wrong [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8116.94s)]
*  in monetary policy. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8120.18s)]
*  And I described this in the book in some detail, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8121.38s)]
*  these anguished letters back and forth. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8124.06s)]
*  And basically, as I see it, [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8125.900000000001s)]
*  Burns doesn't have a solid theory of inflation. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8128.900000000001s)]
*  And the more Friedman pushes him, [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8131.26s)]
*  it's almost like Burns is willfully ignoring Friedman [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8134.22s)]
*  and kind of doing the opposite of what Friedman says. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8136.9800000000005s)]
*  So Burns is running a very loose monetary policy. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8139.1s)]
*  Inflation is quite considerable over the 70s. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8142.38s)]
*  I mean, we were all spooked by what did it get to 6%, [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8144.54s)]
*  something like that recently for a very short time. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8147.26s)]
*  This is inflation going over 10%, [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8150.42s)]
*  hovering in 8% for basically the whole decade of the 70s, [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8153.14s)]
*  going up and down with extremely elevated rates. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8156.06s)]
*  And so the Carter presidency largely falls, [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8158.58s)]
*  foreign policy is a big part of it, [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8162.86s)]
*  but the failure to tame inflation is part of it. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8164.3s)]
*  And then Reagan comes in. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8166.26s)]
*  And now Reagan loves Friedman and Friedman loves Reagan. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8168.14s)]
*  Very mutual feeling. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8171.34s)]
*  The Reagan administration creates [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8173.54s)]
*  like an advisory economic board. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8174.78s)]
*  Friedman's on it. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8176.5s)]
*  He's retired now. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8177.34s)]
*  He's entering his kind of golden years. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8178.82s)]
*  He really has Reagan's ear. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8181.099999999999s)]
*  And here what he does is he convinces Reagan [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8182.74s)]
*  of his theory of inflation, [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8186.74s)]
*  which is inflation has been caused. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8188.299999999999s)]
*  It's a monetary phenomenon [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8190.86s)]
*  that has been caused by bad monetary policy. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8192.18s)]
*  Inflation has an accelerating dynamic. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8195.42s)]
*  The only way to end inflation is by really showing [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8198.699999999999s)]
*  and signaling that government policy has changed. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8203.58s)]
*  And when you do that, [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8206.1s)]
*  it's very painful for a short amount of time. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8207.66s)]
*  People will suffer, [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8210.66s)]
*  but then you will come out on the other side [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8212.300000000001s)]
*  into stable prices. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8214.54s)]
*  And this is what you need for economic prosperity. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8215.98s)]
*  So the man who implements this policy, Paul Volcker, [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8218.66s)]
*  he's definitely influenced by Friedman. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8223.34s)]
*  Buys a big picture of Friedman. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8225.82s)]
*  He even buys Friedman's specific technique [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8228.380000000001s)]
*  of the monetary growth rule [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8231.94s)]
*  and of the focus on monetary aggregates, [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8233.66s)]
*  which Friedman has said, right, money matters. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8237.06s)]
*  Aggregates matter, and that's what money is. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8239.019999999999s)]
*  Pretty quickly, Volcker finds that because of inflation [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8241.42s)]
*  and the financial deregulation in response to it, [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8246.18s)]
*  the aggregates don't work the way Friedman said they would. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8248.939999999999s)]
*  And so the specific policy Friedman recommends, [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8252.42s)]
*  Volcker tries it for a year or so, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8255.98s)]
*  doesn't work super well. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8257.26s)]
*  But what does work is letting interest rates go high, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8259.18s)]
*  and then you can get inflation to a point [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8263.1s)]
*  where both the general citizenry [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8264.18s)]
*  and the financial markets believe like, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8266.859999999999s)]
*  oh, they're actually serious about inflation. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8268.539999999999s)]
*  And because we've had a decade of inflation [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8270.66s)]
*  with all these presidents saying, [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8272.539999999999s)]
*  not forward, we're gonna whip inflation now, [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8274.98s)]
*  that monetary policy has lost credibility. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8277.619999999999s)]
*  This is why people focus so much on credibility today, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8280.06s)]
*  because once it's lost, it's really hard to get it back. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8282.699999999999s)]
*  And one way Volcker gets it back is interest rates over 20%, [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8285.34s)]
*  unemployment very high, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8289.42s)]
*  as high as 25% in construction sectors. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8291.18s)]
*  And as this is happening, Milton Friedman is whispering [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8295.02s)]
*  in Reagan's ear, this is the right thing. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8298.5s)]
*  Stay the course, this is going to work. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8301.06s)]
*  Now, interestingly, he hates Volcker, Volcker hates him. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8303.62s)]
*  And Friedman will never give Volcker credit for this policy, [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8307.5s)]
*  but he will give Reagan credit for this policy. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8310.1s)]
*  But he owes credit himself for keeping Reagan [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8312.58s)]
*  from wobbling on this policy [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8318.14s)]
*  and just pushing it through. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8319.86s)]
*  And he also tells Reagan very pragmatically, [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8321.54s)]
*  you better do this now, you've got a four year term, [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8323.900000000001s)]
*  do this in the first two years of your term, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8327.060000000001s)]
*  things will have turned around by 1984 [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8329.380000000001s)]
*  when you run for reelection and you'll benefit from it. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8331.66s)]
*  And that's absolutely what happens. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8333.86s)]
*  If we could take a small tangent, [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8335.94s)]
*  sort of a question I have to ask about, [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8337.900000000001s)]
*  since we mentioned Bretton Woods and maybe the gold standard, [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8341.460000000001s)]
*  maybe just have a general discussion [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8343.82s)]
*  about this whole space of ideas. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8345.82s)]
*  There's a lot of people today that care about cryptocurrency. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8348.18s)]
*  What do you think that Milton Friedman [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8352.62s)]
*  would say about cryptocurrency [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8355.26s)]
*  and what role crypto might play in the economy? [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8357.7s)]
*  Whether he would be for this idea, against this idea, [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8363.78s)]
*  and if we could look at it for today, [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8369.02s)]
*  and also just 10, 100 years from now. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8371.5s)]
*  There's a clip, I think it's in 1992, [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8374.66s)]
*  where people say, oh, Friedman predicted cryptocurrencies [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8377.34s)]
*  because he's talking about [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8380.14s)]
*  how payments will eventually be electronic. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8382.22s)]
*  So in some ways, he definitely, [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8385.26s)]
*  as he was looking at the computer and money, [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8387.82s)]
*  he knew these would come together in some way. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8389.06s)]
*  I think he probably would see a use case for the crypto. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8391.78s)]
*  He definitely would not buy the stronger forms, [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8396.5s)]
*  I think of crypto ideology [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8399.66s)]
*  in which we could be heading towards a future [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8402.54s)]
*  in which there's many different currencies that compete [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8405.42s)]
*  or that are distributed, or there's a stateless currency. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8407.42s)]
*  And he addresses this very, very clearly [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8409.779999999999s)]
*  because Hayek's denationalization of money, [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8412.099999999999s)]
*  it's a paper in the late 70s, [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8414.939999999999s)]
*  Hayek argues for this kind of competing currency model [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8417.259999999998s)]
*  or regime, and so he's responding to that. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8420.539999999999s)]
*  He's responding to people writing about free banking. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8422.82s)]
*  And he basically says, look, [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8425.58s)]
*  even if you developed a variety of competing currencies, [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8428.099999999999s)]
*  eventually society would converge on one. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8431.179999999998s)]
*  And that's because people just want one currency [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8433.9s)]
*  that they know they don't want a bunch of different options. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8436.42s)]
*  Even in places where there have been options to do that, [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8439.26s)]
*  they've been used very minimally. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8441.9s)]
*  And then he says, secondly, the state always steps in. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8443.699999999999s)]
*  He says, technically, theoretically, it doesn't have to. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8446.98s)]
*  I could draw you a model. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8450.42s)]
*  I could tell you about how it could work without the state, [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8451.66s)]
*  but in actual reality, all human societies, [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8454.619999999999s)]
*  through time and space, [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8458.34s)]
*  the state eventually becomes involved [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8459.82s)]
*  in the provision of money [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8462.46s)]
*  because it has so many knock-on effects to so many people. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8463.619999999999s)]
*  So sure, I think he would, again, [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8466.9s)]
*  find a use case for crypto, think it's interesting, [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8469.699999999999s)]
*  but I don't think he would see it [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8472.38s)]
*  as this is going to displace state money [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8473.939999999999s)]
*  and we're going to have a variety of distributed currencies. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8476.339999999998s)]
*  The other thing he really stresses [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8481.099999999999s)]
*  is that a change in a monetary system, [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8482.779999999999s)]
*  it only happens amid great, great crisis. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8485.82s)]
*  So again, you see in countries [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8488.9s)]
*  where the state is not controlling the money well, right? [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8491.660000000002s)]
*  That's when people are more turning to crypto. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8494.740000000002s)]
*  But he says, because money is so fundamental, [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8496.5s)]
*  there are going to be so much political pressure [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8499.980000000001s)]
*  on any country that gets the currency profoundly wrong [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8502.380000000001s)]
*  that the government will fall [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8507.380000000001s)]
*  and another one will replace it, right? [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8509.1s)]
*  So if you look at episodes of hyperinflation, [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8510.5s)]
*  they don't go on very long [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8513.660000000002s)]
*  because they're so upsetting to people. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8515.18s)]
*  If we can go back in time with, [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8517.900000000001s)]
*  we've talked about it a bunch, [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8519.94s)]
*  but it's still a fascinating time. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8521.18s)]
*  The Great Depression, University of Chicago, [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8523.66s)]
*  there's these folks like Jacob Weiner, Frank Knight, [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8526.94s)]
*  Henry Simons, all of these influence [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8530.78s)]
*  the thinking of Milton Friedman. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8533.460000000001s)]
*  There's this Room 7 situation at the University of Chicago. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8535.5s)]
*  Just going back there, [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8539.7s)]
*  even just speaking almost philosophically, [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8541.94s)]
*  what does it take to explore ideas together, [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8544.140000000001s)]
*  sort of like deliberate, argue in that space? [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8547.22s)]
*  And maybe there might be interesting stories [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8550.58s)]
*  about that time. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8552.58s)]
*  It would just be interesting to understand [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8553.699999999999s)]
*  how somebody like Milton Friedman forms. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8556.539999999999s)]
*  The seed is planted and the flower blooms. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8561.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8563.42s)]
*  So he gets to University of Chicago, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8564.619999999999s)]
*  he makes fast friends, [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8567.699999999999s)]
*  and in his third and fourth year, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8569.98s)]
*  they become what I call them the Room 7 gang. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8572.38s)]
*  So Room 7 is they find an old store room in the basement, [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8574.82s)]
*  they take it over, [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8578.02s)]
*  and that's where they have their jam sessions. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8579.26s)]
*  And what made this world come together was Frank Knight. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8581.38s)]
*  There was a charismatic leader, [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8584.98s)]
*  and there were a bunch of acolytes [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8586.86s)]
*  who clustered around him. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8588.34s)]
*  That I think was a key piece of the ingredient. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8590.539999999999s)]
*  And then there was a sense that they were onto something [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8592.86s)]
*  that the rest of the economics field [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8595.9s)]
*  had forgotten or was rejecting. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8598.14s)]
*  So there was like that sense of mission. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8599.74s)]
*  So that seems to have been, [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8601.94s)]
*  there was a formal education piece, [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8605.02s)]
*  and then there was a parallel education piece [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8607.5s)]
*  rooted in admiration for a thinker, a shared admiration. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8609.82s)]
*  And then what that led Friedman to do, [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8613.54s)]
*  what I found syllabi [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8616.86s)]
*  that he had from non-economics courses, lists of books, [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8620.220000000001s)]
*  and he'd written the prices [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8623.380000000001s)]
*  of different ones he wanted to read. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8624.460000000001s)]
*  So he had John Stuart Mill on Liberty, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8626.02s)]
*  like 50 cents written in the margin. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8628.380000000001s)]
*  So he began to educate himself. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8630.5s)]
*  He gave himself a like parallel curriculum [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8632.58s)]
*  alongside this very formal economics curriculum. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8635.26s)]
*  He started reading the traditions of political liberalism, [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8637.5s)]
*  and then talking them through with friends [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8641.38s)]
*  and then developing like a shared sense of mission. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8643.1s)]
*  And that the incredible thing is [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8645.94s)]
*  of those friends in the group, [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8647.78s)]
*  they scattered for like 10 years, [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8650.66s)]
*  and then they all came back together. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8652.3s)]
*  George Stigler, his great friend was hired at Chicago. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8654.34s)]
*  Aaron Director, who was his wife's brother, [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8657.42s)]
*  was at Chicago. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8660.42s)]
*  So many of these people continued. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8661.699999999999s)]
*  He became Frank Knight's colleague. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8664.099999999999s)]
*  So that was the base. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8666.019999999999s)]
*  That was what really grew him, [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8668.3s)]
*  that really profound peer group. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8669.699999999999s)]
*  Now, the other piece I talk about a lot [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8672.42s)]
*  is Friedman was a collaborator, [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8674.38s)]
*  an open-minded collaborator, [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8678.019999999999s)]
*  and he had incredible connections [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8679.5s)]
*  with economists who were women. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8681.339999999998s)]
*  And he basically found, [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8683.06s)]
*  first in the figure of Anna Schwartz, [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8685.58s)]
*  later in the figure of this group of women [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8687.26s)]
*  who were his wife's friends, [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8688.94s)]
*  this kind of untapped pool of talent. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8691.46s)]
*  And so he immersed himself in this whole other world [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8693.82s)]
*  of consumption economics. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8696.18s)]
*  And that resulted in his more technical work [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8698.38s)]
*  on a theory of the consumption function, [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8700.9s)]
*  which is the theory of permanent income. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8703.82s)]
*  So for Friedman, intellectual work [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8706.02s)]
*  and intellectual production [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8708.58s)]
*  was always done in this very social context, [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8710.38s)]
*  in a context that blended friendship [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8713.7s)]
*  and intellectual partnership. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8716.62s)]
*  And he only had a handful of friends [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8719.02s)]
*  who were not also economists, [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8722.1s)]
*  interested in the same questions he was. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8724.3s)]
*  So he just lived and breathed ideas all day long. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8725.94s)]
*  Can you speak to the jam sessions? [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8730.1s)]
*  What do we know about the jam sessions? [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8731.74s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8733.7s)]
*  You're sitting in a room, [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8734.66s)]
*  are they analyzing, [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8735.94s)]
*  are they reading papers and discussing papers, [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8737.5s)]
*  or are they arguing more over beers kind of situation? [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8739.34s)]
*  Yeah, more arguing over beers. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8742.66s)]
*  And in this case, [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8744.74s)]
*  there's several people who say [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8746.86s)]
*  it was all about Frank Knight. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8748.18s)]
*  What did he say? [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8750.3s)]
*  What did he mean when he said it? [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8751.58s)]
*  Is he right? [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8753.1s)]
*  And so Knight was very, [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8754.46s)]
*  he would say one thing and then say another. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8756.06s)]
*  If you read him, [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8757.7s)]
*  it's very hard to follow what he's actually saying [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8758.539999999999s)]
*  because he's full of qualifications and ironies and blends. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8760.82s)]
*  And so he would throw out these pieces [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8763.539999999999s)]
*  and then the students would kind of clutch at them. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8767.74s)]
*  And then they would come back together [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8769.82s)]
*  and try to assemble this sort of worldview. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8771.1s)]
*  And then Frank Knight fell into this terrible depression [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8772.9s)]
*  and to cheer him up, [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8775.98s)]
*  they planned a big party [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8777.62s)]
*  and they went back through all of his previous writings [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8779.5s)]
*  and they assembled them into a book that was published. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8783.06s)]
*  This is the Ethics of Competition. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8785.66s)]
*  And you can read the introduction [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8787.18s)]
*  written in part by Milton Friedman. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8788.5s)]
*  So not only were they talking about Knight [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8789.86s)]
*  and what he said, [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8792.58s)]
*  but then they started pouring over his work. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8793.42s)]
*  And one of them described it [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8796.02s)]
*  as like a general equilibrium system [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8797.300000000001s)]
*  where you had to know all the parts [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8799.26s)]
*  and then all of a sudden it all fit together in a whole. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8801.14s)]
*  So if we step back, [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8803.9s)]
*  what they were doing was getting inside the mind [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8805.66s)]
*  of a great thinker [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8808.58s)]
*  and understanding the ways that all fit together [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8809.66s)]
*  and then kind of testing their ideas against Knight's. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8812.18s)]
*  And what's fascinating is one of the first papers [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8815.78s)]
*  that Friedman publishes in Statistics [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8819.58s)]
*  is a rebuttal of Frank Knight. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8822.14s)]
*  He publishes a rebuttal of Frank Knight's ideas [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8824.62s)]
*  about risk and uncertainty. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8827.26s)]
*  And Frank Knight, he kind of took a black swan argument. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8829.22s)]
*  He said, risk you can calculate. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8832.460000000001s)]
*  Uncertainty, you can't, like existentially, philosophically. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8835.02s)]
*  You can't get your hands around it. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8839.14s)]
*  It is the black swan. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8840.86s)]
*  And Friedman publishes this statistical paper [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8842.26s)]
*  and he says, I can put uncertainty on a graph. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8844.42s)]
*  And so there's that sort of Freudian killing [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8847.98s)]
*  of the father element when he comes back [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8850.34s)]
*  and he will in some ways turn his back [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8852.54s)]
*  on Knight's approach and Knight's pessimism, [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8856.18s)]
*  even while it's like a foundation of his thinking. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8858.62s)]
*  Fascinating. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8862.300000000001s)]
*  Is there something you could say about the thinking process [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8863.94s)]
*  that Milton Friedman followed? [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8866.380000000001s)]
*  Like how he developed his ideas? [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8869.460000000001s)]
*  You mentioned there's a strong collaborative component, [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8872.7s)]
*  but there's another story I saw about [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8875.54s)]
*  that I think his son recalled [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8879.54s)]
*  about the argument number system that you mentioned. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8883.220000000001s)]
*  Which by the way, if we can explain that [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8887.099999999999s)]
*  as the tangent of a tangent, that's really awesome. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8888.46s)]
*  I think it's like number one, if the other person is right. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8891.42s)]
*  Number two means you were right and I was wrong. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8894.9s)]
*  And the number system evolved in some ways [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8899.18s)]
*  to be quick and efficient, but in other ways, [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8902.9s)]
*  they also were really clear about it. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8904.699999999999s)]
*  So something like there's kind of like three reasons behind it. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8906.14s)]
*  The first is if you use a number, [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8910.3s)]
*  it reminds the listener that it's really hard [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8912.42s)]
*  to say the words, I was wrong. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8916.42s)]
*  So you're kind of calling on their sympathy [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8919.5s)]
*  by using the number, reminding them [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8922.42s)]
*  that you're doing a hard thing. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8923.859999999999s)]
*  And then it's also reminding them [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8925.019999999999s)]
*  that you're in this family with this code. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8928.539999999999s)]
*  And so you're signaling your membership [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8931.259999999998s)]
*  and your closeness and your love really. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8934.58s)]
*  And so it's supposed to be an easy way to disagree [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8937.06s)]
*  without like breaking the relationship. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8940.019999999999s)]
*  So admitting you're wrong now comes [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8941.7s)]
*  with this warm fuzzy feeling. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8945.02s)]
*  And that's really, I mean, that's so powerful. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8947.660000000002s)]
*  I think so much of the friction of human interaction [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8950.820000000002s)]
*  could be boiled down to just not being able to admit [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8955.1s)]
*  that you're wrong efficiently and quickly [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8958.300000000001s)]
*  and regularly and just often. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8960.460000000001s)]
*  And to be able to do that, that's really powerful. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8963.580000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a really neat aspect [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8966.5s)]
*  of their family life for sure. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8969.18s)]
*  That's a fun story. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8971.66s)]
*  But like, can we just generalize [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8972.98s)]
*  to how he engaged in collaboration, [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8974.46s)]
*  how he developed his ideas? [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8977.539999999999s)]
*  Is there like a thinking process? [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8979.699999999999s)]
*  So he taught at the University of Chicago [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8981.9s)]
*  and he tended to teach for six months [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8983.779999999999s)]
*  and then have six months off. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8985.539999999999s)]
*  And he spent the summers in New Hampshire or Vermont. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8986.94s)]
*  He had a, right near that border, [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8990.34s)]
*  they had two different houses. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8991.779999999999s)]
*  And that to him was the deep thinking time. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8992.9s)]
*  And so when he's at Chicago, he's teaching, [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8996.02s)]
*  he's arguing, some people love his teaching style, [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=8999.3s)]
*  very much in charge, very much keeping students [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9003.46s)]
*  on their toes, confrontational. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9006.34s)]
*  Others found it too much, overwhelming, [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9008.619999999999s)]
*  kind of shut them down intellectually [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9011.38s)]
*  and they couldn't cope with it. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9012.939999999999s)]
*  And so I think it was kind of go time when he was teaching. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9015.06s)]
*  In that case, that was a lot of social time, [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9019.019999999999s)]
*  interacting, talking, other professors, [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9021.5s)]
*  going out and giving papers, [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9023.82s)]
*  arguing with the people at Yale or Harvard. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9025.3s)]
*  Then he would go and do these very deep dives [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9027.62s)]
*  over the summer. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9030.460000000001s)]
*  He would also regularly do these trips to New York [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9031.42s)]
*  to see Anna Schwartz, so his 12 year collaborator. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9034.54s)]
*  They didn't have, phone calls were really expensive. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9037.26s)]
*  They did have quite an extensive correspondence, [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9039.460000000001s)]
*  but then they would do these meetings. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9041.300000000001s)]
*  So he would basically come in at the beginning of the summer, [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9042.5s)]
*  going to Raw-Way, stop in New York, see Schwartz, [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9046.820000000002s)]
*  and then again, on the way back to Chicago. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9049.7s)]
*  So you'd have these deep check-ins at that point. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9051.740000000002s)]
*  The other thing that happened is people would come visit him [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9054.1s)]
*  in New Hampshire. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9056.660000000002s)]
*  And so he would have these, [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9057.740000000002s)]
*  he had a studio separate from the house. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9059.820000000002s)]
*  He would go and he would work. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9061.5s)]
*  And then at night, his friends would come. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9062.5s)]
*  His friends are all economists. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9064.78s)]
*  There's a whole cluster of economists. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9066.02s)]
*  They all clustered within driving distance [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9068.140000000001s)]
*  at the Dartmouth library [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9070.62s)]
*  so that they could get their hands on books. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9071.900000000001s)]
*  And so they would come over and then they would argue [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9074.140000000001s)]
*  and talk into the night. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9076.62s)]
*  So I think he did need that deep focus time, [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9078.02s)]
*  but it was not like, he also lived a very engaged, [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9082.220000000001s)]
*  very embedded social life. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9086.1s)]
*  A part of which was his marriage. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9088.66s)]
*  Is there something you could say about love, [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9092.460000000001s)]
*  about marriage, about relationship [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9093.94s)]
*  that made the whole thing work? [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9095.66s)]
*  Cause it was vibrant and they wrote a biography together? [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9096.9s)]
*  They did. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9100.66s)]
*  I mean, they were very complimentary. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9101.5s)]
*  They were kind of the yin and the yang. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9102.82s)]
*  She was very introverted, [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9104.9s)]
*  somewhat suspicious of others, skeptical. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9107.78s)]
*  And he was extremely extroverted, optimistic, [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9111.460000000001s)]
*  high energy. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9116.78s)]
*  And they also were at a time when it was really clear, [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9117.62s)]
*  like for broader society, these are the roles of a man. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9120.460000000001s)]
*  These are the roles of a woman. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9123.5s)]
*  And they pretty much adopted those. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9125.300000000001s)]
*  Now, Rose Friedman did some very important economic work. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9126.7s)]
*  She's part of the early stages [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9131.34s)]
*  of the theory of the consumption function. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9132.7s)]
*  She didn't complete her degree [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9134.86s)]
*  because she really knew there wasn't, [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9136.26s)]
*  if she wanted to be married and have children in the world, [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9138.78s)]
*  she lived in, there wasn't a real pathway [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9141.300000000001s)]
*  to also being an economist. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9143.460000000001s)]
*  I do think that a lot of that, [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9146.54s)]
*  it's not, it feels very gendered, [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9148.5s)]
*  like he's the man out in the world and she's in private. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9150.74s)]
*  It's interesting because her brother, [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9153.82s)]
*  Aaron director was the same way. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9155.060000000001s)]
*  He was very private man, very shy, very introverted. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9156.5s)]
*  And he exerted this like quiet intellectual influence [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9159.86s)]
*  on all of his friends. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9162.34s)]
*  So I think that was just kind of a family trait [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9164.1s)]
*  of being more quiet, preferring to be behind the scenes. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9167.02s)]
*  It wouldn't have worked any other way. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9170.26s)]
*  Because Friedman was so out there, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9171.7s)]
*  so, you know, so extroverted. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9174.380000000001s)]
*  And there's a bit of a sad thing she said. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9177.740000000002s)]
*  She said, when I married Milton, [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9179.78s)]
*  I lost half of my conversations. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9181.94s)]
*  When David came along, I lost the other half. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9184.400000000001s)]
*  So it was a household that was just dominated [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9187.42s)]
*  by male voices and which she didn't have a lot of room. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9190.7s)]
*  What was tricky for me in my research [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9193.86s)]
*  is she didn't leave much of a trace. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9195.42s)]
*  She put together Milton Friedman's archive [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9197.7s)]
*  and she took herself out of it. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9200.04s)]
*  So I really had trouble finding her actual voice [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9201.36s)]
*  in the historical documents. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9205.32s)]
*  And she didn't want to leave that behind. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9206.640000000001s)]
*  So it's absolutely essential piece of his success [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9208.84s)]
*  because she's the one who pushed him [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9212.52s)]
*  to do the Newsweek column, to do Free to Choose. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9214.04s)]
*  And she really wrote capitalism and freedom. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9216.92s)]
*  She took all his random notes [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9219.44s)]
*  and she put them together into a book. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9221.560000000001s)]
*  And that became this kind of testimony of his ideas. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9223.32s)]
*  But she shared many of his ideas. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9225.960000000001s)]
*  And she, you know, without, [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9228.8s)]
*  when I think of Friedman, if you take away Anna Schwartz, [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9230.88s)]
*  if you take away Rose Friedman, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9233.679999999998s)]
*  if you take away the other woman who collaborated with him, [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9234.96s)]
*  you have a much thinner resume [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9237.72s)]
*  than the one he actually has. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9239.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's always sad. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9241.199999999999s)]
*  And it always makes me wonder [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9242.199999999999s)]
*  about the private secret conversations between partners. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9244.359999999999s)]
*  Because they're, you know, [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9250.439999999999s)]
*  they might not show up in the record, [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9252.32s)]
*  but they probably influence the person [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9254.359999999999s)]
*  more than anything else. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9256.759999999998s)]
*  And so, yeah, those quiet little conversations. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9259.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9263.880000000001s)]
*  If we can switch our path [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9266.28s)]
*  to another great mind of the 20th century, Ayn Rand. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9269.800000000001s)]
*  We talked about some of the similarities here [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9276.92s)]
*  about them being fighters for freedom [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9278.800000000001s)]
*  and fighters for capitalism. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9280.68s)]
*  What is Ayn Rand's philosophy? [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9283.48s)]
*  A summary of objectivism. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9285.92s)]
*  Yeah, so she called it objectivism. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9287.28s)]
*  Trying to, she used to do this thing, [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9289.56s)]
*  like I can stand on one foot and say it. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9291.0s)]
*  So it goes something like, [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9294.0s)]
*  epistemology, reason, ethics, selfishness, [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9296.8s)]
*  politics, capitalism. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9300.72s)]
*  You know, that was kind of how she summarized it. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9302.56s)]
*  So what she did, [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9304.12s)]
*  there's a couple of things she did with objectivism. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9305.76s)]
*  First of all, she says the key defining element [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9308.16s)]
*  of humanity is rationalism, the rational faculty. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9311.64s)]
*  So that's what defines what humanity is. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9314.4s)]
*  Therefore, there is an objective reality [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9317.72s)]
*  that we can access and know with our reason. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9319.72s)]
*  That's the objective epistemology. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9322.32s)]
*  And the one social and economic system [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9324.0s)]
*  that lets rationality flower [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9327.84s)]
*  and is based upon rationality is capitalism. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9330.6s)]
*  And then rationality only works, in her view, [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9333.52s)]
*  as an individual capacity, [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9337.76s)]
*  and that rationality teaches that what you should do [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9340.16s)]
*  is pursue your interests. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9343.88s)]
*  And so she ends up calling that selfishness. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9347.48s)]
*  Now, it's tricky because selfishness has so many strong [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9350.759999999998s)]
*  and negative connotations. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9355.439999999999s)]
*  And she meant, I think, something closer [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9357.56s)]
*  to like self-actualization [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9360.88s)]
*  because she really tried to create this idea [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9363.56s)]
*  and express the idea that to be truly selfish [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9368.4s)]
*  did not mean trampling on others. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9371.96s)]
*  It meant just being motivated [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9375.16s)]
*  by your own kind of internal measures and metrics. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9378.16s)]
*  And so in her fiction, she tries to show this [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9383.119999999999s)]
*  by showing the false selfishness of some of Peter Keating, [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9387.32s)]
*  who's an architect who kind of steps over everybody [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9391.359999999999s)]
*  to advance his career. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9393.72s)]
*  And she says, it's not true selfishness [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9395.599999999999s)]
*  because true selfishness would recognize it's false [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9397.359999999999s)]
*  to take others' work and pass it off as your own. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9400.92s)]
*  Now, the other big piece of objectivism [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9403.8s)]
*  is a very approach that's really inspired [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9405.64s)]
*  and related to Friedrich Nietzsche's idea [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9410.52s)]
*  of revaluing values or a genealogy of morals. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9413.4s)]
*  And so she says, what's happened here is Western culture [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9418.4s)]
*  has converged on this idea of altruism as good, [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9424.24s)]
*  being selfless and altruistic is good. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9427.84s)]
*  And this has led us to communism [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9431.2s)]
*  and has led us to devalue the individual [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9434.28s)]
*  in favor of the collective. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9436.4s)]
*  So what we need is a new moral code [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9437.84s)]
*  which elevates selfishness, which elevates the individual [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9440.4s)]
*  and which takes all the things [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9444.12s)]
*  that we have been told are bad [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9445.48s)]
*  and actually says their values. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9447.64s)]
*  This is what she's trying to do with objectivism. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9449.880000000001s)]
*  I mean, it is about as ambitious [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9452.16s)]
*  of an intellectual project as there can be. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9453.8s)]
*  And that's what really draws people in, [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9456.68s)]
*  yet at the same time, she's flying in the face [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9460.32s)]
*  of the way human morals and ethics and societies [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9464.279999999999s)]
*  have evolved and she's not able to single-handedly [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9466.84s)]
*  recreate them the way she wants them to be. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9470.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, she's not doing herself any favors [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9472.8s)]
*  by like taking on the words [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9475.4s)]
*  and trying to rebrand them completely. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9476.8s)]
*  Like writing the virtue of selfishness. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9478.96s)]
*  It's like, can we just call it self-actualization? [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9481.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9484.72s)]
*  There's a negative connotation to selfishness [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9485.56s)]
*  and a positive connotation to altruism. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9487.76s)]
*  So she sometimes, it seems, [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9490.6s)]
*  takes on the hardest possible form of argument. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9493.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, she had a student [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9498.119999999999s)]
*  and who ended up being very close to her, [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9501.439999999999s)]
*  Nathaniel Brandon, and he was the Reverend Advisor, [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9503.279999999999s)]
*  and he said, can you please not use selfishness? [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9505.359999999999s)]
*  Like just come up with another word. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9507.24s)]
*  But part of her liked it. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9508.6s)]
*  Part of her wanted to provoke and unsettle. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9510.76s)]
*  She didn't wanna give that up. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9513.48s)]
*  People should listen to her public talks. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9515.720000000001s)]
*  Her whole aura, way of being is provocative [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9522.92s)]
*  and she's a real powerhouse of an intellectual. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9526.720000000001s)]
*  So she loves the challenge. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9529.800000000001s)]
*  And that just listening to her in itself is just inspiring [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9531.84s)]
*  because you could see the individualism radiate from her. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9536.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that was one of the things I found [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9541.44s)]
*  in researching and writing about her. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9544.76s)]
*  Like she's an incredibly unusual human being. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9546.44s)]
*  And so that was like her strength, right? [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9549.880000000001s)]
*  Cause she's so unusual, but it was also her downfall [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9552.84s)]
*  because she looked to herself as a model [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9554.92s)]
*  or to get insight about humanity [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9557.800000000001s)]
*  and she never quite processed [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9560.92s)]
*  how different she was from other people. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9562.640000000001s)]
*  So just because we talked about Milton Friedman so much, [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9564.92s)]
*  can we just return to what to you, [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9568.52s)]
*  given everything we've said, [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9571.720000000001s)]
*  is the interesting differences about Ayn Rand, [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9573.68s)]
*  her ideas related to Milton Friedman. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9576.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, broadly we could put Milton Friedman [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9584.16s)]
*  and Ayn Rand in some sort of category together, [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9586.2s)]
*  but she has this focus on ethics and rationality [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9588.880000000001s)]
*  and this desire to be revolutionary. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9596.04s)]
*  That's much stronger than Friedman. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9598.720000000001s)]
*  Friedman wanted to overthrow the economic consensus. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9601.0s)]
*  He didn't want to overturn the moral basis [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9604.84s)]
*  of Western society. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9607.16s)]
*  So she's also, she does something. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9608.68s)]
*  So in one of Frank Knight's essays, [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9612.36s)]
*  he talks about the ethics of competition. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9614.16s)]
*  And he says, you basically cannot build an ethics [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9616.28s)]
*  out of competition because it would be monstrous to do so, [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9619.96s)]
*  because it would say the winner of this competition [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9623.64s)]
*  is ethically right. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9627.44s)]
*  And that would open the door [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9628.84s)]
*  to sort of might makes right. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9630.0s)]
*  And this is what Friedman struggles with. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9631.8s)]
*  And he says, I can't take capitalist outcomes [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9633.44s)]
*  as ethical unto themselves. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9637.0s)]
*  I can't do it, doesn't feel right. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9638.4s)]
*  And there's this line where Frank Knight says, [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9640.6s)]
*  no one would ever do this. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9642.52s)]
*  And I was like, oh, Frank Knight, [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9643.68s)]
*  you haven't read Ayn Rand yet. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9645.44s)]
*  Hold my beer, yeah. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9647.4s)]
*  You're a little too early, because that's what she does. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9648.24s)]
*  She takes the outcomes of capitalism [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9650.44s)]
*  and of market competition and says, [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9652.84s)]
*  these have ethical meaning. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9654.72s)]
*  And this is where ethical meaning inheres. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9656.68s)]
*  And it is ethical to try to succeed [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9659.0s)]
*  and to succeed in a capitalist society. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9662.519999999999s)]
*  Now, what she's able to do is create a fictional world [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9664.119999999999s)]
*  in which people succeed in her fictional capitalist world [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9667.4s)]
*  through ethical behavior. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9670.72s)]
*  And so she doesn't really have to wrestle [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9672.56s)]
*  with a capitalist world in which people succeed [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9674.56s)]
*  through fraud and corruption and all the other things [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9677.519999999999s)]
*  that might go into someone's success. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9681.32s)]
*  She creates the best possible take [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9683.24s)]
*  on success under capitalism. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9685.919999999998s)]
*  And then she holds that up as an ideal. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9688.0s)]
*  And I think what's important is that [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9689.8s)]
*  so few people have done that. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9692.16s)]
*  And she comes at a time when everybody is emphasizing [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9693.679999999998s)]
*  the downsides of capitalism. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9696.16s)]
*  And she says, there's another way to look at it. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9698.08s)]
*  Here are the good sides of capitalism. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9700.199999999999s)]
*  And like you said, she was operating, [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9702.279999999999s)]
*  which I really loved the phrasing of that, [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9703.88s)]
*  in the mythic register. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9706.16s)]
*  So she was constructing these characters, [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9709.519999999999s)]
*  these capitalists that are like the highest form, [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9712.279999999999s)]
*  these great heroic figures, almost romanticizing them. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9716.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9720.32s)]
*  You mentioned We the Living is one of the books [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9721.800000000001s)]
*  that you like of hers the most, [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9724.08s)]
*  but can we stay in the mythic register [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9726.720000000001s)]
*  with the fountainhead and Alice Rugged? [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9729.68s)]
*  What to you are some sort of memorable, inspiring moments, [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9732.880000000001s)]
*  insightful moments from those books [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9737.92s)]
*  that may be scenes or ideas that you take away? [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9741.04s)]
*  From them that are important for people to understand. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9746.52s)]
*  Yeah, so the fountainhead is this story [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9750.800000000001s)]
*  of a struggling architect, Howard Rourke, [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9753.52s)]
*  and she kind of follows his life and his career. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9757.28s)]
*  And the message is really, [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9760.68s)]
*  it's a version of to thine own self be true, right? [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9762.960000000001s)]
*  And Rourke's designs are to avant garde. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9766.0s)]
*  Nobody appreciates him. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9769.84s)]
*  And he just keeps doing what he wants to do. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9771.12s)]
*  And it's just focused on his own visions, his own genius. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9774.64s)]
*  I think that's been really inspiring [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9777.92s)]
*  to kind of creators of all types. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9779.519999999999s)]
*  I think it's barely unrealistic [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9781.359999999999s)]
*  as a portrait of human achievement, [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9783.8s)]
*  but it's an aspirational idea. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9786.08s)]
*  I mean, one phrase that comes to mind is, [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9787.68s)]
*  there's a character, I forget which one, [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9790.64s)]
*  who is in some sort of adversarial relationship [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9792.56s)]
*  with Howard Rourke and says something to him like, [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9795.68s)]
*  well, Mr. Rourke, what do you think of me? [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9797.439999999999s)]
*  And Rourke says, I don't think of you. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9800.279999999999s)]
*  And that, Chirrand, was the ideal. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9803.72s)]
*  You're not thinking of other people. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9805.359999999999s)]
*  You're an island unto yourself. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9807.119999999999s)]
*  You're focused on your own goals, your own capacities, [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9810.08s)]
*  and you're not doing it to impress other people [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9814.0s)]
*  or to be better than other people [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9816.599999999999s)]
*  or to dominate other people. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9818.0s)]
*  You're doing it because you're expressing [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9819.16s)]
*  your inner soul in a way. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9820.8s)]
*  So that has been very captivating to so many. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9823.56s)]
*  And The Fountainhead is one of those books [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9827.4s)]
*  we talked about that causes, [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9828.96s)]
*  people read it and they make changes in their life, [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9830.519999999999s)]
*  or they feel called to their higher self. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9832.52s)]
*  And I think there's also the scene where Rourke, [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9835.4s)]
*  with the Dean of Architecture at the school, [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9838.84s)]
*  that's speaking to what you're saying, [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9840.640000000001s)]
*  I think to me is inspiring. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9842.960000000001s)]
*  So this is the Dean of Architecture that expels Rourke, [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9845.36s)]
*  and it brings him into a meeting [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9849.48s)]
*  thinking Rourke will plead for a second chance. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9850.960000000001s)]
*  And the Dean says that Rourke's work [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9853.16s)]
*  is contrary to every principle we have tried to teach you, [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9856.16s)]
*  contrary to all established precedents [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9859.28s)]
*  and traditions of art. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9862.52s)]
*  Do you mean to tell me that you're thinking seriously [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9864.36s)]
*  of building that way when and if you are an architect? [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9866.52s)]
*  And then in a gangster-like way, Rourke says yes. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9870.560000000001s)]
*  And then Dean asks, my dear fellow, who will let you? [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9874.720000000001s)]
*  And Rourke replies, that's not the point. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9878.320000000002s)]
*  The point is who will stop me? [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9880.92s)]
*  Yes. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9884.28s)]
*  I mean, you know, Rand's coming from communist Russia, [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9885.12s)]
*  but it has a bit of the don't mess with Texas flavor. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9887.36s)]
*  I might say that really resonates with this idea [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9890.560000000001s)]
*  of anyone who's felt like they're fighting [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9892.880000000001s)]
*  the powers that be. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9894.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9897.400000000001s)]
*  I thought you might be going to the quote [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9898.24s)]
*  where he says something like, I inherit no tradition. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9900.720000000001s)]
*  I stand at the beginning of one. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9905.28s)]
*  And I really think Rand's thinking about herself [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9907.28s)]
*  when she says that, that she inherits nothing. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9909.68s)]
*  She stands at the start. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9911.76s)]
*  But the fountainhead comes out in the middle of World War II, [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9912.880000000001s)]
*  and it's not, Rand is an unknown writer. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9916.64s)]
*  This is kind of a strange book. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9920.519999999999s)]
*  It's, you know, classic story. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9921.92s)]
*  It's turned down by 12 publishers [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9923.24s)]
*  before one takes a chance on it. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9925.08s)]
*  And Rand really loved this story. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9927.24s)]
*  The editor who read it said this book is great. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9929.48s)]
*  And his boss said no. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9932.24s)]
*  And he said, if you don't take this book, I'm quitting. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9933.88s)]
*  You know, and so she idolized him for doing that. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9937.24s)]
*  So they print it and it becomes a best seller [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9940.599999999999s)]
*  just through word of mouth. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9943.439999999999s)]
*  So it's not advertised, doesn't, [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9945.0s)]
*  it gets one good book review, [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9946.679999999998s)]
*  but people tell each other how much they like this book. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9947.8s)]
*  And it keeps printing and selling out printings. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9951.32s)]
*  It's made into a movie. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9953.48s)]
*  And so it lands in this time when Americans are engaged [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9954.599999999999s)]
*  in this great collective endeavor of World War II. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9958.039999999999s)]
*  They're making all kinds of sacrifices for the collective. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9960.24s)]
*  And I think paradoxically, as they do that, [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9963.72s)]
*  they're drawn to this vision of someone [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9965.599999999999s)]
*  who doesn't have to compromise at all, you know, [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9967.199999999999s)]
*  who is leading their life exactly as they want to. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9969.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, they might be sleeping on an ocean liner [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9972.76s)]
*  because they've been drafted to fight in this war. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9975.359999999999s)]
*  And they're reading the Fountainhead [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9977.08s)]
*  and they're feeling better about themselves. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9978.119999999999s)]
*  And so it's also really interesting. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9979.56s)]
*  The Fountainhead is hugely popular in India, [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9981.64s)]
*  which is fascinating. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9984.48s)]
*  And, you know, talk to people about this. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9985.6s)]
*  And they basically say, this book comes like a breath [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9987.84s)]
*  of fresh air into a very traditional and conformist culture. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9991.119999999999s)]
*  And people just latch onto it and they love it, you know? [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9994.4s)]
*  And it gives them that feeling of freedom and possibility [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=9997.16s)]
*  that they're hoping for. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10000.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it really is a book. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10000.96s)]
*  Atlas Shrugged can be a bit of that too, [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10003.439999999999s)]
*  but it's more of the philosophy, objectivism, [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10005.88s)]
*  and the details and the nuances [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10008.88s)]
*  that seeps into Atlas Shrugged. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10010.32s)]
*  The Fountainhead is very much like a thing [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10012.64s)]
*  that makes you change the path of your life. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10015.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10017.8s)]
*  And that, I mean, that's beautiful to see [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10018.679999999998s)]
*  that books can have that power. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10020.519999999999s)]
*  And, you know, Rand knew that she was doing that [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10022.64s)]
*  and she knew what she was doing. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10026.759999999998s)]
*  You know, this wasn't an accident. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10028.72s)]
*  People say, oh, she's a bad writer. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10030.56s)]
*  Oh, her characters are so heavy-handed. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10032.4s)]
*  You know, she started as a screenwriter. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10034.48s)]
*  She started as someone who analyzed films [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10036.0s)]
*  for movie studios. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10039.119999999999s)]
*  She knew exactly how to manipulate plot [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10040.199999999999s)]
*  and character and drama. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10043.52s)]
*  And she also knew that she was writing, you know, [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10045.439999999999s)]
*  people say, oh, Rand is for, you know, adolescents. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10048.32s)]
*  Adolescent teenagers love Rand. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10051.199999999999s)]
*  And that's kind of who she was writing for. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10052.6s)]
*  And she said, you know, I'm writing for people [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10054.359999999999s)]
*  as they start out on their life [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10055.84s)]
*  and they're thinking about who they wanna be. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10057.039999999999s)]
*  So she's not writing, you know, for the weary middle-aged. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10059.8s)]
*  She's writing for the young who are looking for inspiration. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10063.96s)]
*  You know, people say that to me sometimes [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10066.4s)]
*  about certain books like Rand, but also about The Alchemist. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10067.92s)]
*  I know a lot of people for whom The Alchemist, [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10072.84s)]
*  and they're adults and they're brilliant people, [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10075.84s)]
*  The Alchemist changed their life. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10078.16s)]
*  And the same can be said about The Fountainhead. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10080.48s)]
*  I, and I sometimes get criticized [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10083.08s)]
*  for using words that are too simple. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10087.240000000002s)]
*  I think simple words can have power. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10091.08s)]
*  And the cliche thing sometimes needs to be said. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10095.320000000002s)]
*  And sometimes, if effectively, [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10098.68s)]
*  needs to be said in an over-the-top way [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10101.44s)]
*  in the mythic register, [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10104.76s)]
*  because that's the thing that resonates with us. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10107.52s)]
*  Because we are like heroes of our own story. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10109.92s)]
*  And we need to hear that message sometimes [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10112.44s)]
*  to take the bold step, to take the risk, [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10114.92s)]
*  to take the leap. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10117.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, the other thing, [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10118.08s)]
*  she knew she was doing kind of propaganda in a way. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10119.32s)]
*  She was like, I'm doing pro-capitalist propaganda. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10122.92s)]
*  She has a degree from the University of Leningrad. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10125.24s)]
*  You know, she was raised up in Soviet Russia. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10127.16s)]
*  She said, we need to present the case for the other side [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10129.04s)]
*  in the same way. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10132.76s)]
*  And that's what she did. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10134.24s)]
*  Why do you think she's so divisive? [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10136.2s)]
*  People either love her or hate her. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10137.92s)]
*  I mean, I think it's because of that purity [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10140.6s)]
*  that I'm willing to say, [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10143.28s)]
*  that sort of you get what you deserve [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10145.28s)]
*  and that kind of lack of charity. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10147.72s)]
*  And part of that in her work [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10150.76s)]
*  is because she creates this fictional world [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10152.68s)]
*  where she can set everything up just so. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10154.84s)]
*  And so you don't have contingency or accident or bad luck, [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10157.72s)]
*  or you don't really have a lot of children. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10163.96s)]
*  You don't have handicapped people. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10166.6s)]
*  You know, you just have this idealized world. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10167.68s)]
*  And I think it's really infuriating [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10170.96s)]
*  for people who feel that's so inaccurate. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10173.519999999999s)]
*  How can you be deriving a social theory [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10175.279999999999s)]
*  and philosophy around this? [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10177.72s)]
*  And how can you be missing what seems to many people, [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10179.839999999998s)]
*  she's missing the kind of ethical instinct [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10182.519999999999s)]
*  or the altruistic or charitable instinct. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10185.56s)]
*  And so they just become enraged at that. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10188.0s)]
*  And they don't want to see anyone go that far. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10190.599999999999s)]
*  And they're outraged that someone went that far, [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10193.599999999999s)]
*  did the thing that Frank Knight said no one would do. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10196.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's very unsettling. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10199.92s)]
*  Would you say that's her main blind spot, [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10202.84s)]
*  the main flaw of objectivism is just how black and white [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10206.4s)]
*  it paints the world? [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10210.960000000001s)]
*  Or if not, what would you say are the flaws of objectivism? [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10212.6s)]
*  So, I mean, the big flaw is that it's justified [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10217.76s)]
*  through a fictional world. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10220.84s)]
*  You know, it's not justified [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10222.28s)]
*  through reference to the real world. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10224.48s)]
*  You know, it's not empirical in a way. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10226.04s)]
*  And Rand herself would say that she's not writing [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10229.759999999998s)]
*  about things how they are, but how they should be. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10233.599999999999s)]
*  And so that idealism, it just really undermines [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10237.08s)]
*  it as a mechanism to understand where we're actually living. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10244.56s)]
*  And that is a big contrast with Milton Friedman [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10247.519999999999s)]
*  who would focus on how things are [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10250.039999999999s)]
*  versus how things should be. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10252.359999999999s)]
*  And then I think it's the problem of elevating rationality [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10254.64s)]
*  over any other mode of insight or thinking. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10258.4s)]
*  And so what happens in Rand's life, [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10261.08s)]
*  and I describe this in some detail in the book, [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10262.76s)]
*  is she essentially creates a cult of reason around her. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10265.359999999999s)]
*  And people who are drawn into this cult, [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10269.56s)]
*  it's called the collective. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10273.32s)]
*  It's a group of young people in New York City [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10274.96s)]
*  who are drawn to her work. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10277.44s)]
*  And she's already famous, but she's writing Atlas Shrugged. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10279.24s)]
*  And so she's sharing drafts of Atlas Shrugged [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10281.64s)]
*  as she goes along. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10285.039999999999s)]
*  And one of the members of the collective [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10286.44s)]
*  to bring all of this together is Alan Greenspan, [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10288.6s)]
*  later be head of the Federal Reserve. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10291.04s)]
*  And he's incredibly taken with her. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10292.720000000001s)]
*  He's one of these people who says, [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10294.720000000001s)]
*  I was a narrow technical thinker. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10296.76s)]
*  I never thought about ethics or politics [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10298.52s)]
*  or anything bigger until I met Ayn Rand. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10301.08s)]
*  And she really opened my mind. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10302.76s)]
*  So he's part of this tight knit group. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10304.36s)]
*  But over time, in this tight knit group, [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10306.800000000001s)]
*  they think of themselves, we are all individualists. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10308.32s)]
*  We're dedicated to individualism and capitalism. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10310.44s)]
*  We're different than everybody else. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10312.52s)]
*  Over time, they all come to share Ayn Rand's views [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10314.8s)]
*  and opinions on everything from music to art to clothes. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10318.439999999999s)]
*  She gets a dining room table [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10323.88s)]
*  and a bunch of them get the same dining room table. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10325.16s)]
*  And it becomes incredibly conformist [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10327.72s)]
*  because they've all believed they're acting rationally. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10330.92s)]
*  And they believe that to act rationally [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10335.039999999999s)]
*  is to agree with Ayn Rand. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10336.8s)]
*  And they believe there's no other way [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10338.279999999999s)]
*  to make decisions than rationality. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10340.72s)]
*  And so to disagree with her is to be irrational. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10343.4s)]
*  They don't want to be irrational. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10346.359999999999s)]
*  So people get really caught up [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10347.44s)]
*  in this very damaging cult-like circle around her. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10349.76s)]
*  Plus, for a cult of reason, they get awfully emotional [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10353.84s)]
*  when there's any disagreement with Ayn Rand. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10359.24s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of hilarious. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10362.16s)]
*  It's absurd, but it's, [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10364.8s)]
*  I mean, it's also beautiful to watch this singular figure. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10368.56s)]
*  We've talked about several singular figures [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10372.2s)]
*  in like Frank Wright that shakes up the world [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10374.320000000002s)]
*  with her ideas. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10378.720000000001s)]
*  And of course it would form a cult. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10380.36s)]
*  And of course that cult would be full of contradictions [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10382.16s)]
*  and hypotheses. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10384.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10386.52s)]
*  So Murray Rothbard, who's a famous anarchist, [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10387.960000000001s)]
*  falls into the Ayn Rand cult. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10390.08s)]
*  And then he disagrees and there's some type of show trial [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10392.28s)]
*  where he's told he's wrong about everything. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10397.800000000001s)]
*  And then he has a little sort of pseudo cult of his own. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10400.28s)]
*  And two of his cult members switch over to Ayn Rand. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10403.320000000002s)]
*  And then one of them to show, [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10406.92s)]
*  to gesture their breaking of their relationship, [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10410.960000000001s)]
*  mails him a dollar bill that's been torn in half. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10413.44s)]
*  I mean, this is high theatrics, right? [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10417.0s)]
*  Okay, sticking on the drama and the theatrics, [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10421.08s)]
*  who was Nathaniel Brandon? [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10424.480000000001s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10426.720000000001s)]
*  Take me through the arc of Ayn Rand's relationship [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10427.6s)]
*  with Nathaniel Brandon to their dramatic falling out [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10430.48s)]
*  in 1968. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10433.039999999999s)]
*  Yes, so after The Fountainhead, [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10434.24s)]
*  The Fountainhead is auctioned to be, [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10438.279999999999s)]
*  is sold to be a film. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10439.72s)]
*  So Ayn Rand moves to Hollywood [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10440.84s)]
*  where she's gonna help in the writing of the film. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10442.88s)]
*  She wants a lot of creative control. [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10444.519999999999s)]
*  And she's also still working in screenwriting [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10446.68s)]
*  and things like this. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10448.64s)]
*  And so she gets a letter from a Canadian student [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10449.48s)]
*  who's written to her several times. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10453.88s)]
*  And then he writes again and he says, [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10455.88s)]
*  "'Cause I'm at UCLA." [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10457.24s)]
*  And she's like, [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10458.56s)]
*  "'Young man, you're so full of error. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10459.4s)]
*  Why don't you come visit me and I'll straighten you out?' [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10460.56s)]
*  And so he comes and they have this real meeting [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10463.64s)]
*  of the minds, they talk all night. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10465.72s)]
*  He comes again, he brings his girlfriend, she loves him. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10467.92s)]
*  And they start this very intense relationship [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10471.039999999999s)]
*  of spending every weekend at her house, basically. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10474.199999999999s)]
*  Staying up all night, talking about ideas. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10477.199999999999s)]
*  He becomes completely converted [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10479.0s)]
*  to the objectivist worldview. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10480.48s)]
*  Rand begins counseling him and his girlfriend [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10483.24s)]
*  about their relationship. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10485.4s)]
*  Very intense thing. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10487.92s)]
*  Then eventually they graduate from college [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10489.28s)]
*  and they both enroll in a graduate program in Columbia. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10491.28s)]
*  And they leave. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10494.08s)]
*  And after they've left, Ayn Rand is just bereft. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10495.56s)]
*  And within a few months, she packs up her home [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10499.4s)]
*  and she moves to New York. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10502.039999999999s)]
*  Here I am, I like New York better. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10503.56s)]
*  And so that becomes the seedbed of the collective. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10505.44s)]
*  And the Brandons, they get married. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10507.8s)]
*  They change their name to Brandon. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10510.4s)]
*  They've never publicly spoken on this, [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10512.6s)]
*  but many people pointed out it has the word Rand [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10515.96s)]
*  in the name. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10519.119999999999s)]
*  So it's some type of acknowledgement [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10520.48s)]
*  of how important she is to them. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10522.56s)]
*  And time goes on and romantic feelings develop [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10524.64s)]
*  between Ayn Rand and Nathaniel Brandon, [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10528.439999999999s)]
*  some 20 years her junior. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10530.599999999999s)]
*  And they discuss them and they realize [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10531.96s)]
*  that rationality has led them to the conclusion [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10535.48s)]
*  that they should be lovers. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10538.039999999999s)]
*  Right. Right. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10539.32s)]
*  They've rationally decided this, [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10540.279999999999s)]
*  but because they're rational, they need the consent [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10542.039999999999s)]
*  or at least to inform their partners. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10545.52s)]
*  They're both married. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10547.36s)]
*  They're both married. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10548.28s)]
*  So they call a meeting and they obtain the consent [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10549.2s)]
*  or maybe simply inform the others [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10553.68s)]
*  of the rationality of the choice. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10556.28s)]
*  And then they say, but this is only going to be [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10558.16s)]
*  an intellectual relationship, [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10561.2s)]
*  but we'd like a few hours alone each week. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10562.640000000001s)]
*  And we don't wanna be deceptive, [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10564.880000000001s)]
*  so we want you to know and approve of this. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10566.36s)]
*  So the spouses who bought into rationality, [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10568.24s)]
*  know and approve, one thing leads to another. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10570.68s)]
*  It becomes a full romantic and sexual relationship. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10574.0s)]
*  And although it's open within these four people, [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10577.4s)]
*  it is not open more broadly. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10579.36s)]
*  And so in all these meetings of the collective, [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10581.4s)]
*  Alan Greenspan, all these other people coming up, [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10584.36s)]
*  drinking coffee all night, talking, talking, [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10587.08s)]
*  they all know that Nathaniel Brandon [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10589.36s)]
*  is objectivist number one. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10591.08s)]
*  They don't know that there's a romantic [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10592.72s)]
*  and sexual relationship happening. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10595.28s)]
*  It's kept a secret. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10596.76s)]
*  And then when Atlas Shrugged comes out, [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10597.68s)]
*  it's panned by reviewers. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10600.64s)]
*  People absolutely hate this book. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10602.36s)]
*  And Rand is not Howard Roark. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10604.28s)]
*  She falls into a deep depression [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10606.92s)]
*  because her masterpiece has been rejected. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10608.640000000001s)]
*  And so then the romantic relationship ends, [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10611.400000000001s)]
*  but the close personal relationship continues. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10615.24s)]
*  And then over time, Brandon, who's still married to his wife, [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10618.32s)]
*  begins an affair with another young woman. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10622.480000000001s)]
*  And at this point, he has started [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10625.32s)]
*  the Nathaniel Brandon Institute to teach objectivism. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10627.2s)]
*  And he's making good money. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10630.84s)]
*  He's becoming quite famous. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10632.52s)]
*  She supported the Institute. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10633.84s)]
*  She supported it. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10635.04s)]
*  And at first it was to help her in her depression [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10635.880000000001s)]
*  because he said, the world needs to recognize your genius. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10638.76s)]
*  They missed Atlas Shrugged, but I'm going to teach them. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10641.8s)]
*  I will bring the message. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10644.04s)]
*  And it's very successful. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10645.64s)]
*  It becomes its own business. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10647.0s)]
*  It has a newsletter. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10648.12s)]
*  It's a whole world. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10649.04s)]
*  So that small cult around Ayn Rand expands [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10650.0s)]
*  to this whole social network. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10652.8s)]
*  And it's very much a piece [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10654.0s)]
*  with this burgeoning conservative movement. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10655.6s)]
*  Objectivists are involved in criticizing the draft [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10657.44s)]
*  and there's kind of a libertarian objectivist world going on. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10661.76s)]
*  All of this is happening. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10665.960000000001s)]
*  In the meantime, Nathaniel Brandon has found a new partner [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10667.32s)]
*  and he does, but he doesn't tell Ayn Rand this [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10670.12s)]
*  because he knows she'll be upset. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10672.08s)]
*  And so it goes on for years. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10673.84s)]
*  And Ayn Rand knows something is going on [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10677.16s)]
*  but she can't quite figure it out. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10682.16s)]
*  And it finally, Barbara Brandon says to Nathaniel Brandon, [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10683.76s)]
*  you have to tell her. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10687.880000000001s)]
*  This has just gone on too long. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10689.76s)]
*  So she finds out and the whole thing blows up [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10691.76s)]
*  and she exiles him and she breaks off contact with him. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10694.599999999999s)]
*  And nobody has ever told what happens. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10698.56s)]
*  It's called the objectivism. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10701.199999999999s)]
*  Objectivism breaks in two because some people say, [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10702.92s)]
*  how could Ayn Rand do anything wrong? [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10707.279999999999s)]
*  And other people say, what is this letter all about? [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10708.92s)]
*  And what did Nathaniel Brandon do? [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10712.16s)]
*  And I'm not just going to take her word for it. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10713.72s)]
*  I need more information. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10715.24s)]
*  And then a bunch of people, I've read all the accounts [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10716.36s)]
*  of this, a bunch of people are like, okay, [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10719.76s)]
*  they were having an affair. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10721.36s)]
*  And a bunch of other people are like, no, [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10722.880000000001s)]
*  that couldn't possibly be happening. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10724.560000000001s)]
*  And so the whole thing breaks up. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10726.400000000001s)]
*  But what I argue in my book is actually this is [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10729.52s)]
*  to the benefit of Rand's ideas because Rand herself [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10732.400000000001s)]
*  was so controlling over her ideas. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10736.04s)]
*  And now that she steps back from a public role, [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10738.6s)]
*  objectivism flows into the student libertarian movement, [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10742.800000000001s)]
*  some objectivists become conservatives. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10747.04s)]
*  It just kind of spreads out more generally. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10748.16s)]
*  And you don't have to drink the Kool-Aid. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10750.480000000001s)]
*  You don't have to take the official course. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10753.12s)]
*  Nathaniel Brandon goes on to be part [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10754.960000000001s)]
*  of the self-esteem movement, [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10756.400000000001s)]
*  killer human potential movement, California. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10758.36s)]
*  And Ayn Rand lives another 10 years or so, [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10761.68s)]
*  but she doesn't do major work after that. [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10764.76s)]
*  So since we were talking about some of the, [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10767.52s)]
*  although rationalized some strange sexual partnerships [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10771.26s)]
*  that they're engagement in, [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10776.86s)]
*  I have to ask about the fountainhead [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10779.539999999999s)]
*  and the quote unquote rape scene in the fountainhead. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10781.46s)]
*  Was she intending to add that there to be controversial? [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10785.1s)]
*  How are we supposed to read into it? [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10790.14s)]
*  Is it a glimpse into Ayn Rand's sexuality? [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10792.62s)]
*  And maybe broadly we can say, [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10795.74s)]
*  what was her view on this, [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10798.34s)]
*  on sexuality, on sex, on power dynamics in relationships? [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10800.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's also an objectivist theory [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10804.380000000001s)]
*  of sexuality that probably the least convincing [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10806.78s)]
*  of all the parts of objectivism. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10810.42s)]
*  And it goes something like your sexual desires [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10812.26s)]
*  express your highest values. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10815.7s)]
*  And they are related in some ways to your rationality, [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10820.18s)]
*  which is also related to your highest values. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10823.74s)]
*  So for her that explained her attraction [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10826.02s)]
*  to Nathaniel Brandon and Nathaniel Brandon's attraction [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10829.94s)]
*  to her was a function of their highest values. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10832.78s)]
*  And in fact, Brandon imbibed this so deeply [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10835.78s)]
*  that the fact that he was later drawn sexually [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10838.060000000001s)]
*  to a woman who was not particularly accomplished, [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10840.6s)]
*  but was beautiful caused him deep anguish and guilt [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10844.02s)]
*  for being not objectivist. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10847.78s)]
*  So this is the objectivist theory. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10849.42s)]
*  Then the gender politics are just crazy. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10851.78s)]
*  And we have to kind of back up and think, okay, [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10855.82s)]
*  so who is Ayn Rand? [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10857.14s)]
*  She's born Elisa Rosenbaum in Russia. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10858.460000000001s)]
*  She is someone who stands out from the crowd [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10861.26s)]
*  from the beginning. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10863.9s)]
*  She never really fits in. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10864.74s)]
*  She's not conventionally beautiful [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10866.74s)]
*  by any stretch of the imagination. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10868.58s)]
*  She struggles with her weight [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10870.1s)]
*  and she doesn't consider herself to have a beautiful face. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10871.460000000001s)]
*  She's very independent. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10874.78s)]
*  She meets none of the metrics [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10876.74s)]
*  of traditional femininity at all. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10878.62s)]
*  She finds love with a man who is very handsome, [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10880.7s)]
*  but very passive. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10883.7s)]
*  Yet she writes in all her fiction [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10885.980000000001s)]
*  about strong manly heroes. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10887.960000000001s)]
*  So this seems to be like a projection. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10890.140000000001s)]
*  The man she's actually with is not a strong manly hero. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10892.560000000001s)]
*  The hero she writes about, [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10895.740000000002s)]
*  she probably wouldn't be able to be in the same room [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10897.1s)]
*  with them for more than one minute [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10898.820000000002s)]
*  before they got into raging argument, right? [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10900.1s)]
*  And then she develops this theory about women and men [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10902.800000000001s)]
*  in that a woman should worship her man. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10907.140000000001s)]
*  And a woman finds her true expression [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10911.58s)]
*  in worshiping the man she's with. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10914.7s)]
*  So again, this is not at all how Ayn Rand lives her life. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10916.86s)]
*  This is like this, I would say compensatory theory [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10919.74s)]
*  for her lack of ability to conform [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10924.08s)]
*  to the gender norms of her day. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10926.74s)]
*  She then articulates them in a very strong [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10929.02s)]
*  and almost distorted and exaggerated way to compensate [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10933.38s)]
*  for the fact that she doesn't actually meet them [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10936.9s)]
*  and can't actually enact them. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10938.86s)]
*  The rape scene to some degree embodies that idea [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10941.58s)]
*  that to some degree that the woman should worship the man. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10944.98s)]
*  I tend to read it more in terms of literary genre. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10950.14s)]
*  So Rand is a screenwriter, a consumer of movies, [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10953.66s)]
*  and that rape scene is like paradigmatic [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10960.62s)]
*  for the romance genre. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10964.3s)]
*  In other words, these like pulpy romance novels. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10966.5s)]
*  The hero rapes the heroine and then they fall in love. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10970.5s)]
*  That's just the trope of how it works. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10973.7s)]
*  So it's crazy when you read it, [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10975.74s)]
*  but if you were reading a bunch of novels in this genre, [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10977.58s)]
*  you would find this is like very standard. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10980.619999999999s)]
*  And so that is a huge part of this appeal at the time. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10983.74s)]
*  There's this feminist who hates Susan Brownmiller [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10987.22s)]
*  and she wants to write an angry denunciation [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10991.14s)]
*  of the rape scene. [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10993.58s)]
*  So she goes to get the fountain head and she's wondering [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10994.46s)]
*  how is she ever gonna find the scene [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10996.7s)]
*  in this 800 page book. [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=10998.3s)]
*  It's a library copy because she doesn't wanna buy it. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11000.66s)]
*  And it just falls open to the rape scene [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11002.859999999999s)]
*  because everybody's gone and read it [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11005.58s)]
*  because it's very racy and explicit for that time. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11007.099999999999s)]
*  So I'm almost positive she also knew that. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11010.38s)]
*  Like if I put in this kind of taboo breaking sex scene, [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11013.539999999999s)]
*  that's also gonna probably be why people [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11017.14s)]
*  tell their friends about it. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11019.019999999999s)]
*  So I think it's a mess. [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11020.019999999999s)]
*  I think all of the gender and sexuality stuff [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11022.34s)]
*  that she states is just a total mess. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11026.62s)]
*  I think it also reminds me of another guy related, [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11029.980000000001s)]
*  Friedrich Nietzsche, who had very strong opinions on women [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11033.78s)]
*  and wrote about what women's roles in society should be [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11038.18s)]
*  and different power dynamics and relationships [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11042.66s)]
*  and all that kind of stuff when he himself [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11045.220000000001s)]
*  really had trouble getting laid. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11047.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11049.140000000001s)]
*  And so you have to sort of always maybe chuckle [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11049.980000000001s)]
*  or take with a grain of salt the analysis [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11054.3s)]
*  of power dynamics and relationship from these figures [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11057.66s)]
*  which failed in many regards in their own private life. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11059.9s)]
*  You mentioned feminists. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11066.82s)]
*  Would you consider Ayn Rand a feminist? [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11067.9s)]
*  I mean, she's almost an anti-feminist [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11070.66s)]
*  because she then goes on and someone writes her a letter [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11073.98s)]
*  about like, should there be a female president or something? [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11079.66s)]
*  This is like the beginning of feminism. [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11083.300000000001s)]
*  And she says, no, no woman should ever be president [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11084.82s)]
*  because if she's president, she wouldn't be able to look up [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11090.74s)]
*  to any man because she would be so powerful. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11094.62s)]
*  And therefore she would be like corrupt [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11096.98s)]
*  and like rotten in the soul and like unfit to be a leader. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11098.5s)]
*  And it just makes no sense. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11101.42s)]
*  But that said, she's a woman [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11104.58s)]
*  and she's one of the most powerful intellects [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11106.14s)]
*  in the 20th century. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11107.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11108.94s)]
*  And so it's the contradictions. [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11109.78s)]
*  I mean, Nietzsche is full contradictions of this sort [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11112.26s)]
*  that the very fact that she's one of the most powerful minds [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11115.66s)]
*  in history to me means that she is a feminist [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11123.06s)]
*  in the spirit she embodies, right? [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11126.22s)]
*  In what she represents. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11130.300000000001s)]
*  I mean, she lived the ideals of individualism in her life [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11131.380000000001s)]
*  and set aside gender norms in her own life [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11134.62s)]
*  but she did not see herself as part of any, [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11137.02s)]
*  she did not see herself as doing this [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11139.9s)]
*  for the benefit of other women [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11141.82s)]
*  or to change society's views about women. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11143.539999999999s)]
*  There was no collective essence to it. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11146.699999999999s)]
*  So if feminism has some sort of collective aspect to it [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11148.539999999999s)]
*  or at least some identification, one needs to identify [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11154.98s)]
*  with a broader category of women [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11158.74s)]
*  and feel their acting in behalf of that. [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11160.26s)]
*  She's definitely not doing that. [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11161.94s)]
*  And she did, she was fair to women in her life [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11163.859999999999s)]
*  promoted them in her life, but did not, [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11170.26s)]
*  I mean, she was very negative about feminism. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11173.02s)]
*  And then because like they dress terribly, [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11174.98s)]
*  and then the other thing, it's really interesting. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11178.14s)]
*  She had, there's all these kind of homoerotic themes [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11180.22s)]
*  in her writing. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11182.9s)]
*  And for that reason, many gay men were drawn to her writing. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11184.3s)]
*  And then she would say like homosexuals [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11188.98s)]
*  are dirty, terrible people. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11190.779999999999s)]
*  She would denounce people for being homosexual. [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11192.3s)]
*  So there's a whole actual literature [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11194.82s)]
*  of like gay men wrestling with Rand [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11196.26s)]
*  and how she like, what she says about gay people. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11199.3s)]
*  So yeah, it's hard to make sense of. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11202.14s)]
*  And I just think of the enormous pressures. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11205.779999999999s)]
*  I wanna be charitable. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11209.259999999998s)]
*  I just think of the enormous pressure she was under [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11210.099999999999s)]
*  in the culture she was raised in, [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11212.66s)]
*  the expectations that were placed upon her [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11214.019999999999s)]
*  and her just utter inability to meet any of them. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11216.259999999998s)]
*  And it came out in this very tortured set of ideals [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11219.099999999999s)]
*  that she tried to promote. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11222.619999999999s)]
*  And this kind of lack of ability to introspect in herself [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11224.74s)]
*  and to, it was probably too painful to introspect [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11229.539999999999s)]
*  and to think about that. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11233.02s)]
*  So she just tried to rationalize her way through it [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11233.98s)]
*  and it came out in these very strange theories. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11238.42s)]
*  Why do you think that Ayn Rand is, [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11241.5s)]
*  maybe you can correct me, but as far as I can see, [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11244.34s)]
*  never mentioned in the list of great thinkers in history [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11247.26s)]
*  or even the great thinkers of the 20th century [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11249.9s)]
*  or even the great female thinkers of the 20th century. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11252.38s)]
*  So you have somebody like Simone de Beauvoir, [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11256.14s)]
*  Hannah Arendt. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11259.42s)]
*  I almost never see her in the list. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11261.14s)]
*  If you Google those silly list, top whatever, [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11262.98s)]
*  top thinkers of the 20th century, she's not mentioned. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11268.339999999998s)]
*  Why is that? [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11270.98s)]
*  A lot of people just deeply dislike Rand. [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11272.46s)]
*  They deeply dislike her ideas [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11275.019999999999s)]
*  and they don't think they're profound [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11276.74s)]
*  because their disconnection from other ideas [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11278.7s)]
*  and other understandings of human society. [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11282.42s)]
*  I think where you could look at them and say, [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11284.62s)]
*  these ideas are very provocative and they're very deep [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11288.740000000002s)]
*  because she's not taking anything for granted [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11291.78s)]
*  and she's flipping everything around [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11293.94s)]
*  and forcing you to really think. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11295.58s)]
*  To a lot of other readers, to her critics, [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11297.7s)]
*  they just look absurd. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11300.18s)]
*  How could you even make these contentions? [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11301.900000000001s)]
*  And I think that because she's not without precedence [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11305.06s)]
*  and she's not without followers, [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11309.380000000001s)]
*  but she doesn't knit herself into an intellectual community [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11310.78s)]
*  the way that these other thinkers do very naturally. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11316.82s)]
*  You can see who they influence. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11319.9s)]
*  You can see who they're in dialogue with. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11322.460000000001s)]
*  I think my book was one of the first to really take Rand [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11325.18s)]
*  and say, she's a figure in American history. [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11328.380000000001s)]
*  Here's who she's connected to. [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11330.54s)]
*  Here's who she's influenced. [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11332.06s)]
*  I got a lot of pushback for that. [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11334.9s)]
*  I think now people are more open to it, [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11336.859999999999s)]
*  but I think the people who compile these lists [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11340.22s)]
*  really dislike her work and they think it's shallow [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11343.699999999999s)]
*  because they find her fiction overdrawn. [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11346.5s)]
*  They find her work in the mythic register simple. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11350.82s)]
*  And she's also a grand systematic thinker [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11354.019999999999s)]
*  in an age that's over systems. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11357.619999999999s)]
*  She's almost, she's creating an inverse Marxism. [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11360.14s)]
*  Marx was writing in 1848. [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11363.34s)]
*  He's not a thinker of the mid 20th century. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11365.26s)]
*  So I think that's part of it. [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11368.5s)]
*  The lack of a legacy and the dislike of what she had to say [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11371.06s)]
*  and the feeling that she's too detached. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11374.3s)]
*  Her insights are not insights because they're too idealized [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11376.82s)]
*  rather than being rooted in a theory of human nature [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11380.1s)]
*  that people find plausible. [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11383.58s)]
*  You study and write about history of ideas [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11387.94s)]
*  in the United States over the past 100 years, [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11391.3s)]
*  100 plus years. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11393.539999999999s)]
*  Well, how do you think ideas evolve and gain power [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11396.179999999998s)]
*  over the populace, over our government, over culture? [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11399.38s)]
*  Just looking at evolution of ideas as they dance [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11404.74s)]
*  and challenge each other and play in public discourse. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11407.619999999999s)]
*  What do you think is the mechanism by which they take hold [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11415.179999999998s)]
*  and have influence? [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11417.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a couple of different ways [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11419.380000000001s)]
*  I think it happens. [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11422.26s)]
*  I really am interested in the relationship [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11424.26s)]
*  between the thinker and then the reader [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11427.7s)]
*  and the interpreter of the ideas. [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11431.5s)]
*  And then the conditions on the ground [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11434.1s)]
*  that make that idea resonate or not resonate. [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11436.460000000001s)]
*  And so I think a lot. [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11441.02s)]
*  So as an intellectual historian, I'm studying ideas [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11444.460000000001s)]
*  always putting them in their historical context. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11447.42s)]
*  What is happening that is making these things resonate [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11449.42s)]
*  that is making people seek them out. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11452.380000000001s)]
*  So for Rand's case, she has this credibility [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11456.06s)]
*  because of her experience of communism, [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11459.14s)]
*  which is one of these defining moments of the time. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11461.26s)]
*  And then I think the idea comes out in a sort of pure form [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11464.82s)]
*  and then other people rework it and reshape it [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11468.1s)]
*  as they read it. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11471.02s)]
*  And I'm really interested in how people form communities [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11471.94s)]
*  around these ideas. [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11474.42s)]
*  So a bunch of people started calling themselves objectivists [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11475.38s)]
*  and getting together to read Rand's work. [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11479.3s)]
*  That was spontaneous and ground up [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11482.22s)]
*  and wasn't supported by any money. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11484.939999999999s)]
*  Nobody planned it, it just happened. [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11487.779999999999s)]
*  Friedman's a different case in that he joins [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11489.74s)]
*  an established tradition of thought [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11491.859999999999s)]
*  that's been institutionalized in universities. [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11493.539999999999s)]
*  So people are signing up and paying money [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11495.98s)]
*  and getting credential to learn these ideas. [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11498.099999999999s)]
*  So to my mind, these are two different ways, [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11500.42s)]
*  but really emblematic ways of how ideas spread. [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11502.82s)]
*  So Rand, I think of this more bottom up, [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11506.42s)]
*  like people encounter the idea in a book, [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11508.539999999999s)]
*  they're kind of blown away by it, [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11511.1s)]
*  or they imbibe it without even realizing [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11512.46s)]
*  they're imbibing it. [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11514.5s)]
*  And then they're like, well, maybe I don't like [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11515.38s)]
*  Franklin Roosevelt so much, [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11516.9s)]
*  or maybe I'll look at another time at Barry Goldwater. [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11518.22s)]
*  And then whereas Friedman, you get the idea more top down, [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11521.9s)]
*  I know I'm getting the idea, [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11525.699999999999s)]
*  I know I'm being positioned within a sort of elite discourse [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11526.94s)]
*  of economics. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11529.9s)]
*  And so I think they kind of go top down and bottom up, [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11531.300000000001s)]
*  and then they hit the events, right? [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11533.94s)]
*  Friedman's ideas wouldn't have gone anywhere [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11536.42s)]
*  without that episode of stagflation [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11538.66s)]
*  that really made people think they proved out. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11541.5s)]
*  And I think Rand's ideas really caught fire [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11544.14s)]
*  in Cold War America that's looking for a statement of like, [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11546.66s)]
*  what does it mean to be an individual? [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11549.460000000001s)]
*  What does it mean to live in this mass society? [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11551.74s)]
*  Because it's also a time of great social conformity [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11554.300000000001s)]
*  and where people are suddenly, [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11557.380000000001s)]
*  they're working for large corporations. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11558.82s)]
*  They've been served in a large military. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11561.98s)]
*  The United States is stepping out onto the world stage, [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11565.5s)]
*  everything is bigger. [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11567.539999999999s)]
*  What does it mean to be an individual in that world? [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11568.38s)]
*  And that's where Rand's ideas catch fire. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11570.18s)]
*  So I think a lot about that, [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11572.5s)]
*  about how they trickle through different levels of society [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11574.619999999999s)]
*  and then how ideas collide with experience, [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11576.619999999999s)]
*  I think is critical. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11579.539999999999s)]
*  What do you think about when they actually [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11580.539999999999s)]
*  take power in government? [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11582.74s)]
*  So I think about ideas like Marxism [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11584.42s)]
*  and how that evolves into the Bolshevik Revolution [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11587.7s)]
*  and how that takes hold in its implementations. [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11591.74s)]
*  Or you can think about Nazism and with Hitler [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11594.58s)]
*  where it goes from a small number of people [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11598.02s)]
*  that get real excited about a thing [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11601.18s)]
*  and then somehow just becomes viral [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11602.7s)]
*  and takes hold in power and then that has its consequences. [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11605.7s)]
*  When I think about this sort of historical path of communism [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11610.539999999999s)]
*  and the kind of logics and dynamics of communism, [[03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11616.34s)]
*  I mean, in many ways it has some echoes with Rand [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11619.54s)]
*  in that the ideology in its purest form [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11623.900000000001s)]
*  is almost, it's a rationalist ideology of some ways. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11627.54s)]
*  It's an analysis of history [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11630.580000000002s)]
*  and how things are supposed to be. [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11631.820000000002s)]
*  And I think you mentioned Hannah Arendt, [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11632.94s)]
*  I think she has one of the most kind of penetrating analyses [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11635.060000000001s)]
*  of communism, which she really puts in the category [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11638.02s)]
*  of like it's a logical ideology, [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11641.300000000001s)]
*  logic leads inexorably to its conclusions [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11644.78s)]
*  and then experience crops up and experience is different. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11647.46s)]
*  And what does a sort of cult of rationality do [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11650.94s)]
*  when it hits experience? [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11654.78s)]
*  Well, it tries to bend experience to its will. [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11655.82s)]
*  And that I think is really the story of communism writ large. [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11658.5s)]
*  So the question though is why does it catch fire? [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11664.58s)]
*  Why does it draw people into political allegiance? [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11668.66s)]
*  I think in the case of communism, [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11671.42s)]
*  it's this dream of a more ethical world, [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11673.16s)]
*  dream of equality, dream of the powerless [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11676.8s)]
*  rising up against the powerful. [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11679.36s)]
*  I mean, that's drawn in so many. [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11680.8s)]
*  And then you had the whole edition of Leninism, [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11684.2s)]
*  which gave a kind of international cast to that [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11688.2s)]
*  and helped people think about what are the relations [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11690.76s)]
*  between poor and richer countries [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11693.68s)]
*  and what can we expect out of them and what might happen, [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11695.4s)]
*  gave us sort of a framework for thinking about that. [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11697.56s)]
*  In a time when the world was becoming more interconnected [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11700.32s)]
*  and those differences were becoming more obvious. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11704.119999999999s)]
*  You know, fascism to me is unleashing more something primal, [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11706.92s)]
*  something sort of dark and primal within people. [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11713.8s)]
*  And it's more a permission structure to indulge in that [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11716.8s)]
*  that is normally not there. [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11721.52s)]
*  Those impulses are normally channeled or held down. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11723.119999999999s)]
*  And it seems that when the fascist regimes come into power, [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11725.52s)]
*  they give people permission to let those forces out. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11728.66s)]
*  I think on communism, [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11732.58s)]
*  going back to that lecture that Ayn Rand gave, [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11735.02s)]
*  I think what rings true to me a little bit is that [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11739.539999999999s)]
*  what fuels it is a kind of, maybe not resentment, [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11743.42s)]
*  but envy towards the people that have, [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11747.06s)]
*  the have nots versus the haves. [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11752.18s)]
*  And there's some degree to which Nazism has the same [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11753.92s)]
*  of envy towards some group, resentment towards some group. [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11756.58s)]
*  So it's given the environment of hard times, [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11760.38s)]
*  hard economic times combined with the more primal, [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11763.9s)]
*  just envy of not having and seeing somebody who has it [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11768.14s)]
*  and just constructing a narrative around that, [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11772.9s)]
*  that can become a real viral idea. [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11776.06s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like communism is more animated [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11779.32s)]
*  by this idea of injustice. [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11782.2s)]
*  You know, the world is unjust. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11783.74s)]
*  It should be different. [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11785.14s)]
*  And fascism seems like the process of scapegoating, right? [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11786.619999999999s)]
*  We've identified the source of the problem [[03:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11790.98s)]
*  and it's this group and they need to be punished [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11794.3s)]
*  for what they've done to the rest of us. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11798.58s)]
*  There is a primal thing, going back to literature in 1984, [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11800.619999999999s)]
*  two minutes of hate, [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11805.06s)]
*  where you can get everybody real excited about hating a thing. [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11806.66s)]
*  And there's something primal about us humans [[03:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11811.779999999999s)]
*  where once you're in that state of hate, [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11816.1s)]
*  anyone can direct that hate towards anything, [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11818.140000000001s)]
*  towards any group, towards any idea, towards anything, [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11822.18s)]
*  because we get caught up in the mass hysteria [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11828.42s)]
*  of the hatred, the dangerous thing. [[03:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11831.18s)]
*  You floated the idea, I forget where, [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11835.54s)]
*  of pivoting for your next book [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11839.4s)]
*  towards maybe writing about postmodernism, [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11842.26s)]
*  which is a set of ideas, [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11847.32s)]
*  almost the opposite of Ayn Rand's philosophy. [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11849.02s)]
*  So can you maybe explain your curiosity about, [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11851.02s)]
*  first of all, spaces of ideas, but maybe postmodernism? [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11855.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think in the broadest sense, [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11860.7s)]
*  what I'm interested in, kind of two dimensions [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11863.2s)]
*  that guide me in doing intellectual history. [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11866.28s)]
*  One is what I talked about. [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11868.44s)]
*  How does an idea go from a book, an elite space, [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11869.480000000001s)]
*  out to more popular dimensions? [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11874.84s)]
*  How does that happen? [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11876.36s)]
*  What happens to the idea along the way? [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11877.28s)]
*  How is it distorted or changed? [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11878.76s)]
*  And the other is just search for meaning [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11880.52s)]
*  in a post-Christian era or a secular era. [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11882.44s)]
*  What are people coming up with? [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11885.68s)]
*  And I think to replace that void [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11888.04s)]
*  in their religious or spiritual lives, [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11891.6s)]
*  I think both Rand and Friedman [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11893.18s)]
*  offered these sort of alternatives, right? [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11895.16s)]
*  Objectivism is quasi-rationalist religion. [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11897.04s)]
*  People take economics as a theory of the world [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11901.080000000002s)]
*  that you can almost believe in it, right? [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11905.080000000002s)]
*  It can almost take that place. [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11907.960000000001s)]
*  And in both cases, how do those ideas travel? [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11909.400000000001s)]
*  When I think about postmodernism, [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11911.560000000001s)]
*  it first struck me, [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11913.84s)]
*  if you read the original postmodern thinkers, [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11916.400000000001s)]
*  it's really tough going. [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11919.04s)]
*  I mean, I make my students do it and they suffer. [[03:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11920.28s)]
*  I think they see it's worthwhile, [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11922.76s)]
*  but it's no fun to read Derrida. [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11924.160000000002s)]
*  But somehow it's trickled down into, [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11926.88s)]
*  how do we go from Derrida to Tumblr? [[03:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11929.76s)]
*  And I sort of realized like, [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11932.24s)]
*  oh, this has happened with postmodernism. [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11933.6s)]
*  It's followed the same path [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11935.72s)]
*  that say from Milton Friedman's economic theory [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11938.48s)]
*  to free to choose on YouTube. [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11941.4s)]
*  We've had a similar path of high French theory [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11943.16s)]
*  down to Tumblr and I sexually identify [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11946.28s)]
*  as an attack helicopter or whatever it may be. [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11950.36s)]
*  And so that was really interesting. [[03:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11952.48s)]
*  And then I also thought, well, at the same time, [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11955.64s)]
*  this is clearly a structure of meaning. [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11959.96s)]
*  And I actually think it's followed [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11962.24s)]
*  the same path of objectivism, [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11964.279999999999s)]
*  which is turning into its opposite, [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11966.119999999999s)]
*  like distilled down and then turning into its opposite. [[03:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11968.64s)]
*  So if objectivism was a group of people [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11971.119999999999s)]
*  who considered themselves individualists [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11973.84s)]
*  who ended up deeply conforming [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11975.56s)]
*  to the dictates of a charismatic leader. [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11977.519999999999s)]
*  Postmodernism started about disrupting binaries. [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11980.199999999999s)]
*  That was, we're gonna be fluid. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11983.439999999999s)]
*  We're gonna go beyond the border. [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11986.32s)]
*  We're gonna disrupt the binary. [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11987.16s)]
*  And it's devolved in its popular forms [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11988.72s)]
*  to the re-inscribing of many different binaries. [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11990.88s)]
*  Oppressor and oppressed has become this like [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11994.0s)]
*  paradigmatic set of glasses [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11997.08s)]
*  you put on to understand the world. [[03:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=11998.56s)]
*  So I think the dynamics are very, very similar. [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12000.48s)]
*  So I think it's something in the traffic of the idea [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12002.8s)]
*  from its pure form to its popular form. [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12005.439999999999s)]
*  And then how it gets politicized or mobilized [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12009.24s)]
*  in different ways. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12011.88s)]
*  And behind it all, I think is this human longing [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12012.72s)]
*  for meaning and the inadequacy of the traditional ways [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12014.84s)]
*  that need was met at this point in time. [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12019.24s)]
*  By the way, that going from pure form to popular form. [[03:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12022.28s)]
*  I remember this might be before the internet, [[03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12025.72s)]
*  but when I was in college reading Derrida and Foucault [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12028.48s)]
*  and like not knowing context at all, [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12032.44s)]
*  this is interesting, right? [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12035.64s)]
*  This is like, I'm able to read pure encapsulations [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12037.16s)]
*  of an idea and just kind of like, [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12041.04s)]
*  well, that person believes that and you just kind of hold it. [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12043.24s)]
*  But then you realize if you actually take the pure form [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12046.72s)]
*  of that idea and then it creates a community around it, [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12049.88s)]
*  you realize like what that actually becomes. [[03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12052.519999999999s)]
*  And you're like, oh yeah, no, I don't. [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12054.96s)]
*  That's not, although I do consider myself sexually [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12058.16s)]
*  an attack helicopter, that's it. [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12062.56s)]
*  Identify sexually, yes, beautiful. [[03:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12064.199999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[03:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12066.359999999999s)]
*  So your process of researching for, let's say, [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12067.2s)]
*  the biographies of Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12073.800000000001s)]
*  seems like an insane amount of work. [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12076.480000000001s)]
*  You did incredible work there, [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12080.640000000001s)]
*  going to the original sources. [[03:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12082.880000000001s)]
*  Can you maybe speak to that? [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12085.480000000001s)]
*  What is required to persevere and to go for so many years, [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12087.240000000002s)]
*  to go so deep? [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12095.08s)]
*  To the sources. [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12097.2s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, I go to the archive. [[03:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12098.04s)]
*  That's where I feel like I'm communing with the dead [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12100.400000000001s)]
*  in some ways, I'm seeing what they saw in some ways [[03:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12104.6s)]
*  and reading what they felt. [[03:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12108.16s)]
*  And I tell my doctoral students, [[03:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12109.960000000001s)]
*  it's gotta be something that gets you out of bed [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12113.240000000002s)]
*  in the morning because there comes a point [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12114.68s)]
*  in your doctoral career when nobody's, [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12117.2s)]
*  there's nowhere to go, there's nowhere to be. [[03:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12119.720000000001s)]
*  You gotta be getting up [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12121.800000000001s)]
*  because you're interested in what you wanna study. [[03:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12122.640000000001s)]
*  And so with Rand, it was this real sense of discovery. [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12124.28s)]
*  I am discovering, I wanna know about this woman, [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12126.72s)]
*  I wanna know where she fits. [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12129.039999999999s)]
*  And the only way to find out is to do the research. [[03:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12130.359999999999s)]
*  And so, yeah, I like to go deep. [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12133.519999999999s)]
*  It's really interesting to me. [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12138.56s)]
*  And I should say in both of these cases, [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12141.56s)]
*  I've done it in an institutional structure. [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12143.32s)]
*  I don't know that I would do it independently. [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12145.24s)]
*  So the first was a graduate program in history, [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12147.24s)]
*  was at UC Berkeley. [[03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12149.359999999999s)]
*  And so I had coursework and then I had structures. [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12150.92s)]
*  And I did have people to check in with and read, [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12154.8s)]
*  but I had a great deal of latitude. [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12156.56s)]
*  I'm very grateful for it. [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12158.199999999999s)]
*  People are like, you wrote a dissertation [[03:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12159.24s)]
*  on Ayn Rand at Berkeley. [[03:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12160.8s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, hell I did. [[03:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12161.88s)]
*  Berkeley's like, it's a great place. [[03:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12163.88s)]
*  And at the time I was there, [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12165.56s)]
*  there was absolute room for free inquiry. [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12167.16s)]
*  Oh, can you just like linger on that? [[03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12169.599999999999s)]
*  So when you said that you're doing that [[03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12171.4s)]
*  and doing a dissertation on Ayn Rand, [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12173.88s)]
*  was there, did people get upset? [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12176.56s)]
*  No, I did have a friendly critic [[03:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12180.439999999999s)]
*  who took it upon himself to throw at me everything [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12183.88s)]
*  he thought the outside world would throw at me. [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12186.8s)]
*  I think maybe five or 10 years earlier, [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12189.119999999999s)]
*  it wouldn't have been possible. [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12191.8s)]
*  But the most important thing I had to, [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12193.48s)]
*  the person I really had to convince this was worth doing [[03:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12196.96s)]
*  was myself, you know, [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12199.199999999999s)]
*  because I knew it was an unconventional choice [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12200.32s)]
*  for the field and for a dissertation. [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12203.039999999999s)]
*  But once I convinced myself, I just said, [[03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12204.8s)]
*  well, I'm gonna do this and see. [[03:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12207.52s)]
*  And because it was unconventional, [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12209.16s)]
*  it ended up standing out. [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12210.84s)]
*  But it really was a time, [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12213.119999999999s)]
*  I was started during second Bush administration, [[03:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12216.199999999999s)]
*  George W. Bush, second term. [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12219.8s)]
*  People were interested in just conservatism in general [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12222.44s)]
*  and felt no matter where they stood on the political spectrum [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12225.119999999999s)]
*  felt like objectively we don't know enough about this [[03:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12228.48s)]
*  and this is a problem. [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12230.64s)]
*  And so they were open to learning more. [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12231.48s)]
*  So I really kind of caught that wave in scholarship [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12233.32s)]
*  and caught that wave in American cultural people [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12236.8s)]
*  wanted to know more. [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12238.64s)]
*  I wish you'd probably say that, I mean, [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12239.56s)]
*  I ran is at the very least, as you've mentioned, [[03:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12242.48s)]
*  a kind of gateway to conservatism. [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12245.56s)]
*  Yes, I called her the gateway drug [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12247.199999999999s)]
*  in that people start with Rand or taken by her. [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12249.279999999999s)]
*  In some ways she takes the worldview of Milton Friedman [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12253.439999999999s)]
*  in terms of what capitalism can accomplish economically. [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12257.439999999999s)]
*  And then she puts it in this mytho poetic register [[03:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12261.72s)]
*  and she fictionalizes it. [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12264.48s)]
*  So once people have absorbed that, [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12265.68s)]
*  they want more, they go on to learning more [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12267.72s)]
*  of the ideas behind that vision [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12271.4s)]
*  or they have become true believers, they've converted. [[03:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12273.4s)]
*  And so then they head off to work for a politician, [[03:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12276.199999999999s)]
*  to work for a think tank, to work for a party. [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12278.96s)]
*  It's absolute traffic. [[03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12280.599999999999s)]
*  Now, not everyone, there's plenty of people [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12281.56s)]
*  who read on Rand who don't take the politics in. [[03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12282.88s)]
*  It's a nice story, it's interesting. [[03:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12285.359999999999s)]
*  Just an episode in their life. [[03:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12288.599999999999s)]
*  But for others, it's really foundational, [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12289.84s)]
*  it really changes them. [[03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12291.64s)]
*  So those were the people I wanted to track very deliberately. [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12292.8s)]
*  I wasn't trying to do in the round everything about Ayn Rand. [[03:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12295.2s)]
*  I was like Ayn Rand and the American right, [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12298.800000000001s)]
*  goddess of the market, Ayn Rand [[03:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12301.240000000002s)]
*  and the American right is the title. [[03:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12302.68s)]
*  So where did they take her, [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12303.960000000001s)]
*  those who took her in this political direction? [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12306.6s)]
*  What difference did she make? [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12308.400000000001s)]
*  If we return to the actual, your process. [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12310.240000000002s)]
*  So you're showing up, you're reading sources [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12314.400000000001s)]
*  and you're like, is it kind of like the process of discovery? [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12318.68s)]
*  You're just kind of like taking it all in [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12321.68s)]
*  and seeing what unifying ideas emerge [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12323.44s)]
*  or maybe special moments that illustrate an idea emerge. [[03:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12328.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I know with the biography of a person, [[03:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12332.76s)]
*  I am already given a start and an end date [[03:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12336.800000000001s)]
*  and a rough narrative of what happens. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12339.560000000001s)]
*  So I have a kind of structure. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12341.6s)]
*  And then with Rand, both with Rand and Friedman, [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12343.92s)]
*  I started by reading their major books [[03:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12346.880000000001s)]
*  before I really read anything about them [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12349.12s)]
*  because I wanted my own experience [[03:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12350.8s)]
*  of the material to be fresh. [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12353.32s)]
*  And I had read some Ayn Rand, but not a lot. [[03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12354.84s)]
*  Similarly, I had read some Friedman, but not a lot. [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12357.679999999998s)]
*  So I had first is like, let me read the major stuff, [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12359.92s)]
*  get oriented and then just dive into the archive [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12362.08s)]
*  and see what's there. [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12365.199999999999s)]
*  Who are they talking to? [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12367.56s)]
*  What's going on? [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12368.64s)]
*  In Rand's case, I was interested in her [[03:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12370.439999999999s)]
*  in the United States, not her in Russia. [[03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12374.199999999999s)]
*  I didn't have the language skills to do that. [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12375.88s)]
*  So we start her in the United States [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12378.48s)]
*  when she publishes her first book [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12380.84s)]
*  and she starts getting letters. [[03:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12382.28s)]
*  And who is she writing to? [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12383.960000000001s)]
*  Who's writing to her? [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12385.320000000002s)]
*  And then I start to uncover this world [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12387.160000000002s)]
*  of kind of nascent conservatism. [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12388.76s)]
*  And I'm kind of putting that together. [[03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12390.36s)]
*  And once I have enough, I say, well, that's a chapter. [[03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12391.800000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna cover that chapter. [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12394.92s)]
*  And then there's gonna be, the book has come out. [[03:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12396.800000000001s)]
*  And so now I need to start a different chapter. [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12400.0s)]
*  What's her life like after the book has been published? [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12401.640000000001s)]
*  And then I look for that. [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12404.12s)]
*  But I'm really, although I have this very high level [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12405.0s)]
*  structure, it's coming out of the archive, [[03:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12408.24s)]
*  the material I'm finding. [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12410.72s)]
*  And if I'm not finding the material there, [[03:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12412.76s)]
*  I won't cover it in great detail. [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12414.8s)]
*  Or if I've decided it's outside my ambit, [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12417.199999999999s)]
*  I'm not gonna go into great depth on it. [[03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12419.76s)]
*  And you're trying to understand the relationships. [[03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12421.96s)]
*  It's so fascinating, like reconstruct in a dark room, [[03:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12423.84s)]
*  trying to reconstruct, shine a light on relationships [[03:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12428.119999999999s)]
*  through reading letters. [[03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12431.32s)]
*  It's interesting. [[03:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12433.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[03:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12433.96s)]
*  I mean, correspondence is really, really helpful. [[03:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12434.8s)]
*  Drafts, correspondence, and someone this famous, [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12437.160000000002s)]
*  they have oral histories, other people write about them. [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12440.960000000001s)]
*  So you're reading all these different things [[03:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12443.720000000001s)]
*  and kind of triangulating and trying [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12445.240000000002s)]
*  to sort of put them together. [[03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12446.76s)]
*  And then think about how do I present this [[03:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12447.92s)]
*  in a compelling story? [[03:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12450.6s)]
*  And what do I need to explain? [[03:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12451.720000000001s)]
*  And then also for me, what was really helpful [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12453.960000000001s)]
*  is that because I teach and I am explaining [[03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12456.160000000002s)]
*  the kind of broad sweep of 20th century history. [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12459.44s)]
*  So I know that Rand's involved in a labor action [[03:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12461.800000000001s)]
*  at Warner Brothers, but through my teaching, [[03:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12466.52s)]
*  I realized, oh yes, this is a moment [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12468.92s)]
*  of labor strikes across the country. [[03:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12470.640000000001s)]
*  And so then that really changes the origin story [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12473.12s)]
*  of Atlas Shrugged, because she's looking at labor actions [[03:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12476.4s)]
*  and she originally thinking of the book [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12480.28s)]
*  as being called the strike. [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12482.16s)]
*  So she's really responding in real time [[03:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12483.960000000001s)]
*  and being inspired by what's happening [[03:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12486.48s)]
*  in the mid 1940s in the United States. [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12489.44s)]
*  So then I can kind of take that and run with that [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12492.4s)]
*  and figure out where to go. [[03:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12494.720000000001s)]
*  So you're super passionate about teaching. [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12496.2s)]
*  You mentioned Milton Friedman [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12498.92s)]
*  who had a very interesting way of teaching. [[03:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12500.0s)]
*  So what's your, how do you think of teaching? [[03:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12505.2s)]
*  Teaching history, teaching history of ideas, [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12508.0s)]
*  teaching bright young minds about the past. [[03:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12510.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's great. [[03:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12513.400000000001s)]
*  It's really inspiring. [[03:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12514.44s)]
*  The ways the old school kind of dominating way [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12515.880000000001s)]
*  in which Friedman taught would not fly [[03:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12519.04s)]
*  in today's university wouldn't be permitted. [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12520.92s)]
*  And also the students wouldn't respond to it. [[03:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12524.64s)]
*  So I try to share my enthusiasm. [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12527.279999999999s)]
*  I think that's like almost the number one thing [[03:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12530.599999999999s)]
*  I bring is my enthusiasm. [[03:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12532.4s)]
*  Like, look how neat and interesting these ideas are. [[03:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12533.8s)]
*  I try to keep my own views out pretty much. [[03:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12536.599999999999s)]
*  I try to give the fairest possible rendition I can [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12539.519999999999s)]
*  of each thinker. [[03:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12542.92s)]
*  If I find someone really disturbing, [[03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12543.76s)]
*  I might sidebar at the end of the lecture [[03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12546.119999999999s)]
*  and say this kind of, I find this unsettling [[03:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12548.119999999999s)]
*  and this tells me something about myself. [[03:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12550.68s)]
*  But most of the time I'm bringing people into the, [[03:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12553.36s)]
*  like the biography of a great thinker, the context of them. [[03:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12556.720000000001s)]
*  And then we, in the lecture, [[03:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12559.720000000001s)]
*  we'll literally read the work together [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12561.44s)]
*  and we'll talk about it. [[03:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12563.480000000001s)]
*  And I'll ask the students, what are you finding here? [[03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12564.480000000001s)]
*  What's jumping out at you? [[03:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12567.04s)]
*  Kind of breaking down the language [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12569.400000000001s)]
*  and really teaching them how to do deep reading. [[03:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12572.2s)]
*  So I feel like that is my contribution right now. [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12574.560000000001s)]
*  We're having trouble reading collectively. [[03:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12577.2s)]
*  We're having trouble paying attention collectively. [[03:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12579.800000000001s)]
*  And I'm trying to cultivate their skills to doing that [[03:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12582.04s)]
*  and showing them how I do it. [[03:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12586.2s)]
*  And also modeling, like this is how I would read a text. [[03:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12587.6s)]
*  This is what jumps out to me when I look at Thomas Kuhn [[03:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12589.84s)]
*  or something like this. [[03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12593.880000000001s)]
*  And just show them that studying a history of ideas [[03:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12596.0s)]
*  is really fun. [[03:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12598.2s)]
*  I feel incredibly privileged to do it. [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12599.12s)]
*  And the other thing is I think this is the time [[03:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12601.480000000001s)]
*  for students in college, figuring out who they are. [[03:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12604.0s)]
*  Their minds are developing and growing. [[03:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12607.960000000001s)]
*  They can really handle complicated, hard ideas. [[03:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12610.24s)]
*  They don't always have the context behind them. [[03:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12613.199999999999s)]
*  So I need to give them the hard ideas and then show them, [[03:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12614.96s)]
*  this is kind of the context of what's happening in the world. [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12617.0s)]
*  But really I'm just, I'm showing them the landscape. [[03:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12620.0s)]
*  I don't have time to go deep. [[03:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12623.48s)]
*  We have a 10 week quarter, giving them a flyover. [[03:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12625.76s)]
*  And then I want them to know how to go deep [[03:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12629.44s)]
*  and know where they wanna go deep. [[03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12632.119999999999s)]
*  Do the thing that Milton Friedman did, [[03:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12633.84s)]
*  which is in parallel. [[03:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12635.52s)]
*  Yes, do their own parallel curriculum. [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12638.56s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12640.68s)]
*  What advice would you give in terms of reading [[03:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12642.24s)]
*  about ideas you agree with [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12645.08s)]
*  and reading ideas you disagree with? [[03:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12646.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, even though I think the passion is important [[03:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12648.6s)]
*  for the teaching of the ideas, [[03:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12651.0s)]
*  dispassion is more important for the reading [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12653.119999999999s)]
*  and understanding of them. [[03:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12655.16s)]
*  So a lot of people have said to me, [[03:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12658.0s)]
*  I could never write about Ayn Rand. [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12660.439999999999s)]
*  She makes me so angry. [[03:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12661.96s)]
*  I've never become, I don't get angry reading her. [[03:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12664.48s)]
*  I'm like, oh, there you go again. [[03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12667.8s)]
*  Or like, well, that's gonna cause trouble. [[03:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12669.72s)]
*  And so I guess I'm approaching it with a sort of charity, [[03:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12672.599999999999s)]
*  but also with, I don't have huge expectations. [[03:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12676.759999999998s)]
*  I'm not expecting to have the light shine on me. [[03:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12679.759999999998s)]
*  I'm not expecting to agree. [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12682.279999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I can be very clinical about it. [[03:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12683.92s)]
*  So that's what's worked for me. [[03:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12686.32s)]
*  It might not work for others, [[03:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12688.16s)]
*  but, and then I just try to find the humor in it. [[03:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12690.679999999998s)]
*  How funny is it? [[03:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12694.84s)]
*  These different aspects of them. [[03:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12696.0s)]
*  When teaching my students about Oliver Wendell Holmes, [[03:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12698.679999999998s)]
*  like his dad wrote a poem about him. [[03:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12701.119999999999s)]
*  He called him the astronaut [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12704.519999999999s)]
*  about how he came from outer space. [[03:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12706.32s)]
*  He seemed like he came from outer space. [[03:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12707.96s)]
*  I'm like, this is his dad's view of his son. [[03:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12709.56s)]
*  Like that's how weird of a guy he was. [[03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12712.359999999999s)]
*  You know? [[03:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12714.279999999999s)]
*  And so I try to like find that, [[03:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12715.119999999999s)]
*  keep alert for those funny kind of human touches [[03:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12716.72s)]
*  that like these are ultimately just people, [[03:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12719.24s)]
*  people with ideas that they spent enough time [[03:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12721.8s)]
*  polishing up and developing [[03:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12723.679999999998s)]
*  that we still want to read about them 100 years later. [[03:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12724.96s)]
*  What about the dramatic formulation of that same question? [[03:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12727.759999999998s)]
*  Do you think there's some ideas that are good [[03:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12730.64s)]
*  and some of them are evil? [[03:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12732.32s)]
*  Do you think we can draw such lines [[03:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12734.08s)]
*  or is it more complicated like the old Solzhenitsyn line [[03:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12735.8s)]
*  between good and evil that runs to the heart of every person? [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12740.199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I philosophically agree with Solzhenitsyn for sure. [[03:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12743.359999999999s)]
*  I do think some ideas pull on the good side [[03:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12747.32s)]
*  and some ideas pull on the bad side. [[03:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12749.439999999999s)]
*  Like, absolutely. [[03:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12751.119999999999s)]
*  And I think that's probably why people dislike Rand so much [[03:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12752.6s)]
*  is they feel like she's giving license to the bad side [[03:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12757.16s)]
*  and she's saying it's okay to be selfish and it's okay. [[03:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12760.36s)]
*  You know, they feel like she's unloosing the dark forces. [[03:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12762.84s)]
*  And you know, in some cases that may be true, [[03:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12767.84s)]
*  but I also, she's also unloosing some of the light forces [[03:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12770.76s)]
*  in terms of reflecting on yourself and trying to be true. [[03:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12774.28s)]
*  But definitely there are ideas [[03:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12777.6s)]
*  that are dangerous to play with [[03:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12779.800000000001s)]
*  and there are ideas that I think give license [[03:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12781.32s)]
*  to the darker sides of human nature. [[03:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12783.279999999999s)]
*  But I think you can see that in the historical record. [[03:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12788.0s)]
*  So I think that it's possible to show that. [[03:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12791.4s)]
*  And obviously there's some places, you know, [[03:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12795.96s)]
*  like Germany, they think the ideas are so dangerous, [[03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12798.039999999999s)]
*  they can't be allowed to circulate. [[03:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12800.76s)]
*  And in some contexts that may absolutely be true. [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12802.6s)]
*  And then still even that we should take [[03:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12805.0s)]
*  with a grain of salt because perhaps censorship [[03:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12808.56s)]
*  of an idea is more dangerous than an idea. [[03:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12811.84s)]
*  So all of that, that's the beautiful thing about us humans, [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12813.039999999999s)]
*  we're always at tension trying to figure out [[03:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12816.56s)]
*  what ideas are the ones that are going [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12820.44s)]
*  to help humanity flourish. [[03:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12822.0s)]
*  Pothead question. [[03:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12825.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12826.28s)]
*  Do humans have ideas or do ideas have us? [[03:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12827.52s)]
*  So where do ideas come from? [[03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12830.72s)]
*  You have Milton Friedman sitting there [[03:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12832.12s)]
*  after Rutgers trying to figure out [[03:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12833.64s)]
*  what he can do about the Great Depression. [[03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12835.64s)]
*  Do you ever think about this? [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12838.64s)]
*  I sometimes think that aliens are actually ideas. [[03:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12842.76s)]
*  They're just kind of like travel through human brains [[03:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12846.76s)]
*  and like captivate us and we get all real excited. [[03:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12850.52s)]
*  Like with the monolith in 2001, Space Odyssey, [[03:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12857.880000000001s)]
*  a monolith lands and everybody gets excited [[03:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12861.48s)]
*  and somehow this idea just gets everybody [[03:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12864.48s)]
*  to be on the same page and it reverberates [[03:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12868.279999999999s)]
*  through the community and then that results [[03:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12871.76s)]
*  in an implementation of some action that results [[03:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12874.52s)]
*  in us figuring out that that idea was actually bad [[03:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12877.439999999999s)]
*  and we learn new ideas. [[03:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12879.8s)]
*  But it feels like the idea is right in the show. [[03:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12881.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think in a lot of cases, [[03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12884.279999999999s)]
*  I think it's true. [[03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12886.6s)]
*  Keynes has this famous quote, [[03:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12888.32s)]
*  most men are slaves of some defunct economist. [[03:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12890.279999999999s)]
*  That's funny. [[03:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12895.32s)]
*  So I do think that it's really hard [[03:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12896.56s)]
*  to have an original thought. [[03:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12899.64s)]
*  We are social creatures, [[03:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12901.279999999999s)]
*  we encounter the same situations again and again. [[03:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12902.64s)]
*  And so it's really hard, you're born into these traditions [[03:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12905.76s)]
*  of thinking and being and knowing, [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12909.199999999999s)]
*  and most people are never gonna question them [[03:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12911.4s)]
*  and most people are never gonna become aware of them. [[03:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12913.52s)]
*  So again, that's some of the work of what I do [[03:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12915.72s)]
*  as an intellectual historian is like, let's become aware. [[03:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12918.08s)]
*  Let's realize that you're carrying a map [[03:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12921.199999999999s)]
*  that's orienting you to the world in a certain way. [[03:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12923.12s)]
*  I think you have to work really, really hard [[03:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12928.400000000001s)]
*  to have an original idea. [[03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12930.400000000001s)]
*  And even then, it's not a completely original idea. [[03:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12931.640000000001s)]
*  It's a reworking and a reassembling of ideas [[03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12934.84s)]
*  others have had. [[03:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12937.44s)]
*  So I definitely think it's possible to create autonomy [[03:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12938.640000000001s)]
*  in the realm of ideas and to be an autonomous consumer [[03:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12942.480000000001s)]
*  of ideas, but I think on balance, most people are not. [[03:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12945.800000000001s)]
*  And that's fine, they wanna have experiences, [[03:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12950.68s)]
*  they wanna do other things with their life. [[03:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12952.6s)]
*  Well, Jennifer, thank you so much for this journey [[03:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12955.16s)]
*  through ideas today and thank you so much [[03:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12957.84s)]
*  for your incredible work. [[03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12959.6s)]
*  It was really fun and fascinating to talk with you today. [[03:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12961.52s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[03:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12965.32s)]
*  Thank you for listening to this conversation [[03:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12967.2s)]
*  with Jennifer Burns. [[03:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12969.36s)]
*  And now let me try to reflect on and articulate some things [[03:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12971.4s)]
*  I've been thinking about. [[03:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12975.2s)]
*  If you'd like to submit questions or topics [[03:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12976.800000000001s)]
*  that I can comment on in this way here [[03:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12979.36s)]
*  at the end of episodes, go to lexfreeman.com slash ama [[03:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12982.240000000002s)]

*  at lexfreeman.com slash contact. [[03:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12989.720000000001s)]
*  Please allow me to say a few words about my interview [[03:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12993.16s)]
*  with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. [[03:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12996.08s)]
*  Now that a few days have passed [[03:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=12999.320000000002s)]
*  and I've had the chance to think [[03:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13001.800000000001s)]
*  about the conversation itself, the response, [[03:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13003.08s)]
*  future upcoming conversations, and what it all means [[03:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13006.04s)]
*  for the war in Ukraine, for global geopolitics, [[03:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13009.52s)]
*  and for us humans in general. [[03:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13012.96s)]
*  I've gotten a lot of heartfelt positive words [[03:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13015.56s)]
*  from all sides, including at least so far, [[03:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13017.96s)]
*  literally everybody who knows me personally inside Ukraine, [[03:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13021.48s)]
*  which includes a lot of soldiers [[03:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13025.08s)]
*  and many high profile figures, [[03:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13026.96s)]
*  some who are supportive of the president [[03:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13029.16s)]
*  and some who are critical of him. [[03:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13031.56s)]
*  Literally all private communication [[03:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13034.08s)]
*  has been positive and supportive. [[03:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13036.119999999999s)]
*  This is usually not the case with me. [[03:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13038.2s)]
*  Friends usually will write to me to criticize [[03:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13040.400000000001s)]
*  and to disagree. [[03:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13043.04s)]
*  That's the whole point of friendship, [[03:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13044.720000000001s)]
*  to argue and have fun doing it. [[03:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13047.240000000002s)]
*  There was none of that here, at least so far. [[03:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13050.320000000002s)]
*  So thank you for your support [[03:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13053.640000000001s)]
*  and kind words, it means the world. [[03:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13055.560000000001s)]
*  The most common message was please keep pushing for peace. [[03:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13059.04s)]
*  I will. [[03:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13063.2s)]
*  But online, on the interwebs, I saw a lot of attacks, [[03:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13065.04s)]
*  sometimes from swarms of online accounts, [[03:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13069.640000000001s)]
*  which of course makes me suspicious [[03:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13071.720000000001s)]
*  about the origin of those attacks. [[03:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13073.92s)]
*  One of my friends in Ukraine, [[03:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13076.92s)]
*  who by the way thinks the attacks are all propped up [[03:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13078.28s)]
*  by Ukrainian bot farms, said there's no need [[03:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13081.04s)]
*  to say anything extra. [[03:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13084.52s)]
*  Let the interview stand on its own. [[03:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13086.720000000001s)]
*  Just keep focused on the mission of pushing for peace. [[03:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13089.320000000002s)]
*  Basically, he's a Ukrainian version [[03:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13092.880000000001s)]
*  of my other friend, Joe Rogan, [[03:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13094.880000000001s)]
*  who to this day says, don't read the comments. [[03:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13097.560000000001s)]
*  This is generally good advice and I try to follow it, [[03:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13100.6s)]
*  but I'm also a human being. [[03:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13103.880000000001s)]
*  I wear my heart on my sleeve in this interview. [[03:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13105.44s)]
*  This war for me is deeply personal [[03:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13108.68s)]
*  and the level of vitriol, misrepresentation and lies [[03:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13112.2s)]
*  about the conversation and about me personally [[03:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13116.6s)]
*  was particularly intense and disingenuous. [[03:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13118.92s)]
*  So I thought I would use this opportunity to say a few words, [[03:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13122.48s)]
*  just speak a bit more about how I approach [[03:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13125.68s)]
*  this conversation with President Zelensky [[03:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13128.48s)]
*  and conversations in general. [[03:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13130.2s)]
*  This interview is something I poured my heart and soul into, [[03:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13133.0s)]
*  preparing a lot. [[03:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13136.56s)]
*  I've described parts of the preparation process I follow [[03:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13138.880000000001s)]
*  in the outro to the Zelensky conversation. [[03:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13141.720000000001s)]
*  But in general, let me say that I've read a lot, [[03:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13144.28s)]
*  listened to a lot and had a lot of private conversations [[03:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13147.56s)]
*  with people on the ground. [[03:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13150.76s)]
*  I have many flaws, but being unprepared [[03:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13152.72s)]
*  for this conversation is not one of them. [[03:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13155.519999999999s)]
*  Two low effort attacks got to me a bit, [[03:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13159.039999999999s)]
*  if I'm being honest, [[03:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13161.4s)]
*  though I am learning to take it all in stride. [[03:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13162.96s)]
*  First attack is that I'm unprepared, uninformed or naive. [[03:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13166.8s)]
*  I don't give a damn about the trolls, [[03:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13172.72s)]
*  but I want people who listen to me, [[03:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13174.68s)]
*  who support me, who care about my words to know [[03:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13177.28s)]
*  that this is not the case. [[03:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13180.28s)]
*  It never will be the case for future conversations, [[03:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13181.92s)]
*  especially ones of this importance. [[03:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13185.16s)]
*  I work extremely hard to prepare. [[03:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13188.52s)]
*  Second low effort attack that got to me a bit [[03:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13192.16s)]
*  is that I'm a shill for Zelensky or a shill for Putin. [[03:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13195.68s)]
*  Both accusations were hurled readily and freely [[03:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13199.64s)]
*  by the online mob of all persuasions, [[03:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13203.039999999999s)]
*  by the left and the right in the United States and Europe, [[03:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13205.560000000001s)]
*  by the pro and the anti-Zelensky people in Ukraine [[03:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13209.24s)]
*  or of Ukrainian origins, [[03:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13212.44s)]
*  and by the pro and anti-Putin people in Russia [[03:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13214.2s)]
*  or of Russian origins. [[03:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13217.880000000001s)]
*  As I've said over and over, this is not the case [[03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13220.800000000001s)]
*  and will never be the case. [[03:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13224.720000000001s)]
*  I'm a shill for no one. [[03:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13226.800000000001s)]
*  More than that, I just simply refuse to be caught [[03:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13228.76s)]
*  in any one single echo chamber. [[03:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13231.36s)]
*  It's an ongoing battle, of course, [[03:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13233.92s)]
*  because social media algorithms [[03:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13235.64s)]
*  and the various dogmatic groups and tribes out there [[03:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13237.36s)]
*  want to pull you in to their warmer brace of belonging, [[03:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13240.6s)]
*  and humans want to belong. [[03:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13244.92s)]
*  But the cost of the path I have chosen [[03:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13248.56s)]
*  is that I will never belong to any one group. [[03:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13250.76s)]
*  In the end, like many of us must, I walk alone. [[03:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13254.24s)]
*  And I try to do my best to do what is right [[03:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13259.8s)]
*  to my independent heart and mind, [[03:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13262.76s)]
*  not what is popular with any one group. [[03:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13265.36s)]
*  My goals for this conversation were twofold. [[03:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13268.6s)]
*  First, give a large platform to President Zelensky [[03:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13271.4s)]
*  to explain his perspective on the war [[03:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13274.800000000001s)]
*  and to do so in a way that brings out the best [[03:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13277.04s)]
*  in who he is as a leader and human being. [[03:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13279.56s)]
*  Second goal was to push for peace [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13283.0s)]
*  and to give him every opportunity possible to signal [[03:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13285.92s)]
*  that he's ready to make peace [[03:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13288.960000000001s)]
*  and to provide his vision for what that might look like. [[03:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13290.88s)]
*  And just to be clear, by peace, I mean long lasting peace [[03:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13294.96s)]
*  that minimizes suffering of people in the region [[03:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13298.679999999998s)]
*  and maximizes the flourishing of humanity [[03:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13301.199999999999s)]
*  in the coming decades. [[03:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13304.72s)]
*  The war in Ukraine has led to over one million casualties [[03:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13307.359999999999s)]
*  and growing every single day. [[03:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13311.48s)]
*  For some people torn apart by loss, [[03:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13314.439999999999s)]
*  tormented and forced into a state of anger and hate, [[03:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13317.32s)]
*  peace is a dirty word. [[03:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13321.599999999999s)]
*  To them, nothing less than justice must be accepted. [[03:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13323.92s)]
*  I hear this pain. [[03:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13330.039999999999s)]
*  I've seen the bodies and the suffering. [[03:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13332.0s)]
*  It's true, peace will not bring back your loved ones, [[03:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13336.039999999999s)]
*  but it will prevent further slaughter of more people, [[03:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13340.16s)]
*  each of whom are someone else's loved ones. [[03:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13343.199999999999s)]
*  So again, the second goal of this conversation [[03:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13347.48s)]
*  was to push for this kind of peace. [[03:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13350.96s)]
*  So how did I approach it? [[03:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13355.96s)]
*  Every conversation is its own puzzle. [[03:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13358.0s)]
*  So let me try to explain my approach for this one. [[03:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13360.4s)]
*  As I've said, I read and listened to a lot of material [[03:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13363.76s)]
*  since February 24th, 2022. [[03:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13366.64s)]
*  There would be many weeks over the past three years [[03:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13369.92s)]
*  where I would spend every day over eight hours a day [[03:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13371.96s)]
*  of focused reading and research. [[03:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13375.76s)]
*  There were several rabbit holes [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13379.2s)]
*  that I consistently returned to and researched, [[03:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13380.44s)]
*  but the most important line of inquiry [[03:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13383.6s)]
*  was always peace talks, not just in this war, [[03:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13385.240000000002s)]
*  but in other wars in modern history. [[03:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13388.84s)]
*  For this specific war, as part of the background prep, [[03:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13392.080000000002s)]
*  I would take notes on every single perspective I could find [[03:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13395.720000000001s)]
*  on every single major diplomatic meeting and negotiation [[03:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13398.800000000001s)]
*  that happened in Ukraine-Russia relations since 1991. [[03:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13402.04s)]
*  There is a lot of material to go through, [[03:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13407.72s)]
*  and there are a lot of perspectives, [[03:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13410.039999999999s)]
*  even on the very 2019 meeting [[03:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13412.64s)]
*  that President Zelensky spoke about in this podcast. [[03:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13416.039999999999s)]
*  Just as a small but important example, [[03:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13419.039999999999s)]
*  Andrei Bogdan was interviewed twice by Dmitry Gordon [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13421.56s)]
*  and gave a deep inside look [[03:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13425.32s)]
*  of the administration of President Zelensky, [[03:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13427.72s)]
*  including that very 2019 meeting. [[03:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13429.84s)]
*  The two interviews are seven and a half hours, by the way, [[03:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13432.76s)]
*  and from my interviewer perspective [[03:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13437.4s)]
*  are a masterclass of interviewing. [[03:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13439.48s)]
*  Andrei Bogdan worked directly with President Zelensky [[03:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13443.08s)]
*  as the head of the office of the President of Ukraine. [[03:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13446.039999999999s)]
*  He was there for the 2019 face-to-face meeting [[03:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13449.039999999999s)]
*  between Vladimir Zelensky and Vladimir Putin [[03:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13451.84s)]
*  at the Paris Summit, [[03:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13454.88s)]
*  along with French President Emmanuel Macron [[03:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13456.439999999999s)]
*  and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. [[03:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13459.359999999999s)]
*  This was part of the Normandy format peace talks. [[03:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13462.359999999999s)]
*  In those two interviews, [[03:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13466.72s)]
*  Andrei Bogdan gave a very different perspective [[03:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13468.16s)]
*  on that 2019 meeting than did President Zelensky to me [[03:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13471.32s)]
*  in our conversation. [[03:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13475.56s)]
*  The perspective being that the failure [[03:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13477.68s)]
*  to negotiate a ceasefire and peace [[03:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13479.68s)]
*  was not a simple one-sided story. [[03:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13482.519999999999s)]
*  I don't think this is the right time for me [[03:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13486.16s)]
*  to dive into that data point and be critical. [[03:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13487.8s)]
*  I'm not interested in being critical [[03:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13491.64s)]
*  for the sake of criticism. [[03:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13493.039999999999s)]
*  I am interested, once again, [[03:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13494.92s)]
*  in productive conversations, critical or otherwise, [[03:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13497.279999999999s)]
*  that push towards peace, [[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13500.519999999999s)]
*  the kind I described earlier. [[03:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13503.279999999999s)]
*  This is merely an example of a data point [[03:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13505.839999999998s)]
*  I was collecting in my brain. [[03:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13507.679999999998s)]
*  There are many, many others. [[03:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13509.279999999999s)]
*  But all of it taken together made it clear to me, [[03:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13511.759999999998s)]
*  and I still believe this, [[03:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13515.8s)]
*  that it is indeed very difficult, but possible, [[03:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13517.439999999999s)]
*  to negotiate long-lasting peace with Vladimir Putin. [[03:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13521.6s)]
*  It is certainly true that Ukraine is best positioned [[03:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13526.44s)]
*  to negotiate from a place of strength. [[03:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13529.24s)]
*  After the invasion of February 24th, 2022, [[03:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13532.32s)]
*  I believe there were three chances [[03:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13535.68s)]
*  where peace was most achievable. [[03:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13538.12s)]
*  First chance was March and April of 2022, [[03:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13540.880000000001s)]
*  with the successful defense of the North. [[03:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13544.0s)]
*  Second chance was the fall of 2022, [[03:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13546.800000000001s)]
*  with the successful counteroffensive in Kherson and Kharkiv. [[03:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13550.4s)]
*  The third chance is now. [[03:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13554.76s)]
*  As he has stated multiple times publicly, [[03:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13557.6s)]
*  Donald Trump is very interested in making peace. [[03:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13559.72s)]
*  It is likely that the US financial support for this war [[03:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13562.84s)]
*  will continue to dwindle. [[03:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13566.279999999999s)]
*  So the leverage and the timing [[03:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13568.119999999999s)]
*  for peace negotiation is now. [[03:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13570.4s)]
*  There is unlikely to be another chance like this [[03:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13573.16s)]
*  for a long time. [[03:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13576.16s)]
*  Just to zoom out on the conversation piece of this, [[03:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13578.48s)]
*  I interviewed Donald Trump and may do so again. [[03:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13582.0s)]
*  I interviewed Volodymyr Zelensky and may do so again. [[03:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13585.640000000001s)]
*  And it seems likely that I will interview Vladimir Putin [[03:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13588.76s)]
*  in Russia, in the Kremlin. [[03:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13592.4s)]
*  I understand the risks and I accept them. [[03:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13596.4s)]
*  The risks for me are not important. [[03:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13598.84s)]
*  I'm not important. [[03:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13600.68s)]
*  I merely want to do my small part in pushing for peace. [[03:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13602.16s)]
*  In a moment in history, [[03:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13605.2s)]
*  when there's a real chance for that peace [[03:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13606.800000000001s)]
*  to actually be achieved. [[03:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13609.44s)]
*  I may be speaking too long, I'm sorry. [[03:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13612.880000000001s)]
*  But I can probably speak for many more hours. [[03:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13615.16s)]
*  So this is in fact me trying to be brief. [[03:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13617.2s)]
*  So again, my two goals were to bring out the best [[03:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13620.44s)]
*  in the president Zelensky as a leader and a human being, [[03:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13623.48s)]
*  and to give him every opportunity possible to signal [[03:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13626.72s)]
*  that he's ready to make peace, [[03:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13629.84s)]
*  and to lay out his vision [[03:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13631.960000000001s)]
*  for what that peace might look like. [[03:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13633.52s)]
*  Like I said, step one through 10 is prepare well. [[03:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13636.04s)]
*  I did. [[03:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13639.960000000001s)]
*  But step 11 is the actual conversation. [[03:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13641.28s)]
*  There the specific psychological and personality quirks [[03:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13644.800000000001s)]
*  and qualities of the guests matter a lot. [[03:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13647.880000000001s)]
*  My job is to try to cut through the bullshit walls [[03:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13650.12s)]
*  we put up as human beings and reveal directly or indirectly [[03:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13652.2s)]
*  who the person truly is and how they think. [[03:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13656.76s)]
*  With Zelensky, he is a deeply empathic [[03:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13660.0s)]
*  and emotional human being who personally feels [[03:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13663.56s)]
*  the suffering of the people of Ukraine in this war. [[03:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13666.92s)]
*  This is a strength and perhaps also a weakness. [[03:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13669.76s)]
*  But it is an important part of the reason why I said [[03:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13674.32s)]
*  many times that he is a truly historic figure. [[03:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13677.24s)]
*  Very few leaders in recent history [[03:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13682.08s)]
*  would be able to pull off what he did, [[03:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13684.039999999999s)]
*  to stay in Kiev, to unite the country, [[03:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13686.24s)]
*  to convince the West to join the war effort [[03:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13689.039999999999s)]
*  to the degree they did. [[03:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13691.439999999999s)]
*  He is also a showman, [[03:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13694.199999999999s)]
*  to borrow the title of the biography I recommended. [[03:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13695.92s)]
*  A man with many layers of humor and wit, [[03:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13699.16s)]
*  but also ego and temper. [[03:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13702.32s)]
*  Sometimes fully self-aware and sometimes losing himself [[03:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13705.64s)]
*  in the emotional roller coaster of a painful memory [[03:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13709.519999999999s)]
*  or a turn of phrase that he can use as a springboard [[03:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13712.4s)]
*  for a angry soliloquy. [[03:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13716.439999999999s)]
*  Add to this the fact that we didn't agree to anything. [[03:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13719.96s)]
*  What we will talk about or how long we will talk about it. [[03:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13723.04s)]
*  The interview could have easily been five minutes [[03:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13727.36s)]
*  or three hours. [[03:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13729.64s)]
*  So I had to quickly gain his trust enough to open up [[03:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13731.08s)]
*  and stay for a long form conversation, [[03:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13734.52s)]
*  but push him enough to reveal the complexities [[03:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13737.28s)]
*  of his thought process and his situation. [[03:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13739.96s)]
*  This is where humor and camaraderie was essential [[03:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13743.76s)]
*  and I would return to it often, [[03:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13746.52s)]
*  though it was very difficult given the stakes, [[03:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13748.36s)]
*  the heaviness, the seriousness of the topic of the war. [[03:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13750.96s)]
*  So in this case, the approach I followed [[03:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13755.32s)]
*  for this conversation is constant nudges [[03:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13757.4s)]
*  and questions about peace, [[03:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13759.279999999999s)]
*  often using almost childlike statements or questions. [[03:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13761.24s)]
*  I generally like these kinds of questions. [[03:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13765.56s)]
*  On the surface, they may seem naive, but they're not. [[03:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13767.96s)]
*  They are often profound in their simplicity, [[03:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13771.679999999998s)]
*  like a lot of questions that children ask. [[03:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13774.4s)]
*  Remember, it was a child who pointed out [[03:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13777.48s)]
*  that the emperor was not wearing any clothes. [[03:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13780.48s)]
*  I like the simplicity, the purity, [[03:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13783.84s)]
*  the boldness of such questions [[03:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13785.32s)]
*  to cut through the bullshit to the truth. [[03:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13786.68s)]
*  And that truth is that hundreds of thousands of people [[03:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13790.0s)]
*  died in this war and are dying every day. [[03:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13793.0s)]
*  And all the other problems, from corruption [[03:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13797.439999999999s)]
*  to suspended elections to censorship, [[03:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13800.199999999999s)]
*  cannot be solved until peace is made. [[03:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13803.0s)]
*  I give the president every single chance [[03:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13806.32s)]
*  to signal willingness to negotiate, [[03:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13808.84s)]
*  knowing that both Trump and Putin [[03:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13811.36s)]
*  will listen to this conversation. [[03:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13813.8s)]
*  I don't think he took it, [[03:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13816.56s)]
*  and instead chose to speak very crude words [[03:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13818.12s)]
*  towards Vladimir Putin. [[03:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13821.08s)]
*  This is fully understandable, [[03:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13823.2s)]
*  but not directly productive to negotiation. [[03:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13825.44s)]
*  To clarify, I have hosted many conversations [[03:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13828.2s)]
*  that were intensely critical of Vladimir Putin, [[03:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13831.76s)]
*  from Sir Heplohi to Stephen Cotkin. [[03:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13834.48s)]
*  But this conversation is with a world leader, [[03:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13837.48s)]
*  speaking about another world leader [[03:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13840.199999999999s)]
*  during a historic opportunity for peace. [[03:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13842.32s)]
*  Crude words of disrespect, while powerful, [[03:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13846.32s)]
*  may harm negotiations. [[03:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13849.6s)]
*  Peacemaking in this situation requires compromise [[03:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13852.48s)]
*  in order to avoid further death and suffering. [[03:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13856.199999999999s)]
*  And I believe it requires treating the other leader [[03:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13859.6s)]
*  with the seriousness you expect him to treat you with. [[03:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13862.359999999999s)]
*  This is what I was pushing for. [[03:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13866.56s)]
*  All that while also putting my ego aside [[03:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13869.32s)]
*  and letting the president shine, [[03:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13871.679999999998s)]
*  which is necessary to accomplish both goals one and two [[03:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13873.4s)]
*  that I mentioned previously. [[03:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13876.84s)]
*  This is also why I wanted the president [[03:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13878.84s)]
*  to speak about Elon and Trump, [[03:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13881.08s)]
*  to extend the olive branch [[03:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13883.119999999999s)]
*  for further avenues of peacemaking. [[03:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13884.56s)]
*  This is not about politics. [[03:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13887.0s)]
*  It is, once again, simply about peace. [[03:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13888.72s)]
*  Now, all of this, my words, my attempts, [[03:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13892.96s)]
*  were taken out of context [[03:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13896.519999999999s)]
*  and used to attack me by some online mobs. [[03:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13897.84s)]
*  As an example, President Zelensky said in a mocking tone [[03:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13901.32s)]
*  that he thinks that Vladimir Putin is simply irritated [[03:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13905.08s)]
*  by people who are alive in Ukraine. [[03:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13907.599999999999s)]
*  And I answered, quote, [[03:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13910.96s)]
*  if you believe this, [[03:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13913.76s)]
*  it will be very difficult to negotiate. [[03:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13915.16s)]
*  If you think that the president of a country [[03:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13917.56s)]
*  is completely crazy, [[03:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13919.119999999999s)]
*  it is really hard to come to an agreement with him. [[03:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13920.56s)]
*  You have to look at him as a serious person [[03:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13924.04s)]
*  who loves his country and loves the people in this country. [[03:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13926.720000000001s)]
*  And he conducts, yes, destructive military actions. [[03:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13930.720000000001s)]
*  The president interrupted me at this point and said, [[03:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13935.560000000001s)]
*  who are you talking about now? [[03:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13938.6s)]
*  Who loves this country? [[03:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13940.720000000001s)]
*  And I said, Putin. [[03:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13942.720000000001s)]
*  Do you think he doesn't love this country? [[03:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13945.240000000002s)]
*  And the president answered, no. [[03:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13947.640000000001s)]
*  Again, this is not a podcast conversation [[03:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13951.0s)]
*  with a historian or activist. [[03:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13954.359999999999s)]
*  And I somehow out of nowhere, [[03:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13956.119999999999s)]
*  just for fun, waxed poetic about Putin's or Zelensky's [[03:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13957.48s)]
*  or Trump's love of nation. [[03:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13961.88s)]
*  It is a conversation with a world leader [[03:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13964.92s)]
*  discussing the opportunity to negotiate peace [[03:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13967.92s)]
*  when a large number of people are dying every single day. [[03:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13971.84s)]
*  Even if the heart balls over with hate, [[03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13976.679999999998s)]
*  leadership now requires sitting [[03:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13979.439999999999s)]
*  at the negotiation table and compromising. [[03:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13981.68s)]
*  This may be painful, but it is necessary. [[03:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13983.84s)]
*  There are a few other places in the conversation [[03:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13987.359999999999s)]
*  where some online mobs took my words out of context [[03:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13989.4s)]
*  and used them to call me naive and to call for more war, [[03:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13992.48s)]
*  saying peace is impossible with a man [[03:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13996.88s)]
*  who they claim is the second coming of Hitler. [[03:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=13999.24s)]
*  My friends, if you make such attacks on this conversation, [[03:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14003.279999999999s)]
*  it is in fact you who are naive [[03:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14007.56s)]
*  and ignorant of the facts of history and geopolitics. [[03:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14010.52s)]
*  Peace must be made now in order for death [[03:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14015.279999999999s)]
*  and suffering to stop, [[03:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14019.32s)]
*  in order for Ukraine to have a chance to flourish, [[03:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14021.199999999999s)]
*  and in order for the drums of a global war to stop beating, [[03:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14024.119999999999s)]
*  a global war that would cripple humanity. [[03:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14029.24s)]
*  This was my goal, once again, to push for peace. [[03:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14033.56s)]
*  And I will continue this effort to the best of my ability. [[03:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14038.679999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14042.679999999998s)]
*  I love you all. [[03:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4&t=14043.88s)]
