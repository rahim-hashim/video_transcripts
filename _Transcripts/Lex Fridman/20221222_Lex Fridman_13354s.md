# Bhaskar Sunkara: Socialism and Communism | Lex Fridman Podcast #349
**Lex Fridman:** [December 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNlfHgHJweQ)
*  The following is a conversation with Bhaskar Sankara. He's a democratic socialist,
*  a political writer, founding editor of Jacobin, president of the nation, former vice chair of the
*  Democratic Socialist of America, and the author of The Socialist Manifesto, the case for radical
*  politics in an era of extreme inequality. As a side note, let me say that this conversation
*  with Bhaskar Sankara, who's a brilliant socialist writer and philosopher,
*  represents what I hope to do with this podcast. I hope to talk to the left and the right, to the
*  far left and the far right, always with the goal of presenting and understanding both the strongest
*  interpretation of their ideas and valuable thought-provoking arguments against those ideas.
*  Also, I hope to understand the human being behind the ideas. I trust in your intelligence
*  as the listener to use the ideas you hear to help you learn, to think, to empathize,
*  and to make up your own mind. I will often fall short in pushing back too hard or not pushing back
*  enough, of not bringing up topics I should have, of talking too much, of interrupting too much,
*  or maybe sometimes in the rare cases not enough, of being too silly on a serious topic, or being
*  too serious on a silly topic. I'm trying to do my best and I will keep working my ass off to improve.
*  In this way, I hope to talk to prominent figures in the political space, even controversial ones,
*  on both the left and the right. For example, I hope to talk to Donald Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
*  to Ron DeSantis and Barack Obama, and of course many others across the political spectrum.
*  I sometimes hear accusations about me being controlled in some way by a government or an
*  intelligence agency like CIA, FSB, Mossad, or perhaps that I'm controlled in some way by
*  the very human desire for money, fame, power, access. All I have is my silly little words,
*  but let me give them to you. I'm not and will never be controlled by anyone. There's nothing
*  in this world that can break me and force me to sacrifice my integrity. People call me naive.
*  I'm not naive. I'm optimistic. And optimism isn't a passive state of being. It's a constant battle
*  against the world that wants to pull you into a downward spiral of cynicism. To me, optimism
*  is freedom. Freedom to think, to act, to build, to help, at times in the face of impossible odds.
*  As I often do, please allow me to read a few lines from the poem, If, by Rajar Kipling.
*  If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. If you can
*  trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too. If you can wait
*  and not be tired by waiting or being lied about on dealing lies or being hated, don't give way to
*  hating. And yet don't look too good or talk too wise. Even this very poem is mocking my over
*  romantic ridiculousness as I read it. The meta irony is not lost on me, my friends. I'm a silly
*  little kid trying to do a bit of good in this world. Thank you for having my back through all
*  of it. All of my mistakes. Thank you for the love. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,
*  here's Bhaskar Sankara. Let's start with a big broad question. What is socialism?
*  How do you like to define it? How do you like to think about it?
*  Well, there's so many socialists out there and we can't seem to agree about anything. So my
*  definition, I'm sure is really just my definition. But I think at the minimum,
*  socialism is about making sure that the core necessities of life, food, housing, education,
*  and so on are guaranteed to everyone just by virtue of being born so that those people can
*  reach their potential. And I think that's a minimum requirement of socialism. Beyond that,
*  I think socialism, especially democratic socialism, the type of socialism that I believe in,
*  is about taking democracy from just the political democratic realm and extending it into economic
*  and social spheres as well. So if we think that democracy is a good thing, why do we allow our
*  workplaces to be run in autocratic ways? So economic, political, social, in all those
*  realms, the ideas, the philosophical ideas apply. Like what are, if you can put words to it,
*  what are some philosophical ideas about human beings that are at the core of this?
*  I think at the core, it's the idea that we have intrinsic value. We are individuals that have
*  unequal talents, of course. We're individuals that want different things. But this unique
*  individualness can only truly come to light in a society in which there are certain collective
*  or social guarantees. So we could think, just like Stephen Jay Gould, the scientists and
*  socialists used to say, about how many thousands of potential Einsteins or Leonardo da Vinci's
*  that died in sweatshops and on plantations and never got the chance to cultivate what was unique
*  and human about themselves and also never got a chance to have families and impart what was
*  special and important to them, to future generations and to posterity. My own grandmother,
*  I was born in Trinidad and Tobago. She was illiterate till her dying days in East Orange,
*  New Jersey. She never had the chance to write down her memories of her life in Trinidad as a
*  young woman and what it meant. She, of course, had lots of children. She was able to impart some
*  stories to her children and grandchildren. But I often think about what someone with her wit
*  and intelligence could have done with a little bit more support.
*  But if all human beings have intrinsic value, you don't have to be an Einstein
*  for the application of some of the ideas that you're talking about. Is there a tension
*  or a trade off between our human civilization, our society, helping the unlucky versus rewarding
*  the skillful and the hardworking? I think you could do both. There's always a balance
*  between the two. I think you could reward people who make innovations and who improve lives for
*  everyone through their innovations by giving them, let's say, even more consumption, even that level
*  of inequality, while still making sure that there's not people in poverty and suffering,
*  and while making sure that, hey, we're going to give these people who want to work that extra
*  10 hours or 20 hours or want to apply their hard work some extra benefits, but that these
*  benefits would be not the extreme disparities that you have today.
*  So at the core of socialism and maybe democratic socialism is maybe a reallocation of wealth,
*  reallocation of resources? I think it's wealth and resources, yes,
*  but it's also power. And I guess one way to think about this is some thinkers on the right,
*  like Hayek, they would say in their most generous moments talking about socialist and socialism,
*  they would say, socialists want to trade some of your freedom for equality.
*  And that's them trying to just accurately describe what socialism is trying to do. The way that I
*  would put it, it's a little bit different. Socialists are proposing a trade-off, but it's
*  really a trade-off between freedom and freedom. And by that, I mean, let's say you set up a
*  successful business and you set up a business right here in Austin, Texas, some sort of firm,
*  it's producing some widget or whatever, and it's producing a good that people really want and demand,
*  but you have some competition, you decide to hire 20, 30 people to help you. You entered into a free
*  contract with these people who under capitalism, of course, we're not living in feudalism,
*  have the option to join any other firm, but they like you and they like this firm and they like
*  your offer and you're paying them, let's say $20 an hour for 40 hours of work per week.
*  Now, if the government comes along and says, okay, there's now a new minimum wage,
*  the minimum wage is $22 an hour, and also there's a maximum work week, 35 hour work week.
*  And if you work someone over 35 hours, even if they agree, you have to pay them time and a half.
*  Now, that of course is now an abridgment of your freedom as an entrepreneur, your freedom to set
*  certain terms of employment, to engage in a contract with free people. But now your workers
*  and other workers in the sector, because if you did it unilaterally, you just get undercut by your
*  competition. Now, these people now have a few extra hours a week, they can do whatever they want with,
*  they could watch more NFL with it, they could spend more time with their friends or family
*  or whatever else, and they're still getting paid the same if not better because the wages also
*  went up. So it's really a question often of trade-offs between whose freedom and autonomy
*  are you going to prioritize? The freedom and autonomy of the entrepreneur, or the capitalist
*  in this case, or the freedom and autonomy of ordinary workers. Now, you could create a society
*  that swings so far in the direction of prioritizing the freedom of one group or one class or whatever
*  else compared to another, that you end up in some sort of tyranny. Now, if the state said,
*  you Lex, you're a capitalist, so you don't get the right to vote, or we're going to take away your
*  private home or your ability to do things we think are intrinsic human rights. Now, this would be
*  tyranny, this would be an abridgment of your rights, but shaping your ability in the economic
*  sphere to be an economic actor is I think within the realm and scope of democratic politics.
*  Yeah, so those are the extremes you're referring to. And one perspective I would like to take
*  on socialism versus capitalism is under each system, the extremes of each systems and the
*  moderate versions of each system, how can people take advantage of it? So it seems like no matter
*  what part of human nature is, whatever the rules, whatever the framework, whatever the system,
*  somebody is going to take advantage of it. And that's the kind of pragmatic look at it.
*  In practice, what actually happens? Also, the incentives and the human behavior, what actually
*  happens in practice under these systems? So if you have a higher and higher minimum wage,
*  and people watch more and more NFL, how does that change their actual behavior as a productive
*  member of society? And actually at the individual level, as somebody who could be an Einstein,
*  and chooses not to because NFL is so awesome to watch. So like, is both how do malicious
*  people that want to take advantage, maybe not malicious, but people that like me are lazy and
*  want to take advantage. And people that also I think like me, like I tend to believe about myself
*  that I have potential. And if I let my laziness naturally take over, which it often does,
*  I won't materialize the potential. So if you make life too easy for me, I feel like I will never
*  get anything done. Me personally, of course, there's a giant set of circumstances of the
*  unlucky and the overburdened and so on. Okay, so how can people take advantage of each system,
*  socialism, capitalism? So for one thing, people are going to take advantage of systems,
*  they're going to find loopholes, they're going to find ways around, they're going to find ways to
*  at times dominate and coerce others even in systems meant to get rid of domination and coercion.
*  That's why we need to design our systems in such a way that it eliminates as many of these things
*  as possible. And also that's why we need democracy, we need freedom. So in a Soviet system,
*  for instance, you had the rise of this authoritarian bureaucracy that dominated,
*  of course, others in the name of socialism. Now, that system desperately could have used some
*  political democracy and some checks on what people were doing and some ability to reverse
*  their power, right. And as soon as of course, little elements of democracy was brought to that
*  system, the system, you know, collapsed, because there started to be outlets for dissent and for
*  dissatisfaction. So I think we can't design a priori a perfect system, we need to be committed
*  to certain principles that allow systems to be perfected. And for me, that's the importance of
*  democracy. So even a few years ago, not to go on a tangent, but people were allowed in
*  Chinese authoritarianism. And they're saying China is building this efficient system,
*  the state runs so well, there's technocratic excellence, plus there's just productivity,
*  and they're just working harder than Americans and whatever else. But look at in practice,
*  what really happened with COVID, both the initial suppressing of information about what was happening
*  in Wuhan and the outbreak, where many ordinary Chinese workers and doctors and others were
*  trying to get the word out and they were suppressed by Communist Party officials locally in Wuhan,
*  probably with the collusion, naturally, nationally, and now with zero COVID policies and whatever
*  else. So I think that often we find that even though it seems like these are weak systems,
*  and then democracy makes us less competent technocratically and otherwise, I think it's
*  a necessity for systems to grow and evolve to have that freedom in civil society.
*  But as for individuals, now, the first part of it is, yeah, I think people should be free to make
*  their own choices. You might have tremendous potential, but you might choose to spend it in
*  leisure. And leisure doesn't only mean sitting around at home, drinking a bunch of beers,
*  wasting your life away that way. Leisure might mean spending more time with their friends and family,
*  building these relationships that are going to maybe not change the world in some medicines,
*  but will change the lives of the people around you and will change your community for the better.
*  LWIU I'm taking notes here because for me,
*  leisure just meant playing a lot of Skyrim. This whole family relationship thing, I'm going to have
*  to work on that. I didn't realize that's also included in leisure because I'm going to have
*  to reconsider my whole life here. Anyway.
*  JG No, leisure should mean civic activity too, right? I mean, there's that famous book,
*  the Robert Putnam one, Bowling Alone or whatever, which described that for now, I mean,
*  I was born 1989. I like video and computer games. So I definitely do that type of leisure too.
*  But I found a lot more richness in my life when in the last decade, a lot of my leisure has returned
*  to going to the local bar for the couple drinks I have a week instead of doing it at home alone,
*  watching TV or something, because you get that random conversation, that sense of a place and
*  belonging. But I guess what's the undercurrent maybe of your question was, now, if you have a
*  system with lots of carrots, but not the whip of, hey, you might be destitute, you might be
*  unemployed, you might not be able to support yourself unless you're working a certain amount,
*  would we still be as productive? Would we still be able to generate enough value for society?
*  I think that that's a question that is quite interesting. I think that we're living in a
*  society now with enough abundance that we could afford more people deciding to opt out of the
*  system, out of production, and that the carrots of staying in, more money for consumption,
*  more ability to do cool things, more just social rewards that comes from being successful or from
*  providing would be enough. But that's another thing that would have to be balanced in a system.
*  So if we're seeing mass unemployment by choice in a democratic socialist system,
*  then you might need to reconfigure the incentives. You might need to encourage people to go back into
*  production. But that's something that, again, you could do through democracy and through good
*  governance. You don't have to set the perfect blueprint in motion. Write up a treatise now in
*  50 years from now. Try to follow it like it's scripture. By the way, I do like how you said
*  whip instead of stick in a carrot and stick. That's putting a weight on the scale of which
*  is better. But yes, but I would actually argue to push back that the wealthier we get as a society,
*  as a world, that the more comfortable the social nets become, the less of a whip or a stick they
*  become. Because one of the negative consequences, even if you're on welfare, is like, well, life is
*  not going to be that great. But the wealthier we become, the better the social programs become,
*  the easier life becomes at the bottom. And so you might not have this motivation
*  financially to get out from the bottom. That said, the pushback and the pushback is that there's
*  something about human nature in general, money aside, that strives for greatness, that strives
*  to provide a great life, a great middle class life for your family. So that's the motivated
*  to get off from the bottom. Well, I think a lot of people who are stuck at the bottom of the labor
*  market today, one, these are people who are kind of are, are true philanthropists, because a lot
*  of them are the ones who are working two jobs and are working 60 plus hours and are providing
*  a great life. And so I think that's the thing in this country, it's such a such a bargain for their
*  labor because they're so underpaid. So many of the things that the rest of us use to to enjoy life
*  and consumption or whatever else like, I got here from downtown Austin. And I think my lift, you
*  know, I did tip but I think my lift was like eight bucks base or whatever else, you know, it's, it's,
*  that we are all indebted to people who are working and we don't see it at various stages of the
*  production process from, you know, the workers in China and Taiwan producing, you know, technological
*  things that we're recording this on to, you know, growers and workers in agriculture in the US. So
*  I think that one, working class people are already working, but as far as, you know, getting out from
*  under poverty and desperation, we're in a society that doesn't give people a lot of tools. So if you
*  don't have access to good public schools, from, you know, age five until, you know, 1213, it's
*  going to be really hard to move from generations of your family being involved in manual labor
*  to doing other forms of labor, you're going to be stuck at a certain part of our labor market as a
*  result. If you don't have access to decent health care, you know, throughout your life, you might be
*  already preordained to an early grave by the time that something kicks in, you really want to change
*  something in your life in your mid-20s. Obviously, it's a combination of agency and all these other
*  factors. There's still something, I think, innately human, innately striving that a lot of people
*  have, but we don't really give people in our current society the tools to really be full
*  participants in our society. We just take for granted, for example, and I'm from the Northeast,
*  so I give like excessively Northeast examples, but we take for granted that someone from,
*  you know, Hartford, Connecticut, is going to have, your average working class person, Hartford,
*  is going to have a very different life outcome than someone born on the same day, the same hour,
*  and in Greenwich, Connecticut. You know, we take for granted that accidents of birth are going to
*  dictate outcomes. So you mean like, depending on the conditions of where you grew up, there's going
*  to be fundamentally different experience in terms of education, in terms of the resources available
*  to you to allow yourself to flourish? Yes. A poor city and a rich city, and Connecticut is great.
*  It's highly, highly underrated. Both New Yorkers and people from Boston kind of have a colonial
*  feeling about Connecticut where we make fun of it and we try to carve it up. You know, the West
*  belongs to New York, the East to Boston, but you know, I'm here for, you know, Connecticut nationalism.
*  I think it's a great place. Okay. Can we actually step back a little bit on definitions? Because you
*  said that some of the ideas practically that you're playing with is democratic socialism.
*  We talked about the higher level, the higher kind of vision of socialism, the ideals, the philosophical
*  ideas, but how does it all fit into the big picture historically of ideas of Marxism,
*  communism, and socialism as it was defined and experienced and implemented in the 20th century?
*  What's your key differences? Maybe even just like socialism, communism.
*  Yeah. Well, I hate the no true Scotsman sort of response to this, which is,
*  oh, that socialism is bad. So it wasn't really socialism and my socialism is good. So it is
*  socialism. But I think that socialism and communism share a common ancestor, which is they both
*  emerged out of the turmoil and development of late 19th century capitalism and the fact that
*  there was all these workers parties that were organizing across the capitalist world.
*  So in Europe, for instance, you had this mass party called the German Social Democratic Party
*  and they became probably the most important, the most vibrant party in Germany in the 1880s and
*  1890s, but they were locked out of power because Germany at the time was still mostly a Tarkic.
*  It had a parliamentary democracy, but it was a very undemocratic democracy. The Kaiser still ruled.
*  These movements took root across the capitalist world, but including in Russia and in conditions
*  of illegality. So it was assumed for many, many years in the workers movement across Europe and
*  among socialists of Europe, they call themselves social democrats then, that the revolution would
*  first probably happen in Germany in this developed growing hub of industrial capitalism and not in
*  semi-feudal Russia. But then World War I came, the workers movement was split between parties that
*  decided to either keep their head down or to implicitly support the war and then support the
*  war for now or keep your heads down, don't get banned, don't get arrested, then we'll just take
*  power after the war is over. And those like Russia and also in the United States for that matter,
*  they chose the path of resistance to the war. And it was the Bolshevik faction of the Russian
*  movement, Lenin's Bolshevik party that took power in Russia after a period of turmoil where it didn't
*  seem, well, was it going to go to the fascist right or was it going to go to the far left? There
*  was a period of flux and turmoil in Russia, but definitely the old regime was not able to stand.
*  And these Russian social democrats, these Bolsheviks, said social democracy has so betrayed the idea
*  of internationalism and brotherhood and progress it was supposed to stand for that we can't call
*  ourselves social democrats anymore. We're going to go back to this old term that Marx used,
*  we're going to call ourselves communists. And that's where official kind of communism out of
*  Russia emerged. In other parts of Europe, parties were actually able to take power, some in the
*  interwar period, but most in the postwar period. And they also came out of this old social democratic
*  movement. And these parties mostly just call themselves socialists. And a lot of them still
*  on paper wanted to go beyond capitalism, but in practice, they just managed capitalism better in
*  the interest of workers. But they all had the same common ancestor. And in practice, to me,
*  social democracy means trying to insert doses of socialism within capitalism, but maintaining
*  capitalism. Communism met this attempt to build a socialism outside of capitalism, and often
*  authoritarian ways, in part because of the ideology of these communists, but in part because
*  of the conditions in which they inherited. They were inheriting a democracy, they were inheriting
*  a country that had been ruled by the Tsars for centuries. And with very little condition, like a
*  very weak working class, very poor and devastated by war, and so on, where authoritarianism kind of
*  lended itself to those conditions. And then there's me, then there's democratic socialists.
*  And the way I would define it is, we like a lot of what the social democrats accomplished, but we
*  still believe in going beyond capitalism, and not just building socialism within capitalism,
*  but we believe in this ultimate vision of a world after capitalism.
*  . What does that world look like? And how is it different from communism? Actually, maybe we can
*  linger before we talk about your vision of democratic socialism. What was wrong with
*  communism, Stalinism, implementation of communism in the Soviet Union? Why did it go wrong?
*  And in what ways did it not go wrong? In what ways did it succeed?
*  Let me start with the second part of that question. And that's a very difficult one to answer, in part
*  because I morally and ethically am opposed to any form of authoritarianism or dictatorship.
*  Often when you talk about the successes of a government or what it did developmentally that
*  might have been positive, we have to abstract ourselves from what we morally believe and just
*  look at the record. I would say that the Soviet experiment started off in Lenin's time as
*  the attempt to just hold a holding action. Hey, we don't really have the conditions to rule this
*  country. We have the support of the working class or most of it, but the working class is only
*  3% of the population. The peasantry is really against us. A lot of this 3% of the population
*  has died in war and half of them supported the Mensheviks and the more moderate socialists
*  anyway. But the alternative in their minds was going to be a far right reaction, some sort of
*  general taking power in a coup or whatever else, or just them ending up back in prison
*  because a lot of them were in prison under the Tsar or just killed. So they figured,
*  all right, we're going to have a holding action where we maintain as much of this territory of
*  the old Russian empire as possible. We'll try to slowly implement changes, restabilize the economy
*  through something called the New Economic Program, which was a form of social democracy,
*  because it allowed market exchange for the peasants combined with state ownership of industries in the
*  cities. For a while, it seemed to be working. The revolution never came that they were expecting
*  in Western Europe, but in Russia itself, they were able to restabilize things by the middle or end of
*  the 1920s. They were able to build more of a popular base for some of their policies because
*  people who had seen the chaos of World War I and revolution and then civil war just wanted
*  stability. After a decade plus of war, if you had a government that was able to give you enough to
*  eat and a job, that was good enough for them. Then Stalin came into power and he wanted to rapidly
*  industrialize. His logic was the revolution is not going to come in the West. We need to build
*  socialism in one country and we need to catch up with the West. We need to turn ourselves into
*  industrial powerhouse as quickly as possible. That's where you got forced collectivization
*  to try to increase the productivity of Russian agriculture through state ownership of previously
*  fragmented agricultural holdings and through the implementation of mechanization,
*  so bringing in more machines to make agriculture more productive, all under state ownership,
*  plus more ambitious attempts to build heavy industry through five-year plans.
*  I say this kind of coolly, but we know in practice what that meant. Forced collectivization was a
*  disaster. First of all, I think it was built on the faulty premise that scale always equals
*  more productivity when in fact, especially in agriculture, but in any field, it's a little
*  bit more complicated than that. It led to millions of deaths, it led to famine, it led to a host of
*  other problems. Industrialization in the way that it happened under Stalin also unbalanced the Soviet
*  economy to lean too heavy towards heavy industry, not enough for medium or light industry.
*  This did mean especially the five-year plan and industrialization did manage to put Russia on a
*  different developmental trajectory. By the time the post-war period came, one, it might have
*  given them the ability to survive the Nazi invasion to begin with. That's a complicated
*  question. Then by the time the post-war period came, Russia had jumped ahead of its developmental
*  trajectory in a way that a lot of other countries didn't do. There are a few examples. Japan is one
*  to manage to. If you ran a scenario where Japan would be in the 1870s, 1880s and ran it 100 times,
*  the Japan of post-war period is one of the best outcomes. I think that you could say,
*  about Russian economic development, its ability to catch up at a certain level to the West.
*  Then after that, later on, as economies got more complex, as they moved beyond regular heavy
*  industry and as the main stable of the economy, the Russian economy and its command system was
*  unable to adapt and cope and ended up falling back behind the West again by the 1970s. All this is
*  a very long story to say that a lot went wrong. In Russia, the economic picture is actually a
*  little bit more complicated. Politically, I think it's just a small party without much
*  popular support, but with real popular support in a couple of cities. A lot of popular support,
*  empire-wide, took power and they felt they couldn't give back power. They kept holding on
*  to power and eventually among their ranks in these conditions, one of history's great tyrants
*  took power and was able to justify what he was doing in the context of the Russian nation and
*  development, but also all the threats that came from abroad. The Civil War wasn't just a Civil
*  War, it was really an invasion by many imperial powers all around the world as well. I think a
*  lot of it was conditions and circumstance. I guess the question really is to what role ideology
*  played? Is there something within the socialist tradition that might have lend itself to
*  authoritarianism? That's something we should talk about. That's a really complicated human question.
*  It does seem that the rhetoric, the populism of workers unite, we've been fucked over for
*  way too long. Let's stand together. Somehow that message allows flawed or evil people to take power.
*  It seems like the rhetoric, the idea is so good, maybe the utopian nature of the idea is so good
*  that it allows a great speaker to take power. It's almost like if the mission, like come with me,
*  friends, beyond the horizon, a great land is waiting for us. That encourages dictators,
*  authoritarians to take power. Is there something within the ideology that allows for that,
*  for lying to people, essentially? I might surprise you with my answer because I would say yes,
*  maybe. I think that it's not just socialism. Any ideology that appeals to the collective
*  and appeals to our long-term destiny, either as a species or as a nation or as a class or whatever
*  else, can lend itself to authoritarianism. You can see this in many of the nationalisms of the
*  20th century. Some of these nationalisms use incredibly lofty collective rhetoric,
*  like in Sweden, the rhetoric of we're going to create the people's home. We're going to make this
*  a country with dignity for all Swedes. We're going to make this a country that's more developed,
*  more free, and so on. They managed to build a pretty excellent society, in my estimation,
*  from that. In countries like fascist Germany and Italy, they managed to do horrendous things
*  in Japan and horrendous things with that. In the US, with national popular appeals,
*  FDR was able to unite a nation to elevate ordinary working-class people into a position where they
*  felt like they had a real stake in the country. I think they did great things with the New Deal.
*  In Russia, of course, this language was used to trample upon individual rights and to justify
*  hardship and abuses of ordinary individual people in the name of a collective destiny.
*  A destiny, of course, that was just decided by the party in power during the 30s and 40s by
*  Justall and himself, really. Now, I think that that's really the case for
*  making sure that we have a bedrock of civil rights and democracy. Then on top of that,
*  we can debate. We can debate different national destinies. We can debate different appeals,
*  different visions of the world, but as long as people have a say in what sacrifices they're
*  being asked to do and as long as those sacrifices don't take away what's fundamentally ours,
*  which is our life, which is our basic rights.
*  And voice, our voice. This complicated picture, because help me understand,
*  you mentioned that social democracy is trying to have social policies within a capitalist system,
*  in part, but your vision, your hope for a social democracy is one that goes beyond that.
*  How do you give everybody a voice while not becoming the Soviet Union, while not becoming where
*  basically people are silenced either directly through violence or through the implied threat
*  of violence and therefore fear? I think you need to limit the scope of where the state is and what
*  the state can do and how the state functions, first of all. Now, for me, social democracy
*  was like the equivalent of, I'll give a football analogy. It was the equivalent of getting to the
*  red zone and then kicking a field goal. You'll take the three points, but you would have rather
*  got a touchdown. And for me, socialism would be the touchdown. It's not a separate, different
*  playing field. Some people would say socialism will be an interception. Sure. Sure. No, and they would
*  have the right to, again, to say that and to say we shouldn't go further. And most coaches would
*  take the safe route. So you're going against the decision. Anyway, the analogy takes too far.
*  Yeah. But I understand. I understand. So for you, the goal is full socialism.
*  But I'll take the three points. I just want to march down the field. I want to get within
*  scoring position. The reason why we should really move from this analogy, but the reason why
*  I call myself a socialist is looking through history and these examples of social democracy,
*  you saw that they were able to give working class people lots of rights and income and power in
*  their society. But at the end of the day, capitalists still have the ultimate power, which is
*  the ability to withhold investment. So they could say in the late 1960s and early 70s,
*  listen, I was fine with this arrangement 10 years ago. But now I feel like I'm going to take my
*  money and I'm going to go move to a different country or I'm just going to not invest because
*  my workers are paid too much. I'm still making money, but I feel like I could be making more.
*  I need more of an upper hand. So their economic power is then challenging the democratic mandate
*  of Swedish workers that were voting for the Social Democratic Party and were behind this
*  advance. So to me, what socialism is in part is taking the means of production,
*  where this capitalist power is coming from, and making it socially owned so that ordinary workers
*  can control their workplaces, can make investment decisions, and so on. Now, does that mean total
*  state ownership of everything or a planned economy? I don't think that makes any sense.
*  I think that we should live in a society in which markets are harnessed and regulated and so on.
*  My main problem is capitalist ownership, in part on normative grounds, just because I think that
*  it doesn't make sense that we celebrate democracy and all these other spheres, but we have workplaces
*  that are just treated like tyrannies. In part because I think that ordinary workers would
*  much prefer a system in which over time they accrued shares and ownership where they got,
*  in addition to base kind of ways, they got dividends from their firm being successful
*  and that they figured out how to... Large firms, they're not going to be making day-to-day decisions
*  by democratic vote, but maybe you would elect representatives, elected managements once every
*  year or two, depending on your operating agreement and so on. That's kind of my vision
*  of a socialist society. This sounds, I hope, like, agree or disagree, like it would not be a crazy
*  leap into year zero. This could be maybe a way in which we could take a lot of what's existing in
*  society, but then just add this on top. But what it would mean is a society without a capitalist
*  class. This class hasn't been individually, these people haven't been taken to re-education camps
*  or whatever else, but they're just no longer in this position and they're now part of the economy
*  in other ways. They'll probably be the first set of highly competent technocrats and managers and
*  so on. They'll probably be very well compensated for their time and expertise and whatever else.
*  But to me, both the practical end of things, like taking away this ability to withhold investment
*  and increasing our ability to democratically shape investment priorities and to continue down the
*  road of social democracy and on normative grounds by kind of egalitarian belief that ordinary people
*  should have more stake in their lives in the workplace leads me beyond social democracy to
*  socialism. So there's a tricky thing here. So in Ukraine especially, but in the Soviet Union,
*  there's the Kulaks. The possible trajectory of fighting for the beautiful message of respecting
*  workers' rights has this dynamic of making an enemy of the capitalist class, too easily making
*  an enemy of the capitalist class with a central leader, populist leader that says, the rich and
*  the powerful, they're taking advantage of you. We need to remove them. We need to put them in camps,
*  perhaps. Not said explicitly until it happens. It can happen overnight. But just putting a giant
*  pressure on that capitalist class. And again, the Stalin-type figure takes hold. So I'm trying to
*  understand how the mechanism can prevent that. And perhaps I'll sort of reveal my bias here
*  as I've been reading, I was going to say too much, maybe not enough, but a lot about
*  books like Stalin's War in Ukraine and just I've been reading a lot about the 30s and the 40s
*  for personal reasons related to my travels in Ukraine and all that kind of stuff. So I have a
*  little bit of a focus on the historical implementations of communism currently without
*  kind of an updated view of all the possible future implementation. So I just want to lay
*  that out there. But I worry about the slippery slope into the authoritarian figure that takes
*  this sexy message, destroys everyone who's powerful in the name of the working class,
*  and then fucks the working class afterwards. So first of all, I think it's worth remembering
*  that the socialist movement had different outcomes across Western Europe and Eastern Europe. And in
*  some of these countries in Western Europe, there wasn't actually democracy before the workers
*  movement and before the socialists movement. So the battle in Sweden, for instance, was about
*  establishing political democracy, establishing true representation for workers. And that's how
*  the parties became popular. Same thing in Germany too. Then it was the social democrats who were
*  able to build political democracy. Then on top of that, add layers of economic democracy,
*  social democracy. The Swedish social democrats ruled basically uninterrupted from the early 1930s
*  until 1976. It's kind of crazy to think about, but they were just in government. They were the
*  leading member of government that a few different coalition partners would shift. Sometimes they
*  were with the agrarians. Sometimes they were with the communists briefly. But they ruled
*  uninterrupted and they lost an election in 1976 and they just left power. And then they got back into
*  power in the 80s. So in other words, they created a democratic system, of course, with mass support
*  of working class people. Then they truly honored the system because when they lost power, they
*  lost power. They left power. There's plenty of cases like that across Europe and the world and
*  in other countries like Korea and elsewhere where the workers movements, the most militant, the most
*  class centric workers, South Africa is the same way, created democratic systems.
*  Now, Russia, I think a lot of what happened had to do with the fact that it was never a democratic
*  country. It was ruled by a party and the party itself was very easy to shift from a somewhat
*  democratic party in Lenin's day to an authoritarian one in Russia. And there was no distinction then
*  between the party and the state. So your authoritarian party then became authoritarian total control over
*  the entirety of the state. Now, the fact that the Soviet system involved total state ownership of
*  production meant that the authoritarianism of the party state could go even deeper into the lives of
*  ordinary people compared to other horrific dictatorships like Pinochet's Chile and so on,
*  when maybe you could find some solace just at home or whatever else. You didn't have the same
*  totalitarian control of people's lives. But I would say that socialism itself has yielded
*  different outcomes. Now, on the question of polarization, I guess that implies that this
*  polarization, this distinction is a distinction that isn't real in society and that is being
*  manufactured or generated. You mean the capitalist class and the working class, just to clarify?
*  In certain populist distinctions, the division is basically arbitrary or made up. The us versus
*  them polarization, depending who the us and who the them are, it's truly something that's manufactured.
*  But capitalism itself as a system based on class division, whether you support or oppose it,
*  I think we should acknowledge it's based on class division. That is the thing creating
*  that polarization. Now, I think what a lot of what socialists try to do is we try to
*  take bits of working class opposition to capitalism, to their lives, to the way they're
*  treated at work and so on. And yes, we do try to organize on those bases to help workers take
*  collective action, to help them organize in political parties and so on to represent their
*  interests, economic and otherwise. But the contradiction exists to begin with. And if anything,
*  this system, which I'm proposing democratic socialism, would be kind of a resolution of this
*  conflict, this dilemma, this thing that has always existed since chieftain and follower and so on.
*  We've had class division since the Neolithic Revolution. I think this is a democratic road
*  out of that tension and that division of humanity and to people who own and people have nothing to
*  give but their ability to work. So that sort of that idea is grounded in going all the way back
*  to Marx that all of human history can be told through the lens of class struggle. Is there some
*  sense, can you still man the case that this class difference is over exaggerated, that
*  there's a difference, but it's not the difference of the abuser and the abused.
*  It's more of a difference of people that were successful and people that were less successful.
*  So I'll play devil's advocate, which is that maybe one could argue that in its purest, earliest stage,
*  capitalism was based on a stark difference. But then since then, two things have happened.
*  One, a bunch of socialists and workers have organized to guarantee certain rights for
*  working class people, certain protections. So then our system now, there are certain safety nets,
*  less in the US than in other countries, but in a lot of countries are pretty extensive safety nets.
*  Even like 40 hour work week, minimum wage, safety regulations, all that kind of stuff.
*  And all those things are, in my mind, doses of socialism within capitalism, because what you're
*  doing is you are taking the autonomy of capitalists to do whatever they want with the people
*  contracted to them. And the only thing stopping them is them potentially being able to go to
*  another employer. But even then, it's kind of a potentially a race to the bottom if
*  you can't get more than $2 an hour from any employer in your market, you're going to have to
*  live with it. So one factor is we have built in those protections. So we've taken enough
*  socialism into capitalism that you could say that at a certain point, maybe it makes a qualitative
*  difference and not just a quantitative difference in people's lives. The other thing is over time,
*  we've gotten wealthier and more productive as a society. So maybe at some point, the quantitative
*  difference of just more and more wealth means that even if in the abstract, the division between
*  a worker and a capitalist is real, if that worker is earning a quarter million dollars a year
*  and has a good life and only has to clock in 35 hours a week, 30 hours a week, and has four weeks
*  vacation, then isn't it just an abstract or philosophical difference? So I think you could
*  level those two arguments. What I would say is that one, a lot of these rights that we fought for
*  are constantly being eroded and they're under attack in part because the economic power that
*  capitalists have bleeds into our political democracy as well. There's constant lobbying
*  for all sorts of labor market deregulations and so on. I fundamentally believe that if tomorrow
*  all those regulations went away, capitalists would fight to pay people as little as possible
*  and we'd be back in 19th century capitalism. And not because they're bad people, because
*  if I'm running a firm and all of a sudden my competition is able to find a labor pool and
*  is paying people less than me, I'm going to be undercut because they'll be able to take some of
*  that extra savings and invest into new technology or whatever else and they'll gobble up my market
*  share before long. And then also beyond that, I do think there's a normative question here, which is
*  now do we believe that ordinary people have a capacity to be able to make certain decisions
*  about their work? Do we believe they know more about their work than their bosses?
*  Now, I don't think that's not true at every level, but I think there's no doubt that
*  in workplaces workers know how to productively do their task in ways that their manager might
*  not know. I think we've all been in workplaces where we've had managers who kind of don't know
*  what you do or whatever else. And I think that collectively if incentivized, we could have them
*  one instead of hoarding that information since they're getting a stake in production and so on,
*  they'd be able to more freely share it and be able to reshape how their day-to-day work
*  happens. And also with elected managers, you kind of take that up the chain. I think you would have
*  perfectly efficient market-based firms that could exist without capitalists.
*  So there's a lot of things to say, maybe within just very low-level question of if the workers
*  are running the show, there's a brutal truth to the fact that some people are better. And the
*  workers know this. It's the Steve Jobs A-players. You want to have all the A-players in the room
*  because one B-player can poison the pool because then everybody gets demotivated by
*  by the nature of that lack of excellence and competence. This is just to take sort of a
*  crude devil's advocate perspective. Are the workers going to be able to remove the incompetent from
*  the pool in the goal of towards the mission of succeeding as a collective? So I think that any
*  successful model of socialism that involves a market, you need two things. One is at the
*  micro level, you need the ability to fire people and for them to exit firms, which might be a slower
*  process in cooperative-based firms than it is in a capitalist firm without a union. But it would
*  probably akin to the process that would happen in a capitalist firm, of which there are many with
*  unions. So you need that. And then at the macro level, you need firm failure. You need to avoid
*  a dilemma that happened in Soviet-style economies, which was soft budget constraints and firms
*  basically not being allowed to fail because the government was committed to full employment,
*  the firms employed people, so even inefficient firms were at the end of the day, they knew they
*  were going to be propped up by the government and they would be given all the resources they would
*  need no matter how inefficiently they were using those resources to maintain employment.
*  So I think you need both. Do you worry about this idea of firing people? Man, I'm uncomfortable with
*  the idea. I hate it, but I also know it's extremely necessary. So is there something about a collective,
*  a socialist system that makes firing, you said it might be slower, might it become extremely slow,
*  too much friction? Isn't there a tension between respecting the rights of a human being and saying,
*  like you need to step up, maybe sort of deposit the carrot, like you really like to really encourage
*  fellow workers know when there's a person that's not pulling their side of the doing as great of
*  a job as it could be. But isn't the person that's not doing a great of a job going to start to
*  manipulate the system that slows the firing in their self-interest? Well, I think there would be
*  certain. So maybe another way to put it is think about like if you're a partner in a law firm,
*  right? I don't really know how law firms work, so I probably shouldn't use this analogy, but
*  correctly if I'm wrong. But let's say you're a partner, you kind of have equity in your law
*  firm or something beyond your billable hours. And let's say you're going to be fired from your law
*  firm or they're laying off people or whatever else. They could just get rid of you, but they
*  would also have to figure out how to kind of buy you out too after a certain point. So I think that
*  like in a cooperative firm, you'd probably have a system where you after a certain point of working
*  productively, you probably have a period where you get fired really quickly no matter what. But
*  once your job security kicks in, you would be able to, it would be a process. It would probably be
*  like a day or two process to figure it out. Or maybe they would have a progressive discipline
*  process, which is first you have to get a verbal feedback and then maybe a written performance
*  review. Then you could be fired. I mean, that's how it works in a lot of workplaces with either
*  unions or with just basic job security. In most countries, that's how it works because there's
*  not at will employment in most countries. So I think that the real tension is if you fire someone,
*  if you're condemning them to destitution, then morally you would really feel something there as
*  you should as a human being concerned about other people. But in a social system or even basic
*  social democratic system, there'd be mechanisms to take care of that person. So one, if a firm
*  is failing for any reason, they're getting outcompete or whatever else, those workers
*  would then lend in the hands just for a little bit of the state. And there could be active
*  labor market policies to retrain people to go into expanding sectors. Or your sector is now obsolete,
*  but here you have these skills, you're going to be trained and here's some resources to kind of
*  help you along your training. And then there's a bunch of firms hiring, so go on your way.
*  Then also just with an expanded welfare state, being destitute in certain countries,
*  being unemployed in certain countries is easier than in other countries or situations. So
*  you still can fall back on that mechanism. And also in my vision of
*  market socialism, democratic socialism, there would be an expanded state sector.
*  Not anything you can imagine, but the way in which there's more of a state sector in countries
*  like Norway or Denmark than there is in the US. So there would be various forms of state employment
*  and whatever else. So I think that the real question is, should being bad at your job or
*  getting fired for any reason or getting laid off, should that be a cause to have you totally lose
*  your shirt? Or maybe should you just have to rebound? Maybe you have less money for consumption
*  or whatever else and you'll be on your way onto bigger and better things in a few months.
*  So a strong social net in many ways make it more efficient to fire people who are not good at their
*  job because then they won't actually significantly damage their quality of life and they have a
*  chance to find a job at which they can flourish. To step out into the macro,
*  there's a tension here as well. So you said that there's an equality between the classes,
*  the capitalist class and the working class. And there's a lot of ways you can maybe correct me
*  on the numbers, but you could say that the top 1% of Americans have more wealth than the bottom 50%.
*  That's not talking about perhaps capitalist class and the working class, but it's a good
*  estimate. The flip side of that, if you just look at countries that have more economic freedom
*  versus less economic freedom, more capitalism versus less capitalism, their GDP seems to be
*  significantly higher. And so at the local level, you might say that there's an inequality, but if
*  you look historically over decades, it seems like the more capitalism there is, the higher the GDP
*  grows and therefore the level of the quality of life and the basic income, the basic wealth,
*  the average, even including the working class goes up over time. Can you see both sides of this?
*  So I could definitely accept some of that premise. One, within capitalism,
*  if you divide up that pie, even if the bottom 10% or the working class share is less as a percentage,
*  it's still more in raw terms. So it's better for everyone. The part that I would dispute is
*  more economic freedom versus less economic freedom. So there's obviously some kind of
*  system, so you need to get licenses to do anything and you need to run things for the state
*  or you need to bring in the state's tax system. So I think that's a good example of that.
*  So I think that's a good example of that. And then the other thing that I would argue is that
*  if you're in a country like Egypt or India with a highly or previously highly bureaucratic system,
*  you need to get licenses to do anything and you need to run things for the state or you need to
*  bribe someone to get an incorporation done or whatever else. That's in case in which I would
*  accept the premise of, okay, economic freedom to take entrepreneurial risks, to start something new
*  is limited. There's all sorts of factors in which it's too difficult to start a firm and it benefits
*  no one really except for whatever bureaucracy might be taking their 15% cut. But in general,
*  I think in advanced economies, it doesn't really work that way. So think about it this way.
*  If you're pretend like we're back, I'm sorry to go to Scandinavia again, but this is a good example.
*  But this is a good example. Let's say you're back in the 1970s in Scandinavia or whatever else,
*  you're in a country with extremely powerful unions. So the unions have a lot of labor rights,
*  the state has certain high taxation, certain guarantees on you too, but you're a capitalist
*  there. Now, what would you do if your capitalist competitors in the US were able to pay workers
*  $10 an hour and you have to pay them $20? You would probably, and assuming you can't just flee
*  or shut down or whatever else, you'd probably find ways to use labor-saving technology.
*  That power of the high wages might encourage you to invest more in technology and to utilize
*  people's time is better so they're more productive at work. So they're not just sitting around or
*  whatever else. So this really happened in practice in the Scandinavian countries in part because it
*  was combined with a certain type of pattern wage bargaining. So I'll explain this really simply,
*  but let's pretend that you're in a sector with three different companies. Let's say an automotive
*  sector and I'll just say one is GM, one is Ford, one is Chrysler. Now, all these workers in your
*  sector are all unionized. They're all Swedish UAW, whatever the equivalent is, members, and they're
*  all paid the same and the union is setting through bargaining. The union is setting the
*  wages across the sector. But the unions, and let's say GM is the most productive of these companies,
*  Ford is number two, Chrysler is number three. The unions would intentionally set their benchmark
*  to Ford in the middle. So what that would do is say to Ford, okay, Ford will stay in business
*  because they'll be able to meet the wage demands. Chrysler's might go out of business because they
*  won't be able to meet the demands or they'll have to really adapt really quickly. They might have to
*  lay off people. They might have to restructure. So the union knows this in advance and all the auto
*  workers know this. But the most efficient manufacturer, GM, now has excess profits because
*  if they were negotiating with just the GM workers, the GM workers might even have been able to demand
*  more. But instead, these workers are pegging their wage demands to Ford's level and GM is,
*  in theory, able to expand and employ more people and adopt new production techniques with their
*  surplus. Then those Chrysler workers would be absorbed by the state by active labor market
*  policies, then put back to work for GM or for these expanding sectors. So in other words,
*  you're now in a situation where the state has a pretty big role in your economy, taking a lot of
*  your money and taxes. Unions are really shaping your life as a capitalist far more than would
*  happen in a country like the United States. And yet still, despite your more limited economic freedom,
*  you're still creating a more productive economy. So it could work. The system has to be designed
*  right. And I think social democracies were designed the right way. I think any future
*  democratic socialism after social democracy would have to be designed the right way.
*  Could you just link on that a little more, the pattern wage bargaining? So GM is the most efficient
*  and Ford is the second most. Can you explain to me again the wages, sending the wages to the Ford
*  level, how that is good for GM? So that encourages more GM. This is just sectoral or actually in this
*  case centralized wage bargaining. So setting the wages at a level that Ford can afford,
*  but a level that would probably be too expensive for Chrysler and the automotive sector would
*  benefit GM because they're drawing what we could call excess profits. Because GM, if the GM itself
*  could potentially have to deal with just the enterprise of GM workers bargaining for wages,
*  and if they saw their profitability was high, they would know their leverage and they would say,
*  pay us even more or else we're going to go on strike. But instead, they're accepting slightly
*  lower wages than they would have otherwise had in return for the company having excess profits
*  that they're through both the state, their union, and sometimes there's worker councils or whatever
*  else. They're playing a role in saying, okay, we're going to make sure this excess profit is
*  actually invested productively in order to expand employment and just output. Okay, can we talk about
*  unions in general then? What are the pros and cons of unions? So the interest of the union,
*  maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong. I have a lot to learn both about the economics and the
*  human experience of a union. The union's interest is to protect worker rights and to maximize
*  worker happiness, not the success and the productivity and the efficiency of a company,
*  right? No, I would disagree. So I think a union's interest is in what's collectively bargaining
*  on behalf of workers. Because in certain cases, I am right now a manager at The Nation magazine.
*  Right? If I have a problem with my working conditions or I need a raise or whatever else,
*  I could with my skill set, my background, my role in the company, I could go to my boss,
*  the owner of The Nation and say, okay, I need to renegotiate my contract on these terms. I
*  could bargain, right? Now, if I was a ordinary worker at like a CVS or something, if I didn't
*  like my conditions and I went to my boss and said, hey, I need a $2 raise and I need to
*  be home by 830 because I have obligations at home, the boss would probably say, I'm sorry,
*  that's not possible. Maybe try the Rite Aid down the street or the Walgreens down the street or
*  whatever. Now, if I went to the boss at a place like CVS, or even better, if all the pharmaceutical
*  workers at Rite Aid, CVS, Walgreens went to our bosses and said, listen, we collectively need
*  to $2 more and better hours, shorter shifts or whatever else, then they would probably have no
*  choice but to concede. You have to bargain collectively at any level if you're an ordinary
*  worker. There are some exceptions, but that's for certain highly skilled workers. But even in
*  those cases, of course, all workers are skilled. I mean, just the technical definition.
*  Even in those cases, a lot of those workers have to bargain collectively as well in order to get
*  more wealth. But they cannot make their demands so excessive that their firm gets out of business.
*  The workers only are workers as long as they're gainfully employed. Often unions will try to
*  select their wage demands at such a level that it ensures that their firm will stay in business.
*  Yeah, but the problem is the way firms go out of business isn't by an explosion,
*  like the way popcorn starts getting cooked. At a certain moment, it just is over.
*  It seems like the union can, through collective bargaining, keep increasing the wage, keep
*  increasing the interest of the worker until it suffocates the company that it doesn't die
*  immediately, but it dies in five years. That might still serve the interest of the worker,
*  but it doesn't serve the interest of society as a whole that's creating cool stuff.
*  A market that's operating and increasing cool stuff and constantly innovating and so on,
*  and creating more and more cool stuff and increasing the quality of life in general.
*  I disagree with the premise because I think even taking your example, that would be better for
*  society. If a firm cannot pay its workers a living wage, but its competitors can, then that firm
*  will either figure out a way to innovate, develop new techniques, new markets, new ways to be
*  productive, or it should go out of business. It would be better for it to go out of business
*  than to stay in business or to be artificially kept in business in any sort of way.
*  That's the Chrysler, my old centralized bargaining.
*  Then there is innovation costs money too. The flip side of that,
*  I think to play devil's advocate, is that it incentivizes automotive industry. It's
*  probably a good example of that. It incentivizes cutting costs everywhere and whatever has been
*  making you money currently, figuring out how to do that really well without investing into the long
*  term future of the company for all the different ways it can pivot, all the different interesting
*  things it could do, investing into R&D. Whenever there's more and more and more pressure on paying
*  a living wage for the workers, it might suffocate and die over the next 5, 10, 20 years,
*  which might be a good destructive force from a capitalist perspective, but it might rob us
*  of the Einstein of a company, of the flourishing that the company and the workers within it
*  can do over a period of 5, 10, 20 years. This is just a problem with a lot of capitalism,
*  which is about short-termism. The same thing could be said from, you're starting a company,
*  you have a plan for it to make a lot of money, but your investors want dividends right away.
*  You have to take away from your long-term R&D or other plans and deliver short-term
*  dividends. That's often why a lot of R&D is often rooted in state institutions and research and
*  whatever else is being drawn on. Also, I think that that's a reason why the state has some sort
*  of role in fostering firms in either my version of a socialist economy or a capitalist economy or
*  whatever else to help with these time horizon problems. I won't dispute that workers could
*  play a role or wage demands could play a role in time horizon problems, but more often than that,
*  it's coming from investors, it's coming from just a host of other market pressures that people might
*  have. I would say that in the real world, a lot of investment funds don't come from just retained
*  earnings. It comes from a lot of sources. I think this is a problem that could be solved through
*  public policy, but definitely exists today as well. You mentioned living wage. Is there a tension
*  between a living wage? Maybe you could speak to what a living wage means and the workers owning
*  all of the profit of the company. I guess the spectrum is from
*  no minimum wage, the lowest possible thing you could pay to a worker, then somewhere in that
*  spectrum is a living wage. Then at the top is all of the profit from the company is owned by the
*  workers. Split to the workers. I think that any society is going to have to make distributional
*  choices. You could imagine a variety of capitalism in which workers are paid quite little,
*  but there's extremely high taxation and there's redistribution after the fact. You could imagine
*  a system in which there's less taxation after the fact, but there's more guarantees and regulations
*  on how much people are paid before the fact. In my vision of a social society, there would be
*  similar way that unions work. In my example, the centralized bargaining unions would work that
*  bargain at the sectoral level and not just at the enterprise level like our unions do today.
*  There could be benchmarks set for different occupations or wages. The reason why you would
*  want to benchmark at a worker controlled firm is that you don't want workers self-exploiting
*  themselves in order to gobble up market share because you don't want them collectively deciding
*  okay, we're going to invest in this longer term time horizon and outcompete other people that way.
*  You might say, okay, if you do this sort of clerical work, you have to be paid
*  the equivalent of $15 an hour and that's a minimum, but on top of that, you get dividends
*  from excess profits. I think it would also have to be combined with public financing for expansions
*  and for development, which could be done in quite a competitive way. You could have a variety of
*  banks. In my vision, state-owned banks, but how would they decide who to invest in and who to not
*  invest in, who to give a loan for expansion to and who not to? Because you don't want it to be like,
*  oh, I'm going to invest in my nephew's firm and not this other firm or I'm going to invest in
*  this guy's firm because he's an Italian but not this guy's firm because he's Albanian or whatever
*  else. Just make it rational at the level of their goal is just like any other investment
*  person at a bank today to maintain a certain risk profile and to have an interest yield
*  and decide to invest on that basis. There's a huge automotive firm that has been on business
*  for 50 years that needs a little operating cash. Yeah, they could get their $50 million at 3% loan.
*  If you have some crazy blue sky idea and you manage to get it to that point, maybe you and
*  your friends would get it at 12% or something close to what a VC would offer today. I only go
*  into these details not to say that a system doesn't have to in advance map out all the
*  different possibilities, but I think it does have to be willing to accept a lot of things that
*  we know today. I can't give you a version of socialism that's everything's going to be fine,
*  we're going to live harmoniously and we won't have these sort of tensions and you could hunt
*  in the evening and fish in the afternoon and write criticism or whatever else. I do hope that there's
*  horizons beyond this that we can aspire to. I do have those visions, but for now, I think our task
*  as socialists is to imagine five minutes after midnight, what can we do right away within our
*  lifetime vision? That means through some level of central planning, we're allocating resources to
*  the workers. I think the primary mechanism in this private sector under socialism would be a market
*  mechanism, firms competing against each other to expand, connected to a system of public financing.
*  Even at that level, the individual bankers and public banks and so on would be operating based
*  on their own rationality and the state would certainly shape investment decisions, but maybe
*  no more than they do in a lot of capitalist systems. The state might already today in a lot
*  of countries decide we want to invest in green technology, so it's going to be favorable rates
*  for people or tax credits for people investing in green technology. The state already shapes
*  investment. I think what should be centrally planned, and this is where I'm proud to sound
*  like an old school socialist, is things like healthcare, things like transit, things like our
*  natural monopolies of lots of types, I think can be done very well through planning, and we already
*  have plenty of examples, but a lot of this society I think would be the private sphere of worker
*  controlled cooperatives competing against each other, weak firms failing, successful firms expanded.
*  And the banks, you're saying publicly or privately owned?
*  Publicly owned.
*  Let's just put it all on the table that it's almost guaranteed that every system has corruption. So I
*  guess the bigger question is which system has more corruption? This one was central planning
*  and worker cooperatives versus unfettered capitalism or any flavor of capitalism.
*  I think any system has potential for corruption. I think it depends on how good your civil services,
*  how much oversight do you have to resolve a problem once it arises?
*  How does corruption happen in the socialist system? So you have to, again, I apologize,
*  but the large scale examples of it, so we can look at Soviet Union, China, and Sweden,
*  fundamentally different nations and histories and peoples and economic systems and political systems,
*  but all could be called in part socialist. And so what, you know, there's a ridiculous almost
*  caricature of corruption in the Soviet system, the gigantic bureaucracy that's built,
*  where somehow corruption seeps in through kind of dispersion of responsibility
*  that nobody's really responsible for the corruption. I just had a conversation with
*  Ed Calderon who fought the cartels in Mexico, and there's a huge amount of corruption in Mexico,
*  but it's not like even seen as corruption. You understand when the cop pulls you over,
*  you give this much money and so on. And so that kind of seems to happen in certain systems,
*  and it seems to have happened in socialist systems more than in capitalist systems in
*  the 20th century. Or maybe I'm wrong on that. No, I mean, I think in a lot of countries,
*  it's seen as the cost of doing business, right? Now, in particular countries built on a system
*  of central planning, or just state allocation resources with the state, both produces and
*  allocates and things run through bureaucracies, then I think you're much more apt to have corruption
*  than in a system with just a smaller sphere for the state. So for example, if you're in a
*  hypothetical version of the US, you might see a lot more corruption in the post office, but
*  you wouldn't have that corruption in your workplace, so you kind of learn to go around that.
*  For one thing, even in state sectors, you can have, and this often is the case in democratic
*  countries, you have a transparent civil service where people who are corrupt are prosecuted by
*  judges where it's frowned upon, and over time, it goes away. So you go from having political
*  machines that were tied to certain, had friends in certain police precincts and whatever else in the
*  US in the 19th century and early 20th century, to now today, that would be a huge scandal and
*  unheard of. So I think over time, having an independent court system, having a truly
*  meritocratic civil service can be implemented anywhere. I think though, in the Soviet Union,
*  the extra little bit that happened was you had a bureaucracy that just had so much power because
*  the bureaucracy was producing and distributing everything, and everyone was relying on the
*  bureaucracy with jobs. The way to social advancement was through the bureaucracies,
*  so you end up with people like Khrushchev, people going from peasants to supreme leaders of countries
*  just through getting hooked up in the bureaucracy and advancing within it. Not all these were bad
*  people. I don't think Khrushchev was that bad of a person or Gorbachev. But this is their mechanism
*  to advancement in systems like this. In the vision of democratic socialism that I propose,
*  the state doesn't have that overriding power to begin with. But I think in either case,
*  corruption has arose in many different systems and has been successfully dealt with. I think
*  on the developmental trajectory of even countries today that we think of as being very corrupt,
*  corruption will fade away as well. But you definitely need a system in which
*  individuals are incentivized to act rationally. So if you're in a system in which cops who are
*  corrupt are prosecuted and investigated, and there's internal controls, a civilian board review,
*  and kind of an internal investigators within police departments or whatever else, there will be less
*  corruption over time if people are punished. If you're in a system in which you're running a firm
*  or you're the manager of a firm, an elected manager, and everyone at that firm is trying
*  for more efficiency and trying for more excess profits or whatever else at the end of the day,
*  dividends at the end of the day, then if you try to hire your nephew and he's not good at your job,
*  you're not going to win reelection. I think no system should rely on a change in culture
*  that come naturally or some sort of individual altruism. I think the systems have to be
*  constructed in such a way that it's not rational to behave poorly. From a theoretical perspective,
*  either a socialist or capitalist system can have either culture. But it seems like
*  if you prioritize meritocracy, if the people that are good, whatever the good means in terms
*  of integrity, in terms of performance, in terms of competence, it seems like that leads to a less
*  corrupt system. And it seems like capitalism, there's all kinds of flavors of capitalism,
*  but capitalism, because it does prioritize meritocracy, more often leads to less corruption.
*  So that's not a question of political or economic systems. It's a question of
*  what kind of stuff do you talk about that leads to a culture of less corruption?
*  First of all, I think in theory, maybe capitalism birds meritocracy. But I think in practice,
*  anyone watching this or you and me would think of some of the people we know that work
*  the hardest and they're often, you know, working class people work in the food service industry
*  or whatever else, right? I think we don't have in practice, I don't think we actually live in a
*  society that rewards people for hard work. I think we reward people for a combination
*  of accidents of birth plus hard work. So let me push back because, yes, so I agree with you.
*  But let me push back on a subtle point, because I like to draw a difference between hard work
*  and meritocracy. Because as a person who works really hard, like I work crazy hard,
*  but I've also worked with a lot of people that are just much better than me. So hard work does
*  not equal skill, good, productive. I just want to kind of draw that distinction. But I agree with you.
*  I don't think our society rewards directly hard work or even high skill. There's many examples,
*  at least we can see that it does not do so. So we have an unequal distribution of talent,
*  of course. So if we lived in society in which there was some level of acceptable inequality,
*  and it's a normative kind of question of how much we would say is acceptable, right?
*  And that inequality was based on this unequal distribution of talent, then I think that would
*  be fine with me, right? That would actually be a meritocracy. What I see in the US is often,
*  okay, so if you are a upper middle class or rich kid, and you get a good education, K through 12,
*  out of those people, there will be some that work extra hard and go on to do incredible things or
*  are very successful, and there will be other people that do not, right? And decide for whatever
*  reason, or go down a different path. And you could say maybe among that group of the upper middle
*  class, there is a meritocracy, right? But they're actually given those opportunities to make their
*  own decisions and to fail, whereas many, many other people, the vast majority of American society,
*  I would say, 60 plus percent don't really get those opportunities to make those choices to
*  begin with. And I would aspire to the type of world at least as a first step in which
*  our only inequalities are based on our unequal, innate distributions of talent.
*  LW Yeah, I guess a lot of people worry that when you have a socialist in any degree central
*  planning, or perhaps a collective of workers, that it won't result in that kind of meritocracy
*  that you're talking about. But you're saying that no, it's possible to have that kind of meritocracy.
*  Think about it this way. The workers themselves are incentivized and are shaped by market forces,
*  too, right? They're trying to respond to consumer needs and preferences, they're trying to expand
*  market share, they're trying to make money. So it requires no kind of leap into these people are
*  going to be more altruistic or whatever else, even on purely bourgeois terms, the same way you would
*  maybe justify competitive capitalist firms, I think you could justify this system as long as you think
*  that people elected management can perform just as well, I think based on the experiences of
*  cooperatives, we've seen that they can. Then at the state level, state bureaucracies have their
*  own sort of sets of incentives. But in most systems that already have extensive state bureaucracies,
*  these people at high levels are appointed or elected, they're held to certain standards.
*  At the national level, a national government wants to maintain the tax revenue that they need to pay
*  for services. We already, I think, have incentive structures that you could say that some people
*  might just, I think, disagree with the normative thing of why would people have to own their own
*  means of production, control their workplaces or whatever else? Why do we need this level of equality?
*  Can't we just get by with our existing system, but just make things a little bit easier for
*  capitalists to make money than everyone will benefit or whatever else? That's a normative
*  question. In my vision of socialism, there'll be plenty of multiple parties with different views
*  and perspectives trying to either push us deeper into more radical forms of socialism or on the
*  other hand, to kind of roll back to more capitalist forms of government. So I think that, again,
*  you can't try to make up a perfect system and try to implement it. You have to do it as a process
*  democratically and so on. So just philosophically, in your gut, you're more concerned about the innate
*  equal value of human beings versus the efficiency of this wonderful mechanism that we call human
*  civilization at producing cool stuff. Just like a gut, if we were sitting at a bar, that's where
*  the gut feeling you come with. Of course, your mind is open, but you want to protect the equal
*  value of humans. So I don't want to fight the hypothetical. So I'll say equality. I am concerned
*  with equality, but I don't think the two are necessarily always in tension. But also,
*  when you think about all the great things that human beings have produced, often,
*  I think people today just look at the end outcome. We go to the pyramids and we'll marvel at the
*  pyramids and the human achievement that it took to make it happen, but we won't stop to think about
*  all the suffering that went into the making of that thing. So I think we kind of lean in the
*  opposite direction where we marvel at our achievements, but we don't often think about
*  the suffering or exploitation that went into certain human achievements. I would love a
*  society in which we could marvel at things and not have to worry about the exploitation that
*  was involved because there was no exploitation or oppression involved. There was just human ingenuity
*  and creativity and collaboration. And to the degree, which you may disagree, to the degree
*  there's a tension between the two, at least give equal weight to the consideration of the suffering
*  and don't just marvel at the beauty of the creations. To the degree there is a tension
*  between the two. What Stalin did actually, too, it's not just capitalist, but what Stalin did was
*  he sacrificed whole generations because he thought that he was building something for the future,
*  for future Russians to enjoy and for future people of the world to enjoy. And actually,
*  that analogy that I just gave about the pyramids was written by Karl Kotzky, the German socialist,
*  anti-Stalinist critic when he was complaining about US journalists and others going to Russia
*  in the 1930s and marveling at all the new industries. Are these people blind to the
*  suffering behind these things that they're marveling about? Speaking of which, I think you
*  mentioned in the context of a social democracy that freedom of speech and freedom of the press
*  or basically the freedom of people to have a voice is an important component,
*  which I think is something that caught my ear a little bit. Because if you think about
*  the Soviet Union, one of the ways that the authoritarian regime was able to control,
*  it's almost part of the central planning is you have to control the message and you have to limit
*  the freedom of the press. So there's a kind of notion, especially in like ideas or maybe
*  caricatures of the ideas of cultural Marxism, sometimes caricatured even further as wokeism,
*  that you want to be careful with speech. You want to censor speech because some speech
*  hurts people. So in some sense, you want to respect the value, the equality of human beings
*  by being careful with the words you say. So is there a tension there for you?
*  I think there's no tension. And part, I think that it is very condescending or patronizing
*  to assume that people can't take debate, that people can't either as a society or individuals
*  visually be engaged in the exchange of ideas without or even very vigorous debate without
*  being broken by it. It's just not the case. I'm basically a free speech absolutist. I mean,
*  I would draw the line at obviously, direct incitements of violence or certain other
*  speech like that. But in general,
*  you think a lot of people would be surprised to hear that?
*  No, I mean, not people who know my work. I mean, more generally, I think a lot of people on the
*  right, even in the center, I think might have the idea that a lot of the far left wants to censor
*  them. I think some of the center left wants to censor them. But I think a lot on the far left,
*  on the Marxist or socialist left, I think that, you know, free speech is more or less the norm.
*  Yeah. Where is the imperative to censor coming from? Is this just some small subset of the left
*  on Twitter? Is there some philosophical idea behind certain groups that, like, if we're to
*  steal man and case and which group actually has the interest of humanity in mind in wanting to
*  censor speech? I think we might need to just take it case by case for an example by example,
*  because honestly, I would have to think about a particular case. But let's just say generally
*  that a lot of American liberalism rightly sees the revolution around the civil rights and later
*  the extension of this rights revolution for gay rights and so on as being a very positive
*  achievement in the last half century, and I completely agree. Now for me, now that we've
*  won those rights, a lot of our battle for change needs to go beyond the representational realm
*  and needs to really reground itself in the material bread and butter struggles of ordinary
*  people trying to survive, the battle for good healthcare for all Americans and so on. These
*  are my immediate demands. I think there's a segment of American liberalism that doesn't
*  want to go in that confrontational economic direction and wants to steer it away from
*  battles over things like universal healthcare and so on and really are just still caught at
*  this battle over rights and representation. And it's devolved in such a way that they feel like
*  they need to make change. The way they make change is only through interventions and culture
*  because they don't really have the same sense of class and class struggle that agree or disagree
*  with it. It's a very material plane. So instead, they look at comedians who said the wrong thing
*  or they look at all sorts of other ways to make change. It's not really making a change,
*  it's just making them look bad and making our culture worse. And I think that's where a lot
*  of it comes from. But I think that a lot of the left, even the left that's much more into battles
*  over race and lots of other stuff like real serious anti-racist on the left. Of course,
*  I'm an anti-racist, but a lot of my work is focused on the primacy of class. But even these
*  people are very concerned about material struggles and issues and they don't really care about
*  you know, these issues they think are ephemeral kind of issues.
*  I see when you focus exclusively on language that somehow leads you astray,
*  like on being concerned about language without like deeper economic inequalities and so on.
*  You just become an asshole that's on Twitter pointing out how everything,
*  how racist everyone is. So the anti-racism becomes a caricature of anti-racism.
*  Exactly, because anti-racism was really about the struggle of people for equal rights and voting.
*  It was about the struggle for people who were trapped into bad neighborhoods because they
*  were stuck, they couldn't get decent jobs and their neighborhoods were redlined or whatever else.
*  It was really like a struggle for survival. And what was the main demands like the language of
*  this? One, it was the march for jobs and freedom. It was the slogan, I am a man, asserting the kind
*  of universal dignity of people. This is what the civil rights movement was about. And it wasn't
*  surprised there was a lot of self-described socialists, people like Bayard Rustin,
*  Apel Randolph, Martin Luther King Jr. I mean, these were people who were,
*  Ella Baker, they were socialists. And I think a lot of Americans agree with them with their
*  immediate demands, even though they weren't themselves a socialist, but it was a very
*  materialistic struggle. And I think a lot of this has been co-opted into just some sort of vague and
*  disconcerting complaints about language or culture and so on.
*  Martin Luther King was a socialist. To what degree was he a socialist? I would love to learn about
*  that. Martin Luther King, I think broadly called himself at various points in his life, a Christian
*  socialist or a democratic socialist, especially after his speech against the Vietnam War and the
*  Riverside Church, I think it was 67. The last years of his life, he became much more involved
*  in struggles against the war and also struggles for workers' rights. He was assassinated when he
*  was at a rally at workers' rights. So he thought the next battle was going to be an economic battle.
*  He had this famous line where he said, I don't just want to integrate the lunch counter if it
*  means that we can't afford to order a burger while we're there. That was the line along those lines.
*  And I think that got to his point where the civil rights struggle was part of a step,
*  building some sort of wider movement. So he and these other civil rights leaders were very much
*  interested in working with organized labor, working with the left as it was constructed then,
*  and building some sort of mass space for not just rights but redistribution.
*  It's fascinating. It's fascinating which figures self-identified and were in part socialists.
*  Albert Einstein was one. Albert Einstein wrote an article for the first issue of this
*  left-wing magazine, it's actually still publishing today, called Monthly Review.
*  And I think 1949, and his article is called Why Socialism? I don't think it's paywalled,
*  so people should check it out. But yeah, Einstein was one.
*  So probably the central idea is the pacifist, the anti-war idea for him? Or no?
*  Honestly, it's been so many years since I read it. I think it was more about,
*  um, I think it was actually more economically focused, but I would need to go back and-
*  But is war in general a part of the fundamental ideas that socialists are,
*  again, democratic socialists are against? Like what's the relation between socialism and war?
*  So I think that traditionally in the socialist movement, war was associated with
*  capitalist competition and international competition. And you can look at World War
*  I as very much a case where different nations were competing with each other and developing
*  quite violent rivalries. It was in part based on competition and the periphery over access to
*  markets and colonies and whatever else. So it was very easy to draw a direct correlation.
*  I am opposed to war. I'm opposed to imperialism, the domination of strong nations,
*  dominating smaller nations. I wouldn't call myself a pacifist. I think most socialists
*  wouldn't call themselves pacifists because there are some struggles that are worth fighting for.
*  There's national liberation struggles and so on where if there's no democratic avenue for change,
*  you know, positive change has been made through armed revolts around colonialism and whatnot.
*  But we're living in an age where hopefully, I know neither of us have children,
*  our children or children's children in the future won't have to live through war.
*  And that is one thing that as countries have gotten more developed, as the world has changed,
*  we've actually seen less and less war. Like I won't dispute Pinker on this. I think it's true.
*  Obviously, Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in Ethiopia is like kind of an exception,
*  but on the whole, I think we're going in that direction. But I think it's always been a major
*  organizing plank of socialists against war and against this sense of right-wing nationalism and
*  national identity that often leads to war. And obviously, not everyone on the right has embraced
*  that. A lot of libertarians are consistently anti-war as well. But I think the right ideologically
*  has been associated with war, even if some advocates of capitalism have not been.
*  RG Then there's the military industrial complex,
*  which is the financial machine of the whole thing. I presume. Well, since a lot of that is
*  government, what's the relationship to socialism and the military industrial complex?
*  JS Well, a lot of it's government contracts, but it's privately produced, right? My company's
*  a Glocky Martin and things like that. You could draw a very crude materialist connection between
*  any of these things to kind of prove an ideological point, but we could produce just as many arms and
*  then just bury them or never fire them off or whatever else. Obviously, there are companies
*  that have a vested interest in heightening up tensions or saying that we need to buy a new
*  weapon system to be prepared for conventional war with China, Russia. Meanwhile, I think we all know
*  that if there's going to be conventional war between these countries, it's going to lead to
*  something worse. And no amount of advanced fighter jets is going to make a difference.
*  But I try to avoid crude or causal connections, even though there are relationships. It's kind of
*  like the old slogan, which was quite an effective slogan in the early 2000s. At my first anti-war
*  marches when I was a teenager, I definitely have shouted it, but kind of no war for oil.
*  Both is correct in that it gets to what people's senses of what's going on and how it's bad,
*  but also analytically, it's kind of wanting to explain what really happened or why we ended up
*  in the Middle East, which is a much more complex geopolitical story.
*  Yeah, and it is a story of geopolitics. It's perhaps less a story of capitalism
*  or socialism. It's a story. Yeah, it's a geopolitical story that I think actually
*  operates outside of the economic system of the individual nations. It has to do more with,
*  honestly, in part, egos of leaders. And there's an international battle for resources,
*  but surely there's alternatives. Yeah, definitely. And I think that part of what being a socialist is
*  about dreaming in the long term about a different sort of world without, in my mind, needless
*  divisions of people into nations with standing armies. I'm sure we'll still have pride about
*  where we're from, and there'll still be distinctive cultural features and so on about where we're from.
*  We definitely would, at least for the foreseeable future, be divided into
*  places as administrative units, but the idea that there should be a Mexican army and an American
*  army and a Russian army and a Ukrainian army is just on the face of it, I think in the long run,
*  will be seen as ridiculous, just like we see it as ridiculous today looking back at the idea that
*  a lord from London would be engaged in civil strife with a lord from Liverpool and a bunch
*  of peasants would die. Just on the face of it, it just seems ridiculous that these different places
*  would have their own banners and lords and armies. I think in the long run, you might have to zoom
*  out a thousand years, but in the long run, people will say the same about nation states and standing
*  armies and battles over specks of dirt that mean nothing in a cosmic sense.
*  Yeah, for sure, aliens would laugh at us, or humans that go far beyond Earth and look at the history.
*  Most of the history will be forgotten because if humans successfully expand on to the universe,
*  just the scale of civilization will grow so fast that the bickering of the first few thousand years
*  of human history will be seen as significant. There's a very Marxist idea that I both appreciate
*  in one way, but on the other hand, it's kind of scary, which is that human history is only
*  not beginning before we're in prehistory, but in the future, we'll be in real history. I think that
*  a lot of really important history has already happened, and I think posterity will remember.
*  I think that it will be easier to assign certain people the role of villains, the people not to
*  engage in the contentious topic, off topic of Ukraine or whatever else, but the idea that
*  one government or man would launch a war to recover or to take several hundred square miles
*  of territory and tens of thousands of people die seems absurd to us many people today,
*  luckily, but it would not have seemed absurd 50, 60 years ago. It would have just been a normal
*  thing, these kind of territorial disputes and so on. I think projecting in the future,
*  I think within our lifetimes, we'll live to see that kind of conflict be eradicated.
*  And in part, you could say that, like why? I think it's because of popular pressure in
*  organizations. So you could say kind of the pro-worker socialist organizing part of it,
*  making it less normal. If you're a capitalist, you could say, well, markets are more interlinked,
*  so war is even more irrational. I don't really have a firm answer or whatever it is. I think
*  it's a good thing. You mentioned Marxist view of history. It's kind of interesting to just
*  briefly talk about. What do you think of it? What do you think of this Marxist view of how
*  the different systems evolve from the perspective of class struggle is what we're talking about?
*  Well, I fundamentally, I'm a Marxist. I fundamentally believe in the broad contours
*  of historical materialism. But I think we should be clear on what Marxist theory tells us and what
*  it doesn't tell us. I think Marxist theory tells us pertinent things about how societies evolve,
*  about how the distributional resources work in any given society, who owns, who doesn't, how
*  the conflict, distributional conflicts, and so on. I think Marxism can tell us a lot.
*  How surplus is distributed.
*  Exactly. Exactly. What it can tell us is, as a friend put it, the sex appeal of blue
*  jeans or whatever else. That's beyond what Marxism is meant to do.
*  What economic system can tell us about the sex appeal of blue jeans?
*  No economic system. But socialism, in the Soviet sense, when it was turned into the Soviet style,
*  dialectical materialism, was meant to tell us everything from explain genetics and agriculture
*  whatever else in a very disastrous way. I definitely don't believe in the application
*  of these ideas in an extremely wide way. Also, I'm a Marxist because it's a framework that helps me
*  understand pertinent facts about the world. If at some point I no longer think the framework
*  is doing that, I will not be a Marxist. But I'm a socialist on normative grounds because I've
*  certain beliefs about the equality of people because I believe we should have a society with
*  liberty, with equality, with fraternity. I hope I'll always be a socialist until the day I die,
*  but it's a very unscientific or unserious thing to say this is my framework from beginning to end
*  for the rest of my life.
*  But from a perspective of history, you should say that society's go through different stages.
*  It could be crudely summarized as primitive communism, imperialism, maybe slave society,
*  feudalism defined by mercantilism, then capitalism, then socialism, and finally
*  stateless communism. Did I miss something there?
*  I mean, I think that was close enough. I mean, I think that's definitely
*  true of Marxist theory, that the contradictions of capitalism, the fact that it has brought together
*  all these workers, all these materials and whatever else, and it's now allowing us to
*  socially create wealth on a mass scale, but that wealth is that process is being privately directed
*  and also the surplus is being privately appropriated is a contradiction and that would
*  lead to some sort of rebellion or revolution or change and eventually this contradiction would be
*  a federal on production too, so we would have to move into socialist society.
*  But actually just the backtrack. So in terms of contradictions, so it starts when we're in a village,
*  hunter-gatherers, that's what you call primitive communism where everyone's kind of equal.
*  It's kind of a collective, right? All right, maybe you could just just let me hold on a second.
*  And then inequalities form of different flavors. So that's what imperialism is, is
*  one dude rises to the top and has some control of different flavor. That's what feudalism with when
*  you have one dude at the top and you have merchants doing some trading and so on. And then that leads
*  to capitalism when you have private ownership of companies and they do some, they result in some
*  class inequality. And eventually that results in a revolution that says, no, this inequality is not
*  okay, it's not natural, it doesn't respect the value of human beings and therefore it goes to
*  socialism where there is under Marx's view, I guess some role for the state. State is doing
*  some redistribution and then the pure communism at the end is when it's a collective where there's
*  no state centralized power. What's part of that is wrong. No, I think broadly the Marxist theory
*  of history is about different types, different modes of production that existed various times.
*  Based on material conditions. So in the early times in this theory, there was not much surplus
*  being generated, right? And there was generally egalitarian societies. Then as we became agricultural,
*  as society developed, there was more surplus being produced. Then there was a group of people,
*  the ruling classes of their age that controlled and distributed that, that controlled that division
*  of labor and appropriated more of that surplus for themselves. And they weren't involved in
*  productive labor. In early print of society, everybody's involved in productive labor.
*  Later on, you had casts of priests who did nothing but kind of pray and write and kind of lecture
*  people all day. And you had kings and rulers and bureaucrats and traders and so on. You have a
*  more complex division of labor, but also more inequity driving out of that. Capitalism was a
*  revolutionary system because it took away, one, it made us tremendously more productive. It expanded
*  production beyond our wildest imaginations, but it also no longer bound workers to their lord or
*  manor or whatever else. They were now free to move, free to engage in contracts with employers and
*  so on. But even though workers are now producing all this tremendous wealth, and even though
*  productive forces had been matured in such a way, they were ultimately taken away from all the
*  wealth they were created. They got some of it back. They were in wealthy societies, but they
*  were all there collectively together producing this wealth. And that was a potent force. So Marx
*  theorized that would lead to a revolution or change in a socialist direction. I think, in fact,
*  what we saw was that, yes, workers are dependent on, capitalists are dependent on workers,
*  but the dependency is obviously symmetrical in the sense that workers are also dependent on
*  capitalists. But in fact, it's an asymmetrical dependency in that ordinary workers need their
*  jobs more than capitalists need the contribution of individual workers. So it became a collective
*  action problem where you would need the mass of workers to get together to decide to change
*  things, but also people would be afraid because they'd be dependent on their jobs for their
*  livelihood and so on. So revolution became a lot harder than people thought, especially in
*  democratic countries where workers had certain outlets and certain powers and rights and
*  responsibility. It's no surprise that where you did have socialist revolutions, they were in places
*  like the third world, post-colonial states trying to emerge out of colonialism. They were in places
*  like China and Russia, autocratic countries, and never in an advanced capitalist country.
*  Now, in Marxist theory of history, even as interpreted by a lot of smart Marxists like
*  G. A. Cohen and others, there is a certain inevitability to socialism after capitalism.
*  The way that I would put it myself is I have a more, I guess you could say, Kantian view of it.
*  I think socialism is something that ought to happen, but it's not something that necessarily
*  will happen and will need to organize and persuade. Also, potentially, again, the key part of any
*  social system that's democratic is you have to allow for the possibility of a democratic
*  revision to a different sort of system. So I'd be more than happy in my vision of socialism for
*  there to be capitalist parties getting, hopefully, three, four, or five percent of the vote, maybe a
*  lot more, in the same way that in the US or a public, we could right now have a monarchist party.
*  No one's going to support a monarchist party in the US in serious numbers.
*  Although that's gaining popularity.
*  In Europe or elsewhere?
*  No. In the anarchist tradition, aren't they saying that one of the ways you could have
*  leaders in monarchy, because they're more directly responsible to the citizens, if you have a leader,
*  it's healthier to have a monarch? Anyway, I'm not familiar with this, but I've heard this stated.
*  The left-wing anarchist traditions like anarcho-syndicalism or whatever else,
*  their slogan is kind of no kings, no gods, no masters or whatever, so no bosses. They
*  definitely would not agree with that, but I'm not familiar enough. Anarchism runs a gamut from left
*  to right in an interesting way.
*  I'll have to ask you about that. But yeah, okay. So you don't believe Marx's theory of history in
*  the sense that every stage is a natural consequence of every other stage. Of course,
*  he would predict that somebody like you must exist in order for those stages to go from one
*  to the next, because you have to believe ought in order for action to be taken to inspire the
*  populace to take action.
*  So two things. One is I do broadly believe in Marx's theory of history because it's just
*  explaining how productive forces develop in the relations of production in any given system.
*  I guess there's a theory of transition from capitalism to socialism that Marx didn't really
*  spell out, but it was kind of implied that it would naturally happen. Marx was living in an era of
*  tremendous upheaval. Marx himself actually saw when he was living in London in the 1870s,
*  the Paris Commune, when workers took over for just a few months, but they took over the producers
*  of Paris, took over the city, basically created their own government, their own system,
*  and so on. So he was living through an era of upheaval. And Engels especially oversaw and was
*  the mentor to all these rising socialist parties. So he was very closely collaborating with
*  socialists in places like Britain and Germany when they were drafting their first programs
*  for the Social Democratic Party. So it felt like this was going to happen. It felt like this rising
*  working class would take power, but I think the stability of the system was underestimated.
*  It's easy to see the contradictions in the system, but can you see its mechanisms of stability,
*  the way in which mass collective action or revolution is more the exception or the norm?
*  Could you have imagined, if you're Marx, not only how much wealth the system would produce over time,
*  which I think you could have imagined, but also developments like the welfare state and mass
*  democracy and universal suffrage, which might have changed how workers relate to the system or operate
*  within it. So I think it's just the transition part that I think wasn't spelled out properly.
*  But I think in either case, as socialists, we can assume that history is working in our favor. We
*  just need to hold out and wait for the inevitable revolution. We have to convince people of both,
*  one, the struggle for day-to-day reforms and why it's important to be politically organized,
*  why it's important to be a member of a union or to advocate for things like universal health care
*  or whatever else to try to build the cohesion and sense of self of the class. Then ultimately,
*  for the desirability once we accomplish it, once we build social democracy of going beyond social
*  democracy, which is, of course, the challenge. Now, I don't think it requires leadership from
*  the outside. I think there are plenty of organic leaders that have emerged from the working class
*  and have advocated for socialism from the working class. If you look at the class composition
*  during the glory days of the European socialist parties, this was very much a working class
*  parties and organizations. It's only been the last 30 years that it's been taken over by
*  professionals and not coincidentally, they have accomplished very little in those 30 years.
*  That's the practical and the pragmatic. Can we actually jump to the horizon? As you mentioned,
*  as a social democrat, you focus on the policies of today, but you also have a vision and dream
*  of a future. So Marx did as well, so the perfect communism at the end. Can you describe that world?
*  Also, is there elements to that world that has elements of anarchism? Like I said,
*  there's Michael Malice next door. Anarcho-communism, I don't even know if I'm using
*  that term correctly, but basically no central control. Can you describe what that world looks
*  like? I think the traditional socialist vision of, if you want to call it full communism,
*  would be very similar to the anarchist vision of a world without coercion, mass abundance,
*  and so on. I myself don't share that vision. I believe that we will always need to have a state
*  in some form as a way to one, even just mediate difference. I think traditionally a lot of Marxists
*  have thought that after you remove the primary contradiction of class, that all other political
*  questions would be resolved. I think that's a lot behind a lot of the thinking of we're going to
*  have a full communism after politics. I don't think there will be an after politics. I think
*  for one thing, let's say, I'll give you another Northeast example. Let's say me and you are trying
*  to, with different groups of people, we're trying to figure out how to build a crossing of the Hudson
*  River. For various reasons, you and the people around you want to build a bridge,
*  meaning the people around me want to build a tunnel. That's a question that you will probably
*  need a mediation for. One, it's a big project, so there'll be a very complex division of labor,
*  and so on. But even beyond that, just politically, you will need the state to mediate the difference.
*  You'll need to have a vote, have a vote that people trust, have institutions that people trust,
*  and so on to make a decision. Society is never going to go beyond that decision-making.
*  You don't think it's possible outside of the state to create stable voting mechanisms,
*  or is human nature going to always seep into that?
*  I just wonder why we would have to. If the state is democratic and responsive,
*  the state is an authoritarian. It might not be called the state, but it would function as a state.
*  But why not just call it a state? In other words, if you don't have something like that,
*  then don't you have a greater risk of tyranny or tyrant emerging in the vacuum?
*  I think people's fear of the state is what would happen if the state had too much power.
*  I think that's a legitimate fear. That's why we have democratic checks on state power and
*  certain guarantees of freedom and so on. But I guess I just wonder, I'm more afraid of the vacuum
*  and not having a democratic, responsive state and what the world would turn into.
*  Also, I'm just not a utopian thinker, if that makes sense. I like to think that I'm an egalitarian
*  thinker. I'm a socialist, but my mind just goes to, I can see a vision of the future that I would
*  like 50, 60 years from now. Maybe there's some sort of future of superabundance and automation
*  and there's some sort of techno utopian future. We don't want some of those things that would
*  exist in my five minutes for now vision of socialism, but I just don't see it. In general,
*  I'm wary of visions of change that seem like they're not built off little pieces that we have
*  now and not built off history and experience and whatever else. I don't want a year zero.
*  I don't even like the term prehistory because I think there's a lot in history that I want.
*  I want Shakespeare under socialism. I want a lot of things that I think we should be grateful for.
*  There's a part of tradition that I think that exists that's hierarchical and exploitative and
*  whatever else, but there's another part of tradition that's our sense of place and belonging
*  and our connection with the past and hopefully the future. I want to keep that.
*  Yeah. You're worried about revolution or otherwise a vacuum being created and you're
*  worried about the things that might fill that vacuum. The anarchists often worry about the
*  same mechanism of the state that controls voting or keeps voting robust and resilient and stable,
*  the same mechanism also having a monopoly on violence. That's the tension. They get
*  very nervous about a central place having a monopoly on violence. Whereas if there is going
*  to be a place for the monopoly on violence, let's just say temporarily take that for granted.
*  Should it not be a place with a skilled, elected, accountable, transparent civil service
*  with a democratic mandate and so on? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well put. Speaking of AI,
*  just to go into that tangent, do you think it's possible to have a future world, let's say 50
*  years, 50, 100 years where there's an AI central planning? We remove some of the human elements
*  that I think get us into a lot of trouble. You can take a perspective on the Soviet Union and
*  the flaws of the system there have less to do with the different ideologies and more to do with
*  the humans and the vacuums and how humans fill vacuums and the corrupting nature of power and
*  so on. If we have AI that's more data-driven and is not susceptible to the human elements,
*  is that possible to imagine such a world? Almost like from a sci-fi perspective.
*  Maybe in the future you can imagine certain calculation problems that arose during central
*  planning solved through advanced computing. But I would say that there's another whole set of
*  problems with the system that were incentive problems and I'm not sure how that advanced
*  computing would solve the incentive problems of how do you get people to actually produce things
*  that other people want? Kind of that informational question and how do you communicate without
*  endless meetings or someone reading your brain? Yeah. What do you actually want? So there's that
*  informational question but then there's the incentive of how do you get people to work
*  efficiently at work and how do you get firms to use their resources that they're getting
*  more efficiently? I think solving the calculation problem solves some of these questions but not
*  all of them. But that's kind of a who knows but if your vision of the future requires some sort of
*  leap into a technological unknown that's very hard to advocate for today.
*  It's exciting to consider the possibility of technology empowering a better reallocation of
*  resources. If you care about the innate value of human beings and think of the mechanism of
*  reallocation resources as a good way to empower that equality, it's nice to remove the human
*  element from that. If you work really hard and you're really good at your job, it's nice to be
*  really data driven in allocating more resources to you. So kind of. I kind of think that the
*  agency part requires human beings and conscious human activity. So I think if you have a sort of
*  planning system that works and let's say the technology is there for it to work,
*  I would want it to be democratic planning in such a way that there is a human element,
*  there is some debate and deliberation in society. And also even in my vision of socialism
*  with the state sector and state investments and so on, I'd want there to be more public discussion
*  and debate about certain things that's not just left to technocrats because you'd want to live
*  in society where you just find out the next day that there's some massive infrastructure project
*  that you haven't had a chance to think about or debate or feel like you're participating in.
*  And debate is not just facts and logic. That's why if the whole universe was about facts and
*  logic, computers could do a better job of that. There's something about humans debating each other
*  that goes into the difficult gray areas of what it means to be human and what it means to have a life
*  that's worth living. That requires humanity. And I'm also worried about, while I'm excited by the
*  possibility of AI controlling everything, half joking, but the reason I'm really terrified of
*  that is because usually there's a possibility of a human taking control of that system.
*  You now start to get the same kind of authoritarian thing. Well, I am a human, I'm smart enough to be
*  able to control this AI system and I will do based on what this AI system says what's good for you.
*  It's kind of like talking down to people and then use that AI system to now have the same kind of
*  thing as Hollidmore in 1930s. And also our preferences might change. So an AI system might
*  say the goal of humanity is to just increase infinitely efficiency or increase output,
*  whereas we might collectively decide that we have enough and we want to have a trade-off.
*  And I think that we need a system that allows for people to make certain trade-offs.
*  Have more of this leisure that I've been learning about from you. This is a very interesting concept,
*  leisure. How do you spell that? All right. So
*  if we can step into the practical, we're talking about historical and philosophical,
*  into the practical of today. What are some of the exciting policies that represent
*  democratic socialism today, modern socialism? I think you mentioned some of them, Medicare for
*  All or universal healthcare. Something you haven't mentioned is tuition-free college,
*  increasing minimum wage, maybe stronger unions like we talked about. What are some ideas here?
*  What are some ideas there's especially policy, especially exciting to you?
*  Well, I think that hours reduction has always been an important demand for socialists. So,
*  I mean, it's been a reality in certain countries like France in recent decades,
*  where part of the logic is if you have a bunch of people working for 40 plus hours a week,
*  and you also have some unemployed people who would like more employment, then it's not a
*  zero sum game. You could reduce hours to 35 hours and still maintain the same output by employing
*  more people to fill the slack in hours. So one, I think it's a solidaristic thing in working-class
*  movements between unemployed and employed workers. I also think that, yeah, it gives people more time.
*  Marx was a big advocate in his day of a 10-hour bill in the UK that would have reduced the hours
*  of working time and reduced child labor and other things as well. Part of it was, this is a radical
*  demand because it's reducing the sphere of exploitation. So it's putting limits on how
*  much time the capitalists can take from ordinary workers and how much freedom they would have.
*  With healthcare, one, I just think it's a government healthcare system. You could tell me
*  that you don't want it in the US, but you can't tell me it doesn't work because we've seen it
*  work in every other major industrial system in different forms. So what does that usually involve?
*  What does universal healthcare involve? So there's different varieties. In the UK,
*  for instance, they have a national health service in which medical personnel and hospitals are
*  run directly by the state. It's almost like a mini-Soviet system, to be honest,
*  but just for healthcare. It works pretty well just for healthcare. I think it's one example of the
*  way in which you could actually take the market. So I gave you a vision of socialism that involves
*  a lot of market, but I think there are certain spheres where you could remove the market from
*  and still have an efficient system, in part because this is an area in which people don't
*  have, obviously for cosmetic procedures, whatever, they have preferences. But for most routine things
*  that people do in healthcare, they just need to see a doctor. They need to get diagnosed.
*  Some of these systems have had trouble with waitlists for specialists or whatever. That's
*  more of an allocation problem of if you want more specialists, you pay specialists more.
*  This is problems that could be solved through the mechanisms of planning and government-run
*  healthcare. So that's the most left-wing that you could get is the system in the United Kingdom.
*  Beyond that, you have a system like Medicare for All where you say,
*  most of the doctors, besides for public hospitals that already exist,
*  are going to be privately employed by hospitals. The hospitals are going to be private.
*  But instead of having all these different insurance carriers, we're just going to have one
*  national insurance carrier that we're all going to pay into. That national insurance carrier is
*  going to negotiate the price of healthcare with doctors, the price of drugs with pharmaceutical
*  companies, and so on to hopefully reduce prices and to implement a different little bit of planning
*  into the system because if there's only one big national insurance company, that company has a lot
*  of weight and power. But you could still visit your same doctor and it's not as radical of a
*  shift in that direction. That's the dominant demand of Bernie Sanders and the left right now.
*  There's 30-plus million people in the US that would be insured that currently aren't insured.
*  If we moved to this system, there's a lot of other people that are underinsured or worried about how
*  to pay co-pays or premiums involved. I think it would be a net benefit for the vast majority of
*  the US population even if it was offset by certain taxes because we spend a lot of money out of
*  pocket with health insurance. It's a demand also that's widely popular. For me, it's almost like
*  if you're trying to build support for something like socialism, we were talking this lofty vision
*  of socialism after capitalism or what worker ownership, the means of production would look
*  like in practice and so on. By the way, you're one of the few interviewers who ever asked me
*  any of the details. It's good that I've been thinking of a rough sketch in my head for the last
*  you know, whatever, 16 years I've been a socialist. But we have to start in the here and now.
*  If you can't convince people that the state should play a bigger role in their health insurance,
*  and you can't convince Americans and a whole host of other sectors that they should be living in
*  something closer to social democracy, how are you going to convince those people that there should
*  be worker ownership of the means of production? It's kind of a ridiculous leap if you don't have
*  the credibility as the group of people organizing for universal health care, organizing for a $15
*  minimum wage and able to get the goods. And also in practice, as we fight for these reforms,
*  ordinary people will have a better sense, at least my hope is, of what it means to be involved with
*  politics and what politics can do for their lives. It's positive because right now when we talk about
*  politics, it often just seems that we're talking about like a very glib cultural conflict removed
*  from the things that are important in our lives. Whereas in truth, I think politics can be a tool
*  for us to make our lives better. Yeah, and there's like deep ideas here, where in some sense,
*  universal health care and worker collectives are not so radically different, that there's just,
*  there's philosophical ideas to explore and accept. And also from my perspective, at least,
*  maybe I'm wrong on this, but it seems like with a lot of things at the core of politics, the right
*  answer from an alien perspective is not clear. Like everybody's very certain of what's the right
*  answer. Everyone's certain universal health care is terrible, or in the case of universal health
*  care, majority of people think it's a good idea, but I don't think anyone knows. Because I think
*  that depends on cultural history, on the particular dynamics of a country, of a political system,
*  on the dynamics of the economic system in this country, of the changing world. The 21st century
*  is different than the 20th century. Maybe the failures of communism in the 20th century will
*  not be repeated in the 21st century, or the flip side of that, maybe capitalism will actually truly
*  flourish with the help of automation in the 21st century. I don't think anyone knows. So people
*  like you are basically arguing for ideas, and we have to explore those ideas together.
*  Why do you think if universal health care is popular,
*  why don't we have universal health care in the United States?
*  Well, democracy is a great thing. Political democracy is wonderful. It came from the struggles
*  of ordinary people to expand suffrage and so on. But the economic sphere, entrenched power in the
*  economic sphere, bleeds into our political democracy. So I think there's a lot of people
*  with a vested interest in not having universal health care. There's large industries with a
*  vested interest in not having universal health care. They pay for ads, pay lobbyists, they influence
*  government, and they have made it very difficult. So you can't get universal health care
*  done without the bill. Even if you pass something and you're trying to make a change,
*  Obamacare was supposed to have a public option. Everybody's been running on a public option in
*  the Democratic Party for 12, 13 years. Why don't we have a public option? People know that if people
*  have the choice of buying into government plan, that might be the slow road to really having
*  universal health care. So I think a lot of it's opposition. Do you like that idea, the public option?
*  Maybe you can, like, because isn't there complexities, like pre-existing conditions?
*  So isn't a public option mean you can not have any insurance until you get into trouble?
*  And then you can, if it covers pre-existing conditions, just start paying for insurance,
*  then therefore young people don't pay for insurance. Isn't it better to go full in?
*  I don't support a public option in part because I think if we allow politicians to just say,
*  hey, I support a public option, it's just kind of a way to signal your support for universal health
*  care but give us nothing. And I think that's what we saw with Biden and a lot of other politicians
*  that have supported a public option. I think in practice, if a public option is defined in such
*  a way that it just means you by default can just opt in to a public plan, and let's say hypothetically,
*  you don't even have to pay for it, then it's just a back door to universal health care really quickly
*  because I think the vast majority of people who aren't currently covered, and also a lot of
*  employers, to be honest, would probably drop their private coverage if they knew their employees can
*  just get a public option and maybe would only provide supplemental insurance or whatever else.
*  But I think the broad overarching point of all these demands is to say that socialists need
*  to be really connected to the day-to-day struggles of people to just improve their lives.
*  So if you're feeling like you're paying $400, $500 on the Obamacare market for health insurance,
*  and that's hampering your ability to do what you want to do in your life,
*  then maybe you would support a candidate who's for universal health care. If you feel like you're
*  struggling to find work that you can afford to pay your rent with or whatever else, maybe you'll
*  support a candidate committed to all sorts of mechanisms to reduce housing prices or increase
*  your power as a tenant and whatever else. I think these day-to-day concerns need to be connected to
*  the more abstract and lofty vision of change. Otherwise, our politics just becomes this
*  fantasy world thing that's nice ideas to think about or debate but really won't make much of
*  a difference in people's lives. What do you think about free college? Should college be free?
*  So I would say free college is not at the top of my list of priorities,
*  but it definitely should be free in my vision of a just society.
*  What is at the top? Just to clarify, is the universal health care up there?
*  Yeah, universal health care is probably far higher in my priorities than free college.
*  I think right now the way our system is built, when someone goes to college,
*  they're given credentials, they're given a decree they carry with them for the rest of their life.
*  It gives them a chance to join a privileged part of the labor market. It's not a zero-sum game.
*  I don't want college-educated people to think that non-college-educated people are their enemies and
*  vice versa because a lot of them are just ordinary working-class people trying to survive
*  and they're in different areas or in different sectors. Some of them are in nursing sectors
*  where they need a college degree and so on. But if you just make college tuition free,
*  but you don't also make trade skills and other things free for someone to learn how to become
*  an electrician or a plumber or whatever else, then to some degree you're privileging one sector
*  of the labor market over another. So I would advocate just if you're going to make something
*  like that free, you just have to make sure you're doing it in an egalitarian way.
*  The options and the routes to college are more equal. There's more investment in K-12 education
*  so that more kids in rough neighborhoods have the chance to go to college. For those that choose
*  the trade route from any part of the country, they're given the skills and resources for
*  vocational trainings and those are also free. It just feels like in terms of order of operation,
*  I would just start with K-12 education, improving it and whatever else, then college after,
*  but I'm not opposed to it. Does that, improving K-12 education,
*  does that mean investing more into it? Is it as simple as just increasing the amount of money
*  that's invested in public education? In general, when it comes to the public
*  sector or any sphere that you're investing in, obviously it's not just as simple as throwing money
*  at a problem. I do think we have a lot of schools that are underfunded, but we have other schools
*  that are adequately funded, but the conditions in which those schools are, like the neighborhoods
*  they're in and what's going on in society, the problems are so deep that it's impossible for
*  just education to solve everything. I think especially a lot of liberals think that education
*  should be the panacea. Invest in education, you'll help people. If kids are living in poverty,
*  if they go into school hungry or whatever else, education's not going to give them
*  everything they need to succeed. Sometimes we, I think, put too much weight on education.
*  Of course, you could define education more broadly, which is the care of the flourishing
*  of the young mind, whatever that is. Whatever you call it.
*  New York City, at least, we do have universal pre-K. From age three onward, you have the option
*  for that. It's important for kids' socialization. Their parents are now able to know that they could
*  go to work or do something else and have their kids taken care of. There's a lot of measures like that
*  that we could do to equalize things. Again, for libertarians in the audience, some of this stuff
*  is scary because it's obviously more state involved. State involved in pre-K. State is already
*  very involved in K through 12. More investment into state institutions like our state universities
*  and in college. For me, it's not a question of state versus non-state. It's a question of
*  good outcomes for people. It just happens to be that for working class people,
*  having the collective power to elect representatives that will build a broader safety net is in their
*  interest. For upper middle class people, for others, they could afford to pay for their own
*  provisioning either directly or through Obamacare schemes where you just get a subsidy and you pay
*  the rest yourself. This is for the bottom 40% plus of the population. They really don't have any
*  options so they prioritize other things. They end up with some sort of injury or health problem or
*  whatever else. It's bad for everyone in society but especially bad for the people at the bottom of the
*  labor market. I saw various estimates for socialist programs like social security expansion, free
*  college, Medicare for all will cost upwards of $40 trillion over 10 years.
*  They could argue with those numbers and so on. There's a cost. There's a taxpayer cost.
*  Given the weight of that cost, can you still make the case with these programs and then can
*  you try to make the case against them that the cost is too high? I will not argue with you on
*  the numbers because you just threw out random numbers. I do think universal health here,
*  if done right, can be basically cost neutral. I think it's an exception because we spend a
*  tremendous amount of money on health care, a huge percentage of our GDP. I think it could be done
*  in a way that's close to cost neutral. Can you argue on the numbers without arguing on the
*  numbers? You're saying just your gut says that there's a lot of, depending on how these programs
*  are done, there's a lot of variance in how much it will actually cost. There's a lot of bureaucracy
*  billing right now in our health care sector, for example, that would be eliminated. There's a lot
*  of costs that are spiraling upward, provider costs from both doctors, hospitals, but also
*  pharmaceuticals, and drug costs that insurance companies shoulder because their market share is
*  too fragmented to really negotiate hard. Medicare can sometimes negotiate better rates, but Medicare
*  for all would negotiate even better rates. I think there's a cost spiral that we can adjust
*  with more government involvement. There's a reason why we spend a bigger share of our GDP
*  on health care than other places, but let me just accept the broad premise that social programs cost
*  money. Now, I think that one, for ordinary people, most of them, the trade-off of even hypothetically
*  if taxes on lower middle class and working class people in certain cases go up, the trade-off would
*  still be in their benefit because they're the ones who currently would be consuming more of those
*  goods. Also, our tax system and whatnot is progressive, so the rich will pay more,
*  the majority will consume more of them. Also, I think a lot of these programs are the bedrock
*  of a healthy society. One reason, for example, that we have so much crime and violence in the
*  U.S., there's lots of cultural and other causes with our level of gun ownership, American history,
*  and so on, but one really important factor is just the level of poverty and inequality in the U.S.
*  compared to other countries that combined with guns and other factors means that we live in more
*  violent, unequal societies. A European would be shocked by the fact that in even some of our nicest
*  areas and cities and elsewhere, because there's a lot of rural violence too, it's just normal to have
*  gun violence. It's normal to have drug-related violence. We have, what, like 400 or 500 people
*  some years in Baltimore, a city of under a million getting killed. These are all recipes
*  for a society in which, one, the public sphere is drunk like crazy because you're not going to go
*  wander out for an evening stroll in a park if you live in a dangerous area or whatever else.
*  Like, the rot goes very deep and a welfare state is one way to live in a better society for everyone.
*  There's been plenty of studies. There's one book called The Spirit Level on inequality that was
*  quite popular that just notes that inequality is really terrible for the psyches of the rich too,
*  not just for the poor. I think spending some more money living in a more just society is doable.
*  There's different ways to address certain cost spirals. One reason why our welfare states are
*  getting more and more expensive is in part just because our population is aging, but many of the
*  same people who say we can't afford more in our welfare states because we're already spending so
*  much on social security and all these other entitlements are the same people also for,
*  one, closing borders so immigrants can't come in to help build the economy and to fill gaps in the
*  economy, and also who aren't for things that will make it easier to have kids. I'm 33 years old.
*  I have a lot of friends who have been putting off having kids until they save up X amount of dollars,
*  even though they have someone they could raise children with, because they can't afford the cost
*  of childcare. Their job probably won't give them more than four or six weeks of family leave or
*  whatever else. This is not the case in other countries. I think there's all sorts of benefits
*  from having a bigger welfare state, but yes, there are costs and there are going to be certain
*  trade-offs. It's not a magical thing where you could just have everything without trade-offs.
*  In a progressive tax system, to push back on the costs here, is there a point at which taxing the
*  rich is kind of productive in the long term? In the short term, there might be a net benefit
*  of increasing taxes because the programs the middle class, the lower middle class gets is more
*  beneficial. Is there a negative side to taxing the rich? In theory, yes, of course. One would be
*  if you tax the rich so much, they change their consumption patterns and that has negative impacts
*  on the economy as a whole. You would have to really model it out, but there would be a certain
*  point in which the consumption changes might have net detrimental effects. I think that's
*  more unlikely. The more likely scenario is you tax corporations and other wealthy people in society
*  to the point that they have potentially less money for productive investment because you're
*  in a capitalist society, so you're relying on capitalists to invest. You don't want to be in
*  the worst of both worlds where you've gone too far for capitalism, but not far enough for socialism.
*  My vision of socialism, that's one reason why we'd have to take the investment function
*  away from capitalists. If you're going to make it so hard for them that they can't invest or they
*  can't employ labor the way they're employing now, you have to create another mechanism for supply to
*  be created. That's the transition point. What about longer term de-incentivizing young people
*  that are dreaming of becoming entrepreneurs and realizing that there's this huge tax on being
*  wealthy? If you take these big risks, which is what's required to be an entrepreneur,
*  and you are lucky enough to succeed and good enough to succeed, that the government will take
*  most of your money away. I think realistically that's not a disincentive for most people.
*  First of all, we already have a progressive taxation system. The government does take a
*  bunch of the money away and people are still striving to become rich. A lot of what people
*  want when they dream of success is they want accolades, they want respect, and of course,
*  they want some more wealth. Wealth they consume luxury goods with or whatever else.
*  But at a certain point, it becomes better for the state to tax and either redistribute directly or
*  through social programs or redirect that money through tax credits and other ways to shape
*  investment towards productive investment. We don't want a society in which a bunch of rich people
*  fly around in helicopters going from club to club while the productive economy does nothing.
*  At that point, I think a lot of ordinary rich people might prefer the government to come in
*  to tax them and to try to spur investment in certain productive sectors. It really
*  just depends. I honestly believe that most people don't necessarily want to be rich for the sake of
*  being rich. They want to be successful and there's many different dynamics to that.
*  Accolades and social respect is an important one of them. It's also why people who just become
*  filthy rich often, the first thing they do is start out philanthropic trusts and try to give
*  away their money because they want the social respect and accolades and whatever else. They
*  don't want just their money. On that topic, a little bit of a tangent. There's a lot of folks
*  in the left community, far left community, socialist community that I think are at the
*  source of a derision towards the B word, the billionaires. Does it bother you or do you think
*  that's in part justified using the word billionaire as a dirty word?
*  I think it's perfectly justified that it's a popular shorthand. Obviously, when I talk
*  about inequality, I often talk about power dynamics between workers and bosses and so on.
*  Billionaire is just the 99%-1% version of it. It's just a popular shorthand to just explain
*  the fact that there's a lot of people who have accumulated obscene wealth. These people aren't,
*  in my mind, parasites in the very, very old school socialist rhetoric.
*  Capitalists provide employment, take entrepreneurial risks, come up with new ideas,
*  sometimes themselves, sometimes directly manage work and whatever else.
*  They exert so much power over the lives of not just their workers but society as a whole.
*  Taking away some of their wealth and power is a way to just empower others. Again, these things
*  have policy trade-offs. If you just snap your fingers and say, Elon Musk, all your wealth is
*  gone, you're now on food stamps or whatever else in that arbitrary way, you'd be a totally
*  disincentivized people from trusting the rules of the game as they've been set up in a capitalist
*  society. I think that would have negative consequences for workers. But saying that,
*  hey, this person has too much power and too much wealth and has too much ability to dictate things
*  about the lives of others, I think is just simply a fact. I think it's true in the cases of people
*  who are good people and have risen to this position and it's true in the cases of people who are
*  maybe not so good people and who have risen to these positions.
*  I agree with you in part, but I have to push back here. One of the problems I see is using
*  billionaires as shorthand to talk about power inequality and wealth inequality often dismisses
*  the fact that some of these folks are some of the best members of our society. Outside of
*  the, however the system has created inequalities, a young person today should dream to build cool
*  stuff, not for the wealth, not for the power, the fame, but to be part of building cool stuff.
*  Now, there's a lot of examples of billionaires that have gotten there in shady ways and so on,
*  and you can point that out. But in the same way we celebrate great artists and great athletes
*  and great literary icons and writers and poets and musicians and engineers and scientists,
*  we should separate the human creator from the wealth that the system has given them.
*  That's what I worry about is like in our system, some of the greatest humans are the ones that have
*  become rich. We sometimes mix up the, if you want to criticize the wealth, we sometimes
*  criticize the human and the creator while that should actually be the person we aspire to be.
*  I would agree with that. LeBron James, if he's not already in his lifetime, will be a billionaire.
*  He got his money largely through just being an incredible athlete, excelling in his field
*  more than anyone, besides for Michael Jordan. I think he's my number two. He might be my number
*  one. We'll see. I'm willing to keep keeping open mind about the LeBron versus Jordan conversation.
*  He got that through his merit and he's been rewarded. In a part, he's getting rewarded
*  because he's created vast amounts of wealth beyond what he's getting. This is just his share.
*  It's the salary cap league. Whenever he's doing an endorsement, obviously that company is thinking
*  that he's worth more than what they're paying him for that endorsement and so on. To the extent
*  with Elon Musk, people see innovation and they see someone who will put himself out there with
*  sometimes crazy ideas because he's trying to think about the future and trying to just push
*  things forward instead of just sitting on whatever money he has now and just investing it, earning
*  6% return for the rest of his life. I think that's a positive thing, but I think it doesn't get to
*  the broader policy question. When people invoke billionaires, they're invoking the specter of
*  inequality and power. It's not normally the rhetoric that I use because I propose and I use
*  more traditional socialist rhetoric and terms, but I think it gets at something real.
*  Often with these sorts of shorthands we use in politics, they're imperfect, but they speak to
*  a real thing. They feed a little bit of fun that folks like AOC and Elon have with each other.
*  It feeds, it inspires, it serves as a catalyst for productive discourse. Speaking of which,
*  you said you're a fan of Bernie Sanders. Would you classify yourself as a Bernie bro? What's
*  the technical definition of a Bernie bro? Is that a subset? No, no, no, I'm sorry. You're a
*  sophisticated philosopher, writer, economic and political thinker. Of course, you would not call
*  yourself a Bernie bro. I'm fine with calling myself a Bernie bro. It was made up by liberal
*  journalists to smear Bernie and his supporters during the 2016 campaign, even though disproportionately
*  his supporters were young women in their 20s. I'll ride for Bernie. There's worse things in
*  the world than being called a bro. What do you like about Bernie Sanders and to what degree does
*  he represent ideas of socialism? To what degree does he represent the more traditional liberal
*  ideas? I love Bernie. Most of all, I like his clarity. He's by far the best communicator we
*  have on the left. He speaks with a moral force. He's relatable. He's taken a lot of socialist
*  rhetoric from academia and brought it down to its core in a way that's comprehensible for ordinary
*  people and speaks to their daily lives. When Bernie does a speech, people can finish his lines
*  because they know what he's going to say. They know what points he's going to hit because
*  socialism, in my mind, should not be a complicated thing. When we get to more abstract discussions
*  about what a future system would look like, when we get to the policy trade-offs today,
*  I think we need to put on a different hat. We should embrace all sorts of nuance and contradiction
*  and complication. When it comes to the core moral and ethical appeal, I think Bernie grasps that
*  and how to communicate it. Bernie Sanders was politicized a very long time ago. I actually
*  once told him, I've only met him a few times, but one time I joked that in his book he mentioned that
*  one politicizing moment in his life was when the Brooklyn Dodgers left town and he was devastated
*  because he was a Dodgers fan from Brooklyn. I said, this is a 2020 campaign, this may be 2019. I said,
*  Bernie, you're running for president. You do not need to keep reminding people your age.
*  He was politicized through the Young People's Socialist League, which was an old offshoot of
*  the Norm Thomas Socialist Party of America. It's a very old school socialist tradition.
*  Then he was engaged in labor struggles in the 60s. He was engaged in the Civil Rights Movement. He
*  came from this old left generation that I think just had a more plain spoken, more rooted way of
*  understanding change and socialism. It wasn't in my mind polluted by academia and by some of the
*  turn towards issues of culture and excessive focus on representation or whatever else. It was really
*  rooted in something economic in a way. Then obviously he had all his ideas and he was also
*  a product of the left and that he went to Vermont. He did the back to the land thing. He was basically
*  like not quite a hippie and affect, but he was out there trying to farm or whatever in cold as hell
*  Northern Vermont. Then he decided to do politics, do electoral politics. He failed for a long time.
*  He did third party politics. He kept losing races. Eventually he became savvy and luck in things he
*  learned, the mayor of Burlington, Vermont. He just kept with the same message. In my book,
*  I talk about, I quote, I think a Bernie speech from the 1970s, one of his early campaigns.
*  I compared it to a Bernie speech during his 2016 campaign. It was virtually identical.
*  Millionaires were swapped with millionaires and billionaires, speaking of billionaires,
*  which is beautiful. I think there's something great to what he offered American politics.
*  Also, all around the world, there's a socialist poll in politics, whether you agree with it or
*  not in all these countries in Europe and any rich country, Japan and so on. The US really didn't
*  have that. The furthest left he could go was Chris Hayes and MSNBC or whatever. I'm very glad that
*  there's a socialist poll and I think we have Bernie to thank for it to the extent that a lot of
*  self-described socialists don't think Bernie is a real socialist. It's in part because he stays
*  grounded in people's day-to-day lives and struggles. I don't think he thinks often the way that I do
*  and other people more disconnected or step and move from day-to-day politics, think about the future
*  and the future contours of a socialist society and so on. I think he's morally committed to
*  an egalitarian different sort of future. I don't think he, at least I haven't heard him
*  talk about this big broad history and future, the Marxist ideology and so on. Not that he's
*  afraid of it or something, it's just not how he thinks about it. Yeah, I think he's a practical
*  thinker and also, yeah, he is running, even if he should be afraid of it too because he is a
*  major politician running for president. I think what people want is they want
*  the left wing of the possible or at least the segment of the party that was voting for him,
*  the Democratic party is voting for him. They wanted something that was a step or two removed
*  from what they had now and was visionary, but not so far removed that it seemed like a scary
*  leap and I think we lost a chance in 2016 to elect someone that I think would have
*  beaten Trump or at the very least would have been close. Do you think the Democrats screwed him over?
*  Yes, not in the way of deliberate or direct vote-working, but they put their thumb on the
*  scale for sure. It's not even conspiracy theory. There's all this stuff in the debates about
*  Clinton's people being fed questions and whatever else and just the tone of the media.
*  The media was extremely dismissive and hostile to him. I love that Bernie still does the Fox News
*  town hall with his, they're just him speaking to the people and he's not afraid of going on any
*  outlet and making his case, but I think a lot of the liberal media in particular always had it out
*  for Bernie Sanders. What was the, because that was really annoying. That was really annoying how
*  dismissive they were. I've seen that in some other candidates. They were dismissive towards Andrew
*  Yang in that same way. So forget the ideology. Why are they so smug sometimes towards certain
*  candidates? What is that? Because I think that's actually at the core to a degree if Democrats or
*  any party fails, that it's that smugness because people see through that. I think a lot of these
*  people are friends. Even if they don't know each other, they're friends because they went to the
*  same schools. They know the same people. They have the same broad ideology and worldview.
*  They had a sense of what the Democratic party should be and who it should be running and who
*  is going to win and also what was serious and unserious. Bernie would say some things about
*  the world that objectively to a lot of people seemed correct or at least pretty close to correct
*  and a journalist would just look at him like he's from outer space. To some extent, this also happens
*  to people on the right. People on the right often say things that I find repulsive or just wrong,
*  but there's parts of the media that would describe their certain views as illegitimate or outside
*  the boundaries of acceptable conversation. I think there should be a few things outside
*  the boundary of acceptable conversation, hate speech and so on. There's this attempt to say
*  their views are illegitimate and therefore anyone who votes for them for any reason is illegitimate
*  too. That's one reason why I think it's fueled a lot of resentment and will ultimately end up
*  fueling the extremes of American politics that people feel like they're not being listened to.
*  And some of it is also style of speaking and personality where if you're not willing to
*  sort of play kind of a game of civility or there's like a proper way of speaking if you're a Democrat,
*  if you're not doing that kind of proper way of speaking and people dismiss you.
*  I think in certain sense, whatever you feel about him, people dismiss Donald Trump for the same
*  reason where it's the style of speaking, the personality of the person. He's not playing by
*  the rules of polite society, of polite politician society and so on. That troubles me because it
*  feels like solutions, the great leaders will not be polite. They're not going to behave in the way
*  they're supposed to behave. And I just wish the media was at least open-minded to that,
*  like, which I guess gives me hope about the new media, which is like more distributed citizen
*  media, right? That they're more open-minded to the revolutionary, to the outsiders, right?
*  I actually first, I really like Bernie Sanders. I first heard him in conversation with Tom Hartman.
*  He had these like weekly conversations and just the authenticity from the guy, I didn't even know
*  any context. I didn't even know honestly he was a Democratic socialist or anything. The authenticity
*  of the human being was really refreshing. And when he, I guess, decided to run for president,
*  that was really strange. I was like, surely this kind of, this person has no chance.
*  Just like he seemed too authentic. He seemed too, like he's not going to be effective of playing the
*  game of politics. So it was very inspiring to me to see that you don't necessarily need to be good
*  at playing the game of politics. You can actually have a chance of winning. Yeah, that was really
*  inspiring to see. What about some of the other popular candidates? What do you think about AOC?
*  I don't know if she self-identifies as a socialist or not. She does self-identify as a Democratic
*  socialist. I think she was a very inspiring figure for a lot of people. She was kind of out of this
*  Bernie wave with the first set of Bernie candidates in 2018 that identified with him instead of the
*  Democratic Party establishment. I think that she's still developing as a politician. And it's very
*  difficult when you're in a deep blue district and when you don't often have to worry about re-election
*  or talk to, but modulate your rhetoric to win over swing voters in your district, but then you're
*  immediately a national and cultural figure. So AOC basically goes from her views, which are compelling
*  in my mind. A lot of her programmatic views are compelling. Wins her district and then has her own
*  rhetoric, which to me compared to Bernie owes itself more to the academic left and the way that
*  a lot of the left has learned to talk. I don't mean academic in the sense that she's like a Marxist
*  or whatever else, but academic in the way that she may be using at times confusing language to
*  convey basic points when she gets into the language of intersectionality and whatever else.
*  Especially in the context of cultural issues and stuff like that.
*  Exactly. Instead of just a plain spoken Bernie, like, yeah, discrimination is wrong. If you ask
*  me about a cultural issue, I'll come down on the same side as AOC, I'm sure, nine plus times out of
*  10, but I'll try to root it into just basic, yeah, treat people with respect and they'll treat you
*  with respect and that's the way we should govern our civic sphere. We don't need to talk about
*  intersectionality to get that. So there's that rhetoric. But she's not just a regular congressperson
*  in a deep blue district, she's also a national and international cultural and political figure.
*  So she's now a spokesperson because of large media event of her surprising upset election and her
*  being young and being really connected to this post-Bernie moment. And I think amid these constant
*  one attacks on her from the right and also this media attention and this notoriety, she hasn't
*  really modulated or adjusted her audience, her rhetoric. How do you win over someone who
*  really hates a lot of your ideas but might actually believe in some of your policies?
*  And I think she's been ineffective, quite frankly, in the last year making that transition. Whereas
*  I think other politicians who are not so far left, who don't identify as socialists, but let's say
*  John Federman has managed to become more effective. And I don't think it's a question of character
*  or whatever else and I like AOC, so I don't want to put it so harshly. But I think a lot of it has
*  to do with her being a congressperson in a deep blue district and Federman being running for
*  statewide office in a quote unquote purple state. But at her best, she does it, but it's like glimmers.
*  It's kind of like, I don't know, what sport are you biggest fan of? I'll give you a sports analogy.
*  I mean, NFL is up there, soccer is up there, but probably UFC.
*  Okay, well, I can't give you a good analogy for any of those, but it's like a raw prospect.
*  Someone who shows glimmers of hope, so they were drafted really high and then they bounce from team
*  to team and you're like, I'm clinging on to my AOC stock, but I think that she needs to be self-critical
*  enough and her team needs to be self-critical enough to know that the goal is not merely to be a
*  national cultural figure and win a reelection near a deep blue district. The goal has to be to become
*  truly a national political figure, which will require changes.
*  A unifier and inspiring figure about the ideas that she represents.
*  Definitely. And she has other things against her. Obviously class focus, but there's no
*  denying I think that some of the hostility to her is sexism. It's rooted in I think people
*  wanting to see her fail or whatever else, but that's only some of it. I think some of it
*  otherwise is her struggling to relate to people who don't have a lot of her starting points as far
*  as moral and ethical beliefs. Yeah, but she's actually great at flourishing in all the
*  attacks she's getting. She's doing a good job with that. And a lot of those attacks would break me,
*  if I'm being honest. Yes, that's the amount of fire she's under. But you don't want that to become
*  a drug to where you just get good at being a national figure that's constantly in the fights
*  and are using that for attention and so on. You still want to be the unifier. And that's the tricky
*  switch. Do you think there's a chance there's a world in which she's able to modulate it enough
*  to be a unifier and run for president? And when? I think she's very far away from being able to
*  do that. I think that even other politicians that are also polarizing within the squad in terms of
*  what they say or their ideas, whatever else, are very effective communicators like Ilhan Omar and
*  others. I think AOC, I mean, that's my hope. My hope is that someone like AOC could. The last year
*  plus has not been extremely promising in my mind, in part because she's continued to position herself
*  as a lightning rod cultural figure. Whereas I think a national political figure needs to
*  pick their spots and also pick their moment for changing their rhetoric and adjusting to their
*  audience. And I think she does it in certain environments, but that needs to be your national
*  message when you're out there. You need to be speaking towards the not already converted.
*  And I think Bernie does that. Bernie strips his politics down to the basics.
*  So I agree with you spiritually, but we also have an example of Donald Trump winning the presidency.
*  Isn't some of the game of politics that's separate from the policy being able to engage in
*  rhetoric that leads to outrage and then walking through that fire with grace?
*  First of all, I think Trump is kind of a unique personality in American history, so it's hard to
*  compare anyone to Trump. But don't you think AOC is comparable in terms of the uniqueness
*  in the political system we're in or no? I think Trump is much more of a firebrand,
*  anti-establishment force. And I mean this negatively for what it's worth because I
*  disagree with Trump, but he was willing to set fire to the Republican
*  establishment. He was able to self-fund largely his campaign and he already was a media figure
*  without them. AOC has been much more cautious with the Democratic Party establishment,
*  in part because she's not trying to run a national political campaign right now
*  for the outside, like a 5% chance they're going to be president. Let me set fire to everything.
*  She's trying to help people and help her constituents through the game of getting
*  committee appointments and getting wins on the margins. I think that's understandable
*  for what it's worth. But in the process, I think what's the difference between AOC
*  and a progressive Democrat? During 2016, it used to be pretty easy to say the difference
*  between the Bernie-Krats and a progressive Democrat, because we were establishing our own
*  outside third force in American politics. You could knock on the door of a lot of people who
*  would end up voting for Trump and they would say, oh, I have a lot of respect for Bernie,
*  or whatever. They were still going to not vote for him, but he wasn't considered part of the
*  Democratic Party milieu. I think now with AOC, there's a much closer association of AOC in
*  our policies with ordinary Democrats, where she needs to draw stronger distinctions. She does need
*  to do it like Trump did with just, man, I forgot all of them, though I found some of them amusing
*  in the moment, like all his nicknames about a lion Ted Cruz and the rest. But I do feel like
*  she needs to differentiate herself a bit more, but then also just keep her language simple.
*  Trump was more complex than Bernie in his literal language, but he was repetitive and there was a
*  rhythm and a cadence to Trump's speech. I think AOC needs to, like Bernie, reduce her rhetoric down
*  to a couple key lines and signatures and focus her politics not on 20 issues, but on three or four
*  most important issues and have that message discipline. Bernie will do an interview with
*  you and he'll write down, I hope you do interview Bernie, but he'll write down like five things and
*  I'm only going to talk about these five things. Ask me about this? Okay, I'm talking about these
*  five things. So that's a message discipline that Bernie has been exemplary on. Yeah, sure. But I
*  think that's learned, that could be developed. I think she could develop it. Listen, I hope,
*  I'm answering your question, I think not the way I should answer it, being someone broadcasting to
*  two people on the left and elsewhere. I hope AOC goes in that direction. I just think that she has
*  a lot going against her just because she's already a national figure and she's in a deeper blue
*  district. But we need to root our politics then in working class people and a lot of districts that,
*  that I don't know, the type of kitchen table conversations are, I hate that cliche,
*  but I just used it. But a lot of these conversations are just different in their tone
*  and cadence. And it's not just a question of, you know, Fetterman or Tim Ryan in Ohio and kind of
*  just white working class voters. I mean, working class voters of any race. There's their day to
*  day needs and the day to day things they want to talk about is just at a different plane than
*  you know, a Met Gala cultural statement. Yeah, I mean, it's clear that you respect and love her
*  and would like to see different ways. I mean, she's young, so the different trajectories that
*  she could develop that would ultimately make her a good candidate. I'm just looking at odds here
*  for, and I disagree with them. I'm buying AOC stock here, given these odds. So in terms of
*  democratic, who's going to win the 2024 election? So that includes running and winning.
*  On the Democrat side is 18% chance for Biden, 7% chance for Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom at 6%,
*  Michelle Obama at 3%, Hillary Clinton at 2%, and AOC at 1.5%, and then Bernie at 1%. So,
*  I would not buy AOC at that mark. I would buy Biden like crazy though.
*  I'm not a gambling man, but I would totally toss a G at Biden at that amount.
*  AOC at 1.5% chance? I don't think she runs.
*  You don't think she runs? Yeah, okay. I don't think Bernie will primary Biden either. I mean,
*  if Biden doesn't run, then obviously it's an open field, but I just feel like...
*  Do you think Biden runs? Yes, I think Biden probably runs.
*  Oh, man. Oh, boy. He's an incumbent president, so it's very hard to imagine
*  another Democrat being able to do better than him. All right. What about the competition?
*  I think Donald Trump is the best thing for the Democrats, period, just because it would create
*  this turnout mechanism, this excitement around we have to stop Donald Trump. He's attacking
*  DeSantis already. He's trying to... The sanctimonious thing. Trump's like the Don
*  King of American politics. Yeah, it's interesting what kind of dynamic chaos he's created.
*  It probably led to more people being interested in politics. Well, almost guaranteed it led to
*  more people being interested in politics, but maybe not in a healthy way. Maybe it created an
*  unhealthy relationship with politics where it created more partisanship.
*  For me, I don't have a problem with partisanship. It's what kind of partisanship.
*  I think Trump has cultivated a lot of right populists, a relationship with his
*  supporters. It's almost like a leader follower relationship in a way that doesn't actually
*  enhance people's knowledge of politics and the issues, but actually just leads them to follow
*  the party line. Ideally, I think socialist politics and politics on the left should be something
*  different. Eugene Debs, the great American socialist leader of the late 19th and early 20th century,
*  used to say, I'm not your Moses. I can't promise to lead you to the promised land
*  because if I can lead you there and you just follow me there, someone's just going to lead
*  you straight out as soon as I'm gone. I think there's something nice about that kind of anti
*  blind following leader follower dynamic on the left at its best.
*  That said, in the way at least the political race in the United States has turned out,
*  it seems like it's turned into a bit of entertainment and they're having personalities
*  and characters is really important. In terms of policy and actual leadership, yes, maybe having a
*  leader, like an authoritarian big leader is not good, but maybe for the race it is,
*  for the drama of it. You just want to have drama and attention on people who are actually going
*  to turn out to be good leaders. That's a weird balance to strike. Earn media is what they always
*  talk about in political campaigns. The more you could get on TV, the better. I really like
*  Federman. He just won his campaign, but a good part of his early campaign, he had pivoted from
*  talking about issues to just talking about Dr. Oz living in New Jersey and having the troll campaign
*  against him, which I found amusing, but also it was effective, obviously he won, but it's a bit
*  depressing because I would have rather a whole campaign cycle about health care and jobs and
*  other issues. The hope is that people just get better at that kind of social media communication.
*  I do actually think there's something about doing political speeches that makes you sound less
*  authentic because you have to do so many of them. It must be exhausting to day after day after day
*  make the speech. You're going to start replaying the same stuff over and over as opposed to actually
*  thinking about the words that are coming out of your mouth. Then the public will know that you're
*  not really being that authentic. Even though you believe those things, it's just tough. I just wish
*  they didn't have to constantly do speeches. I think that the fact that Bernie's speeches very
*  clearly came out of, if not directly his own pen, but his own rhetoric over the years and he wrote
*  it seemed authentic, even if he was repeating it. Then Trump, his just wild improvisation,
*  I think people found real in a certain way. I would love for the left more generally to tap
*  into some of that anti-establishment sentiment, but obviously do it in a way that's productive,
*  that doesn't blame immigrants or whatever else for problems, but it's built on a different basis.
*  People are fed up for good reason with a lot of conventional politics and we need to speak to that.
*  Otherwise, it'll only be the right that is taking advantage of those people's anger.
*  Well, I almost forgot to ask you about China. Both historically, we talked about the Soviet Union,
*  but what lessons do you draw from the implementation of socialism and communism
*  in Maoist China and modern China? What's the good and the bad?
*  Well, I think it's very similar to the Soviet case in that socialism came to China
*  through not a base of organized workers in a capitalist country at a certain level development
*  and so on, but it came through the countryside and in conditions of civil war, strife, Japanese
*  invasion and whatever else, and Mao built his base in the peasantry, then came down to the city
*  to govern and try to build a base and rule over workers. It was an inversion of classic
*  socialist theory. Now, the same thing that I said before about Stalin and assessing the
*  Soviet Union has to apply here because obviously, I oppose authoritarianism and all sorts of moral
*  condemnations I should do, but to look at what the Chinese Communist Party actually accomplished,
*  I think we need to take a step backwards from our moral opposition to the means in which they
*  accomplished it and just look at it developmentally. China benefited greatly from the Communist Party's
*  implementation of basic education and healthcare. In a lot of China, one of the conditions of women
*  were absolutely terrible. There was still foot binding and all sorts of terrible backward
*  practice. You had a huge vast majority of the population that was illiterate without any access
*  to basic education and you had no health access, especially on the countryside.
*  Those are the three good things that China did. Improve the status of women, get everyone into
*  primary education and improve the lot of healthcare. Besides for that, their agricultural campaign was
*  a failure, just like Stalin's for many of the same reasons I mentioned before. The Great Leap Forward
*  crash industrialization didn't really work either. In a way, is China better than India or other
*  countries that didn't have the basic education and the strong state authority and the health
*  improvements and whatever? I think maybe, but I think that's why we need to sometimes go beyond
*  just economic measures of success. If you told me tomorrow, the US will grow at 3% if we maintain
*  democracy, but it'll grow at 8%, 9%. Everyone will be wealthier if we move to some sort of
*  authoritarian government. I think you're asking the wrong question if you're going to make your
*  decision based on growth because it has to be based on some sort of principle. The same dynamic
*  from the beginning of the Chinese Communist Party ruling over people emerging from the outside
*  through armed conflicts and ruling over ordinary Chinese people have continued. Since Deng Xiaoping,
*  the policies have been better economically and often at times, not always, the technocratic
*  governance has been quite good, but that doesn't mean that the party has a democratic mandate or
*  has the right to govern as they see fit. Clearly, it doesn't have that mandate in swathes of the
*  country or in places like Hong Kong or elsewhere. To me, nothing the Chinese Communist Party does
*  has anything to do with socialism. I think even by their own definition today, it really doesn't.
*  It's a sort of nationalist, authoritarian, developmental state that has done some good
*  things to improve the living standards of the Chinese people, other things that were
*  counterproductive. As a democratic socialist, I certainly don't support that state, but I also
*  hope that the US and Biden will find a way to avoid intense rivalry and competition economically
*  spilling over into something worse. From a democratic socialist perspective,
*  what's one policy or one or two ways you could fix if you could fix China, if you took over China,
*  what would you like to see change? Well, the democratic part comes before the socialist part.
*  I would say there needs to be multi-party elections in China and state censorship and
*  control over the press, in other words, needs to be done with. As far as their immediate economic
*  policy, I think the idea of maintaining strong state control of certain commanding heights of
*  the economy while liberalizing other spheres has done quite well in China's case, lifting people
*  out of poverty. But again, there's something really lost in society, even if it's getting
*  wealthier, if ordinary people don't have the ability to participate in dissent freely.
*  The Chinese authorities have allowed some, it's not North Korea, it's not a totally totalitarian
*  state. There's been workplace protests, there have been all sorts of local anti-corruption
*  protests and things like that, but the government decides what's permitted and what's not at what
*  particular moment. I think the long run, even if it can survive, there's a better way to do things,
*  which is quite simply a democracy. The thing is though, the lessons of history
*  that China is looking at, there's this dark aspect. Building on top of the fact that it seems like
*  under Stalin and under Mao, under Stalin, the Soviet Union and under Mao, China has seen a lot
*  of economic growth. And then one dark aspect of that, while under the Great Leap Forward, you have
*  upwards of 70 million people dead. Today, I think there's a large number of people who admire Stalin
*  and admire Mao. What they admire is the stability and the strong leadership. There's a lot of people
*  who miss the Soviet Union. The reason why they miss it is that it was a system they knew,
*  it provided the basics of their livelihood. Then afterwards, look at Russia in the 90s,
*  people were in chaos. The Communist Party had a huge amount of support democratically.
*  Anti-democratic measures had to be taken, ironically, against the Communist Party
*  to keep it from regaining more of a foothold in Russia. But we don't need that trade-off.
*  We could have a form of... Imagine if Russia went to a system closer to social democracy
*  that maintained the stability that people wanted, the welfare state that people wanted,
*  but restructured the economy in not a shock way, but in a way that made sense and that ordinary
*  people felt ownership of instead of just oligarchs who are a former Communist Party bureaucracy,
*  just dividing up the country for themselves. I think the same thing in China. First of all,
*  certainly from the West, the US government and people in the US should have no say over what
*  should happen in China. The Chinese Communist Party has more authentic authority than any of
*  us do in the country. But I think that the fears and stability that a lot of Chinese people have,
*  why I would imagine that even in a democratic election, the Communist Party might have majority
*  support, is because they fear the unknown. They fear collapse. That was one of the big lessons of
*  the Soviet collapse. Do you want China divided into five, six states? Do you want economic
*  turmoil? Do you want mass immediate privatization? Do you want whatever welfare state you have
*  destroyed and so on? I think people are right to have those fears, but there's a different route
*  towards democratization that maintains stability. There's different routes that you could have
*  democracy. Not every country had to go down the route of Yugoslavia and the USSR and so on.
*  You are the founder of the magazine Jacobin, of which I am a subscriber. I recommend everybody
*  subscribe whether you're on the left or the right. The magazine does tend to lean left.
*  Does it officially say it's socialist? Yeah, we're a socialist publication. We try to be
*  interesting. We try to have articles that have debates and contestation and whatever else,
*  but we're all socialists. Well, it's a lot of really interesting articles,
*  so I definitely recommend that people subscribe and support. The product of the 21st century
*  only subscribed to the digital version, but I guess there's also paper version. Yeah, there's
*  70,000 subscribers in print. Does it come on a scroll? I don't even know. Do they even publish
*  paper magazines anymore? I'm going to mail you a bunch of copies. No, it's perfect bound. It's
*  long issues. Our Jacobin's publisher, RemakeFour, just recently did a redesign of the publication,
*  so it looks really good. It's up there in the design award competition range. It's nice. It's
*  sexy. I can show it off to all my friends. Look. Put it in your coffee table. You don't even have
*  to read it. First, I need to get a coffee table, but yes, I'll get both. That's what respectable
*  listen. I've upgraded my life. I haven't had a couch, I don't think ever. I got a couch recently
*  because somebody told me that serious adults have a couch. I also got a TV because serious adults
*  have a couch and a TV. As you see, it's been here for many months and I still haven't unboxed it.
*  I'm trying to learn how to be an adult looking up on YouTube how to be an adult and learning
*  slowly. After that, I'll look into this whole leisure thing. Anyway, what's the origin of
*  Jacobin? What was the idea? What was the mission and what's the origin story?
*  So I started Jacobin when I was between my sophomore and junior year of college.
*  Basically, I was already a socialist. I was involved in the Democratic Socialist of America.
*  I was in the youth section, the young Democratic Socialist. I was editing their youth online
*  magazine called The Activist back then. To be honest, I had my ideology, I had my views.
*  I had a group of people around me that we would debate together and occasionally write for this
*  other publication, The Activist and so on. Just a product of creative ignorance in the sense that
*  I knew I had the capacity to maybe pull off an issue or two. I just had no idea how long I would
*  keep doing it. I eventually consumed my life slowly, maturely. I had different plans for my
*  future, but I ended up just being a magazine publisher. I literally didn't know what a magazine
*  publisher was, but it just happened. What's the hardest part about running a magazine?
*  The hardest part is obviously the things, just like any enterprise, the things beyond your control.
*  You could put out something that you think is great or interesting, but then you need the
*  feedback of people actually subscribing to it. You occasionally encounter periods where you feel like
*  you're doing your best work, but you're not getting the audience response. I think you just need the
*  self-confidence to just keep doing it. Obviously, if you're totally obscure and crazy and way off
*  the mark, you're never going to build that audience. I think a lot of publications have
*  tried to adapt to what everyone else is doing right away when they don't achieve success.
*  Whereas for me, the early issues of Jackman got very little resonance and took a while for it to
*  build into something. A lot of it was just the confidence to just keep going and keep publishing
*  what I would want to read and just hope that I'm not so much of a weirdo, that I'm the only one.
*  Is there some pressure that you could speak to of audience capture? Because it is a socialist
*  publication, you have a fan base, a readership base. Is there times you feel pressured not to
*  say a certain thing, not to call out bullshit, not to criticize certain candidates, all that kind of
*  stuff? Yes, definitely. Of course. I myself am looser on the self-centership than other people.
*  That's only because I've gotten this far just shooting from the hip or whatever. Occasionally,
*  you'll come to a rash judgment. You'll speak too soon or complain about something too soon,
*  and you'll have to either apologize or reconsider or whatever else. But on a host of issues,
*  I have views that maybe not all of the left has. But I know that the core of my politics is a
*  politics against oppression, against exploitation, against all the things that we talked about.
*  If you know that's at the core of your politics, then you could maybe say,
*  you know what, I don't think the left should respond to the real racism that's still around
*  in the world by adopting an excessively racialized rhetoric, if that makes sense. I fundamentally
*  just am a universalist, and I believe that people, no matter where their backgrounds are and so on,
*  want the same things for themselves and for their families. I feel like a lot of the left,
*  or some of the left, not even the far left, more like the center left, has adopted a stance saying,
*  oh, we need to talk about white privilege or white Karens or white guys or old white guys doing this
*  or whatever else. To me, it's not only wrong in a moral sense, but it's counterproductive.
*  The last thing I want is a young white teenager who feels unrepresented politically and wants to be a
*  part of maybe even the left to feel like, oh, I should think more about my identity. No, the whole
*  point of anti-racist politics is that we want to live in a world where me and you can go around
*  the corner and get a beer, and we're not people of two different races getting a beer. We're just too
*  guys in America getting a beer. We're trying to have the type of society in which there's less
*  of that communal or racialized identity. That was the whole point of a whole generation of
*  anti-racist struggle, but now we seem to be reifying it in the media and in culture and
*  in politics. That's one issue where I've been banging the drum on this to the point that it's
*  annoying in certain parts of the left. I don't think there's maybe extreme opposition among
*  socialists, but it's more like a, why do you keep focusing on this? Let's focus on our real enemy,
*  the right, instead of criticizing this part of- No, I think it's really, I'm really glad you exist.
*  I'm really glad you're beating that drum because I think that's one of the reasons that the left has
*  not had a broader impact or is not heard by more people that could hear its message is because the
*  othering of, as if there's two teams, as if it's black and white, as opposed to having,
*  there's a common humanity and a common struggle amongst all of us. You also wrote the book that
*  we mentioned a few times, The Socialist Manifesto, The Case for Radical Politics in an Era of Extreme
*  Inequality. What's the framework? What are the key ideas of the book? A lot of it's a look at
*  socialism's past, present, and future, basically. A lot of it is historical. The opening chapter
*  uses a pasta sauce factory as a way to explain certain Marxist concepts, but also a theory of
*  change, like how we get from, let's say, pure capitalism to more regulated unionized and
*  social democratic systems, and then beyond social democracy into my vision of socialism.
*  That's the first little bit. It's a visionary look at the future of socialism. But then I try to
*  explain why some of the past social movements have gone wrong because I think we can't take for
*  granted. I think a lot of people want to live in a different or better society, but they look at
*  past examples and they're skeptical. I think there's good reason for skepticism. I try to
*  explain both the successes of certain systems like social democracy, but also what happened in
*  Russia, China, and more of a historical overview. Then the book ends in the present. It ends with
*  looking at the Bernie Sanders campaign, why it resonated, looking at some of the problems facing
*  the US, the UK, other advanced economies, and why I think the socialist message is still relevant.
*  For the longest time, I'm 33, I became a socialist as a teenager. For the longest time,
*  it seemed like I was just a member of the historical society, keeping alive an idea that
*  nobody was interested in anymore. Now, it's heartening to see more young people interested
*  in the idea. But we actually need to, I think, have a clearer sense of what we stand for and how
*  we make our movement, like it used to be, more rooted in the working class. If anyone
*  rewinds the tape, they go to when we first started talking about early socialism, when I was talking
*  about the German social democratic workers movement or all these different early parties.
*  I think at various points, I use the word worker and socialist movement interchangeably,
*  because in fact, at the time, it was pretty interchangeable. Socialism was the ideology
*  that had the appeal of the working class movement. You couldn't really separate between the two.
*  Now, obviously, socialism is like a fringe ideological concurrent among a very small
*  minority of the working class, which is fine. But we need to get to the point, I think, ideally,
*  where when people talk about unions and people protesting and social movements and socialism,
*  they all are one in the same as part of the same broad movement.
*  How did you become a socialist? What was the personal story or the idea took hold in your mind?
*  I'm the youngest of five. I was the only one in my family born in the United States. It was very
*  obvious to me that my life outcomes were very different than the life outcomes of my siblings.
*  My three older siblings didn't go to college after high school. Some of them got their degrees
*  much later on as adults. But I was from a pretty young age, had access to a great public school
*  district and was put on the track that you're going to go to college. This is the outcome.
*  Like I said, even my grandmother was illiterate. My mom didn't have a lot of educational
*  opportunities early in her life. She actually graduated from college the same year I did.
*  She later got her degrees and whatever else. But to me, it was obvious that so much of my
*  life outcomes weren't just a product of hard work or my family sacrifices because, of course,
*  I had the same family as my siblings, but the product of state institutions helping out,
*  evening things out, public school district, public library, all sorts of afterschool programs. All
*  that was the domain of the state and I really benefited from it. In essence, my core was a
*  social democratic belief. The state should redistribute a bit, build public institutions,
*  be an equalizer. Now how I became a Marxist and a socialist was much more random. I was
*  intellectually interested in it. Eventually, I merged the two together where I merged together my
*  more pragmatic and practical interest in day-to-day concerns and reforms and so on with my loftier
*  intellectual interests in Marxism into the politics I have today, which I try to balance
*  and do both. I think a lot of socialists in the organization that I joined as a teenager,
*  the Democratic Socialists of America and elsewhere, try to do the two, try to maintain some sort of
*  balance between here and our vision of the future. What do you think Marx would say
*  if he were to read your book, Socialist Manifest, and do a review?
*  I think Marx would say that my vision of a socialism after capitalism
*  maintains key elements of what he would, the commodity form. A lot of what Marx was concerned
*  about was what markets do to human relationships in a negative sense. His early writings, especially,
*  focus a lot on the alienation of labor. My vision of socialism, at least in the near term,
*  is about decommodifying certain sectors, reducing the market in certain sectors and reducing
*  alienation, but not eliminating it. It is about eliminating exploitation and oppression.
*  Knowing Marx and knowing how critical he was of certain other socialist strands and tendencies,
*  and he would often write very snarky notes and letters to people like Engels being like,
*  this guy, LaSalle, he's a total asshole. Then he would send a separate note to LaSalle saying,
*  hey, can I borrow five grand? This is actually true. He did the both, I think, the same month.
*  He would be really good at Twitter is what you say.
*  He would be the best at Twitter. Also, he was a journalist before with his work for the New
*  York Tribune. He was very clever, very snarky. He would be awesome at Twitter. I think him and Elon
*  would have good back and forths. I think it would be critical in some parts, but I think that
*  the strangest part for him would be reading the historical sections and seeing the way in which
*  his ideas, which was fundamentally ideas about human emancipation,
*  were used for evil, for hardship in ways that did the opposite of emancipated, but in some cases,
*  enslaved people. I think he would definitely not want to be associated with them.
*  He probably would rather be associated with me than them, but even then only begrudgingly.
*  Okay.
*  What advice would you give to young folks in high school, in college, how to have a career they can
*  be proud of or how to change the world? I think be intellectually curious. Read outside your
*  current beliefs and understand or read authors on their own terms. The worst thing in the world to
*  do is to read anything, especially work of fiction, but anything and try to deduce the authors
*  backgrounds or politics, whatever else. Read it on its own terms first. Then you could reread it
*  and do other examinations or whatever else. Also, read a lot of history. I started off reading
*  books like Eric Hoppe's Bombs, four books on history going from the 1700s all the way to 1994.
*  The last book is Age of Extremes. But I think understanding history gives you a bird's eye view
*  of everything, sociology, economics, everything. These big sweeping historical books are really
*  useful to know. Everybody should know basically what your, or at least what decade, serfdom was
*  abolished, what decade, slavery was abolished, what century Magna Carta was, when the Roman Empire
*  fell, even though that's kind of debated when the Roman Empire fell. All these, I think, being a
*  person with a general knowledge and general sense of history and whatever else just makes you more
*  eclectic and interesting. It's way better than just, especially a lot of my Indian friends,
*  or not just Indians, but the hyper focus on you got to specialize and you got to focus on
*  math or engineering, whatever you want to do. You just know your field really well, but nothing else.
*  I think there's something really to whether you're getting in school or you're just going
*  to do it by yourself, giving yourself kind of a liberal arts education.
*  I think there's a lot of power to sort of having the facts of history in terms of in time when
*  stuff happened, but also really powerful is knowing spatially, like the geography,
*  there were a point on a map and there's interesting dynamics that happened throughout history of all
*  the different nations in Europe, of all the different military conflicts and the expansions
*  and the wars and the empires and all that kind of stuff. It really puts into context how
*  human history has led to the place we are today because all the different geopolitical conflicts
*  we have today, even the politics of the day is grounded in history. Maybe less so for the United
*  States because it has a very young history, but that history, even from the United States,
*  is still there from the Civil War. Understanding that gives you context to when you tweet random
*  stuff about this or that person or politician and so on. Yeah, very true. Very true. One of the
*  regrets I have currently is I have perhaps been too focused on the 20th century in terms of
*  history, the present and the 20th century. A lot of people write to me that there's a lot of lessons
*  to be learned in ancient history as well. So not just even American history, but just looking farther
*  and farther and farther back. Yeah, that feels like it's another time, it's another place,
*  it totally has no lessons, but then you remind yourself that it's the same human beings, right?
*  Yeah, and also we're no smarter than them. We just have more crude knowledge in part because of them.
*  But they were just as clever as us. What do you think is the meaning of this whole experiment
*  we have going on on Earth? Now, what's the meaning of life? Well, I think there's no broad meaning
*  of life. It was an accident, but we ourselves need to make our own meaning. And for me,
*  a lot of it is about posterity, trying to do something worthwhile while on Earth, but also
*  leaving something behind. It could just be relationships with friends or family in the
*  future, maybe having a family and then leaving behind that legacy, little bits of yourself,
*  but also them being able to learn the same way I have little bits of my parents and my grandparents
*  in me. And then also, I think in a social sense, zooming out from just the individual and the
*  family, leaving the world behind a little better. I would love to be a part of a movement that created
*  a world with a little bit less suffering, a little bit less oppression or exploitation or
*  whatever else. That's really why I'm a socialist. It's not about snapping your fingers and curing
*  the world of everything in one go, but it is about, I think, giving our lives some sort of
*  meaning and purpose. And you don't have to be a socialist to do that. You could just do it at the
*  you know, at the micro level in your own day-to-day interactions, but I just feel like life
*  has no good meaning without thinking of posterity in the future.
*  And I have to say thank you for doing so. Thank you for caring about the struggle of the people
*  in the world through ideas that are bold and I think challenging for a lot of people. In a time
*  when socialism is something that can be attacked aggressively by large numbers of people,
*  still persevering and still exploring those ideas and seeing what of those ideas can make
*  for a better world. That's beautiful to see. Baska, thank you so much for talking today. Thank you
*  for all the work you do. I can't wait to see what you do next. I appreciate it. And yeah,
*  thanks for keeping an open mind with these conversations and to your audience too. You
*  know, it's nice to have a space where, you know, people can debate and think at length and don't
*  have to worry about soundbite culture. Thank you, brother. Thank you for listening to this
*  conversation with Baska and Kara. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors
*  in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx. Democracy is the road
*  to socialism. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
