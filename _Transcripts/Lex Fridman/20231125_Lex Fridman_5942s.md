# Michael Malice: Thanksgiving Pirate Special | Lex Fridman Podcast #402
**Lex Fridman:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yHr9DPnSzk)
*  What's your opinion on my bird here, Mr. Parrot?
*  It's a macaw. Scarlet macaw.
*  What?
*  It is a scarlet macaw.
*  Oh, you know birds?
*  Yeah. And that's actually not life-sized.
*  Are you saying he's not real?
*  I'm saying it's not to scale.
*  Okay. But he's real.
*  Are we doing that Monty Python sketch?
*  Everything is a Monty Python sketch.
*  I don't think Monty Python's funny.
*  You don't.
*  That explains so much.
*  Does it? What does it explain?
*  What do you think is funny?
*  You not answering that question is pretty funny.
*  What do you think is funny? Having a Menta Shrimp?
*  No.
*  Do you think Big Lebowski is funny?
*  Oh, God, no.
*  This is getting worse and worse.
*  The following is a conversation with Michael Malus, anarchist and author of Dear Reader,
*  The New Right, the Anarchist Handbook, The White Pill, and he is the host of the podcast,
*  You're Welcome.
*  This is a Thanksgiving special of the pirate and ocean-going variety.
*  So once again, let me say thank you for listening today and for being part of this wild journey with
*  me. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the
*  description. And now, dear friends, here's Michael Malus.
*  The box?
*  Yeah.
*  The mystery box.
*  I'm wondering what's in it.
*  There's something in that box of exquisite beauty, both literally and in what it symbolizes and
*  why it is here.
*  Given the kind of human being you are, I'm terrified at what you find beautiful.
*  That's a good point. You kind of hit me with a curveball.
*  For me, the most beautiful wildlife are what I call God's mistakes.
*  Because my friend came up with that term where she's like,
*  God made these disgusting animals just throw in the bottom of the ocean.
*  He's like, no one's ever going to see this.
*  Yeah, you commented on Twitter about some creature, like a rainbow type creature.
*  The peacock mantis shrimp.
*  Yeah, it's beautiful.
*  It's horrific though. It has, I think, eight legs, six arms, two punching claws or
*  spearing claws, depending on the genus, two eyes, two antennae, two ear flaps.
*  I don't know what they do.
*  Its punch can be as strong as a bullet.
*  The other type with the spears, divers call them thumb splitters.
*  Because if you stick your finger near it, it'll cut your thumb down to the bone.
*  I had one as a pet all night. I would hear banging on the PVC pipe.
*  I've got to tell you, they have the best eyesight of any animal because they see in
*  seven different ways. When you make eye contact with this thing, it's just absolutely terrifying.
*  You can eat them as sushi. They call them sea centipedes.
*  They're colorful and beautiful.
*  That species is, yeah.
*  What was it like having one as a pet? Why did you do it?
*  Well, when you have a species that's that unique and that much of an outlier, growing up reading
*  these books, watching these shows, I found this stuff so much more fascinating than space,
*  which is dead. To be able to have this specimen in your house and just observe its behavior
*  is just an amazing thing.
*  Why did you get rid of it?
*  I didn't have, I guess, the right minerals in the mix.
*  It died.
*  It had a problem molting once. Yeah, it couldn't molt correctly.
*  You miss it? Think about it still?
*  I do think about it, to be honest. I still have a pair of punching appendages from when it molted.
*  What pet animal in your life do you miss the most that has been in your life that you think about?
*  I've never had cats or dogs growing up or anything like that, which, oh God.
*  My problem is- Here we go.
*  If I like something, I will go down a rabbit hole.
*  I know if I got one tattoo, I already know my first five are going to be.
*  I can't do it because then once I get those five, it's going to be 100,
*  and I'm already too old to be the tattoo guy.
*  What would be the first tattoo? My face?
*  Would it go on your ass cheeks or where would you put them?
*  If it was my face.
*  If I got your face, it would definitely be on my arm right here.
*  If you had multiple faces, would you put like-
*  I think delts, right? Shoulders, different faces and different shoulders.
*  And then when you flex? Like once in symmetry.
*  Yeah, yeah. Would you get a dictator? If you had to get a dictator, who would you get?
*  I'd be Kim Jong-il, right? Because I wrote the book on him.
*  Oh, it's like the plugging your book in a tattoo.
*  I don't think plugging. It's just like I have a personal connection to the stuff.
*  Good opener to this conversation. But you would be asking, why him?
*  And then you'd be like, well, I wrote a book about it.
*  I'd be like, okay. Okay. Here's what-
*  Let me check it out.
*  That would be a bad- No, that's not what happens.
*  Okay. Here's the thing.
*  What happens? When you write a book about North-
*  Hey, nice to meet you. What is it you do? I'm an author. What kind of books do you write?
*  Well, my last book was on North Korea. 90% of the time, 90, they will then start telling me
*  everything they know about North Korea. And it's like, I don't need- This isn't a quiz.
*  And it's a very poorly understood country. I don't expect you to know anything.
*  You're not on the spot. And half of what you're saying is not accurate either. It's fine.
*  How often do they bring up Dennis Rodman? 100%.
*  100% of the time. Oh, so you don't- Do you know Dennis Rodman?
*  Yeah. But I don't understand what- I guess people
*  feel the need to like, all right, now we're talking about this subject. I just got to drop whatever
*  I can talk about. It's usually a small amount. And there's this thing in the culture, which I hate,
*  that everyone have to have an opinion on everything. And it's like, it's okay to be like,
*  yeah, I don't know anything about that. Tell me more. There's lots of things I don't know
*  anything about. What's your opinion on my bird here, Mr. Parrot?
*  It's a macaw. Scarlet macaw. What?
*  It is a scarlet macaw. Oh, you know birds?
*  Yeah. And that's actually not life-sized. Are you saying he's not real?
*  I'm saying it's not to scale. Okay. But he's real.
*  Are we doing that Monty Python sketch? Everything is a Monty Python sketch.
*  I don't think Monty Python's funny. You don't?
*  At all. That explains so much.
*  Does it? What does it explain? What do you think is funny?
*  You're not answering that question. It's pretty funny.
*  Yeah. What do you think is funny? Having a Metsa shrimp?
*  No. Do you think Big Lebowski is funny?
*  Oh God, no. Although- This is getting worse and worse.
*  To be fair, I only tried to watch Big Lebowski after it's been part of the culture for many years,
*  to the point where every single line has been quoted incessantly by the most annoying frat bros
*  ever. So I kind of have been poisoned to be able to appreciate it. So maybe if I'd seen it when
*  it came out, before it became a thing, I would have enjoyed it. I couldn't get through it.
*  I couldn't get through 20 minutes. Is that how you feel about Schindler's List?
*  Well- It's so much easier for me to stare at you when you have sunglasses on.
*  I didn't think you'd be the one making Holocaust jokes today. And yet here we are.
*  And cut scene. I actually have no trouble making eye contact with you when you're wearing shades.
*  Yes, because you're a robot. Two copies of myself.
*  Yeah. Oh, you're seeing yourself in them?
*  Mm-hmm. Cool.
*  I'm having a conversation with myself. It's not your fault, Lex.
*  They made you like this. You were just a good little robot in St. Petersburg.
*  I could see Mr. Parrot a little bit too.
*  What do you find funny? Come on. This is an interesting subject.
*  Well, I find Mighty Python. I find absurdity funny.
*  Yes, I find absurdity funny. I think that's the thing. When people come at me,
*  and maybe this is an Eastern European thing, when they're like, how can you find this very dark
*  subject funny? It's like, well, the humor, first of all, the humor is that you're making fun of
*  something that's dark. So already it's absurd. It's completely inappropriate. Second, just
*  psychologically, Joan Rivers said that Winston Churchill said, I don't know if it's true,
*  that when you make people laugh, you're giving them a little vacation.
*  And I was just thinking about this the other day, how when I die, if I want my funeral to be a
*  roast, it doesn't help me that everyone's sad. If I brought people happiness or joy in life, whatever,
*  I want to keep doing that in death. Your sadness doesn't help me. I know you can't help it,
*  but tell stories of how it made you laugh. Make fun of me. Make me the punching bag,
*  even literally take me out of that coffin and beat the crap out of me. Make me a pi√±ata. I don't care.
*  I don't understand. Well, I do understand, but it's sad for me when people are like,
*  this isn't funny. That isn't funny. The way I look at humor is the way it's like a chef.
*  It's pretty easy to make bacon taste good, but some of these really obscure ingredients,
*  to make it palatable, that takes skill. So if you're dealing with a subject that is very
*  emotional or intense and you can make people laugh, then that takes skill and that's the relief for them.
*  It's all about timing.
*  What's the difference? You want to hear one of my jokes?
*  Is it a pirate joke? Because that's the only kind I accept today. But go ahead,
*  it doesn't have to be a pirate joke this one time.
*  Do you know who Leah Thomas is?
*  Yeah.
*  What's there between Leah Thomas and Hitler?
*  What?
*  Leah Thomas knows how to finish a race.
*  Very nice. Very nice.
*  Did I just get the gold medal?
*  Good job. Why does it take pirates forever to get through the alphabet?
*  Why?
*  Because they spent years at sea.
*  Oh, I thought it was going to be an arrr-err-err joke.
*  Nope.
*  That's a good one. I like that.
*  When I was in North Korea, one...
*  Oh, Dennis Rodman. It's a callback.
*  By the way, the thing that is very heartbreaking about the North Korean situation is that they
*  have a great sense of humor. It would be a lot easier if these were robots or drones.
*  They have big personalities, big sense of humor. And that made it much harder to leave
*  and interact with these people because it's I mean there's nothing more human and universal than
*  laughter and laughter is free. You're saying there's humor even amongst the people that have
*  most of their freedoms taken away? Especially I mean again we're from you know the Soviet Union
*  like there's a Russian humor is a thing because there's nothing you can this if you can't have
*  food or nice things at least you can have joy and make each other laugh. I think about it all the
*  time and I think about my guide all the time it's been what uh 2012 so it's been 11 years since I've
*  been there and she's still there and everyone I've seen is still there. They just recently
*  electrified the border so you can't even even the few people who are escaping can't do it anymore.
*  But that's interesting that they still have a sense of humor. I attribute the Soviet Union
*  for having that because of the like really deep education system. Like you got to read a lot of
*  literature. Okay. And because of that you get to kind of learn about the the cruelty the injustices
*  the absurdity of the world. Right. As long as the writing is not about the current regime.
*  Yeah but I think like if you look at like African Americans, Jewish Americans, gay Americans they
*  are all disproportionate in terms of contributing to comedy. It's not because these groups have some
*  kind of you know magic to them. It's that when you are on the outside looking in a you're going to
*  have different perspective and the people who are in the middle of the bell curve but also when you
*  don't have anything to lose at the very least you can make each other laugh and find happiness that
*  way. So you know that is something that I think is an important thing to recognize. So what do
*  you find funny? What makes you giggle like in the most joyful ways? The suffering of others? I mean
*  there are YouTube videos of like fat people falling down and they're really funny. There's
*  two kinds of people in this world. Those that laugh at those videos and those that don't.
*  No and those that are in them. My friend Jesse just told me a great Norm Macdonald joke and this
*  is a good litmus test joke because he says a certain group of people lose their minds and a
*  certain group of people just stare at you and he goes this kind of so I'll tell you the joke. This
*  is Norm Macdonald. Guy walks into a bar and he sees someone at the bar who has a big pumpkin
*  for a head and the guy's like dude what happened to you? He goes ugh you never believe this.
*  I got one of those genie lamps and this genie he's like what happened? He goes well the first wish
*  I wished for 100 million dollars. He's like yeah did you get it? He goes yeah. He goes did my bank
*  count. Feels fine. He goes all right. Well the second wish I wished to have sex with as many
*  beautiful women I want. He goes did that happen? He goes yeah it was amazing. He goes then what?
*  Well I wish for a giant pumpkin head.
*  So there's a certain mindset that will just be staring at the screen
*  and that is I mean there's so many levels why that's funny at least to me and I just love that
*  kind of thing. Well Norm Macdonald is like just I watch his videos all the time. He's a guy that
*  definitely makes me giggle and he's one of the people that makes me giggle for reasons I don't
*  quite understand. Did you ever see him with Carrot Top on Conan O'Brien? No. Of making fun of
*  Carrot Top? No. This is probably the best talk show clip of all time. He's on with Courtney
*  Thorne-Smith. She was on Melrose Place and Conan O'Brien's the host and Courtney's talking about
*  how she's going to be an upcoming movie with Carrot Top and Conan is like oh what's it going
*  to be called and she's like doesn't have a title yet and Norm goes oh I know what should be called
*  Box Office Poisoned and they're all laughing and she's like no no no like the working title is
*  Chairman of the Board and Conan goes do something with that smart ass and Norm goes yeah board is
*  spelled B-O-R-E-D and they all just completely lost it. There's something about him with words
*  spoken out of his mouth with the way he like turns his head and looks at the camera. I think he is
*  one of those rare comedians who you really feel like he's talking to you directly. Yeah. He feels
*  like he's winking at you in the audience and he's like can you believe I'm doing this? It's
*  like he almost he feels like he's I don't want to say imposter but like he's more a member of the
*  audience than he is a member of the people on the stage. Yeah it feels like he's on our side. Yes.
*  Yeah. Whatever the hell our means. You know Roseanne got him his first job. Roseanne. You and her have
*  been hanging out. I got it. Oh my god. Talk about Thanksgiving. When you are talking to Roseanne Barr
*  and making eye contact with this person it is I can't even describe it. It's just like holy crap
*  Roseanne Barr is talking to me. She is I've said this to her face pathologically funny.
*  Like it does not turn off and you're sitting there and you're like holy crap and when you make her
*  laugh which is that laugh that's in the theme song of her show you feel like okay I did a mitzvah. I
*  did something good and right in the world that I made Roseanne Barr laugh and it's also really
*  funny because and she's gonna hate this because I tell her she's adorable she isn't like that
*  she's little. You think of Roseanne Barr as this like force of nature like a tsunami. She's like
*  five three I'd say like maybe 130 like and she's and she puts on the sunglasses you think this
*  little old Jewish lady you'd never know this is one of the most epic performers of all time. She
*  lives near here now so it's just so much fun talking to her. There's an old satirical magazine
*  in the I think like early 2000s called Hieb written by Jews and she dressed up as Hitler
*  for one of the photo shoots and she was baking little men in the oven. I got I found on eBay I
*  want her to sign it to Michael it should have been you but she signed it to Michael you're one smart
*  cookie and now it hangs love mom Roseanne Barr and I call her mom and it hangs over my desk
*  because have her like good domestic goddess energy flowing at me.
*  What? What do you find what else so Norm MacDonald? Norm MacDonald. My favorite comedian
*  is. We agree on something. My favorite comedian of all time is Neil Hamburger. So Neil Hamburger
*  I don't know if I'm ruining the bit he's a character performed by this guy named Greg
*  Turkington. So he comes out in a tuxedo big eyeglasses holding three glasses of water
*  coughing into the mic and I remember I saw him once in LA and the girl ahead of me at the table
*  ahead of me was with her boyfriend this basic chick pumpkin spice. She turns to him she goes
*  what is this and I remember the first time he was on Jimmy Kimmel and he tells one of his jokes
*  and he was like why does ET like Reese's Pieces so much? Well that's what sperm tastes like in
*  his home planet and like no one laughs and he goes oh come on guys I have cancer
*  and it just cuts to this marine in the audience with his arms crossed.
*  So if you know what he's doing it's just absolutely amazing he opened for Tenacious D once in
*  somewhere I think in Ireland or the UK one of those and they're booing him because his
*  jokes are often not funny he's like hey where did my whore ex-wife run off to with that dentist
*  she's shacking up with? I don't know but when I see her in court next month Alaska. So they're
*  booing and he goes all right do you guys want me to bring out Tenacious D? They're like yeah do you
*  want to see your heroes of mine Tenacious D? Yeah come on let me hear it do you want to see Tenacious
*  D? Yeah he goes all right if I tell this next joke and you don't boo me I'll bring out Tenacious
*  D and it's like I'm trying to think of one that's not too... Self-censorship is never good. Okay he
*  goes can we agree that George Bush is the worst president America's ever had and from claps he
*  goes which makes it all the stranger that his son George W Bush was in fact the best. I take it back
*  in the self-censorship. So two people laugh and he goes oh that's amazing I guess I'll do an encore
*  and he did 10 more minutes it was just just like I love him so much. It's interesting they open for
*  Tenacious D. Jack Black that's a comedic genius of a different kind. Oh yeah and he was in one of my
*  favorite movies Jesus' Son it's this little indie movie he did a great turn of that he's really
*  underrated as an actor he's got a lot of range like I know they kind of kind of get types cast
*  as this kind of one specific type but he's really really talented. But also just like the pure joy.
*  Yes he's clearly having fun. Okay it is Thanksgiving so in a tradition following tradition what are
*  you thankful for Michael? I got a... Do you have a list too? No not really. Really? It's up in here.
*  Oh I mean but you have several things you're thankful for. Yes. Okay. Yes. One of the things I'm...
*  My list comes from the heart I don't have to write anything down. Well I don't have written
*  down. Okay. One of the things that I'm most thankful for this is a common answer but I
*  can back it up is my family because my nephew Lucas is now six years old and he when kids have
*  a sense of humor it's like just miraculous. So he stole my sister's phone his mom figured out
*  that grandma is listed as mom in the phone and he calls her up and he's like Michael's in the
*  hospital he's really sick he didn't want to tell you and she's freaking out he goes prank. So I
*  took him Dinesh D'Souza just released a movie called Police State which is actually really good
*  highly recommended I was surprised how much I liked it there because he wasn't going Republicans
*  good Democrats bad it was just about authoritarianism and he had a movie premiere Mar-a-Lago so I'm like
*  I gotta bring Lucas to Mar-a-Lago so Lucas is I'm like we're going to the president's house he's
*  like oh the white house and I'm like no no like a former president goes oh Abe Lincoln and I'm like
*  okay kid logic like he's giving logical answers this is kind of like AI you have to you have to
*  program it's using logic correctly. You should have told him as a president that's second to only Abe
*  Lincoln in terms of accomplishments. He went up to all the women in their ball gowns you know
*  evening gowns and he goes you're so beautiful were you born as a girl so when you have this
*  six-year-old asking you this it was really really fun so that is a great joy to have a nephew and
*  I have another one Zach who's coming up in age and he's starting to talk now that is really really fun
*  getting to watch them you know find out about the world for the first time and also training them
*  like that he he wants he loves being funny and having fun you're his audience in a sense yeah
*  but because you giggle and I can we're prank bros it gives me a high five my family and this is
*  when you talk about what I find funny this is things that actually enrage me when people and
*  this is such a wasp thing don't just go with the joke or they're like I don't get it or they don't
*  understand to just go with it I was in the car with my sister when she was like 10 12 whatever
*  she's much younger than me she's like 12 years younger and there's this species of squid by the
*  way which is asymmetric one of its eyes is very much bigger than the other because it swims
*  horizontally and so one's looking up one's looking down with this more light shout out if you want to
*  learn more about squids go to octo nation.com octo nation shout out shout out to Warren there's a lot
*  of fascinating stuff octo nation on instagram yes um I was in the car with my sister she's like 10
*  or 20 me as a pirate I don't I'm sorry for the rude interruptions I appreciate that I count
*  especially yeah it's a great yeah these jokes and thoughts are coming to me at a like a 10 second
*  delay so I apologize anyway you were telling about the asymmetrical all right um so I tell
*  sometimes you need help no the age is getting too
*  I was uh your skin is showing it it's getting dark I told my sister I go when you were born um one of
*  your eyes was bigger than the other and you had to have surgery to fix it so she turned she's like
*  mom and my mom goes honey the important thing is that you're beautiful now that's all it's like
*  what's the big deal it was just a little surgery and my sister's like all right calls grandma
*  and grandma goes uh she goes Michael said that I was born one of the eyes she goes why is he telling
*  you this now it's not a big deal you were so the fact that everyone went with this oh was I was so
*  impressed I was like this is a quality family in this very specific regard yeah does your family
*  have a sense of humor uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know Soviet culture there's like a dark
*  sense of humor very much there's weight there's uh wordplay wordplay uh yeah yeah especially the
*  Russian language allows for some like yes uh hilarity to it there's also culture of like
*  poetry and like uh my dad my mom too but they they remember a lot of lines from books and poems
*  so there's just you can do a lot of fascinating references that add to the humor and the richness
*  of the I feel like that's a very Russian thing like at a party or maybe at a bar or something
*  I don't know where you'd meet people these are such great I saw I meant in Russia I meant these
*  would be such good icebreakers right you go up to someone goes hey did you hear this one
*  no no anecdote and you just tell him some little story did you say icebreakers because it's cold
*  in Russia I'm here all night that's literally so I feel like that's the thing
*  yeah and that's not a thing in America uh you mean like witty banter no meaning you go up to
*  stranger and like that's your icebreaker you tell him this little little joke and since everyone
*  kind of has the same sensibilities right away you guys are chatting I don't think that's a thing here
*  yeah thing here it's more small talk which drives me crazy so what else are you thankful for
*  well what about what's something you're thankful for well you went with family I'm definitely
*  thankful for family okay yeah how if I may ask how do they react to you like you're sitting down
*  with Elon you're sitting out in Yahoo you're sitting out with all these like big with Kanye
*  all these big names are they expressing that they're proud of you or is it more like why haven't
*  you talked to this person yeah more Michael Malice please the people's choice yeah yeah they're
*  very proud they've been very they're very I mean but they get argumentative and we just
*  they're just like a regular human being with whom I'm close and we just argue about stuff they're
*  not maybe not enough showed the being proud of but that that part is just the nature of our
*  relationship it's also Soviet parents yeah I don't talk to my dad that's one of the reasons
*  because there's never ever any good job and at a certain point it's like why am I trying to
*  search for approval from someone I'm never getting get it for and from who it wouldn't
*  mean anything at this point anyway well that's interesting I mean there's a journey like that
*  for a lot of people with their father or with their mother like they're always trying to find
*  approval right and that's life for a lot of people yeah that's that's a really big part of
*  the human condition is that relationship you have with your father with your mother I don't know
*  it's a beautiful thing so it's whether it's been a rough childhood or a beautiful one all of it
*  that's who you are like that the relationship especially early on in your life with your father
*  with your mother is like extremely formative yeah so my dad taught me a lot of things at a young
*  age that I'm very very grateful for he was he's extremely intelligent very flawed and that's fine
*  we all are except for me and it's the kind of things that when you learn things that are right
*  eight and this is one of the things I like about being older is that when I'm friends much older
*  much older when I'm much much older when I have friends who are younger it's very easy for me to
*  keep them from making the mistakes I did so at least this is something I'm getting out of it is
*  that okay I can't fix these mistakes but it just takes me 30 seconds and I can pull you back from
*  making the mistake so he taught me a lot as a kid he really encouraged me very much to he's a very
*  good sense of humor and also very bad in some ways dad jokes but also really funny jokes but also
*  this love of learning uh that I got that from him and I mean I I have got literally right now
*  98 books on my shelf to read it's just a life that makes me I remember I had a friend and she
*  ran into someone she went to high school with and he stopped you on the train and he's like yo you're
*  not in college you need to read books anymore and I was just like horrified to hear this yeah yeah
*  boy don't I know it I mean I mean I you do laugh but like I when you got there's a lot of things
*  I don't understand when you got heat for like I want to read the western classics to me that
*  that might have been like the internet at its absolute worst I think I think there's just a
*  cynical perspective you can take that there this is such a simple celebration of a thing that there
*  must be something behind it I think the internet for good and bad is just skeptical like what's
*  behind this my hero Albert Camus and if there's one thing I would want to fight it's cynicism
*  yeah because it's such a giving up it's such everything sucks this sucks that's like this
*  sucks most things suck most standard comedians suck most movies suck all podcasts suck um but
*  it doesn't matter especially yours especially mine it's it's unwatchable you're welcome we can't even
*  spell it correctly um but the stuff that's good is what matters there who cares if 90% of movies
*  are terrible like they're the ones that change your life the books the people the the comedians
*  the shows the music and even the terrible things have good moments beautiful moments some not all
*  your podcast being an example of not all I've literally just I keep listening for something
*  good something good in all fairness none of my guests have anything to offer
*  it's not on me I try yeah yeah well I wish you'd talk a little less in your podcast
*  it's a little excessive I only listen for the underwear commercials she's thundera.com
*  I think you did this um I haven't seen you do in a while but this kind of commentary on a debate
*  or um I think it was with rand like an iron ran debate oh yeah malice at the movies I watched the
*  video and I broke it down yeah great I wish you did that more I've I haven't done live streaming
*  in a long time I it was something I was doing a lot in New York especially during COVID I feel that
*  um I don't know I'm having I got so many projects on the plate
*  uh I'm oh this is something else I'm thankful for this is something I'm very very thankful
*  for and I'm gonna announce it here coming out of the closet finally go ahead
*  who's the lucky guy
*  you're the one in drag
*  uh he makes me he makes me call him sex freedman
*  uh you like it so I didn't say it didn't even imply that when I in as you probably know
*  as you know but as many people watching this also know uh Harvey picar who had the comic book series
*  American Splendor was the subject of movie American Splendor he wrote a graphic novel
*  about me in 2006 called eco and hubris which goes for like 150 dollars on on eBay it's not worth it
*  just download it and I met Harvey because I wrote this screenplay about this band from the 80s
*  called rubber rodeo it's a real band and the keyboardist Gary Lieb who passed away rest in
*  peace Gary introduced me to Harvey because he did the animation for the movie and the script's been
*  in my desk for over 20 years and I realized uh thanks to my buddy Eric July who has some huge
*  success with his comics I could just produce this as a graphic novel so I've got an artist
*  we're getting it together so I'm gonna make it happen finally and it's some of the best writing
*  I've ever done I'm really proud of the story it's kind of ironic reading it now because
*  when you're a writer obviously you're different books you put different aspects of yourself into
*  them right and this story is very very dark because basically they did all the right things
*  and they went nowhere right what I realized was reading it now that all these fears I had
*  over 20 years ago about what if I'm not going to make it what if you know I'm doing all the
*  hard work and it's still not enough uh now it's been disproven because I can at least pay my rent
*  you feel you like you've made it as you said you could pay your rent I feel that to make it
*  is if you can pay your if you don't have to have a boss and you know how I really felt like I made
*  it this is going to sound like a joke and it's not uh this is being an immigrant I own as you know
*  Margaret Thatcher's bookcases yes so to me as an immigrant to have her bookcases in my house
*  I've made it you're right it's not a joke it's not there's nothing funny about it at all
*  it's time to get serious oh nice oh now I'm more nervous
*  and aroused uh so what else are you thankful for so we're both thankful for family
*  you I mean I'm the fact that I can still get it up what's that nothing go ahead I think
*  as an author to be able to write what you want and have enough an audience that it covers your
*  living that's as good as it gets as an author almost you don't need to be Stephen King or some
*  legend it's like you know there's lots of stand-ups who aren't like world famous but they they have
*  perfectly good living they do their gig they'll do what they love I feel very very blessed you
*  must be thankful for your career yeah yeah career wise but like uh I think the best part about it is
*  just meeting making friends with people I admire okay quite honestly just friends I you know the
*  people have gotten to know me I hide from the world sometimes I hit some low points especially
*  with this new all the new experiences and just the people that have been there for me and haven't
*  given up on me you know there's days I'm sure you had this also where like I literally don't
*  speak to someone the whole day and in certain times in my life it's really I remember very vividly
*  I was in DC in 97 I was an intern and that summer DC closes down in the weekends
*  and I remember those weekends when like I got off the phone with like the third person I knew there
*  was no possibility anyone was going to call and what that felt like and it was dark and it was bad
*  um so I remember that those feelings of loneliness um like a lot I still feel alone like that sometimes
*  you don't feel you don't feel alone um not anymore what's the what's the reason you think
*  I because there's like I have a lot of people who I care about who care about me uh but I I mean
*  the thing about moving to Austin is I forgot how lonely New York got because it was like one after
*  another I lost everybody and a certain and then you start losing the places you go to and then
*  it was just like holy crap I'm very isolated and here in Austin there's not as much to do obviously
*  as in New York but there's a lot of people here more people are coming all the time um so if I
*  ever want to like hang out with someone you know I've got a long list um and these are people who
*  I've known for a very long time people who know me quite well so I could be myself um my awful awful
*  awful awful awful self uh and that is something I don't take lightly now you moved to Texas it's
*  gonna secede yeah it's just a very uh do you know what happened with that no I forgot the guys in
*  the amen is probably for the best Monday on Monday a guy in the Texas legislature introduces a bill
*  to have it on the referendum to have a referendum for Texas to declare its independence
*  Tuesday I'm on Rogan me and him discuss it I give it national attention it was also really funny
*  because a lot of people like these people have been in Texas five minutes blah blah I go to the
*  Texas legislature meet with the guy have a nice conversation month or two later uh unanimous I
*  think he gets voted kicked out of Congress because he got an intern drunk and was inappropriate with
*  her and at least it was a girl in this case but yeah so it's like um that was my little Texas
*  independence moment oh it didn't go anywhere it did not go anywhere well but it's still part of
*  the uh platform the Texas Republican Party yeah it's fascinating that history is probably laden
*  with stories like this of failed revolutionaries we celebrate the heroes but then there's the
*  losers like myself yeah yeah and we're gonna mark that one as a failure and edit it out
*  and moving on so thankful yeah friendships right but by the way I want to say just to you
*  I'm thankful in this lonely moments for people who write books I've been listening to audiobooks a
*  lot reading a lot I really like audiobooks actually and just like I don't know I can just
*  name random person sir he plow he's a historian I'm reading on the wait I read him what he what he
*  I just see he written a book most recently about the Russia-Ukraine war he wrote another one that
*  I read didn't he write empires I think the fall the Soviet Union or something like that yeah yeah
*  yeah it was very very good he's great I used him as a resource for the white pill he's uh objective
*  while still having emotion and feeling to it like he has a bias that's fine but without uh
*  when a lot of times when you write a story that involves Putin people are really ideological yeah
*  they don't really like they don't write with a calmness and the clarity and the rigor of history
*  there's emotion in it like there's almost a virtue signaling yeah and he doesn't have that even though
*  he is Ukrainian and his very strong opinions on the matter anyway there's people like that and he's
*  does an incredible job researching a recent event like he says I was looking at everything that's
*  been written about the war in Ukraine and realizing you know the old Churchill line that
*  historians are the worst ones to write about current events except everybody else and so he's
*  a guy I'll might as well just write about this war and he doesn't accept from job summarizing
*  day by day the details of this this war anyway so I'm just grateful for a guy like that
*  so for me there's I'll name some historians I love Arthur Herman
*  Victor Sebastian is probably my favorite um David Petrusha P I E T R U S Z A when you are a historian
*  and I tried to do this to some degree in the white pill as much as I could
*  when you take data and you make it read like a novel this so you're learning about who we are as
*  people what had happened but also it's entertaining and readable that to me is like the acme of writing
*  and I have so much admiration what does acme mean top okay zenith zenith okay um this is what writers
*  do they just come up with these incredibly sophisticated words I'm impressed well you could
*  have just said the best of writing acme is also the company and like bugs bunny and wily coyotes
*  always acme student you know acme yeah yeah like acme bombs um when they are that good it's it's
*  just I just I just leaves me in awe that's just Ron Charnow is another one who he wrote the
*  Hamilton biography oh nice oh I have a lot of favorite historians about the whole
*  time period of world war two will have shire people that lived during it especially I really
*  like those accounts obviously Solzhenitsyn is he's not a historian but his accounts are sure
*  fascinating you actually how much do you talk about Solzhenitsyn never not much right why not
*  I feel like I wanted to I there's nothing I could add to him oh he did he's the Michael
*  Malice of the previous century no he's talented charismatic and skilled so he's not the Michael
*  Malice uh yeah I I did not um I feel like I didn't I didn't I didn't read Gulag Acapelago for the
*  white pill I didn't I didn't no I feel I got a lot of it from Anne Applebaum who's a very
*  controversial figure her history books on the Soviet Union I think are superb but she's also
*  accused of being very much like a neocon and being a warmonger in contemporary times oh I see and I
*  think comparisons between Putin and Stalin although there is a Venn diagram I I think are a bit much
*  because I think it's very hard to claim that you know if Putin conquered Ukraine that there would
*  be a genocide yeah I don't think I think that's a very hard argument to make in these tense times
*  even the comparisons of what's going on in Israel on either side comparisons to the Holocaust are
*  also troubling in this way yes and and I also don't like how that you know I got in trouble there was
*  some literal demon who works at the Atlantic and was a regular demon as opposed to figurative demon
*  I didn't know they employed demons they exclusively employed demons at the Atlantic and he was giving
*  me crap this a couple years ago on Twitter because I didn't think it's appropriate to
*  refer to George Soros as a Holocaust survivor and I'm like listen if you want to put him in the same
*  context as Anne Frank knock yourself out but I think that's so completely disingenuous and
*  and frankly repulsive to me morally to equivocate between figures like that and also to claim that
*  anyone who is a billionaire who is including Elon including Sheldon Adelson there's no shortage of
*  these people if you want to use your extreme wealth used to influence politics you have to be up for
*  criticism and and to protect people of Bill Gates to protecting these people from criticism
*  just on the base of their identity is deranged to me but also the Holocaust as a historical
*  event and the atrocities within it are just singular in history and so comparing them
*  What's the utility right you're just you're just basically trying to take this brand I'm using that
*  term you know in a very specific way and latch like when they say climate denial no one's denying
*  climate exists so you're just trying to go off of Holocaust denial I think it's shameless
*  and I think it's it's it's gross and it cheapens everything yeah there's deep important lessons
*  about the Holocaust yes to me the lessons are about how extreme it can get and how fast yeah
*  and how fast that's the one so you know people ask oh are humans basically good are they basically
*  evil I always say they're basically animals and I think people are most people are almost fundamentally
*  deranged and that there's basically this veneer of civilization and decency and when shit hits the
*  fan and we see this over and over they do things that would have been completely unthinkable even
*  to themselves five years ago most people are fundamentally deranged with a veneer of civility
*  there's a show called um I think I disagree with that what's the show called I'm having Alzheimer's
*  because of the advanced age the skin care there's a show there's a show called I think you should
*  leave it's a sketch you should leave okay sorry it's a sketch comedy show and he captures these
*  great has a hair princess he captures these great moments of just the like just a very thin veneer
*  of normalcy and just the craziness that's so frequently lurking underneath another great
*  example of this when this is dealing with people who are literally crazy have you ever seen the
*  show hoarders so every episode of hoarders every there's two usually two people in every episode
*  but every episode is the same plot line veneer of normalcy veneer of normalcy veneer of normalcy
*  slight expression of concern full-blown derangement and it always follows that exact pattern
*  yeah I don't know I think the deep ocean of the human mind is is good like there's a longing to be
*  good to others I have seen literally no evidence of this and I know everything's the deep ocean
*  with you people but like what do you mean you people pirates oh I don't see it you you that
*  mr parrot you were an anti-semite no that's not nice to say in front of such a large audience
*  you're embarrassing me mr parrot lex you have that mr parrot you you have he's he's a run-of-the-mill
*  troll and barely an intellectual that's not nice to say that's not true we talked about this you
*  have to see the good in people you have seen personally yeah how quickly and easily it is
*  for human beings to form outgroups yeah and to just read others just as I just did a minute
*  ago with the Atlantic completely other human race and that happens constantly and very easily
*  humans are tribal beings so that does not I don't see how that's compatible with this essential
*  desire to do good no I think it's like in 1984 for the two minutes of hate there is a part of
*  humans that wants to be tribal yeah and wants to direct get angry and hateful and then that hate
*  is easy to direct yes by especially people as you as an anarchist talk about other people in power
*  they can direct that anger but I think if you just look at recent human history the desire for
*  good the communal desire for good outweighs that I think like most of life on earth right now
*  people are being good to each other in the most fundamental sense relative to how nature usually
*  works I okay I think you're both wrong about people and about nature so nature is not inherently
*  violent in the sense like for example if anyone has an aquarium or if you look at wildlife
*  yeah you're going to have predator prey but these animals are going to be coexisting and they're
*  going to be ignoring each other for the most part right and as for humans you know being
*  essentially good I think humans are essentially not to each other you said I think they're
*  essentially civil and amiable but that's not really being good good I think is a thing that
*  gets illustrated when you're challenged when there's difficult situations yes I mean civility
*  is a good starting point and then when there's a big challenge that comes people step up on average
*  I completely agree with you that human beings are capable of such profound goodness that it kind of
*  makes you extremely emotional and I certainly think that that's true but I think that that's
*  I think that that's more unusual than is the norm I see beauty everywhere so do I but that doesn't
*  mean it's in every person not in every person but in most people I think I mean I wish there was a
*  really good way to measure this my general sense of the world is just there's so much incredible
*  both in terms of economics in terms of art in terms of just creation as a whole that's happened
*  over the past century that it feels like the good is outpowering the bad you just did the perfect
*  segue to the box what's in the box so is it your fragile ego that's what you stole my joke
*  you stole my joke that was the joke I made at you before we recorded you stole my joke no it did I
*  write you all your material you hack so as you know I have a lot of beautiful stuff in my house
*  because I think it's something very important everyone listening if you accomplish something
*  that is great some achievement what I like to do is buy myself something to remember that moment
*  because sometimes when it's hard you forget you've done great things in your life you've
*  had accomplishments it doesn't have to be some amazing factory it could just be like my first
*  job where I got a raise or you know what I anything so there's this amazing sculptor
*  named Jake Michael Singer a singer who's a sculptor and I saw a piece of him how's the singing voice
*  this is jokes I do hold on I could go somewhere with this okay how's the singing voice do you
*  want me to write your joke for you yeah what's the punch line hard there it is that's that's
*  what she said so I followed him on Instagram he followed me back and he's like if I made he says
*  what's the point of being an artist if the work I create isn't in the spaces of people I like and
*  admire he's a big fan of yours you've given him and our episodes together give him joy so he said
*  if I get a sculpt make Lex a sculpture will he put on the shelf behind him and what that reminded me
*  of is when I was a kid you read Batman comics and there's the Batcave and the Batcave has all this
*  cool stuff in it I didn't realize until much later that all of those things in the Batcave had an
*  origin story so the giant penny the dinosaur there was actually a story where that came from
*  so if you're a fan of a show you can spot oh this is when this appeared this is when that appeared
*  this is that appeared so he made you this sculpture he lives in Turkey and it's called chance murmur
*  and it is I haven't even seen it yet it is absolutely beautiful all right this so you
*  want to do a little unboxing yes okay uh axe or body spray
*  all right let's do it unbox
*  you know uh that Stephen Seagal movie where there's like a stripper that comes out of the box
*  under siege he's on a boat
*  you're not an action film guy no
*  one what does the pirate say when he turns 80 what I madey
*  I madey oh oh see that's how I know you don't like I just don't like pirates
*  what your mom does you play any musical instruments
*  no neither do you I've seen your guitar videos
*  okay here's a big piece of wood for you that's what it feels like just so you know oh wow yeah
*  oh my god this traveled across the world
*  so here's why his work speaks so much to me so first of all he's combining so many different
*  references it's Nike the goddess of victory right it's that it looks like an angel as well
*  the Italian futurists which is my favorite art movement from the early 20th century they tried
*  to capture motion in 2d or 3d form but they were able to capture motion in 3d or 4d form
*  well Jake thank you thank you thank you thank you for creating beautiful things
*  and thank you for caring about somebody like me and somebody like Michael who really feels the love
*  that's the other thing when you have something that matters to you in your house
*  and you're having a bad day you can look at it and remember you know what I mean that spirit of joy
*  and I actually have a list here okay I got a little rant ready you want to hear my rant yeah
*  let's go you're one of the things that drives me crazy is when people especially conservatives
*  think that all contemporary art is ugly or abstract or like literally garbage and there's
*  a lot of that but so much of the stuff out there in galleries is not only not crazy expensive but
*  they're trying to sell things for people in their house and these are young artists you know they're
*  trying to add beauty I have a list so if you don't believe me and you think all contemporary
*  art is garbage or terrible go to the website any of these places that I'm going to rattle off
*  look through them and you're telling me that that it's not about creating beauty and joy and things
*  in people's lives so I don't have any relationship with any of these people these are just some
*  galleries I follow on Instagram Utre gallery antler gallery giant robot 2 bainart I don't know how to
*  pronounce I'm sorry be a b-e-i-n-a-r-t spoke art gallery var gallery Milwaukee I was there the
*  pieces were not expensive at all what kind of art are we talking about everything mostly paintings
*  mostly paintings some sculptures too like this Corey Helford is my favorite one in LA night gallery
*  vertical gallery avant gallery hive gallery haven gallery and curio art gallery I'm telling you
*  uh it's not exorbitant this is not the kind of thing where you have to go to a museum and be
*  like this doesn't make sense to me you look at it right away you're like okay I know what this is
*  and it's beautiful it's awesome um and you're supporting someone who's young and creative
*  trying to do something and make the world a better place so I'm a big fan of the contemporary art
*  scene a lot of it is not great but even the stuff that's not great is very rarely disgusting or
*  gross it's just like okay I've seen this before something like that okay it's like there's like
*  a stand-up where like I'll pay money for the ticket and someone's like who's an opener it's
*  like I wouldn't pay to see him perform but he sure still made me laugh that person is still
*  more by far more good than bad so a lot of this art is and stuff I would own
*  but it's like okay I get it I like it well as the analogy goes I really like going to open mics
*  actually because like fun it sounds absurd to say but funny isn't the only thing that's beautiful
*  about stand-up comedy it's the act the act the it's it's going for it it's trying to be funny
*  it's taking the leap trying the joke and some of the best stuff is actually funny but the audience
*  is like three people two of whom are drunk and bored and you're still going for it and that's
*  like that's the human spirit right there Roseanne was telling me how Gilbert Godfrey'd go on it was
*  like three in the morning and it was like five her and like three other comics in the audience
*  and like they all were just dying like he was just killing them who's your favorite comedian
*  um Dave Smith who and cutscene favorite comedian first on Norman McDonald if you like put a gun
*  to my head and I had to answer really quickly that would be him okay I would also say uh Louis C.K.
*  oh wow yeah oh my god but that's almost like a vanilla answer at this moment in in history
*  because it's like uh Louis C.K.'s pretty radioactive he is well yeah he does it the tough topics sure
*  the best Mitch Hedberg the wit of a good one-liner it's great I guess that's what
*  Norman McDonald's genius is what about you there's I mean we're so fortunate to be here in
*  Austin because that comedy mothership you go there and like people are just killing it David
*  Lucas is amazing Ty Rivera Ty Rivera probably did the best set I've seen since I've been here
*  in Austin and I I watched him and I'm like this guy's even like even bitchier than I am so I
*  reached out to him um so he's just terrific David Lucas is another one of body of mine um you just
*  said it twice I think um I'm thinking Dave Landau excuse me yeah Dave Landau um Joe Mackie it's
*  true though it's true it's true it's true Dave Lucas you ever been to the comedy mothership
*  it's a great it's a great spot where is that is that in Austin Austin is that where Willie
*  Nelson's from I haven't really go ahead oh I heard a joke about that uh the other week what's the
*  oh tell the joke again what's the only thing worse than giving head to Willie Nelson
*  um what if he says I'm not Willie Nelson
*  what's that Mr Parrot I know he's not funny he's better he thinks he's better on Twitter
*  but that's not nice to say right in front of his face
*  just think how he feels the statues chance murmur is judging you chance it's called chance murmur
*  chance murmur god that's so beautiful that's gorgeous this is this another reason I hate
*  cynicism and I talk about this a lot even just on Etsy there are so many small not huge companies
*  like individual artisans who are creating great stuff um and just making it happen and it's really
*  sad for me where people can't see that or if they're like well how could I be excited about
*  a sculpture when blah blah blah the middle east and it's just like you can always look for an
*  excuse not to look for joy or you could look for an excuse to look for joy yeah Etsy is incredible
*  I feel the same way about only fans I can't even get that out of my mouth before laughing
*  at my own failed joke that's what she said oh
*  uh all right that might be one of the first that's what she said from Michael Malice yeah I'm gonna
*  count that I don't know what I'm gonna do with mine because I got my own mine's three feet tall
*  just like your box was much bigger yeah uh it was giving me an inferiority complex
*  I think I'm gonna invade Russia
*  that's a Napoleon reference
*  for those in the audience um I don't know if I'm gonna I think I'm gonna put in my bedrooms
*  that's the first thing I see when I wake up put in the bedroom yeah uh do we get through everything
*  we're thankful for no I've got lots of things I'm thankful for what else friends family
*  we said books I'm thankful for career I'm thankful for I am thankful for
*  and I know people are gonna lose their minds and I can hear them flipping out already I am thankful
*  for social media yeah I'm thankful for several reasons first it is a way for people to make
*  connections that they couldn't have made in years past that if you got some weird hobby you can find
*  that other person's weird hobby and you make that connection it's a great way to stay in touch
*  permanently for people otherwise you'd lose touch with you know whatever venue and it's also a great
*  way to expose uh corporate depravity when you have these organizations that are dishonest I think the
*  community notes thing on twitter is the greatest thing ever that's incredible I wish they would
*  pay them the attention of the Michael Malice account more often you shouldn't be encouraging
*  anyone to pay attention to my twitter account yeah it's a dumpster fire and I don't mean Bridget
*  I mean like literal Bridger Fetish Bridger by the way is amazing but your twitter account makes yes
*  not here I wish she did she's in Georgetown no I mean in this where we're sitting it's a joke Michael
*  is it yeah but I'm just really glad about uh it's another way for people who before would have felt
*  very alone I know it makes some people do feel alone but for other people makes them feel connected
*  uh there's been a lot of talk about antisemitism recently yeah what's what's your sense about this
*  is there is antisemitism like any other brand of hate there's a lot of hate out there no I don't
*  think it's like any other brand of hate because I don't think um racists or transphobes or homophobes
*  or homophobes or misogynists or xenophobes argue openly or even not so openly for the killing of
*  black Americans transgender people gay people women or immigrants and it's not only something
*  that's talked about it's something that has actually happened and not just the holocaust
*  but just centuries of pogroms right there's this great book that I read many years ago called the
*  satanization of the Jews camille paulia recommended it and I read it and they live in this this certain
*  specific kind of antisemitism and I'm again I'm not talking about people who are against Israel
*  something I'm talking specifically about jew hatred they have this moral calculus that Jews are the
*  only people who are capable of good or evil and Jews are exclusively capable of evil and for example
*  if you look at the george w bush white house you had w you had cheney condoleezza rice colin powell
*  donald rumsfeld a lot of these neocon advisors so if there's 10 people in a room and there's one
*  jewish person it's his fault and the rest are jew controlled so again they they only exist as a
*  puppet of jews in this kind of worldview and it's like that to me if there were no jews on earth
*  it is crazy to say that john bolton and liz cheney and lindsey graham wouldn't be pushing
*  for more war that makes no sense to me it's like you blame the jews when bad things happen
*  but when a jewish person does something good it doesn't really matter or just wait he's
*  gonna do something bad well yeah that's true human beings do good things and then they do bad things
*  sometimes but it only counts when that jewish person does the bad thing i wonder what's a way
*  to fight antisemitism and fight hate in general i think the only or the best way because i thought
*  a lot about this about how did gay americans go from being universally hated and despised to the
*  point that many people in the 80s went to their graves those who had aids without even telling
*  their parents because they were so scared to now time square is just covered in pride flags and i
*  think and this this also works for islamophobia and some of these other bigotry is what i call
*  the ambassador program because as soon as you know someone who is a member of a certain group
*  it is a lot harder to be bigoted against them because instead of this being this out group
*  that's somewhere out there it's like wait a minute i work with this guy yeah he's kind of a
*  jerk and maybe he sees things a little differently than me but this guy is not a horrible human being
*  so i think the only way to fight any form of bigotry is to be a good example of the counter
*  to these um whatever archetype or stereotype is in the culture
*  here.
*  Karl Marx wrote that religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a
*  heartless world and the soul of a soulless condition it is the opium of the people as
*  the famous phrase goes do you think he has a point no i hate that quote i absolutely hate it i despise
*  this sort of reddit internet atheist activism for the simple reason that i know many people
*  who in finding faith have become objectively better human beings yeah i mean they start
*  living consciously they take morality seriously they try we all fail to be moral good people
*  so this sneering that these midwits these marginally intelligent people have towards religious people
*  now lots of religious people use religion to rationalize their bad behavior or you know simple
*  or big ego so and so forth that exists that's true but to say that it never helps anyone
*  and it's universally the see Marx was talking about a period i mean i'll defend his quote when
*  his argument was you know the masses are being starved and oppressed but they're promised
*  don't worry you'll have riches in heaven so you should kind of like let yourself be pushed around
*  now and this is kind of this bs bargain that the people are being given so that was i think the
*  point he was making it's not it certainly doesn't apply nowadays i i've been close to the family in
*  the midwest they're good christian people i remember very specifically this guy shout out to him
*  Sean Sharad i went to college with him David Lucas and have you checked out the comedy
*  mothership great great club is in austin um and i you know i was 17 18 freshman year
*  and i was reading all this criticism of the bible and i was like look this is in there look at this
*  in there and he put a sand on my shoulder and he says michael there's nothing you're gonna tell me
*  that's going to make me lose my faith and that was a very uh self-aware and profound thing to say
*  as i've gotten older and i have lots of religious people there's no part of me that um thinks they're
*  wrong or they should be mocked it's like it also reminds me of when people sneer at uh addicts in
*  recovery they're like alcoholism is a disease it's a choice it's like wait a minute you don't know
*  what it's like to have your entire life ruined by drugs or alcohol and if you have to tell yourself
*  you know i have this disease and blah blah blah and that keeps you from drinking and now you're
*  a moral upstanding person who's reliable and takes responsibility for their actions
*  i i don't see the harm at all so i i think this kind of activist atheism is uh cheap i i don't
*  agree with it whatsoever and i i do not like that quote at all uh but otherwise big fan of marks
*  i mean it's i i think there's a fan of mine i forget who it was apologies he had this great
*  quote he goes the game and this is me talking he goes the games people play to to feel smarter
*  than others is depressing and annoying and i think this kind of fedora internet atheism is a good
*  example because here's the other thing if you've proven that someone else is stupid that doesn't
*  mean you're smart you could both be stupid so congrats you prove someone else is stupid who
*  cares yeah been sneering involved forms yes general is just not great that's one of the
*  things i block out people on social media instantly you're not going to sneer at me
*  in my space you can steer me all you want in your space but i'm not putting up with your crap i
*  don't know you my space great social network is that on uh six that six six street heywell.com
*  come
*  like a pavlov's dog that was the sound before you get to see
*  spend 10 minutes waiting for an image of a lady load one line at a time yeah
*  uh i recently talked to uh john meersheimer i don't know if you know him at all
*  uh so he has this idea about uh offensive realism it's a way to analyze the world international
*  relations and uh the basic idea and i'll run it by you and see what you think is that uh states
*  nations want to survive and they try to do so by maximizing power military power and he talks about
*  anarchy quite a bit in that one of these underlying assumptions of this way of viewing the world is
*  that states are an archic towards each other yes that's true and they operate under a lot
*  of uncertainty states cannot be sure that other states will not use military capabilities against
*  them right they want to survive and they want to use military power to uh control the uncertainty
*  to protect themselves so i i can i disagree in that regard and i i see on your bookshelf
*  i think the world is a lot closer to brave new world than it is to 1984 and i think it is if you
*  look at let's suppose china's influence in america right the influence is far more through soft power
*  than military power china doesn't threaten america through you know we're gonna kill you it's more
*  like their infiltration of universities tick tock things of that nature maybe this would have worked
*  before the pop culture era but i think one of the reasons we have this kind of american hegemony
*  isn't just a function of american military i think it's much more a function of american
*  popular culture when you're exporting ideas and culture it makes other people in other countries
*  feel closer to you and also feel forgot you as a friend and also to adopt your value it's a great
*  way to spread propaganda it seems to correlate though right it's interesting it's an interesting
*  idea what has more power the viral spread of ideas or the the power of the military it seems that the
*  united states is at the top of the world on both that's true and so it's hard to disentangle the
*  let's look at europe american culture is very popular in europe in many ways right like the
*  best music comes out of sweden swedish indie pop they're singing in english you know even though
*  so on and so forth none of this is a function maybe it's a function of post-world war two to
*  some extent but i don't think it's a function of american bases there i think it's a function of
*  we're exporting our music our tv shows and our movies yeah it's interesting if the battle ground
*  will be brave new world the battle of ideas i think it's clearly brave new right i i i it's
*  so much cheaper and again this is one the dark side of social media to use influence than it is
*  to use threats i don't think i think cove is a good example of this like so much of the pressure
*  yes there was authoritarianism but it was the fact that everyone bought into it rightly or wrongly
*  but the vast majority of the population was behind all of these things and that was through
*  persuasion not because and because people are begging for it to come back in many cases
*  so who's funding you which intelligence agency wassad wassad wassad this is how you do great
*  interviewing see he didn't even expect that okay what's that mr parrot is the parrot
*  you knew it but you didn't have any documentation did you i think mr parrot is threatened by the
*  better wings chance murmur he gets like that when he's turned on he's not threatened you can't wait
*  until he's all three of us are alone together it's going to be one hell of a party beaks and
*  feathers everywhere and metal
*  yeah this thing is beautiful it's ridiculous you have you have actually a lot of really cool
*  stuff at your place so fun what um what's the what's the cool thing that stands out to you
*  maybe a recent addition so i went to the dallas museum of art last year for my birthday
*  and there was a painting i liked and i googled it and i saw the auction for that exact painting
*  and it was like i think three grand which is not cheap but not something you think you think in a
*  museum i can never afford something like this right so when i was in um i went to houston with
*  some friends the side surf chef natalie who made the cake of you cake um terrified my mom dish it
*  did it yeah huh no it's not the cake that terrified my mom it's you michael malice cutting it off
*  cutting the face off and laughing maniacally well natalie's pregnant she's gonna have a daughter
*  named daisy so congrats to natalie but i was in the museum with them and they was a statue of
*  thoth who's the egyptian god whose head is an ibis it's a bird of the long beak and thoth is the
*  god of the moon god of knowledge and supposedly he invented writing so i thought you know what i've
*  always loved ancient egypt i know a lot about it and especially the mythology it would really
*  cool as an aspiring author to have an ancient egyptian thoth statue in my house well
*  it turned out that the egyptians also killed and mummified ibises and buried them with scribes
*  and a week after i went to the museum there was an auction for an ibis mummy and i have it now
*  in my house still in its bandages overlooking my desk and we all know it's going to come to life
*  and peck out my eyes yeah and write with my blood but that is one of the recent cool additions
*  another thing i have which is like in terms of holy crap i've made it i have an original patrick
*  nagel painting and if people don't know the name he's like the 80s artist he did the randoran cover
*  we never see him in nail salons i have a male which were very rare for him to do um so that's
*  two of my kind of favorites yes what he only drew women predominantly i have one where we drew a
*  male like as a guy in a like a genet or something and now i'm looking forward to so jake made me
*  a three foot tall sculpture called future murmur which i am ecstatic to get just remind yourself
*  how many fascinating beautiful people are out there and just a victory and holiness
*  technology and speed and how many people have you know fought so that i could do what i do
*  yeah that's another thing i'm grateful for just like the 100 billion or so people that came before
*  us yeah and also the trillions of life forms that came before that oh god i've gone down this
*  this trilobite rabbit hole buying fossils because as a kid i thought trilobites were the coolest
*  thing and i've got like 15 yeah and what's interesting is when you buy trilobite fossils
*  on ebay they're listed as used because it's got to be newer used according to programming so it's
*  used yeah yeah but just look thinking about all that history just all the life forms that came
*  before it seems like a really special thing we have going on earth here oh yeah i think that's
*  that's very fair to say but i also think this kind of is like live life to the fullest you
*  know camu talked about living to the point of tears yeah especially on behalf of people who
*  didn't have that privilege so you know i dedicated the white pill to my parents who got me out of the
*  soviet union and all the kids who never could and it's like when i die i want everyone else to
*  not only they're obviously going to be happy but yeah like i'm not here enjoy what you you live
*  for me because i can't have that privilege anymore what do you think about kamu as a writer
*  i don't like his novels at all or you don't at all yeah you've talked shit about the plague to me
*  yeah i i didn't i think the book is pointless it's fascinating because all you need to do is read the
*  synopsis and then you get it like i don't think his book it's not true for most books no i mean
*  like you could take i don't know i just don't agree at all there i mean it's it's catcher in the
*  eye there's a lot of books that are seem trivial i don't think it seems trivial but i think animal
*  farm animal farm is a methodical step-by-step examination of a transformation from one thing
*  to another the plague is not that it's a methodical examination of what a society is like under the
*  plague which could symbolize a lot of things including the plague directly or nazi germany
*  or ideological movements or it's it's similar to animal farm maybe not as effective
*  in terms of using this kind of i think animal farm has a narrative and i'm going to spoil the whole
*  plague the book the plague okay there's a there's a town i believe in oman a plague descends people
*  struggle to deal with it and the plague vanishes as quickly as it came the end yeah but there's the
*  victims the the people that take advantage of it there's the doctor that amidst the absurdity and
*  the evil of the plague is fighting to do good nothing for me it does nothing okay well i can
*  spoil animal farm there's uh pigs there's animals at a farm and they the humans are abusing them
*  and then the animals overthrow the humans but then the pigs uh become just like the humans
*  the lesson kids is that uh power corrupts no matter whether you walk on four or on two i thought the
*  lesson was that pigs are the most human-like animals on the farm i thought i thought the
*  lesson was that there's no sugarcanny mountain that's right yeah you've interviewed a lot of
*  people yeah what have you learned about getting to the soul of a person the soul of an idea
*  from interviewing just how to do a good interview first i'm not interviewing just random people i'm
*  interviewing people who are accomplished it's not a random group that's self-selecting for something
*  different but i think that people um love to and this is very understandable love to feel seen
*  so if you're someone who's done something even if you're like the best guinea pig breeder in
*  america to have someone interested in your work and ask and listen to what you're saying because
*  i remember every book i've written you know i have friends and i wouldn't stop talking about
*  you know the the the person i'm writing with or you know the north korea at a certain point i'm
*  sure they're like all right i don't care about this anymore but like it takes over your brain
*  you know what i mean so if you have someone who has an interest or a hobby i'm sure to some extent
*  maybe your friends or family are sick of talking about it or you don't want to talk about with them
*  you would have that's the private life where you could just be yourself so i try to and this comes
*  from my co-authoring background when i'm talking to people to ask questions that they haven't heard
*  before there's a possibility that this actor i'm a huge fan of um is going to be on my show i don't
*  want to spoil everything and he's got a very specific role that he's known for and i know i'm
*  gonna i'm like okay i'm gonna i know it's gonna be annoying for you talking about this one role
*  but my goal is to ask questions that haven't you have aren't sick of ants asking of having been
*  asked porn star or uh not a porn star that joke failed also edit out what do you know about
*  breeding guinea pigs you mentioned it i'd love to hear i don't know i'd love to hear more about it
*  this is i always use this as an example i said there's there's you meet someone a party who
*  breeds guinea pigs right there's two approaches either you're weird get it okay or sit down and
*  tell me everything yeah and i'm very much and all the people i like are the second group
*  when you meet someone who's doing something unusual and are passionate about it and you know
*  are good at it like that to me is the mother load yeah that to me uh also is the thing i enjoy the
*  most it's like because and then it's like passionate about it who you guys hate do you
*  guys hate the hamster people do you hate the rabbit people there's got to be someone that you guys
*  look down on because like the marine aquarium people look down the freshwater aquarium people
*  yeah it's a hierarchy yes there's always gonna be a hierarchy this is where the left anarchists
*  and i disagree because they think you can have galitarianism there's gonna be a hierarchy
*  hierarchies emerge yes there's no anarchy in the guinea pig world no it's just a different kind of
*  energy somebody's always breeding somebody else yes and looking down on the others if someone's
*  the other yeah whether it's the hamster people the rat people and everybody's breeding yeah
*  by the way are you uh anarcho-capitalist what kind of what flavor of uh anarchist are you i'm
*  an anarchist without adjectives i like them all the black flag comes in many colors all right all
*  right you're quoting you're oh yeah no i understand dude it was as a beautiful line in the book thank
*  you i think the anarcho-capitalists don't give the left anarchists enough credit especially for
*  their courage and i do whatever i can in my power to talk about people like emma goldman whenever
*  possible do you still think uh that are some people better than others is a good litmus test
*  yes it's worked 100 percent of the time and for you the answer is yes i never answered
*  there's two of them
*  um
*  what are you getting all hitchcock up in here oh hey careful
*  i always got your back
*  uh what little habits in your life make you happy now that you're in austin oh my god
*  i was prepping for this interview and i imagined this coming up and i knew that as i explained this
*  you know how sometimes when someone tells a story like at first it's amusing then it's amusing and
*  concerned and then you're like holy shit like like where's the exit yeah i'm getting nervous already
*  like where's the exit yeah i'm getting nervous already you should so i'm going to tell you
*  something i've told only a couple of people
*  this is my absolutely off the charts autistic approach to shaving oh so i have this insane
*  system uh you asked about habits like amy joy i used to hate shaving i used to hate it there's
*  something called wet shaving so wet shaving is you get the brush you get the soap that's in a
*  canister yes stir it up you paint your face and then you shave the thing is there are dozens
*  of these shaving soap companies yeah okay so i tried a couple of hundred of these soaps because
*  you're testing for scent you're testing for with the lather thickness and also how smooth of a
*  shave it gives you yeah i have it down i'm not making this up i'm not this creative i haven't
*  down to a cycle of 67 soaps yeah okay so this cycle a cycle so 67 yeah when i use up one soap
*  that is a slot that i will have to try new ones and i will try new ones in that slot
*  until i get one that i like and then that slot is filled so right now i have 67 that i use and i have
*  86 candidates like candidates yeah in this in the queue do you label them do you remember like
*  which one is which well they all have beautiful labels i mean these are artisans who are creating
*  these amazing things so they're i would encourage everyone to try this hobby who's a guy it's so
*  much fun i will give a shout out to the companies that that are the best so the best company in my
*  opinion is a company called they just changed the name because you know what they're originally
*  called i'm not joking yeah grooming department and now it's like a bad name yeah but it has
*  certain connotations in contemporary discourse so now he's contemporary discourse yes he changed
*  his name to ion skincare aion that's the the sense of the most sophisticated the most diverse and the
*  soap is just really high quality another amazing company is barrister and man and if i'm going to
*  tell you to try one it's called shesher he comes out with new ones every month or so a lot of it's
*  missed a lot of it's hit just great great quality stuff another great company is chisels face they
*  make something called midnight stag which basically smells like a garage it's one of my favorite
*  soaps of all time yeah what makes for a good smell for michael mails i have 67 answers so some
*  of them smell into converting some are citrusy some are industrial some so garage is more
*  industrial it smells like a garage yeah midnight stag it smells like garage some are fun because
*  there's smells that smell like other things for example there's a scent in my queue called
*  scotty it smells like swedish fish another great company is phoenix shaving and they have one
*  called aloha smackdown smells like hawaiian punch they had one called yule ham that they made for
*  me special smells like a ham they had a ramen one rockin ramen smells like cup of noodles
*  so they're a great and they every year they do an advent calendar where you for 12 days you have a
*  little sample of a soap and a sample of the aftershave nice so those are i'm forgetting
*  someone and i'm feeling angry that i'm doing it but those are some of the oh and katie's bubbles
*  is great they're vegan out of new jersey they've got one called a knee high to a grape it smells
*  like grape soda i think those are the biggest names off the top of my head will that list
*  converge down to a small set eventually or no 67 down to well no it's down to 67 so oh so it's
*  always keeps right so there's a slot then you know what i mean like i'll fill that you just
*  i'm saying oh so you will forever have the variety of 67 yes huh you know you know what
*  you know how sad my brain is when i when you were telling me this i was like i wonder how many soaps
*  are left in michael mouse's life like you can count your life by days by months by years or by
*  soaps that is depressing that is what i could because each each experience of shaving is a
*  little beautiful experience yes it is how many do you have left in your life right that's true
*  yeah i gotta tell you there's something else there's a term called my friend jackie taught me called
*  touching pan it's a makeup term so basically when you use it and you can see the bottom
*  and you can see the bottom that's like a big moment oh it's a great thing yeah it's like
*  what's kind of fun i'm telling you like people can scoff it is such a fun and there's a lot of us
*  online who are into this whole space it's really really fun when you first discover this can i
*  curse yeah fuck you coal striker because i was staying at my friend coles house in la yeah fuck
*  you coles fuck you coles is like one of the biggest hipsters i know he's got the the shirts
*  with the pearl snaps and everything and i'm staying at his house because i was doing rogan
*  and he goes oh have you heard of this wet shaving thing and he goes look this one's
*  pro rezo that's like the italian grandpa soap which is also a great one and i went down this
*  rabbit hole and i'm like hunting i don't even know how many how much money i spent on this and it's
*  all because of him oh but it's like a happy fuck you like fuck you coles yeah i love you coles
*  fuck you thank you yes that's a good idea for a tattoo fuck you coles
*  uh how do you have advice on how to be happy
*  yes there's a lot of loneliness and sadness in the world uh here i can give a very easy piece
*  of advice that worked a lot for me instead of telling yourself
*  that you have these ridiculous standards tell yourself i can be better right i don't have to
*  be a great writer i could be a better writer i don't have to be a great podcaster that will
*  never happen i could be a better podcaster i could be a better person i could be a better
*  uh at the gym i could be better with my time and when you regard things in those and especially
*  if you have metrics that you can go by you know for example i'll run this many miles a day things
*  you have control over if you especially as males when you have this chart and the data is telling
*  you you're improving right away it's like you have this sense of accomplishment so i think that is a
*  really great way to uh and if something is not working in your life let's suppose you don't have
*  friends right there's the internet how do people make friends try things out what's the worst that's
*  going to happen you're going to blow up in your face well you're you're you'll learn something
*  at least don't be afraid of making mistakes when i was a kid i was so scared of having things under
*  control so like i would never have to get hit in the face metaphorically and then i realized and
*  you realize this as well everyone who's important gets hit in the face look at the president whoever
*  the president is it becomes a matter of being strong enough that you could take getting hit
*  in the face so that is a big important switch in your thinking yeah there's a bacoski quarter row
*  down sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning you think i'm not going to make it but you laugh
*  inside remembering all the times you felt that way yeah yeah there's a part of me that's like that
*  there's some days where i feel like this is the worst day of my life and then like shortly after
*  they chuckle at that yes just knowing the ups and downs of the brain and the mind and life and all
*  that you ever been depressed yeah of course i'm more anxious than depressed i don't really get
*  depressed like yeah but i've been depressed like low points yeah but i think i i distinguish
*  depression between low points right like if things are going bad and you feel bad that makes sense
*  but i when i think of depression i think of someone who feels bad when things aren't bad
*  like it's a it's by that to me it's like almost by definition irrational well yeah and there's
*  different kinds of i like there there's a exhausted kind of depression where you're not it's not so
*  much sad is you're not don't want to do anything you don't want to live you don't want to what's
*  the yeah what's the point what's the point yeah um and like an extreme self-critical negativity
*  which i'm also scared of because my brain is generally very self-critical because you're not
*  taking up magnesium do you take erectile or in the mouth you take erectile okay but as for the
*  magnesium you should take it as a pill okay what the way your mom explained it then is is way
*  different uh what are you most afraid of
*  of
*  holy crap that's that's i i i'm trying to think of anything i'm afraid of
*  you know in 1984 with i thought like even just look if i wanted to torture you hypothetically
*  well you're doing well mission accomplished you know what i mean i mean in terms of i'm scared of
*  increasing authoritarianism but that's not personal and that's not that's something that
*  i don't think is as much of an imminent concern as like let's say in canada are you scared of death
*  no i think kamu was scared of death no he just accepted it as it's look i i can i honestly feel
*  like if i died tomorrow i did pretty good with what i had like i i think i did things that matter
*  to me i think i moved the needle on things that matter to me i think i've been a good uh friend
*  to the people i care about um i've saved a couple of lives so i i can i i think it's a very low bar
*  for someone to be able to grow their grave and say you know i left the world a better place than
*  i found it i don't think it's that hard you ever been betrayed oh god yes of course haven't you
*  not as often as i would have predicted yeah the russian upbringing like it's like expects
*  everyone to be like just it's a time bomb before the betray you have been betrayed of course yeah
*  yeah you value loyalty i do and i also made it a point to not let that betrayal
*  color my future interactions and regard that as the universal or the norm yeah i think that's very
*  important me too and also i feel bad i i've gotten lex enough that i feel bad for the person who
*  betrayed me because it's just like they didn't need to do this and at some point if you betray
*  someone you know and you know you're not a good person i believe that yeah like even if you
*  yourself there's something i had to do you still know you had to do a bad thing to someone who
*  didn't deserve it and that's a really hard pill to swallow in in my situation i still
*  think good thoughts and empathize with with the people that have done me wrong i don't empathize
*  with them but i sympathize with them my english is not good enough to know the difference
*  empathizing means you're putting yourself on their shoes sympathizing means you feel
*  bad for them and wish them well
*  yeah i wish them well yeah but i don't put myself like i it's it's very hard for me to empathize
*  with someone who betrays someone that they care about because that is something it's not that
*  just i think i'm such a great person it's that i feel guilt very strongly so if i did that to
*  someone who trusted me i would really it would fuck up my head for a long time yeah but maybe
*  they were in pain maybe they were desperate maybe sure sure to the to the wall sure they felt that
*  sure well that's the sympathy thing not really an empathy thing yeah yeah loyalty is a fascinating
*  thing yes i value trust a lot i know you do especially because you're such a public both
*  of us were you know very public positions you have to be very careful who you surround yourself with
*  it sucks does it well it it sucks because it's hard to uh
*  i usually just trust everybody that's okay that's crazy
*  but what's the alternative to be have a filter well i have a filter in terms of who i interact
*  with okay but within the you know i see the good in people but then you you know in the very rare
*  instances that might turn okay and yeah it just sucks it breaks my heart yeah i hear you i
*  completely agree has your heart ever been broken yes love yes
*  i'm just so relaxed right now good happy relaxed and happy good this is making me really happy
*  it's so again it's beautiful on like eight different levels i think that's the deepest
*  thing i'm thankful for it's just how beautiful people are how beautiful the world is i really
*  and people are gonna laugh and i welcome it that's fine i really sometimes feel like the guy in
*  american beauty looking at the plastic bag dancing in the wind and he's brought to tears because of
*  how much beautiful life is and a lot of people feel they need to sneer at that scene and and
*  ricky's ricky pitts whatever and i think he's got it exactly right i think he does too
*  well in the end you and i will be both laughing that's exact and right and also seeing beauty
*  where others people see garbage and i'd rather be the person who sees beauty than the person who
*  sees garbage yep well when i look at you i see beauty when most people see garbage
*  and it's really unfair mr parrot that you keep saying that but all jokes aside man i'm really
*  grateful for your friendship and i'm really grateful for you as a person thank you so much
*  for talking today thank you so much for talking to me throughout all these years thank you for
*  being who you are you are welcome thanks for listening to this conversation with michael malice
