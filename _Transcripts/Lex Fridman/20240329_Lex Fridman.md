# Mark Cuban: Shark Tank, DEI & Wokeism Debate, Elon Musk, Politics & Drugs | Lex Fridman Podcast #422
**Lex Fridman:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cn3VBjfN8g)
*  the person who controls the algorithm controls the world, right? And if you are committed to one
*  specific platform as your singular source of information or affiliated platforms,
*  then whoever controls the algorithm or the programming there controls you.
*  The following is a conversation with Mark Cuban, a multi-billionaire businessman,
*  an investor and star of the series Shark Tank, longtime principal owner of the Dallas Mavericks,
*  and is someone who is unafraid to get into frequent battles on X, most recently over topics of DEI,
*  wokeism, gender, and identity politics with the likes of Elon Musk and Jordan Peterson.
*  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Mark Cuban.
*  You've started many businesses, invested in many businesses, heard a lot of pitches privately and
*  on Shark Tank. So you're the perfect person to ask, what makes a great entrepreneur?
*  Somebody who's curious, they want to keep on learning because business is ever changing.
*  It's never static. Somebody who's agile because as you learn new things and the environment around
*  you changes, you have to be able to adapt and make the changes. And somebody who can sell
*  because no business has ever survived without sales. And as an entrepreneur who's creating
*  a company, whatever your product or service is, if that's not the most important thing and you're
*  just dying and excited to tell people about it, then you're not going to succeed.
*  But it's also a skill thing. How do you sell? What do you mean by selling?
*  Selling is just helping. I've always looked at it about putting myself in the shoes of another
*  person and asking a simple question. Can I help this person? Can my product help? And from the
*  time I was 12 years old, selling garbage bags door to door and just asking a simple question,
*  do you use garbage bags? Do you need garbage bags? Well, let me save you some time.
*  I'll bring them to your house and drop them off to streaming. Why do we need streaming when we have
*  TV and radio? Well, you can't get access to your TV and radio everywhere you go. So we kind of
*  break down geographic and physical barriers and cost plus drugs. What's the product that we
*  actually sell? We sell trust. In a simplistic approach, we buy drugs and sell drugs, but we
*  add transparency to it. And bringing transparency to an industry is a differentiation and it helps
*  people. Trust in an industry that's highly lacking in trust. Exactly. Okay. So what's the trick to
*  selling garbage bags? Let's go back there. 12 years old, I mean, is it just your natural charisma?
*  I guess a good question to ask. Are you born with it or can you develop it? Oh, you can definitely
*  develop it. Yeah. I mean, because selling garbage bags door to door was easy, right? Because like
*  12 year old Mark going, hi, my name is Mark. Do you use garbage bags? You know what the answer
*  is going to be, right? Can I just drop them off for you? You know, once a week, whenever you need
*  them, you just call and I'll bring them down. Sure. So that was easy. But I'm sure you've been
*  rejected. Oh yeah, of course. Not everybody says yes. What's your, what was your percentage?
*  I don't remember, but it's pretty close to a hundred percent. So that's why you don't remember.
*  Right. Cause he's going to say no to a 12 year old kid. He's going to save him time and money.
*  But you know, typically my career, where I've started companies, it's to do something that
*  other people aren't doing, whether it was connecting PCs and to local area networks and
*  at micro solutions. And you know, the salesmanship was walking into a company and just
*  saying, look, talk to me and I can help you improve your productivity and your profitability.
*  Is that important to you? And the answer is obviously always yes. And then the question is,
*  can I do the job and can I do it cost effectively? And so you didn't have to be a born salesperson
*  to be able to ask those questions, but you have to be able to be willing to put in the time to
*  learn that business. And that's the hardest part. I'm sure there's a skill thing to it too. And like
*  how you solve the puzzle of communicating with the person and convincing them. Yeah. I mean,
*  there's skill from the perspective that I read like a maniac. Then like now you can give me an
*  example of any type of business and it'll take me two seconds to figure out how they make money
*  and how I can make them more productive. And I think that's probably my biggest skill, being able
*  to just drill down to what the actual need is, if any. And then, you know, from there being able to
*  say, well, if this is what this company does and this is what their goal is, how can I introduce
*  something new that they haven't seen before? And is that a business that I can create and make money
*  from? So figure out how this kind of business makes money in the present and then figure out
*  is there a way to make more money in the future by introducing a totally new kind of thing?
*  Correct. And you can just do that with anything? Pretty much, yeah.
*  And you think you're born with that? No, I worked at it because, you know, going back to what I said
*  earlier about curiosity, you have to be insanely curious because the world is always changing. My
*  dad used to say, we don't live in the world we were born into, you know, which is absolutely true. If
*  you're not a voracious consumer of information, then you're not going to be able to keep up and
*  no matter what your sales skills or ability are, they're going to be useless. What did you learn
*  about life from your dad? You mentioned your dad. My dad did upholstery on cars, you know, got up,
*  went to work every morning at seven o'clock, came back five or six, seven o'clock exhausted. And I
*  learned to be nice. I learned to be caring. I learned to be accepting. Just, you know, qualities
*  that I think he really tried to pass on to myself and my two younger brothers were just be a good
*  human, you know, and I think, you know, he didn't have business experience. So as I got into business,
*  he would just, you know, say, sorry, Mark, I can't help you. You know, I don't understand what you're
*  doing. He never went to, neither one of my parents had gone to college. You've got to figure it out
*  for yourself. But he was also very insistent that, you know, he worked at a company called
*  Regency Products where they did upholstery on cars. And he would bring me there to sweep the floors,
*  not because he wanted me to learn that business, because he wanted me to learn how backbreaking
*  that work was. I mean, he lost an eye in an accident at work, a staple broke. And he, the
*  only thing he wanted from my brothers and I was for us to never have to work like that, to go to
*  college to figure it out. You said to be nice. That said, you also said that you, when you were
*  first starting a business, you were a bit more of an asshole than you wish you would have been.
*  Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Because I was more of a yeller. I was, you know, I didn't have-
*  No, really? Yeah.
*  Yeah. What you see on the sidelines, you know, with me at a Mavs game, maybe a little bit,
*  but I also didn't have any patience for somebody I thought wasn't using my kind of common sense,
*  right? Because I was always on the go, go, go, go, go when I, particularly when I was younger,
*  just trying to be successful, trying to get to the point where I had independence.
*  And I would tell this to people, you know, either you're speeding up and getting on the train or,
*  you know, we'll stop and drop you off at the next station, but let's go where you go.
*  Did you have trouble with the hire fast, fire fast part of running a business?
*  Yeah, always. Cause I hated firing people. Cause it meant one, it was an admission of
*  mistake in the hiring. And two, the salesperson to me always wanted to come out ahead and I was
*  always horrible at firing, but I always partnered with people who had no problem with it. So I always
*  delegated that. Well, that's the tricky thing. When you're working with somebody and they're not
*  quite there and you have to decide, are they going to step up and grow into the person that's the
*  right or they're not? And in that gray area is probably where you have to fire.
*  It was hard. Yeah, for sure. Because, you know, there is obviously a failure somewhere in the
*  process. You know, what did we do wrong? And when I would interview people for jobs, I think 99%
*  of the people I've ever interviewed, I've wanted to hire because in my mind it was like, okay,
*  I can figure out how to make this person work. Right. And then they wouldn't. And then, you know,
*  people at the company be like, Mark, you suck at this, you know? And so I always delegated the
*  hiring. Yeah. I mean, I'm the same. I see the potential in people. I see the beauty in people,
*  and which is a great way to live life. But when you're running a company, it's a different thing.
*  It's different. And you got to know what you're good at when you're bad at, right? I was good at,
*  you know, I was a ready fire aim guy. And I always partnered with people who were very anal
*  and perfectionist because where I could just go, go, go, go, go, go, they would keep me inside the
*  baselines. They would do the due diligence. Yeah. Or just, yeah, the detail work, the dot the I's
*  and the cross the T's. What does it take to take that first leap into starting a business?
*  That's the hardest part. It really depends on your personal circumstances. Like I got fired.
*  I mean, I was sleeping on the floor, six guys in a three bedroom apartment. So I couldn't go any
*  lower. So there was no downside. Yeah, there was no downside for me starting a business. And it was
*  just like, you know, I was 25 when we started Micro Solutions. And, you know, I just gotten fired.
*  And it was like, look, I'm a lousy employee. I'm going to just start going to some of my prospects
*  that I had in my job and ask them to front the money that I needed to install some software and
*  found this company, Architectural Lighting, who put up $500 for me. That allowed me to buy software
*  and have 50% margins. And, you know, that's how I started my company. But like by way of advice,
*  would you say, I mean, it's a terrifying thing. Yeah. I mean, you've got to be in a position where
*  you're confident. You know, I get emails and approached by people all the time. You know,
*  what kind of business should I start? That tells me you're not ready to start a business, right?
*  Either you're prepared and you know it or you don't. You know, in the United States with the
*  American dream, everybody kind of always looks at themselves and say, okay, you know, I have this
*  idea, right? And then you go through this process of saying, okay, you know, you talk to your friends
*  or family, what do you think? And then almost always, oh, it's a great idea, right? Then you
*  go on Google and you say, oh my God, no one else is doing it without thinking, you know,
*  10 companies have gone out of business trying the same thing. But okay, it's on Google. And then
*  people stop, right? Because that next step means, okay, I have to change what I'm doing in my life.
*  And that's not easy for 99% of the people. Some people look at that as an opportunity and get
*  excited about it. Some people get terrified because it's okay, maybe I'm comfortable,
*  maybe I have responsibilities. And so whatever your circumstances are, if you want to take that
*  next step, you have to be able to deal with the consequences of changing your circumstances.
*  And that's the first thing, you know, do you save money? You know, so you have, you know, if you have
*  a job, do you have a mortgage? Do you have a family? You've got to save money. You can't just walk,
*  you know? I mean, they've got to eat and they've got to have shelter. But on the other side of the
*  coin, if you've got nothing, it's the perfect time to start a business. Yeah, desperation is a good
*  catalyst for starting a business. But in many cases, the decision, as you're talking about,
*  you're going to have to make is to leave a job that's providing some degree of comfort already.
*  So I suppose when you're sleeping on the floor and there's six guys, it's a little bit easier.
*  It's really easy, right? Particularly when you get fired and you don't have a job,
*  you know, and you're looking at bartending at night to try to pay the bills. And so
*  it wasn't hard for me, but to your point, it really comes down to preparation. You know,
*  if it's important enough to you, you'll save the money. You'll give up, you know,
*  whatever it is you need to give up to put the money aside. If you have obligations, you'll
*  put in the work to learn as much as you can about that industry so that when you start your business,
*  you're prepared. And you can always, you know, at night, on weekends, whenever you find time,
*  lunch, start making the calls to find out if people will write you a check, you know, transfer
*  you money to buy whatever it is you're selling. And by doing those things, you can put yourself
*  in a position to succeed. It's where people just think, okay, you know, Geronimo, I'm leafing off
*  the edge of a cliff and I'm starting a business. That's tough. But sometimes that's like the way
*  you do it though. There's always examples of any situation or scenario, right? But I mean,
*  anecdotal evidence for everything. Yeah. But if you're going into a new business,
*  you're going to have competition unless you're really, really, really, really, really lucky.
*  And that competition is not going to just say, okay, let Lex or Mark just kick her ass.
*  And so you've got to be prepared to how you're going to deal with that competition.
*  What do you think that is about America that has so many people who have that dream and act on that
*  dream of starting a business? You know, I think we've just got a culture of consumption and more,
*  you know, and to get more, you've got to, you know, creating a business gives you the
*  greatest potential upside and the greatest leverage on your time. But it also creates the most risk.
*  So that capitalist machine, there's a lot of elements by contrast,
*  the respect for the law, like an entrepreneur can trust that if they
*  pull it off, the law will protect them. There won't be a government.
*  Hopefully that's still the case. Yeah.
*  There's always, yeah, there's always other countries. Right. Right. So
*  us versus other countries, like Joe Biden, of all people said to me, it was at an entrepreneurship
*  conference that when he was vice president, he had put together and we had gone up there from a bunch
*  of us from Shark Tank to talk to young entrepreneurs from around the world. And he said to me, Mark,
*  you know, the one thing that separates, I've been to every country around the world. And the one
*  thing that separates us is the entrepreneurship. We're the most entrepreneurial country in the
*  world and there's no one else who's even close. And when you look at the origin of our biggest,
*  you know, the biggest companies in the world, for the most part, there's an American origin
*  story somewhere behind there. And I think, you know, that just gets perpetuated on itself.
*  We see those Horatio Alger stories. We see examples of the Jeff Bezos of the world,
*  Steve Jobs of the world, and those are the types of people we want to copy.
*  Yeah. We want to be really careful and try to really figure out what that is because we don't
*  want to lose that. For sure. We want to protect that whatever, you know, and that's a lot of the
*  discussions about what's the right way to do government, big government, small government,
*  what's the right policies, but also culture, like who we celebrate. One of the things that troubles
*  me is that we don't enough celebrate the entrepreneurs that take risks and the
*  entrepreneurs that succeed. It seems like success, especially when it comes to wealth,
*  is immediately matched with distrust and criticism and all that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah. It's changing for sure because, you know, you can go back just 12 years, right?
*  Traditional media dominated, let's just say, through 2012. You know, that was the peak of linear
*  television. You know, newspapers weren't as strong, but they still had some breadth and depth to them.
*  And then social media comes along and everybody gets to play in their own sandbox
*  and share opinions with people who think just like them. And that also gives them the opportunity to
*  amplify those feelings. And I think that's where celebrating entrepreneurs really started to
*  subside some. There were always people who were progressive that were like,
*  billionaires are bad or millionaires are bad, depending on the time period.
*  But you didn't really see it on an ongoing basis, right? It wasn't going to be on the evening news.
*  It wasn't going to be in the front page of the newspaper. It was going to be if you read a book
*  and someone talked about it, or you read a magazine and there was an article talking about,
*  you know, this progressive movement or that progressive movement, whatever it may be,
*  you know, and then, or political parties. But now all of that is front and center on social media.
*  And we're trying to figure out how we deal with the mobs of people and the virality of it all.
*  I think we'll find our footing and start celebrating greatness again.
*  Well, I mean, that's the whole reason I do Shark Tank.
*  That's true. That show celebrates the entrepreneur.
*  It's the only place where every single minute of every single episode, we, you know, we celebrate
*  the American dream. And the reason I do it is we tell the entire country and it's shown around
*  the world even. We, you know, we're amazing advertising for the American dream and I don't
*  even know how many countries, but every time somebody walks onto that carpet from Dubuque,
*  Iowa or Ketchum, Idaho, you know, that sends a message to every kid who's watching, seven, eight,
*  nine, 10, 12 year old kid, that if they can do it from Ketchum, Idaho, you can do it. If they
*  can have this idea and get a deal or even present to the sharks and have all of America see it,
*  you can do it. And that, I mean, I'm proud of that. 15 years of that is just, it's just been insane.
*  You know, now kids walk up to me and go, yeah, I started watching you when I was five or 10.
*  And I started a business because I learned about it from Shark Tank. And so, you know, I think,
*  you know, we're being, it celebrates it and we convey it. And I don't think it's going away,
*  but there are different battles we have to fight to support it.
*  Yeah. I love even when the business idea is obviously horrible. Just, just, just the guts
*  to step up, to believe in yourself, to really reach. I mean, that's what matters. I mean,
*  cause like some of the best business ideas are probably, uh, maybe even you and Shark Tank will
*  laugh at. Oh, for sure. You know, without question, the good ones, we're not going to recognize every
*  good one. And then sometimes we'll just motivate people to work even harder to get it done.
*  Cause of what we say to them. And that's fine too. You know, there's been great success stories
*  that we said no to. What stands out as like a memorable business on, uh, you've been pitched on
*  Shark Tank. What's the best one that stands out? There's no best one, right? They're all different.
*  They're all best in their own way. I guess the stupid ones and, you know,
*  we haven't had any, you know, world or world changing or shattering ones, right? Because
*  those aren't going to apply to Shark Tank. They don't need us, right? You know, so we typically
*  get businesses that need some help at some level or another. Um, but there's ones I've passed that
*  I wish like Spikeball. Do you know what Spikeball is? So it's just rebounding net that you can put
*  on the beach and you have these yellow balls and you play a game of, you know, it's just competitive
*  game, but they're killing it. So if you go to beaches in New York or LA, you'll see kids playing
*  it all the time. And it was a fun game, um, that I wish I had done a deal with. There's,
*  and there's been others. And you passed. And I passed. They were getting some traction and they
*  wanted to create leagues, Spikeball leagues, and they wanted me to be the commissioner.
*  And I don't want to be a commissioner of a new Spikeball league.
*  So you have to kind of have this gut feeling of will this scale, will this click with people?
*  Of course. Yeah. Can it be protected? Is it differentiated? Is it something that makes me
*  think, you know, why didn't I think of that? Um, or is it just a good, um, solid business
*  that's going to pay a return to the founder and may not be enough of a business to return to,
*  um, an investor? Yeah. And I guess the question you're trying to see, will this scale, this promise,
*  will the promise materialize into a big thing? Well, see, I don't even care if it's going to be
*  a big thing, right? Cause it's all relative to the entrepreneur. We had a 19 year old from
*  Pittsburgh, Laney, who came on with this simple sugar scrub and there was nothing
*  outrageously special about it. I didn't see it becoming a hundred million dollar business.
*  I thought it could become a two, three, five million dollar business that paid the bills for
*  her. And that, that was good enough. And you know, six months after the show aired, she called me up,
*  she goes, Mark, I've got a million dollars in the bank. What am I going to do? I'm like, enjoy it,
*  put aside money for your taxes and go back to work. You know? And so it doesn't have to be a
*  huge business. It's just got to be one that makes the entrepreneur happy. But then there's the
*  valuation piece. I mean, do a lot of the entrepreneurs overvalue? Yeah, of course. Yeah.
*  I mean, that's, that's the nature of it, right? I mean, and that, that's really where the biggest
*  conflicts in Shark Tank happened. That's an evaluation. They, you know, they, they think
*  this is the best business ever. You know, there, we had one lady, um, couple that came on and they
*  had this scraper for cat's tongues, right? Nice. Bizarre. Most one of the most bizarre pitch ever.
*  I love it. Um, you know, and they had this insane valuation and it was on because it was corny and
*  fun TV, not because it was a good business. Oh really? Okay. Hey, you didn't see the potential.
*  No, none. There's a lot of cats in the world, Mark. Yes, there are. They'll go to very well without
*  me. So how do you determine the value of a business, whether it's on Shark Tank or just in
*  general? It's actually really easy, right? So if you take just to use an example of business,
*  that's valued at $1 million and I want to buy 10% of that company, um, for a hundred thousand dollars,
*  then in order for me to get my money back, they've got to be able to generate a hundred thousand
*  dollars in after-tax cashflow that they're able to distribute. Can they do it or can they not?
*  Right. And if it's a $2 million value, whatever the valuation is, that's how much cash after
*  tax cash they have to generate to return that money to investors. Or the other option is,
*  do I see this as business potentially having an exit, right? Do they have some unique technology
*  or do they have something specific about them that some other company would want to acquire?
*  Then the cashflow isn't as, I don't want to say important, but isn't going to guide the valuation.
*  And how do you know if a company is going to be acquired? So it's the technology, like the
*  patents, but also the team? Yeah, it could be any of the above, right? It could be, it could be
*  a super products company that, um, I think is going to take off. And how do you know if they
*  can generate the money? What's, what's the, you made it sound easy, you know? Yeah. I mean, is,
*  can the person sell, you know? And if not them, can I do it or someone on my team do it for them?
*  So you're looking at the person. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. That's where Barbara Corker is the best.
*  She can look at a person and hear them talk for 20 minutes and know, can that person do the job
*  and do the work? Can you tell if they're full of shit or not? So one of the things with
*  entrepreneurs, they're kind of like we said, overvaluing. So there may be overselling themselves,
*  but also they might be full of shit in terms of their understanding of the market or also like,
*  or exaggerating what they're thinking, do all that kind of stuff. Can you see through that?
*  Yeah, for sure. Just by asking questions, you know? So if they are, um, delusional at some level
*  or misleading at another level, I'm going to, I'm going to call them on it. You know? So you get
*  people trying to sell supplements that come on there and it's a cure for cancer or whatever it
*  may be. Or there's this latest fad that, you know, increases your core strength without doing any
*  exercises, you know, the shit like that. I'm just going to bounce. I'm going to pound on them. Right?
*  I still love that. I still love the trying to, you know, give them credit, right? Because they
*  know all of America is going to see it and they're deluded themselves to believe this story.
*  So strongly, I mean, there's a delusional aspect to entrepreneurship, right? Like you just,
*  I see that. That's a great question. Um, do you have to be ambitious and, you know,
*  set aside reality at some level to think that you can create a company that could be worth 10,
*  a hundred, a billion dollars, right? Um, yeah, at some level, cause you don't know it's all
*  uncertainty, but I think if you're delusional, that works against you. Um, you, because everything's
*  grounded in reality. You've got to execute. You've got to produce, you know, you can have
*  a vision, right? And you can say, this is where I want to get to and that's my mission, or this is
*  my driving principle, but you still got to execute on the business plan. And that, that's where most
*  people fail. Yeah. You have to be kind of two brained, I guess you have to be able to dip into
*  reality when you're thinking about like the specifics of the product, how to design things,
*  how to like the, you know, the first principles, the basics of how to build the thing, how much
*  it's going to cost all of that. Yeah. I mean, cause if you can't do the basics, you're not going to
*  be able to do the bigger things. And at the same time, you've got to be one of the things that
*  entrepreneurs do that I always try to remind any of that I work with on is we all tend to lie to
*  ourselves. Our product is bigger, faster, cheaper, this or that, as if that is a, um, finite
*  situation that's never going to change. Right. And there's always somebody, I call them leapfrog
*  businesses. There's whoever's competing against you, you know, if you do a, B or C, they're going to
*  try to do C D and E, right. And you better be prepared for that to come because otherwise
*  they're out of business too. So you're never in a vacuum. You're always competing against
*  sometimes an unlimited number of entrepreneurs that you don't even know exist who are trying
*  to kick your ass. And the tricky part of all this too is you might need to frequently pivot,
*  especially in the beginning. Hopefully not. So you think like in the beginning, the product you have
*  should be the thing that carries you a long time. Yeah. Because I mean, that's,
*  that's your riskiest point in time. Right. And so if you've done your homework, which includes
*  going out there and testing product market fit, um, you should have confidence that you're going
*  to be able to sell it. Now, if you didn't do your homework and you go out there and you sell
*  whatever it is, then, and you've raised money or whatever, just to pivot, you've already shown that
*  you haven't been able to read the market. And so it's not that pivots can't work and always don't
*  work. They can, but more often than not, they don't. You pivot for a reason. That's because
*  you made a huge mistake. Well, I also mean like the, the, the micro pivots, which is like iterative
*  development. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's not, yeah, just iterations. Yeah. You know, entrepreneurship
*  having any business is just continuous iteration, continuous, your product, your sales pitch,
*  your advertising, you know, introducing new technology. How do you use AI or not use AI?
*  Where do you use it? What person is the right person? There's, there's just a million touch
*  points, you know, that you're always reevaluating in real time that you have to be agile and adapt
*  and change. But especially in software, it feels like business model can evolve really quickly too.
*  How are you going to make money? Yeah. With software for sure, because you know, anything
*  digital, because it can change in a millisecond. Speaking of which, how did you make your first
*  billion? So my partner, Todd Wagner and I, um, had, would get together for lunches and we were at
*  California pizza kitchen and Preston Hollow in Dallas. And he was talking about, um, how we could
*  use this new thing called the internet. This is late 94, early 95 to be able to listen to Indiana
*  university basketball games, because that's where we went to school. And he was like, look, when we
*  would listen to games, we would have somebody in Bloomington, Indiana have a speaker phone next to
*  a radio. And then we would have a speaker phone in Dallas and you know, six pack or 12 pack of beer.
*  And we sit around listening to the game because there was no other way to listen to it.
*  So I was like, okay, my first company, microsolutions, you know, I'd written
*  software done network integration. And so I was comfortable digging into it. And so I'm like,
*  okay, let's give it a try. So we started this company called audio net and effectively became
*  the first streaming content company on the internet. And we're like, okay, we're not sure
*  how we're going to make this work, but we were able to make it work. And we started going to radio
*  stations and TV stations and, you know, music labels and everything. And evolved audio net.com,
*  which was only audio at the beginning to broadcast.com in 1998, which was audio and video
*  and became the largest multimedia site on the internet took it public.
*  In July of 1998, it had the largest first day jump in the history of the stock market at the time.
*  And then a year later, we sold it to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in Yahoo stock. And I owned,
*  you know, right around 30% of the company, give or take. And so after taxes, that's what got me there.
*  Well, there's a lot of questions there. So the technical challenge of that, you're making it
*  sound easy, but you wrote code, but still, in the early days of the internet, how do you figure out
*  how to create this kind of product of just audio at first and video?
*  A lot of iterations, right? Like you talked about, we started in the second bedroom of my house,
*  set up a server, I got an ISDN line, which was 128K line, and set up downloaded Netscape server,
*  and then started using different file formats that were progressive loading and allowing people to
*  connect to the server and do a progressive download so that the audio you can listen to the audio,
*  well, was downloaded onto your PC.
*  Yeah, it was a super choppy. So you're trying to figure out how to do it.
*  Oh yeah, for sure. It would buffer. It wasn't good, but it was a start.
*  But it was good enough because it's the first kind of...
*  Yeah, because there was no other competition, right? There was nobody else doing it. And so it was
*  like, okay, I can get access to this, this or this. And then there were some third party software
*  companies, Zing and Progressive Networks and others that took it a little bit further. So
*  we partnered with them and I started going to local radio stations where literally we would
*  set up a server right next to it. I had a $49 radio, the highest FM radio that I could find.
*  And we take the output of the audio signal from the radio with these two analog cables,
*  plug it into the server, encode it, and make it available from audionet.com.
*  Then I would go on UUNet bulletin boards. I would go on CompuServe. I would go on Prodigy.
*  I would go on AOL. I'd go wherever I could find bodies. And I'd say,
*  okay, we've got this radio station, KLIF in Dallas. It's got Dallas sports and Dallas news
*  and politics. And if you're in an office or you're outside of Dallas, connect to audionet.com.
*  And now you can listen to these things on demand. And that's how we started. And it started with
*  one radio station and then it was five, then it was 10, then it was video content. The laws
*  were different then so we could literally go out and buy CDs and host them and just let people
*  listen to whatever music. And we went from 10 users a day to 100 to 1,000 to hundreds of thousands
*  to a million over those next four years. How did you find the users? Is it word of mouth?
*  Word of mouth. Just word of mouth. Didn't spend a penny on advertising.
*  So the thing you were focusing on is getting the radio stations and all that.
*  Radio and TV, anything, any content at all. To pick up the phone? How did you?
*  Everything that was public domain, I'd go out and buy a video or a cassette, whatever it was.
*  And this was before the DMs, the Digital Minimum Copyright Act of 97, whenever it kicked in. So
*  literally anything that was audio, we would put online so people could listen to it.
*  And if you think about somebody at work, they didn't have a radio most likely. And if you did,
*  you couldn't get reception. Definitely didn't have a TV, but you had a PC and you had bandwidth
*  available to you. And the companies weren't up on firewalls or anything at that point in time. So
*  our in office listening during the day just exploded because whoever's sitting next to you,
*  what are you listening to? And that was the start of it. And then in early 98,
*  we started adding video and just other things. And we had ended up with thousands of servers.
*  There was no cloud back then. And just pulling together all those pieces to make it work.
*  But where we really made our money was by taking that network that we had built and then going to
*  corporations and saying, look, it's 1996, 97, 98. And to communicate with your worldwide employees,
*  what they would do is they would go to an auditorium that had a satellite uplink.
*  And then they would have people go to like theaters or ballrooms and hotels that had
*  satellite down links. And then would broadcast the product introductions, whatever. And so we
*  said to them, look, you're paying millions of dollars to reach all your employees when you can
*  do it. Pay us a half a million dollars and we'll do it just on their PCs at work. So we did, when
*  Intel announced the P90 PC, we charged them $2 million or whatever to do that. When Motorola
*  announced a new phone or a new product, we would charge them. And so we used the consumer side to
*  do a proof of concept for the network. And then we would take that knowledge and go to corporations.
*  And that's how we made our revenue. And there's some selling there with the corporations. Yeah,
*  a lot of selling there, but we were saving them so much money. And they were technology companies.
*  They wanted to be perceived as being leading edge. And so it was win-win. How much technical
*  savvy was required? You said a bunch of servers. Like at which point do you get more engineers?
*  How much did you understand could do yourself? And then also once you can't do all yourself,
*  how much technical savvy is required to understand enough to hire the right people to
*  keep building this innovation? I did all the technology and then we hired engineer after
*  engineer after engineer to implement it. And so, yeah, from putting together a multicast network to
*  software to just all these different things. Was this like a scary thing? Like it's terrifying,
*  right? Because as we were growing, trying to keep up the scale and literally we're buying off the
*  shelf PCs and then server cards as the technology advanced and hard drives and things would fail.
*  And we would have to, we didn't have machine learning back then to do an analysis of how
*  to distribute server resources. So there was a time when Bill Clinton and all the Monica Lewinsky
*  stuff happened. They released the audio of their interviews of him or something like that. And
*  we literally, I knew at that point in time when that was released, everybody at work was going
*  to want to listen to it. So we had to take down servers that were doing Chicago Cubs baseball
*  and just make all these on the fly decisions because we didn't have the tools to analyze
*  and be predictive. But yeah, it was all technology driven and marketing.
*  The acquisition by Yahoo, can you tell the story of that? But also in the broader context of this
*  internet bubble, this is a fascinating part of human history. So on the acquisition side,
*  we were the largest media site on the internet. It wasn't close. There was nobody close. We were
*  YouTube and relatively speaking, we would be 10X YouTube relative to the competition because there
*  was nobody there. And so it became obvious to Yahoo, AOL and others that they needed a multimedia
*  component and we had the infrastructure, sales, all that stuff. And so Yahoo, when we went public
*  in 98, or right before I think it was, they made an investment of like $2 million, which gave us a
*  connection to them. And then after we went public, they decided they needed to have multimedia. And
*  April of 99, we made a deal and then July of 2000 is when it closed.
*  And can you explain to me the trickiness of what you did after that?
*  The caller? Yeah.
*  Okay. So when we sold to Yahoo, we sold for $5.7 billion in stock, not cash. And so I looked at,
*  you know, after MicroSolutions, when I sold that, I took that money. And initially I told my broker,
*  I wanted to invest like a 60-year-old man because I wanted to protect it. But then he started asking
*  me all kinds of questions about all these technologies that I understood, like networks
*  I had installed. We had become one of the top 20, let's say, systems integrators in the country.
*  At one point in time, we're the largest IBM token ring installer in the country. It was crazy,
*  right? Banyan, blast from the past. So anyway, these Wall Street bankers, or analysts rather,
*  that were the big analysts of the time, would call me up because they would ask my broker,
*  what does he know about this product? And I knew them all, what was working and not working.
*  Right? And so the ones that work, I say that it's working, I'd see the stock, they'd say something,
*  the stock would go up 20 bucks, right? So I'm like, well, and my broker was like, you need to,
*  you know this better than they do, you need to invest. So I started buying and selling stocks,
*  and this was in 1990, and we're just killing it. I was making 80, 90, 100% a year over those next
*  four years to the point where a guy came in and asked to use my trading history to start a hedge
*  fund, which we did. And I sold within nine months. It was great, right? But the point being, as it
*  goes forward, so when we sold to Yahoo, I already had a lot of experience trading stocks. And I had
*  seen different bubbles come and go, the bubble for PC manufacturers, a bubble for networking
*  manufacturers. They went up, up, up, up, up, and then they came straight down after the hype,
*  or somebody just leapfrogged. And so when we sold to Yahoo, I was like, I've got to be next to my
*  name. That's all I need or all I want. I don't want to be greedy. And I'd seen this story before
*  where stocks get really frothy and go straight down. And I knew that because all of what I had
*  was in stock, I needed to find a way to collar it and protect it. So understanding stocks and
*  trading and options and all that, my broker and I, we went and shorted an index that had Yahoo in
*  it. And so the law at the time was you couldn't short any indexes that had more than 5% of that
*  stock in it, right? Of any one of the Yahoo stock. And so I took pretty much $20-some million,
*  everything I had at the time, and I shorted the index. This is fascinating, by the way,
*  because it's based on your estimation that this is a bubble. Or just mind not to be greedy.
*  Sure. So you're at the foundation of this kind of thinking is you don't want to be greedy.
*  Yeah. I mean, how much money do I need, right? You know, where other people were saying, oh,
*  I think you can go up higher, higher, higher. I went on CNBC and I told them what I had done.
*  And they were like, and Yahoo stock had gone up significantly from the time I had collared.
*  And one of the guys, Joe Kernan, was on there, don't you feel stupid now that Yahoo stock has
*  gone up X percent more? I'm like, yeah, I feel real stupid sitting on my jet.
*  But so, I mean, there is some fundamental way in which bubbles are based on this greed.
*  Oh, for sure. Yeah. And I'd seen it before, right? Like I just said. And so what I did was
*  we put together a collar where I sold calls and bought puts. And as it turned out, when the market
*  just cratered, I was protected. And, you know, over the next two, three years, whatever it was,
*  it converted to cash, paid my taxes, et cetera. But it protected me. And as it turns out,
*  it was called one of the top 10 trades of all time. And what was even more interesting out
*  of that period, my broker at that time was at Goldman Sachs. And I had asked him to see
*  if there was a way to trade the VIX, right? The volatility index. And there wasn't, right? And so
*  one of the people that Goldman that we were working with to try to create this
*  actually left Goldman and created indexes that allowed you to trade the VIX.
*  Well, it's not trivial to understand that it's a bubble. I mean, you're kind of
*  lessening your insight into all of this by saying you just didn't want to be greedy,
*  but you still have to see that it's a bubble. Yeah. I mean, yeah, obviously if I thought it
*  was going to keep on going up and there was intrinsic value there, I would have stayed in it.
*  But it wasn't so much Yahoo. It was just the entire industry. You would back then, you know,
*  like we're looking at the Magic 7 or whatever it is stocks now, and people are asking, is it a bubble?
*  And when I would get into cabs and people just start talking about internet stocks,
*  there were people creating companies with just a website and going public.
*  You know, that's a bubble, right? Where there's no intrinsic value at all.
*  And people aren't even trying to make operating cap profits. They're just trying to leverage
*  the frothiness of the stock market. That's a bubble. You don't see that right now. There's not
*  companies. You don't see any IPOs right now for that matter. So, you know, I don't think we're
*  in a bubble now, but back then, yes, I thought we were in a bubble, but that wasn't really the
*  motivating factor. Do you think it's possible we're in a bit of an AI bubble right now?
*  No, because we're not seeing funky AI companies just go public. If all of a sudden we see a rush
*  of companies who are skins on other people's models or just creating models to create models
*  that are going public, then yeah, that's probably the start of a bubble. But that said, my 14-year-old
*  was bragging about buying Nvidia, you know, with me and in his Robinhood account. He tells me the
*  order, I place it and he was like, oh yeah, it's going up, up, up, you know, and I'm like,
*  yeah, we're not quite there yet, but that's, you know, that's one thing to pay attention to.
*  Yeah, we're flirting with it. You said that becoming a billionaire requires luck. Can you explain?
*  Yeah, I mean, there's no business plan where you can just start it and say, yeah, I'm definitely
*  going to be a billionaire. You can, you know, if I had to start all over, could I start a company
*  that made me a millionaire? Yeah, because I know how to sell and I know technology and I've learned
*  enough over the years to do that. Could I make 10 million? Probably 100 million. I hope so. But
*  a billion, just something good has got to happen, you know, timing, you know, internet stock market
*  was going nuts right when we started, you know, and that certainly I couldn't predict or control.
*  You know, it's like AI right now. AI has been around a long, long, long, long time and the Nvidia
*  processors or GPUs rather, you couldn't predict that now's the time that they were going to be
*  get to that cost effectiveness where, you know, you could do, you could create models and train
*  them. And although it's expensive, it's still doable. You know, we didn't really even, we had
*  ASICs right for custom applications and we had CPUs that were leading the way, but GPUs were more
*  for gaming and then crypto mining. And now then all of a sudden they were the foundation for AI models.
*  So I think luck being essential to becoming a billionaire is a beautiful way to see life
*  in general. First of all, I personally think that everything good that's ever happened to me is
*  because of luck. I think that's just a good way of being. It's like you're grateful. That said,
*  there's some examples of people that you're like, they seem to have done a lot of, they seem to have
*  gotten lucky a lot. You know, we'll mention Jeff Bezos. It seems like he did a lot of really
*  interesting, powerful decisions for many years with Amazon to make it successful.
*  But he was really able to raise money, right? A lot of money and people were really dismissive of
*  him because they weren't making, they weren't profitable. And we were in an environment where
*  it was possible to raise that money. I mean, what about somebody you get sometimes
*  feisty with on the internet, Elon, but we couldn't even look at Zuck and Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
*  Look, Zuck was just trying to get laid, right? And it took off and you wrote some good stuff.
*  Aren't we all at some level, right? Yeah.
*  The foundation of human civilization.
*  Right? But yeah, so more power to them, right? You can't take anything away from them.
*  But yeah, Snapchat, same thing, took off. Apps didn't take off in 2007 when the iPhone came out.
*  Apps took off in 2011, 2012. And if you were there with the right app at the right time,
*  and even Facebook, in 2004, the bubble had burst and the price for computers had fallen
*  enough in kids in school, all needed computers or laptops. If he had tried to do something like that
*  five years early, I mean, he was too young, but five years early or five years later,
*  or Friendster might've been the ultimate, or MySpace.
*  Friendster, I remember Friendster.
*  Or MySpace. I had a MySpace account and that was before Facebook.
*  The timing is important, but there's the details of how the product is built,
*  the fundamentals of the product.
*  But that's what gets you to, when the opportunity is there,
*  that's what allows you to take advantage of that opportunity and the kismet of it all.
*  It wasn't like any of the people I mentioned, there weren't others trying the same thing.
*  You had to be able to see it. You had to be able to visualize it and put together a plan of some
*  sort or at least have a path. Then you had to execute on it and do all those things at the
*  same time and have the money available to you because it wasn't like whether it was Google
*  or Facebook, they raised a shitload of money. It wasn't bootstrapping it that got them there.
*  Raising money is not just about sales. It's about the general feeling of the people with
*  money at that time. And proximity.
*  Oh yeah, sure.
*  If Duck wasn't at Harvard and he was at Miami of Ohio University or he was at Richland Community
*  College, same idea, same person, same execution and nothing.
*  I believe in the power of individuals to find their, to realize their potential no
*  matter where they come from.
*  But I agree. I agree 100% with that, right?
*  But luck is required.
*  Yeah. I mean, scale is the only Delta scale, right?
*  We're not all blessed with the access to the tools that you need to hit that grand slam.
*  But then also billion is not the only measure of success, right?
*  Absolutely not. Everybody defines the success in their own way.
*  How do you define success, Mark Cuban?
*  Waking up every day with a smile, excited about the day.
*  People say, well, when you get that kind of money, does it make you happy?
*  And my answer always is if you were happy when you were broke,
*  you're going to be really, really, really happy when you're rich.
*  But you got to work on being happy when you're broke, I guess.
*  Well, you're just being happy, right?
*  If you were miserable, you know, in your job before, there's a good chance you're
*  still going to be miserable if that's just who you are.
*  That's a pretty good definition of success, by the way.
*  How do you reach a success by way of advice to people?
*  You know, we talked about my dad, my parents.
*  I never looked at my dad and said, okay, you're not successful.
*  He busted his ass. And when he came home, you know,
*  we enjoyed our time together, right?
*  There was nothing at any point in time where I felt like, oh, this is miserable.
*  We're awful. We're, you know, we don't have this.
*  We don't have that.
*  You know, we celebrated the things we did have and
*  never knew about the things we didn't have, you know?
*  And so I think, you know, you have to be able to find your way to whatever it is
*  that puts a smile on your face every day.
*  Some people can do it and some people can't.
*  It's not always about the smile or the smile on the outside.
*  It could be a smile on the inside.
*  Whatever it is, right?
*  Whatever makes you feel good.
*  Even the struggle with your dad, the really, really hard work can be a fulfilling experience
*  because the struggle leading up to then seeing your kids.
*  Exactly right.
*  That was my dad's grand slam.
*  Seeing three kids go to college, be successful, you know, be able to spend time with them.
*  And that was the other thing, you know, he really made me realize
*  is the most valuable asset isn't the money.
*  It's your time.
*  That's why, you know, from a young age, I wanted to retire because I wanted to experience
*  everything that I possibly could in this life.
*  You know, he got joy from us.
*  I get joy from my kids.
*  And that's the most special thing you ever can have.
*  Beautifully said.
*  You have made some mistakes in your life.
*  A lot of them.
*  One of the bigger ones on the financial side, we could say is Uber.
*  Yeah, we call that not doing something.
*  Yeah, it wasn't a mistake.
*  It was just, I mean, it was a mistake.
*  But he tried to.
*  Yeah, I always try to look at mistakes, the things you did that didn't turn out
*  as opposed to things you did to, you know, the negative.
*  But can you tell the story of that?
*  And maybe it's just interesting because it is illustrative of like,
*  how to know when a thing is going to be big and not,
*  and what are the fundamentals of it and how to take the risk and not,
*  and all this kind of stuff.
*  Right.
*  So the backstory of that is Bill Gurley came to me and said,
*  Mark, there's this guy, Travis, that has this company, Red Swoosh,
*  which is a peer-to-peer networking company that I think you can help.
*  And so I invested and would spend a lot of time with Travis.
*  And it's funny because back then that was like 2006.
*  I was an investor at Box.net with Aaron Levy and, oh, there's one other company.
*  But there were three of them where there'd be emails between,
*  you know, where I'd introduce them and we'd all talk in these emails.
*  And they'd all gone to have astronomical success.
*  Right.
*  But so Red Swoosh had its issues, you know, because I was looking at peer-to-peer
*  as kind of stealing bandwidth from the internet providers when bandwidth was a scarce commodity.
*  And so, you know, what Travis did with that though was great.
*  You know, he convinced gaming companies who wanted to do downloads of the clients for
*  those games to use his peer-to-peer and Red Swoosh.
*  And, you know, he busted his ass and I think he sold it for $18 million.
*  So he did well.
*  And so it was natural for him to come to me.
*  And I still have the emails, you know, and asked me about UberCab.
*  And I thought, okay, this is a great idea.
*  I really, really like it.
*  I said, you're going to, and he showed me his budgets and I think they were raising
*  money at 10 or $15 million or whatever.
*  And I'm like, your biggest challenge is going to be you're going to have to fight all the
*  incumbent taxi commissions.
*  They're going to want to put you out of business.
*  That's going to be a challenge.
*  And I think you don't have enough money designated for marketing to get all that done.
*  And I said, I'd invest, but not quite at that valuation, right?
*  Never came back to me.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's some lessons there connected to what you're doing.
*  Now we'll talk about it.
*  Cost plus drugs is like looking at an industry that seems like there's a lot of complexity
*  involved, but it's like hungry for revolution.
*  For sure.
*  And the cabs are that.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  They were dominated by an insulated few.
*  They were not very transparent.
*  You didn't know the intricacies.
*  They were very politically driven and old boy incestuous network.
*  And like I told him, Travis, the best thing about you is you'll run through walls and
*  break down barriers.
*  The bad thing about you is you'll run through walls, even if you don't have to.
*  Yeah.
*  And there you kind of have to see, is it possible to raise enough money?
*  Is it possible to do all this?
*  Is it possible to break through?
*  And it's kind of a fascinating success story with Uber is.
*  I think he tried to go too big.
*  He had too big an ambition, which cost him in the end, not financially and personally,
*  but just in terms of being able to stick it out with them.
*  But that's what makes him a great entrepreneur.
*  Well, it's a fascinating success story.
*  You have certain companies like Airbnb, just kind of go into this thing that we take
*  completely for granted and change it all.
*  Just change it all.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's Linda Johnson, who worked as our general counsel at broadcast.com was Brian's
*  GC and chief operating officer.
*  So yeah, they had a smart, smart, smart, smart team.
*  And they believed in it.
*  And I mean, it's a beautiful story because you're like, all right, all the things that
*  annoy you about this world, like they're inefficient and just seem like pain.
*  And I probably would have said, no, like a lot of people did to Airbnb because I'm like,
*  that's not what people sit in my sleeping in my bed.
*  I would have too.
*  I was like, this is not going to work.
*  I've done like couch surfing and stuff and it was always, it didn't seem right.
*  It didn't seem like you could do this at a large scale monetize it.
*  Yeah, but he did more power to him.
*  In 2000, I think January, you purchased the majority stake in the NBA team Dallas.
*  Mavericks for 285 million.
*  So at this point, maybe you can correct me, but it was one of the worst performing teams
*  in franchise history.
*  It's true.
*  How did you, how did you help turn it around?
*  I had this big tall guy named Dirk Nowitzki and I let him be Dirk Nowitzki.
*  Right.
*  And I got out of the way.
*  But I think more than anything else, there was the turnaround on the business side.
*  And then there was the turnaround, the basketball side.
*  And on the basketball side, I just went in there immediately said,
*  whatever it takes to win, that's what we're going to do.
*  You know, back then they had three or four coaches that were responsible for everything.
*  And I was like, okay, we spend more money training people on PC software than we do
*  developing the most important assets of the business.
*  So I made the decision to go out there and hire like 15 different development coaches,
*  one for each player.
*  And everybody thought I was just insane, but you know,
*  it sent the message that we were going to do whatever it took to win.
*  And once the guys believe that, you know, winning was the goal,
*  as opposed to just making money, attitudes change, effort went up and,
*  you know, the rest is history.
*  So the assets of the business here are the players.
*  The players.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And then on the business side, the first question I asked myself is what business are we in?
*  And I really didn't know the answer immediately,
*  but within the first few months, it was obvious that, you know,
*  the entire NBA thought we were in the business of basketball.
*  We were not.
*  We were in the experience business.
*  When you think about sporting events that you've been to,
*  you don't remember the score.
*  You don't remember the home runs or the dunks.
*  You remember who you're with and you remember why you went.
*  I was my first date with a girl who's now my wife, or I went with my buddies
*  and he threw up on the person in front of us.
*  You know, my dad took me, my aunt, my uncle took me.
*  Those are the experiences you remember.
*  And once I conveyed to our people that this is what we were selling,
*  that what happened in the arena off the court was just as important
*  as what happened on the court, if not more so.
*  Because if, you know, mom or dad are bringing the 10-year-old,
*  you have to keep them occupied because they have short attention spans.
*  And so, you know, I would get into fights with the NBA, you know, put aside the refs,
*  but getting into fights with the NBA, I would say NBA, nothing but attorneys, right?
*  Because they had no marketing skills whatsoever.
*  To their credit, you know, they realized that was a problem
*  and started bringing in better and better and better marketing people.
*  So part of the selling is you're selling the team, selling the sport,
*  selling the people, the idea, all of it, like just the...
*  Well, yeah, the experience.
*  So have you ever been to an NBA game?
*  Miami Heat.
*  Do you remember walking into the arena and you feel the energy, right?
*  That's what makes it special.
*  Yeah, the energy is everything, especially playoff games.
*  Right, for sure, right?
*  And even a regular season game, right?
*  Even against the worst team, you know, that's where we get, you know,
*  because the tickets tend to be a little bit cheaper on the resale market,
*  that's where parents will bring their kids.
*  And so you hear kids screaming the entire game and the parents are thrilled to death, right?
*  They got to do something with your kids.
*  The kids are thrilled to death because they got to see basketball,
*  an NBA game and scream at the top of their lungs.
*  And, you know, if it turns out to be a close game and that ball's in the air,
*  and if it goes in, you know, everybody's hugging and high-fiving people
*  you've never seen before in your life.
*  And if it misses, you're commiserating with people you've never seen before.
*  That's such a unique experience that's unique to sports.
*  And we never sold that.
*  And that's exactly what we started selling.
*  I have to say, like, just going to that game, turn me around on basketball
*  because I'm more of a football guy.
*  So basketball wasn't like the main sport.
*  And I was like, oh, wow, okay.
*  It's fun.
*  The energy was just like...
*  Yeah, the energy in a stadium is completely different than the energy in an arena.
*  You know, you can, you know, in the stadium,
*  particularly if it doesn't have a roof, it's hard to bottle that energy.
*  You feel it and you see...
*  Like, I'm from Pittsburgh, so there's the terrible towels
*  and people screaming defense and everything at Steelers games.
*  But in an arena, the energy level is just indescribable.
*  So how much of it is the selling the tickets in person,
*  but also versus what you see on TV?
*  So when you're owning a team, do you get any other cut for what's shown on TV?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  We, yeah, so there's a TV deal that's done with either a local TV broadcaster
*  and we get all of that or a network broadcaster like ABCC, ESPN, TNT, whatever.
*  And then we get one-thirtieth of that.
*  So what role does the TV play in like turning a team?
*  It keeps fans connected.
*  Look, when a team is doing really well, it's easy, right?
*  There's more viewers, everybody's more excited.
*  And when you're not, it's, you know, there's still going to be hardcore fans
*  and, you know, general fans and kids that like to watch the game.
*  What about like the personality of the people in the stands?
*  Like, I mean, clearly you're part of the legend of the team
*  because you're literally there going wild.
*  Yeah, screaming, yeah, the whole game, right?
*  Yeah, it's funny, you know, the way I am here is how I am,
*  you know, 24 hours a day, unless there's a Mavs game, you know?
*  And for whatever reason, that's where I let out all that stress and frustration.
*  But yeah, I mean, it's not so the fans, you know, the sixth man, right?
*  We need fans to bring that energy and, you know,
*  amplifying that as much as we can is important.
*  You've had a beef recently on Twitter on X with Elon over DEI programs.
*  What to you is the essence of the disagreement there?
*  I wouldn't call it a beef, right?
*  I, it's just-
*  It's a bit of fun?
*  Yeah, it's fun for me, right?
*  I just, you know, it's his platform.
*  He gets to run in any way he please.
*  He pays for that right.
*  And so I have total respect for whatever choices he makes,
*  even if I don't agree with him.
*  But because it's his platform, people are less likely to disagree with him.
*  Particularly somebody who's got a platform themselves.
*  And so when we start talking about DEI and it's just de facto racist and this stuff,
*  stuff that I just think is nonsense, I have no problem, you know, sharing my opinion.
*  And, you know, if he disagrees, okay, he can disagree.
*  I don't care, you know, and it's fun to engage, but he doesn't really engage, you know,
*  he just comes back with snark comments, which is, you know, his choice.
*  Yeah, you in your comments, well, you do a bit of snark too, but-
*  Yeah, a little bit.
*  But you're pretty, let's say rigorous in your response.
*  So there is some exchange of ideas.
*  There's some snark.
*  There's some fun, all that kind of stuff.
*  And you do voice the opinion that represents a large number of people.
*  And it's great.
*  I mean, that's what's, it's really beautiful.
*  But just lingering on the topic, what to you is the good and the bad of DEI programs?
*  Really simple, right?
*  D is diversity.
*  And that means you just expand your pool of potential applicants to people who
*  you might not otherwise have access to.
*  You know, to look where you didn't look before,
*  to look where other people aren't looking for quality employees.
*  That's simple.
*  And the E in equity means when you hire somebody, you put them in a position to succeed.
*  The I in inclusion is when you've hired somebody and they may not be typical, if you will, right?
*  You show them some love and give them the support they need so they can do their job
*  as best they can and feel comfortable and confident going to work.
*  It's that simple.
*  So that's a beautiful ideal.
*  When it's implemented, implemented poorly, perhaps, or in a way that doesn't reach that ideal.
*  Do you see, maybe when it's quota based, do you see that it can result in
*  essentially racism towards Asian people and white people, for example?
*  There's a lot to unpack there, right?
*  So first, you can't do quotas.
*  They're illegal unless you're, and I'm not the lawyer on this subject, but unless you're
*  trying to repair something that's happened in the past, like some discrimination that's
*  happened in the past.
*  So it's not quota based.
*  And I think that's really just kind of a straw man that people put out there.
*  Now, does that mean that there aren't DEI programs that are implemented poorly?
*  Of course not.
*  There are everything that's implemented poorly in one company to another, right?
*  Sales, marketing, human resources.
*  You can pick any element of business and find companies that implement it poorly.
*  But that's the beauty of capitalism in a free market or mostly free market where if you make
*  these choices and they are the wrong choices, you're going to lose your best people.
*  You're not going to be able to hire the best people.
*  You're not going to execute on your business plans in the way that we discussed,
*  regardless of the size of the company.
*  And it also, I think, depends on where you're having the discussion.
*  When I'm in a different group of people off of X, the feedback is completely different.
*  But to your question of reverse racism, yes, it happens.
*  Because people are people.
*  There's no human being that is 100% objective.
*  And it's also, there's very, very, very few jobs that can be determined on a purely quantitative
*  basis, right?
*  How do you tell one janitor from the other who's the best, right?
*  How do you tell one salesperson that you're hiring versus another you're hiring?
*  Because they haven't sold your product yet.
*  So you don't know.
*  We talked earlier about firing people because you made mistakes.
*  And yes, there's discrimination against any group, white, Asian, black, green, orange,
*  whatever it may be.
*  But I truly believe that there's far more discrimination against people of color
*  than there are people who are white.
*  And I think it's become a straw man that reverse discrimination because of DEI
*  is prevalent or near ubiquitous.
*  Well, much of American history was defined by intense radical racism and sexism.
*  But in the recent years, there was a correction.
*  And I think the nature of the criticism is that there's an overcorrection where DEI
*  programs, the universities, the companies are often when they're not doing their job
*  well, are often hard to criticize.
*  Because when you criticize them within the company or so on, they have a very strong
*  immune system.
*  If you criticize a DEI program, it seems like it's very easy to be called racist.
*  And if you're called racist or sexist, that's a sticky label.
*  So you're getting into the culture of organizations, right?
*  And leadership within organizations and accepting any type of criticism, put aside DEI.
*  When I criticized the referees at the NBA, I got fined, right?
*  That was their option.
*  I knew what I was getting into, right?
*  Not that they're completely analogous, but it's cause and effect.
*  If I'm in a major company and I'm publicly criticizing or even internally criticizing
*  a sales plan or a product, our product sucks, right?
*  Or like there was a Google engineer that got fired for saying Google had AGI, right?
*  And nobody believed they did and they knew that created problems.
*  It wasn't DEI related, but it was saying something publicly that was in the CEO's
*  eyes to the detriment of the company, right?
*  So I think those are all analogous.
*  If you're trying to accomplish something within an organization because you think
*  there's a problem and there's people speaking out saying, look, we're getting it wrong.
*  I think I'm a victim of all this and the company, right?
*  Then leadership has got to make a decision.
*  Do they agree or not agree?
*  Are they right or are they wrong?
*  Is it positive or negative to the company?
*  And you decide.
*  So this conversation that conservatives are being silenced in organizations now,
*  I haven't seen it.
*  And then the other side of your question, I think I'm packing it, is
*  what's driving all this?
*  Put aside universities for one, in corporate America.
*  When I talk to people in corporate America about DEI, they always start talking about ideology,
*  right?
*  And like I talked to Bill Ackman, who you've had on, right?
*  And when I asked him, well, Bill, you run your own companies.
*  Who's telling you what to do?
*  They are.
*  Who's they?
*  Well, it's the universities, the people who have this ideology of DEI.
*  I'm like, did they force you?
*  Did they coerce you?
*  Did you lose control of your company?
*  No, it's not me.
*  It happens to other people.
*  Then I talk to other people.
*  Same thing.
*  So I get, try not to go one-on-one and tip Twitter conversations on this topic.
*  So in the DMs, I'll talk to people who are really conservative and I'll ask the same question.
*  And be like, well, who's forcing you to do this?
*  Well, it's the ideology that's everywhere.
*  You see it.
*  Didn't you see the Harvard thing, you know, in University of North Carolina?
*  I'm like, I've never had anybody try to push me in this direction to do this.
*  This was my business choice.
*  I'm not trying to tell other people you have to do this.
*  You make your own business choices.
*  And so where companies have made their business choices,
*  and if somebody doesn't feel confident or comfortable with it,
*  they may feel they're being discriminated against.
*  There was something I just read in the Wall Street Journal.
*  Where the Wall Street Journal had a company interview 2 million people, right?
*  And the difficulty in firing and how people, when they were fired,
*  40% of the people who were fired felt like it was wrong that they were doing a great job.
*  Yet they then have talked about the HR person going through the hassle of
*  trying to explain to this person through performance reviews
*  that they weren't doing a good job.
*  Yet the people still thought they were doing a great job,
*  despite being told they're not doing a good job.
*  So I see that as being an analogous to all this huffing and puffing about
*  reverse discriminations and conservatives not being able to speak up.
*  Because if 40% of people who have been fired don't believe they should have been fired,
*  there's a disconnect somewhere in how you think you're doing your job.
*  And if you just feel like, I can't speak up because of it,
*  because you're white and that doesn't comport well with DEI programs,
*  a lot of things are going to happen, right?
*  Either you're going to, that's going to come up in your performance review,
*  HR or your boss is going to have to address it in some way.
*  It's going to get to HR at some level and then decisions are going to have to be made.
*  And you can't just fire somebody because they spoke up, right?
*  Somebody's going to have to communicate with you.
*  And so I think a lot of, I just don't trust the supposed volume that
*  people say is happening at versus everything I've read and seen.
*  And when I talk to people in positions of authority within organizations
*  and ask them who's forcing them to implement these ideologies, nobody says,
*  nobody says yes, that there is somebody.
*  But on Twitter, it sounds great.
*  It is true for conservatives, but in general, you can sell books, you can get likes.
*  When you talk about this ideology and there's a degree to which is this woke ideology in the
*  room with us right now. Meaning like it's this boogie monster that we're all kind of.
*  Or is it a positive?
*  I guess another way to say that is they don't highlight a lot of the positive progress that's
*  been made in the positive version of the word woke in terms of correcting some of the wrongs
*  done in the past. So, but that said, you know, if you ask people in Russia, a lot of them will
*  say there is no propaganda here. There's no censorship and all that kind of stuff.
*  It's sometimes hard to see when you're in it that this kind of is happening.
*  It does seem difficult to criticize DEI programs, not horribly difficult, terrible.
*  They're this monster that infiltrates everything, but it is difficult and requires great leadership.
*  So where have you criticized it and been condemned? Academic or?
*  Academic.
*  Academic. Yeah. Okay.
*  Academic. Let's two different worlds.
*  Companies and academic. Yeah.
*  Two different worlds.
*  But I also think it's not, I really want to point my finger at the failure of leadership
*  of basically firing mediocre people, like people that are not good at their job.
*  The problem to me is DEI defense mechanism, like immune system is so strong that the shitty
*  people don't get fired. So the vision, the ideal of DEI is a beautiful ideal. It's just like.
*  Well, maybe it's because I'm an entrepreneur when I see an ideal that, you know, you try to
*  implement it and support it and get to that point, but universities and companies are night and day
*  different, right? I can see an argument for the ideology in a university. I can see, you know,
*  you look at the amount of money spent on it. And so while the goal is right,
*  the way they implement it in universities, the way they implement most things in universities is
*  wrong, right? There's a reason why tuition has gone up, you know, a multitude of, or a multiple of
*  inflation. They're not well run organizations across the board. So I'm not going to argue
*  with that at all. So when you've seen me argue with DEI, I haven't waded into DEI in universities
*  at all. So it's mostly focused on companies. 100%, right? Because that's where I exist.
*  But at the same time, like I read Christopher Rufro's book where he talks about the kind of
*  the genealogy of wokeism and ideology. But then he gets to the point, and I hope I'm remembering
*  this right, where he says that the response to it is decentralized activism, if you will. That's not
*  the word he used to try to counter that DEI. And that seems to me to be counter to the whole
*  conservative movement right now, right? Other than school boards, right? Where it's centralized and,
*  you know, the Republican candidate is all about centralized power in him. And, you know, I, to me,
*  that's just a conflict and a lot of the underpinning of this, of the whole DEI conversation that
*  a lot of, a lot of which goes through Christopher Rufro right now.
*  Let's continue on a theme of fun exchanges on the internet. So Elon tweeted,
*  the fundamental axiomatic flaw of the woke mind virus is that the weaker party is always right,
*  in parentheses, even if they want you to die. And you responded at length, but the beginning is
*  the fundamental axiomatic flaw of the anti-woke mind is that it allows groups with historical
*  power to play the victim by taking anecdotal examples and packaging them into conjured
*  conspiratorial ideology that threatens to upend the power structures they have been depending on.
*  So, uh, well, there's a tension there. So yes, but both can be abused, right? Both positions of
*  power can be abused. There's power in DEI and there's shitty people that can crave power and
*  hold onto power and sacrifice their ideals. Okay. Put aside universities. Okay. Damn it.
*  Yeah. I mean, I, because I'm not going to argue that universities implement DEI well, right? And
*  I'm not going to tell you that, um, you know, they need to be spending 20 some million dollars a year
*  on DEI positions. To me, that's insane. Um, do I look at the Harvard and North Carolina decision
*  and say it was a great decision? No, because, you know, I think having a diverse student body
*  helps make for, um, kids who are better prepared for the real world, but I'm not running a university.
*  So it's not my choice. Maybe at some point in the future I will, but not now. Um, and in terms of
*  the corporate side of it, who's telling anybody what to do?
*  Well, maybe you can give me some help. Sure. I'm here to help you. Like,
*  there's an example in the AI world of, uh, a system called Gemini. Yeah. I mean,
*  everybody was black or whatever people of color, George Washington was black. Nazis were black.
*  So why, why is it when that came out, it was a big uproar, but when somebody re so who,
*  oh, who was it? One of the people who are trying to fuck with me. Um, I forget which one, um,
*  there's so many, but, um, he pointed out to, um, Elon that Grok, Elon's AI was woke when it
*  answered certain questions and other people have pointed out other things to Elon about Grok,
*  Grok, whatever the however is pronounced. Um, that was leaning left or woke, right?
*  And Elon's response was, oh, it'll change. It's a mistake. We're fixing it.
*  When it happens to Gemini and Google, it's the end of the world. Look how woke they are. And it's
*  reflection of all their culture. Now Google comes out and says, this is a mistake. And then they
*  docs the guy, um, who is the product manager or whatever of AI of that product, um, who, and then
*  they go back and look at his old tweets, right? And show that he's very left leaning and very,
*  you know, DEI supportive. And that's the end of the world. It's not the end of the world, but,
*  uh, Google's so much, uh, dependent on trust that trust that Google search has as objective as
*  possible, um, channel into the world of information. And so that brand is really important.
*  Yeah. So you're, you're over, you're giving them too much power. Um, and maybe I'm not recognizing
*  the power, right? So I'll tell you a personal experience, um, up until a month ago, maybe,
*  if you put in keto gummies, shark tank, keto gummies into Google, it would show up with
*  scammy ads, scam ad after schema. And I would get emails, um, up until a month ago from
*  elderly people asking me why the gummies weren't working and why the companies were charging, um,
*  all this money on a month by month basis when they tried to cancel. And they said it was the
*  number one deal on shark tank of all time, right? And all shark, right. It was a mistake.
*  Well, there's fraud, there's mistakes, but the mistakes.
*  No, but why didn't Google fix it? Right. The distance didn't happen once over one week,
*  over two weeks. Right. And because it was hard to fix. As it turns out, I was working with them to
*  try to find a fix and we would both look at the same page. And if you were inside of Google within
*  the do Google.com domain, it would show one page. If you were outside of Google, it would show
*  another. And it took us looking at it at the same time for anybody to realize it, meaning that
*  there's a lot of technology problems that are hard to fix. They're super complex and we could talk
*  about it forever with social media. The criticism towards Google, towards other companies when
*  they're based in Silicon Valley, there could be an ideological drift into, um, a ideological bubble
*  out of which the technology is created and they could be blind to the obvious bias. That's, that's
*  Yeah, but they've got billions of customers who are not going to, but so what you're saying is
*  the free market stops with artificial intelligence, that people don't pay attention and respond that
*  Google doesn't listen to the responses that people inside of Google will ignore their own
*  best financial interest and even their own best personal interest. Cause they know they're going
*  to get docs now on, on by Elon and others. And so I just don't see that. And, and, and Elon's not
*  allowed to make those same mistakes, but allowed to make those mistakes, but Google isn't.
*  Oh, I know. Elon is 100% should be criticized for, for the ridiculousness of overstatements that he
*  makes about various products. He's having a bit of fun like you are also. Uh, but, and I also believe
*  in the free market, but it's not, it's not always efficient. You know, there's like a delay. It just
*  takes time. Yeah, it's fine. So which is why Elon is important when calling out, I think overstating
*  the criticism of Gemini, but Elon and others are just Gemini wasn't even a fully available
*  public product yet. It's still a bias that resonates with people. That's the way neural
*  networks work though. Right. That's why there'll be millions of models because weights and biases,
*  putting together, you know, a neural network, but no. So like the, the, the black George Washington
*  is an, is a correction on top of the foundation model. So to keep it quote unquote,
*  sort of safe. One of the big criticisms of all the models, frankly, probably even grok a little
*  bit less. So is there, they're like trying to be really conservative in this, in the sense of
*  trying to be careful not to say crazy shit because you don't know how the thing brand new and we know
*  what happens. Right. And they do it on the front end with prompts and they try to do it on the
*  back end with the neural networks that are underneath them. Right. And it doesn't always
*  work. And that's why there's going to be millions of models rather than just, you know, four
*  foundational models that ever five that everybody uses. Well, I guess the main criticism is you want
*  to have some transparency of all the teams that are involved. And that this kind of, to the degree
*  there's a left leaning ideology within the companies, it doesn't affect the product,
*  but that's the beauty of the free market. Yeah. That's where the market corrects it. Right.
*  And not only from the outside, because everybody, you know, is going to test it. Like when YouTube
*  first came out, we're not first came out when after Google bought them, used to be able, there
*  used to be different commands you could give it, right. There were line prompt commands that you
*  could give it. And you could find all the nasty porn that got loaded before the, they, they kicked
*  it off. Right. Right. And it was just the nastiest shit ever. And even now to this day,
*  if there's some horrific, tragic event, somebody's loading it up. Right. Yeah. No, I know that's not
*  direct to your point of internal influence to the output. Right. But people on the outside are going
*  to check for that now. Right. It's almost like the new bug contest, right. To try to find bugs and
*  software. And then on the inside, if it's all left leaning and all you have is left leaning employees,
*  because, you know, most conservatives won't want to work there then again, that's self correcting
*  as well. That's the hope, but it can self correct in different kinds of ways. You can have a different
*  company that competes and becomes more conservative. I mean, my worry is that it's kind of becomes like
*  two different worlds where there's like already is the look. No, come on. Don't give up. Oh, I'm not
*  giving up. So where does this go is the question. Yeah. Right. What, what happens next? And I mean,
*  going back, I mean, I've been in so many PC revolutions, right. Or evolutions where
*  porn was the big issue. Right. Now we don't even talk about porn being an issue, even though,
*  you know, if every, every post on Twitter now has, you know, Lincoln bio for a porn post, right. We
*  don't even think that's, that's a negative anymore. That's just an accepted thing. And now it's become
*  very, um, where your politics on, on Twitter. But again, as you extend that and things grow,
*  as AI models become more efficient and trainable on less for a lot less money, or even locally on
*  a PC or a phone, we're all going to have our own models and there's going to be millions and millions
*  and millions of models and not just foundational models. Now maybe opens, maybe they're built some
*  an open source, maybe, you know, um, it'll be copy pasta where you can just cut and paste and
*  create your own model and train it yourself. Maybe it'll be mixed mixture of experts where,
*  you know, maybe it'll be a meta front end. Like we're working on a project where we take 30
*  different AI models and there's just a meta search engine where it searches all of them and you can
*  compare all the outputs and see what you think is the best kind of like a search engine, right.
*  Because you might get, is DEI good, right? You know, is the COVID vaccine good, right?
*  You're going to get a variety of, of, of, um, outputs and you have to make that decision
*  yourself. That's what I think is going to happen with AI as well, because I think brands,
*  there's no way the Mayo Clinic and the Harvard medical school are just going to contribute all
*  their IP to chap GPT or Gemini or whatever they're going to, it's going to have to be licensed or
*  they're going to do their own. Yeah. I mean, that's a very hopeful message, but that said,
*  you know, uh, human history doesn't always auto correct really quickly, self correct really
*  quickly. Sometimes you get into this very painful things. You have, you have Stalin,
*  you have Hitler, you can get to places very quickly where the ideological thing just builds on itself
*  Twitter is not real world. You know, there's, there's 20s, it's not real world. That's true.
*  Yes. But you can still have a nation captured by an ideology. I think America has been really good
*  at having these two blue and red, always at attention with each other, dividing the populace
*  and in the process of doing that, figuring stuff out, like almost like a playing devil's advocate,
*  but like in real life. And that's, that's fair. And that's right. You know, as opposed to Pravda
*  telling you everything you want to know, right. And everybody believing it because there's control
*  of everything. Right. And so going back to what you said earlier, people in Russia don't think
*  it, you know, invading Ukraine, it's, it's, you know, a lot of them see it as a positive, right.
*  I'm sure you have relatives and friends who think, you know, it's the best thing to ever happen,
*  right. Cause they believe in Putin. They're denazifying Ukraine. They're removing the Nazis
*  because that's exactly what Putin said. And, you know, we don't have one uniform
*  media outlet. That's the difference. Even though people like to talk about mainstream media as
*  being the source of a lot of the friction, there is no such thing as mainstream media anymore.
*  You know, Fox is the biggest cable news channel with the biggest audience and they call everybody
*  else mainstream media. You know, it's insane. The things that we accept from our sources of
*  information. To me, that's the bigger problem. The bigger problem is trying to figure out what
*  is free speech and what is the line of tolerance for free speech. And at what point does hateful
*  free speech crowd out other, other people, right? Putin's the master of that. He, you're going to
*  jail or you're going to be dead if you disagree, right? No, God help us if we ever get to that
*  point here. But the person who controls the algorithm controls the world, right? And if you
*  are committed to one specific platform as your singular source of information or affiliated
*  platforms, then whoever controls the algorithm or the programming there controls you in a lot
*  of respects. And I think that's where our biggest problem has been. We get people attached to
*  specific platforms and apps and media outlets and they become part of that team and they identify
*  as such and either you're part of the team or you're not. And that to me is the fundamental
*  problem. It's not woke ideology because I never felt any pressure to make the choices that I've
*  choice that I've chosen in, you know, including diversity, equity and inclusion. And I've never
*  forced anybody or told anybody to do it. I just said, here's my experiences.
*  Whenever I've talked to people who talk about the woke ideology, no one ever got forced. I mean,
*  if you look at Dylan McDermott, right? If there was a way to gauge the number of impressions that
*  she had, right? And where they source from, I'd be willing to bet any amount of money that 90% plus
*  of the impressions and discussions of Dylan McDermott were on right leaning media.
*  Several things actually, let's even go there. You've gotten a bit of a beef with, again, fun
*  with Jordan Peterson about this. That's the guy whose name I couldn't think of, yeah.
*  So the topic there was the gender transition and Dylan Mulvaney. Can you explain the nature of the
*  beef? I mean, it's an interesting claim you're making that most of the people who are concerned
*  about this are conservatives. Yeah, just the point is that if you looked at impressions,
*  when you run an ad, you're curious about impressions and who sees them, right?
*  But if you look at the impressions related to Dylan McDermott, like I just said, I'd bet 90%
*  or more were in conservative media. And I don't know how many followers she had, 250,000 followers
*  or whatever when the Bud Light ad came out. And if it weren't for Kid Rock shooting at Dylan
*  McDermott Bud Light cans, she'd be long forgotten. Yeah, but most of the people that care about
*  censorship are going to be free speech advocates. So most people that care about Putin suppressing
*  speech or anybody else suppressing speech are going to be libertarians. So there's probably
*  an explanation of that. The criticism that Jordan Peterson could provide, I guess he said that
*  Dylan Mulvaney popularized the kind of mutilation in his view. They can affect, there's a very
*  serious life changing process that a person goes through. And when that's applied to a child,
*  it can do a lot of harm to a person. But my point still holds. I don't know how many kids
*  were following, and you can look at the followers list. It's not like it's hidden, right? Back then,
*  if they had 250,000 followers and now we're on TikTok, where he might get 50 some thousand
*  views or likes, right? I don't know how many views, but likes. I've never seen any evidence
*  that Dylan McDermott influenced people to transition their gender. As he transitioned to her,
*  it was documented on TikTok over the course of a year. And again, when you go back and look at the
*  views on those TikToks, it wasn't enormous. Yeah, but the trends start. It could be,
*  whereas for young kids, there to be a trend of, especially when you feel like an outsider,
*  you feel not yourself, less than yourself, all this kind of stuff that kids feel like,
*  that if it's popular enough as a trend, you would gender transition
*  without meaning to do that. It's just part of a trend. That's the worry that has a big stretch,
*  right? To think that all the things that have to happen before you transition gender, right?
*  And I'm not saying kids might identify, you know, find it cool or, you know, in the moment,
*  expedient, if you will, to dress up as the other gender. Great. Who cares, right? But to go through
*  the actual physical transition, I don't remember what the numbers were that I read, but I do
*  remember that the latest numbers that came out in terms of transitioning were from JAMA, which is a
*  medical association that said from 2021 to 2022, the numbers went down. But the bigger point is,
*  there are no numbers for 2023 when post Dylan McDermott. So there's no way to know if the
*  assertion is true, even marginally true. Now, you can easily suggest it, right? But you can say that
*  about any social media influencer, right? You know, kids are dying because, you know, I mean,
*  it's just like when people accuse Trump of potentially influencing people to, you know,
*  inject bleach into their veins. You can't, you know, that's a big old leap to say that because
*  you know, Trump says it, that people are going to start invest, you know, injecting, and then they
*  find somebody who actually did and it's like, Oh, it must be true. You know, this is a trend now.
*  I just, I'm just not buying it that there aren't enough roadblocks in the way. Now, I'm not saying
*  it never happens, right? And I, and for me, to me, you should have to wait until you're 18 to actually
*  have any surgery to transition. And if your parents approve it earlier, then you can have
*  a conversation with your doctor. But you're suggesting that everybody in that process
*  to go to transition a minor is corrupt. That the doctor, the sociologist, the psychologist,
*  all the people involved, the hospital where the surgery is happening, the insurance company that's
*  paying for it, they all have been corrupted by this trend. I just don't see that.
*  Well, not corrupted, but you know, people, uh, it's back to the DEI thing that could be pressure
*  and we are pressure to operate. So think about all the people who have to be complicit
*  to do an operation. It's not complicit like evil complicit. It's no, it is evil complicit, right?
*  Because somebody docked in hospitals right now, they won't perform abortions because of state law
*  and Alabama, they stopped IVF treatment immediately after that, um, ruling by that judge,
*  right? The Q Anon judge to think that they're not going to pay attention to the possible
*  consequences of being the hospital that does transgender that are, that gives doctors operating
*  rights there and not be, um, aware of the risks associated with it and double check. To me,
*  that's just insane. They're risking their entire business and livelihood and personal relationships
*  for not checking that this 14 year old, you know, boy who wants to be a girl or vice versa
*  is there waiting for, for surgery that I just don't see that in America. Yes. But if we look
*  at humans in general and Jordan Peterson, I think unjustly incorrectly brought up Auschwitz.
*  Yeah, that was, that was ridiculous. But if we look to me, world war two is a very interesting
*  time. It does reveal a lot about human nature and that humans are able to commit atrocities
*  without really speaking up. The point I want to make is that when you're in this situation where
*  everybody is around, around you is committing an atrocity. You can be sort of the good German
*  and, and yeah, but I mean, human nature is such that you can do that. That is in a time of war.
*  Yeah, but it's still human nature. It's interesting to remember that war when you feel like
*  there's nationalism, patriotism, everything that comes up in Russia, right? You know,
*  the moms of the kids sent to be, you know, sent to Ukraine who didn't come back in Russia feel
*  certainly different than the, the everyday Russian who's just taking, you know, whatever
*  information that's available from a unified controlled media. Yeah. But you know, we should
*  remember human nature. It's interesting. I'm not just missing human nature at all, but
*  there's a difference. I think that human nature, self-preservation influences those decisions.
*  There's nothing about self-preservation involved in DEI, wokeness, you know, transgenderism to
*  compare it to Auschwitz. That's insane. Yeah. Well, that comparison is almost always, probably
*  always is insane comparison between anything and the Holocaust. I agree. I think there's a name for
*  that role, but once you bring up Hitler, the conversation ends. I do appreciate you bringing
*  up Trump and bleach as an example. So continuing on fun exchanges between you and Elon, you said,
*  if they were having Biden's last wake and it was him versus Trump and he was being given last
*  rights, I would still vote for Biden to which Elon replied, caricaturing you, if Biden were a
*  flesh eating zombie with five seconds to live or upon being reelected, Earth would plunge into a
*  1000 years of darkness. I would still vote for him. That's basically quoting you, but in a
*  caricature and you responded. Well, I have your attention. Wanted to say thank you. Your consultants
*  at Tesla followed up about using cost plus drugs, about which we'll talk about to save the company
*  money truly appreciated. And in parentheses, my limit is 300 years of darkness. Very well done,
*  Mark. What's your intuition if we just stick on Biden and Trump for a sec, what's your intuition
*  why Biden would make a better president than Trump? Look at it at the basics, right? If you look at the
*  people he's hired, there hasn't been any turnover in his cabinet at all. If you look at the people
*  he's hired over the course of his career or while he was vice president in particular,
*  there's nobody who turned on him and came out and written books and made public statements about how
*  he's bad for the country. Now compare that to Trump, the people closest to him, almost all of them turn
*  unless there's a financial relationship involved. And to me, that says everything. The dynamics of
*  the team is important to you. If you're going to be the most powerful person in the world,
*  you better know how to manage and lead. And that's not to say Biden hasn't made a lot of mistakes.
*  I mean, immigration to border is a horrific mistake. And hopefully he recognizes that. And I
*  don't like the fact that he doesn't admit his mistakes and just say, okay, I got to fix it,
*  or I made a mistake in Afghanistan, whatever it may be. The position of commander in chief and
*  president, you're going to make mistakes. Then I look at the other guy, never miss a mistake,
*  and the list is long. What do you think about the immigration situation? A lot of conservatives
*  are using that. The theory is that the reason it's happening is because they would be able to
*  illegally vote. That's insane. For Biden. Yeah, you can't be an illegal immigrant and vote.
*  And now in a lot of states, because of the conservatives, they've passed laws saying you
*  have to show identification. When I voted in Texas, you had to show state identification.
*  They can't vote. You can't register as an illegal alien that I'm aware of to vote.
*  Yeah, but of course that story really worries me,
*  enables or serves as a catalyst for questioning the legitimacy of an election.
*  Questioning the legitimacy of an election.
*  I remember going to the debate with Trump in 2016. He was debating Clinton and one of the things he
*  said was, we don't even know if this election will be legitimate if I lose. This was in 2016
*  before he was even elected and that was where he was going. That's just what he does. He's never
*  admitted a mistake. The guy's failed a zillion times. Most people say, okay, I learned from him.
*  I read a book about Roy Cohen and Roy Cohen was the ultimate deny, deny, deny and that was one of
*  Trump's mentors. And you can see almost everything Roy Cohen ever did in the same way that Donald
*  Trump approaches things. But given how drastic the immigration situation is, that story becomes more
*  believable. Yeah, of course it does. But the facts are still the facts. And in red states,
*  they're going to be checking every ID. They're going to be making sure that's not the case.
*  And you can also make the argument, well, in the blue state, it doesn't matter. In the swing states,
*  they're still going to be checking because they know Trump is going to sue the shit out of them
*  when he loses. And so again, that's where people will take those self-preservation steps to keep
*  their job and do the right thing. There's still enough people who believe in this country and how
*  amazing it is to do the right thing. And a lot of the premise of what some conservatives are saying
*  and doing, the underpinning of it is that their fellow citizens will not do anything, not some
*  things, anything that serves the best interest of this country. And to me, that's just wrong.
*  That is just misleading and wrong. I just worry about, I don't care about Trump or Biden.
*  I care about democracy. I just worry about the viral nature of the idea of this illegal immigrants.
*  But it's very functional. There's a thousand different ways, an unlimited number of ways
*  to enter the United States of America undetected. And the South border where it's the easiest and
*  the worst. And Biden needs to take steps to reduce that. Remember, when Biden was vice president and
*  Obama was president, they called Obama the deporter in chief. He had no problem deporting people.
*  And I think if I had to guess, and this is just a guess, that when they looked at the initial
*  statistics for immigration, when Biden took over, they thought there was room for more immigrants,
*  not because they would vote, but you can make a fiscal argument that in a world where the
*  birth rate is flat to declining, we need immigrants. And immigrants typically don't
*  have a higher crime rate or anything than indigenous American citizens. Indigenous isn't
*  the right word, but American citizens. And so they made a calculated mistake. They made a decision
*  that was wrong and now they have to fix it or it's going to hurt them severely. But I don't buy,
*  like what Elon's pushing that the whole reason is they are voters and will become voters.
*  And we should say the obvious, you're a descendant of immigrants. And the immigrants is what makes
*  this country great in many parts of the diversity of this nation. And we should probably keep the
*  people that are like already been in this country for a while and are killing it, like PhD students
*  and all this. That's not what Donald Trump wants though. He wants to ship them all out. Right?
*  There's just a whole lot of hyperbole when it comes to talking to all about talking about all
*  of these things we're talking about. When it's right versus left, my team versus your team,
*  my tribe versus your tribe, the only way to stand out is hyperbole. The hard part,
*  and why I like this conversation is how do you distinguish hyperbole versus reality?
*  And I get where you're going Lex, where it's like what the smallest spark sometimes can cause
*  people to change and then that spark becomes bigger and then it becomes more widespread.
*  And then all of a sudden your country has changed. It's not what you thought it was.
*  I get that completely. Right? And yes, you always have to be on top of that to make sure.
*  But a lot of that comes from lack of leadership, right? And lack of trust. Because there's nobody
*  who's saying, all right, the Republicans, that's all hyperbole and you're wrong for that. Democrats,
*  you fucked up on immigration, right? You fucked up in Afghanistan, right? Here's where you made
*  these mistakes, own it. There's nobody who says, right, we're not going to just bring in Republicans
*  if the Republicans win. And then, you know, and there's nobody who says we're not going to
*  just bring in Democrats. We're going to bring in a mix, right? We're going to try to get balance
*  on the Supreme Court. There's just, there's no leadership that's doing it. That's the fundamental
*  problem. It's not about the ideology of woke. It's not the, no leadership.
*  Yeah, leadership. And yeah, there's, it's just, whatever systems we've created,
*  it's really frustrating that if you don't like Trump, it's really is Trump's arrangement
*  syndrome. Like he's the, he's definitely Hitler. If you don't like Biden, he's seen a lizard person.
*  Right.
*  Everybody gets labeled, right? And because that works on social media. That, look, if Elon
*  changed the algorithm just by taking himself out of it, seriously, I'm not saying don't post,
*  right? Post all you want. But he, you know, if you look at his followers, they're almost all
*  right leaning. If you look at the people he engages with positively, they're almost all
*  right leaning. And if you look at the people he engages with negatively, like me, right,
*  I consider myself an independent, but I lean left on the DEI topic. Right. That influences
*  the algorithm. And so you see what you see because of what he says. Yeah. Well, I mean,
*  for sure. But the, the, there could be a lot of influential people
*  on Twitter that influence the algorithm and all that kind of stuff. I do feel it's not even
*  about ideology where you lean. It's about like the algorithm, not prioritizing drama, like the,
*  the, the attention grabbing thing or the lower lizard version of that,
*  or like people just want the drama. They want to tear it out.
*  When I last read through all the stuff on, on, on their algorithm, right? Maybe it's changed.
*  Whoever has the biggest account and gets engagement on that account influences what people see the
*  most. Yeah. I mean, that's interesting. I don't know if that's to a degree that's true. They,
*  they've pretty rigorous description of what's, um, of the way the algorithm works. It's actually
*  kind of fascinating. There's a clustering of people based on the interest, right? But I think they
*  call it the nearest neighbor, right? Approach. And I think that's what they do. And so whoever
*  has the biggest account has the most neighbors who in turn have their neighbors, who in turn have
*  their neighbors. And that's how they discern what comes next. But there's a clustering still. So
*  like, if you don't give a shit about Elon, you're not following them. Yeah. You're not going to
*  have an influence. When you get a break, just create a burner account on Twitter and see what,
*  who they recommend to you. And not just Elon. I mean, the people that Elon likes, and I'm saying
*  that's not Elon saying add this person, add this person, and suggest this person, this person,
*  this person. I'm saying that's what the algorithm is. Yeah. There should be transparency around that
*  for sure. There is. There is. That's the whole point, right? He knows there's transparency
*  and he knows the impact. That's why when I say take yourself out of the algorithm,
*  right? Don't include his account. That changes, I think, the output of the algorithm.
*  Well, when he wasn't owning Twitter, he was one of the biggest accounts, if not the biggest account
*  already. It wasn't, but still like even like the Kim, well, the Kim Kardashian accounts, whatever,
*  right? It was, it wasn't open source to Elon's credit it is now. So I couldn't see it to know,
*  right? So I didn't get the sense one way or the other of one element being dominant over the other.
*  But obviously conservators felt that that left leaning was more dominant back then.
*  Yeah. I would love to see numbers on all of this. Yeah. You'll be fun.
*  DI, everything like this. Sometimes anecdotal data really frustrates me. It frustrates me
*  primarily because of how sexy it is. People just love a story and I'm like, God damn it. This is
*  not science. This is, this is not even common sense. Well, no, I think anecdotal stories often
*  have a wisdom in them. No doubt, right? There's something to be gained from seeing them.
*  There's a signal there, but like how representative is that signal of the broader thing?
*  There's a whole lot more noise than signal more often than not.
*  All right. So as I mentioned, cost plus drugs, there's so many questions I can ask you, but
*  what's the big question? What's broken about our healthcare system?
*  There's no transparency. And when the lack of transparency leads to lack of trust.
*  And when you can't trust the healthcare system other than maybe your doctor,
*  that's a broken system. So what aspect of the system does cost plus drugs is trying to solve?
*  So the thing we're trying to solve for is trust. And the way we feel we get there is through
*  complete transparency. So when you go to cost plus drugs.com and you put in the name of the
*  medication, if it's one of the 2,500 and growing that we carry, we will first show you our costs,
*  what we actually pay for it. Then we'll show you our 15% markup. Then we'll show the pharmacy fill
*  fee and shipping, and that's your total price. And that alone, that transparency alone is
*  completely revolutionizing how drugs are priced in America today. And it's led to research being
*  done comparing our pricing to CMS and ours being cheaper than even the government is negotiating,
*  et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And so just that transparency alone has had an impact and saved
*  millions of people hundreds of millions of dollars or more.
*  Maybe it results in more transparency in other parts of the system too, seeing the business of
*  it. What do the so-called middlemen companies, so the PBMs?
*  Pharmacy benefit managers.
*  Thank you. CVS Caremark, Cigna Express Scripts, and United Health OptumRx.
*  They control majority of the market. What do they do wrong?
*  They put profits over everything, right? And they know in an industry that's completely opaque,
*  they can pretty much do what they want and nobody gets to see what they're doing in detail.
*  And so the first thing when you sign a contract with one of those big PBMs is says,
*  you can't disclose any of this. And the fact that you can't be disclosed means they could tell
*  Lex's company that they're getting a great price and they're only being charged X.
*  And they can tell Mark's company, oh, you're getting a great price and we're charging Mark
*  X plus, right? But Mark doesn't know any better because there's no way to know.
*  The markup is not transparent.
*  The cost isn't transparent. The markup isn't transparent. And there's different things.
*  I was just talking to a company in a presentation a couple of days ago,
*  and they took the step to leave the big three PBMs to go to a rebate free PBM that was smaller.
*  And what they said led to the decision. They had a contract with the PBM for these things called
*  rebates, right? Where depending on the volume of medications you buy, they'll kick back to you
*  a percentage of them. And as it turns out, when they compared what was contracted for to what
*  they actually got, they were getting underpaid every single year. They just don't care, right?
*  They'll take products. There's a drug called Humira, right? And it is the number one revenue
*  drug in the country. And there's also a biosimilar, multiple biosimilars, but one we carry called
*  Usimri. And Humira, the pre-rebate price is about $8,000 per month. And after rebates,
*  depending on the size of the company, it'll be anywhere from $3,000 to $6,000 a month.
*  You can go to get your doctor to prescribe that biosimilar, Usimri, and you pay $594.
*  But those big three PBMs won't allow their clients to get Usimri because they don't get a rebate on
*  Usimri. So they'd rather keep a drug on their formulary, even though their patients would save,
*  their customers would save a lot of money. They'd rather keep a drug and exclude another because
*  they'll make a lot more money. So the CVS Caremark spokesperson, I think responded to you,
*  Phil Blando with the usual language that so deeply exhausts me, but I was wondering if there's any
*  truth to it. Employers, unions, health plans, and government programs work with CVS Caremark
*  precisely because we deliver for them lower drug costs, better health outcomes, and broad pharmacy
*  access through our true cost, cost, vantage, and choice formulary initiatives. We are the
*  leading agent of change, innovation, and transparency in the market. That's a whole lot of nothing.
*  So they are not transparent. No. No. Call them up. You go to Cost Plus Drugs, we'll give you our
*  price list of every, all 2,500 plus drugs. The actual cost. The actual cost and what we sell it
*  for because it's just a plus 15%. Call up any of the big three companies and ask them for the same
*  thing. They're going to laugh at you. It's so bad. In fact, if you do business with them right now
*  and you just ask for your claims data, meaning how many people use Humira that we're paying,
*  what are we paying for it? They won't even give it to you unless you really, really scream and
*  yell at them and then they'll charge you and take six months to get it. So when we moved away from
*  them, we wanted to get what our claims data was to understand what we were going to be facing.
*  They wouldn't give it to us until like six months later. I forget the exact month,
*  and then they charge us for it as well. Our own data.
*  On the CEO front, you said that CEOs don't understand healthcare coverage
*  and it's costing them big. What's the connection between Cost Plus Drugs and companies?
*  So I can speak for my own companies and this applies to all companies,
*  bigger companies that self-insure because we self-insured. When we started Cost Plus,
*  I finally said, okay, it's time for me to understand how I'm paying for my healthcare,
*  for my employees and their families. The first thing I looked at was a lot of these companies
*  use employee benefits consultants. Turns out I was paying $30 per employee per month,
*  which was millions of dollars a year. They were just sending us to the companies that paid them
*  the biggest commissions. I'm like, how fucking dumb am I? So I'm like, okay, we're cutting that.
*  Then I looked at our prescription deals that goes through the PBMs that we were using
*  and that the consultant connected us with. I took a list of, this is early on in Cost Plus Drugs,
*  list of the generic drugs that we sold that cost more than $30 that the Mavericks also had
*  purchased. We were able to get that claims data. It turns out we spent $169,000 with that PBM,
*  one of the big three PBMs. It would have cost us buying from Cost Plus Drugs $19,000.
*  That's just a simple example. Then I looked at the insurance side of things. We self-insure,
*  so there weren't premiums per se, but we were getting charged $17.15 per employee per month
*  just to use the network that they put together for us, providers, hospitals, whatever.
*  I'm like, all right, are there companies that won't charge us to put together these networks?
*  Turns out there's a lot of them. Those insurance companies and those PBMs are also responsible
*  for determining what to authorize and what to deny. For a drug, it may be, all right,
*  this is an expensive drug, but before they'll say they'll pay for the drug that your doctor wants
*  to prescribe for you, you have to try these three other drugs in what's called step-up therapy to
*  see if these other cheaper drugs work, or they're not even necessarily cheaper. They may be being
*  pushed because they're getting a higher rebate. I'm like, that's insane. I want my employees to
*  get the medication that the doctors say is best. I didn't realize those were the intricacies of
*  where my healthcare dollars went. There's not a single CEO who does, because that's not a core
*  competency that they need. The CFOs, that's not their core competency. The HR people,
*  they contribute and they understand it some because they're dealing with the claims,
*  but they spend most of their prescription drug related time or healthcare related times
*  trying to get pre-authorizations approved. Your kid breaks their arm or you get sick
*  and you go to the doctor and before the doctor will do a surgery or do whatever,
*  they have to go to the insurance company and get pre-authorized. Then they always say no,
*  and then you have to go back and somebody has to argue for you. That just eats up employee time
*  because I'm sick or my kid's sick and you're wasting my time, eats up HR time. The CEOs don't
*  know any of this. What I'm saying is, one, the smartest thing to do is to get a healthcare CEO
*  at every company with over, let's say, 500 employees that focuses on all these things.
*  You'd save a shitload of money. Two, healthcare is your second largest line item expense
*  after payroll. In some companies, it's hundreds, billions of dollars. You don't understand it
*  and you're letting these guys rip you off. It's because these big CEOs don't understand it and
*  are getting ripped off that the industry is the way it is because that allows the opacity to continue.
*  That's fascinating. Most companies outsource offload, the expertise on the healthcare side
*  when they really should be internally, there should be an expert that-
*  Yes, because it's the wellness of your employees and their families.
*  And it costs a lot of money.
*  Yeah, but if your employees aren't healthy or if they're worried about their kids,
*  and what is more worrisome and detrimental to the performance of a company? A DEI program
*  or having to go to HR and scream and yell and explain, and your doctor wasting their time doing
*  the same thing to get authorization for a surgery or a medication. It's insane.
*  What made you decide to step into this cartel-like situation where so much is opaque?
*  I got a cold email from a Dr. Alex Osmianski, who's my co-founder. He's a radiologist by trade
*  and a physicist and a smart motherfucker. He had a pharmacy that he wanted to create,
*  a compounding pharmacy that would manufacture generic drugs that were in short supply
*  because it happens all the time that things aren't available. I'm like,
*  you're thinking too small. We should do something on a much bigger scale.
*  Then it was right around the time they were sending the pharmacy bro, Martin Shkreli, to jail.
*  I was reading up on that and he increased the price of this drug, DeraPrim. I think it was
*  7,500% or increased a low-cost drug to $7,500, one of those. I'm like, well, if he can just jack up
*  the price of this drug and charge more and get away with it, this has to be an incredibly
*  inefficient market. The question is, why is he able to do it? It was immediately apparent that it was
*  a lack of transparency. Can we start a company that is fully transparent with our costs, our markup,
*  and our selling price and see if it works? We went for it and it took off immediately.
*  You read a press release from a company saying they were creating a cost advantage program,
*  basically pretending to replicate us. We haven't been in business two years.
*  How insane is that? Did you get a lot of pressure? I'm sure they're very good at playing games.
*  Cartel type situations, they protect. It feels like healthcare, it's very difficult to get in there.
*  It does. The whole industry is an arbitrage, but we don't work inside the system, we work outside
*  the system. We don't work with those biggest companies. The biggest companies with the most
*  dominant control, it's very insulated and very controlled, like you said. We work outside them,
*  we won't work with them. Because of that, we don't have access to every medication because
*  they've told a lot of the big brand manufacturers that if they work with us, they'll take them off
*  their formularies or change the rebate structure so that they won't be prescribed as much.
*  Yeah, it is dark, but we'll get past that because there's a downstream impact of all this in the
*  rebates and the greediness of those big three PBMs. When you go to a local pharmacy here in Austin,
*  you have a friend here that is on Medicare or Medicare Advantage, and they go to a local
*  pharmacy and they get a drug that costs $600. Well, an insurance company, that's $600.
*  The pharmacy first buys that drug for probably that price minus 5%, so $570. Then there's probably
*  a copay by the patient and that's probably $20. Now, the net investment that the pharmacy,
*  the local pharmacy has for that brand medication is $550. Where it gets really fucked up is those
*  big three PBMs. They're not reimbursing them $550 or more. They're reimbursing them $500 or less.
*  Literally, those community pharmacies are eating that loss. As a result, they're going out of
*  business left and right. The most insane part of it is, yes, with corporate employer insurance,
*  that happens, but it happens more with Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage. It happens all the
*  time with those, almost with every script. The government is complicit in these community pharmacies
*  going out of business. How does that connect to Cos Plus Drugs and what we're doing and the big
*  brands? The big brands know that if all these community pharmacies are going, tens of thousands
*  of them are going to go out of business because of the way this pricing is, they're going to lose a
*  connection between their brand medications and grandma and grandpa and aunt Sally and all that
*  business is going to get transferred to the big companies. They're going to have even less leverage.
*  They're working with us to come up with programs that are very supportive of independent pharmacies.
*  That's going to allow us to break the cartel because it's in their best interest not to allow
*  them to be so vertically integrated that they destroy the entire community and independent
*  pharmacy industry. Is there other aspects of the healthcare industry that could use this kind of
*  transparency and revolutionizing? What we're going to do with our own healthcare,
*  we're not going to be in the business of selling healthcare or anything like that or operate,
*  but the things we do for my companies, we're only going to do deals with healthcare providers that
*  allow us to be completely transparent so that whatever contracts we do, we're going to post
*  them all. Whatever pricing we get, we're going to post them all so that every company who's our size
*  or even bigger will have a template that they can work on, which will take it away from the
*  big three insurance companies and the big three PBMs because now without that transparency,
*  they have to use consultants who are getting paid by those big companies and aren't giving them the
*  best response. Now that transparency will overcome that. You're using your, how should I say it,
*  celebrity, your name to push this forward. It's weird that people aren't getting into the space.
*  Well, you public people, there's not a big, you look at tech, there's these
*  CEOs are open and public and they're pushing the company and they're selling everything. It's all
*  transparent, but you don't see that in healthcare. No, because it's a big business and most people,
*  if I was 25 trying to start a company, I'd work in the system because if I can build it up big
*  enough, they would just buy me and I'd make money and buy a sports team, but I don't need that money
*  now. Let me ask you about AI. You got a little bit of an argument about open source. I think you
*  stepped in between Vanilla Coastland, Mark Andreessen. Do you think AI should be open source?
*  Yeah, for sure. So all that discussion we've been having about Google and so on, one of the solutions.
*  Two different things, meaning that Meta is doing open source. That's a good choice for them. I
*  think that's a smart choice, but it's just a business decision for everybody else. I don't
*  think it should be forced. Forced, yes. Even Google is open sourcing some of the models.
*  That's a very incestuous industry where the people all work together at some level. They read the
*  same papers. They go to the same conferences. It's like the early days of streaming and the
*  internet where people used the same technology everywhere. Now they just try different things
*  and you get one smart or two, a couple smart people in one company like Anthropic. They do
*  things a little bit better and model efficiency gets better. It's just a business choice, but I
*  don't think it should be forced, but I think it's a smart business decision. Open sourcing is a smart
*  business decision. Yeah, it's a tricky one. Google is a pioneer in that with TensorFlow in the AI
*  space. That's a tricky decision. It really is. But go back to historically, there was digital
*  computing, which was a dominant player. IBM to a certain extent thought that they wouldn't be
*  subject to a problem with the PC industry. Then all of a sudden, with their mainframes and everything,
*  they had captive software. They wouldn't use off the shelf software. For digital equipment,
*  an IBM mainframe, you needed software that was written for it. There was nothing off the shelf.
*  When the PC industry came along, it was the exact opposite. There was MS-DOS and then Windows,
*  things that were off the shelf that every PC could use. That changed how people thought about
*  software. I think the same thing will happen here where it's going to be,
*  as models become more efficient and less expensive to train, I think there'll be more
*  more reasons to open source. Yeah, that's the hope. It creates more competition and a lot of
*  different diversity of approaches in how they're implemented, deployed, what kind of products they
*  create, all of that. Vinod compared the danger of that to the Manhattan Project.
*  I'm not buying that. You don't see the parallels between nuclear weapons and AI.
*  No. I think I'm not an AI fatalist at all. I'm an AI optimist. It's not to say that there
*  isn't a lot of scary shit that can happen with it. Militarily, like I said earlier,
*  I'm a big believer that there's going to be millions and tens of millions of models.
*  People will take their expertise and either get hired for it and contribute or create their own
*  models and license. You see now with this thing called mixture of experts, where you connect
*  things. People can take their expertise and will be able to take that expertise and retain it in a
*  way that they want to retain it. I don't think there's going to be one medical database. I told
*  this to people at a couple of big companies that were doing healthcare initiatives. Branding is so
*  important in the healthcare space for hospitals. The Mayo Clinics, the MD Anderson, they're huge
*  brands. I don't think they're just going to give up their expertise to some singular model and say,
*  whatever expertise we have is available to you in Gemini or Chattupt or so-and-so's version of
*  Meta is open source. That would be business suicide. I think you're going to see each of
*  them have their own models and update them as they go and license them. Make money from the
*  expertise. You have to. Don't give away the expertise. Any expertise evolves and grows and
*  all that kind of stuff and you want to own that growth. What advice would you give to young people?
*  You have an exceptionally successful career. You came from little, made a lot. What advice would
*  you give them? Love your life. Find the things that you can enjoy. Be curious. You don't have
*  to have all the answers when you're 12, 15. I get emails from 13, 15-year-old kids. What do I do?
*  What do I do? I feel like I'm being held back. I'm like a 15. You feel like you're being held back?
*  Just be curious because you don't have to have the answers. You don't have to know what you're
*  going to be when you grow up. I'm a hardcore believer that everybody has something that
*  they're really, really, really good at. That could be world-class great. Every single human being on
*  this planet. The hard part is just finding what that is and in some places having resources to
*  enable it. Be curious so you can find out what it is. I took one technology class in college,
*  Fortran programming, and I cheated on it. It wasn't until I got a job at Mellon Bank and I
*  started learning how to program in this thing called Ramus, this scripting computing language,
*  that I realized, oh, this is interesting to me and I like it. That's what got me a job selling
*  software and going on from there. You just don't know what that's going to be until you go out and
*  experience different things. For anybody young out there listening, enjoy your life, find things to
*  smile about, be curious, read, watch, expose yourself to as many different ideas as you can
*  because something's going to click at some point. You may be 15, you may be 25, you may be 55,
*  but it can happen. One thing to mention is sometimes it's difficult or your parents,
*  people around you might not be conducive or might not be of help in finding the thing you're good
*  at. In fact, in my own life, the society was such that I don't know if they've helped much
*  at the thing I was good at. I'm still not sure what that is.
*  I think you've done pretty well for you.
*  Well, it's not even, there was a thing where I saw the beauty in people. It's very intensely,
*  so you can call it empathy, all that kind of stuff.
*  Someone would call it wokeness.
*  Super woke. I guess you could say just super woke. That's me.
*  But in the education system, I came up in, it was a very hard mathematics, science and so on,
*  and it didn't notice that, whatever that was in me. But you have to keep the flame going,
*  you have to try to find your way and see what that's useful. And others around you might not
*  always notice it, so it might take time. So it could be lonely. You can really have to
*  find the strength to believe in yourself.
*  Oh, for sure. And I'll tell you one quick thing.
*  One quick story. 1992, I went to Moscow State University to teach kids how to start businesses.
*  Because I had sold Micro Solutions and I wanted to travel and I took Russian in high school.
*  My Ruski is like, nah, how to show.
*  Good enough to remember that.
*  Yeah, right. Yeah. But it was interesting to me and I bring it up because just they didn't
*  they didn't know what the word profit meant. But at the same time, I would go around and
*  meet people and it was entrepreneurial. Right after the Soviet Union fell,
*  entrepreneurship went through the roof. I mean, a lot of it was mafia driven, but
*  people found that spark because I think that is natural. And so you just never know
*  when and how and when the circumstances will come together for you to be able to take advantage.
*  That spark is really important to comment on is in Russia and Ukraine.
*  I think the system kind of suppresses that spark somehow. As you said, you saw
*  the natural entrepreneurship, but there's not the entrepreneurial spirit once you grow up
*  in both of the nations I mentioned. There is.
*  No, I believe it.
*  But there's something about the system that kind of be reasonable, be, you know,
*  there would be no reason for me to go over to do what I was doing if it was otherwise.
*  That's the thing that really can help a country flourish.
*  You know, it's gonna be interesting with Ukraine if they're able to survive this,
*  right? Because as horrific as it is, you know, as you saw across Europe after World War II,
*  the rebuilding creates opportunities.
*  Rebuilding creates opportunities, but you know, first the war has to end.
*  How that ends.
*  I don't know either.
*  Is a really complex path. What gives you hope about the future of humanity?
*  Just looking in my kids' eyes, just, you know, talking to them and seeing their spirit,
*  their friend spirit. And obviously we're blessed as can be, right? And it's not the same for every
*  kid, but I do, you know, I get emails that I respond, don't respond to all of them, but from
*  13, 14, 15 year old kids around the world, you know, because the shark tank shown everywhere,
*  asking me business questions. And it's just like they took the time.
*  They were that curious and that interested. And I see it when I talk to schools, you know, when I
*  go to different groups that spark in kids' eyes that there's something bigger and better and
*  exciting out there. And that's not to say there's not fear, you know, climate and any other number
*  of things, but that's the beauty of kids. And I think Gen Z really embodies that.
*  And to me, that's just really exciting.
*  They dream, they dream big. They see the opportunity for making the world better.
*  That's cool. It's cool to see young people and that in their eyes, that dream that,
*  and I could be the one to do it too, which is a super-pop.
*  It's funny because when I go talk to like elementary school kids, right, one of the things I do,
*  I said, okay, let's look around. You see that light there? One day that light didn't exist.
*  Then somebody had the idea, then somebody created a product out of it. And now your school bought
*  that. You see that chair? Chairs didn't always look like that. Somebody had that idea. Why not you?
*  So when you walk out and want to make them do, ask yourself, why not me? Why can't I be the one to
*  change the world? Thank you for that beautiful, hopeful message. And thank you for talking today,
*  Mark. You're fun to follow. I'm a big fan of yours, but you're also an important person in this world.
*  I really appreciate everything you do. Well, I appreciate it. Thanks for saying that,
*  Lex. And keep on doing what you're doing. This was great. I really enjoyed this.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Mark Cuban. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Oscar
*  Wilde. Imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he is not. And a sense of humor
*  was provided to console him for what he is. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
