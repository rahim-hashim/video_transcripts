# Eric Weinstein: On the Nature of Good and Evil, Genius and Madness | Lex Fridman Podcast #134
**Lex Fridman:** [October 29, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2nG7-eXxko)
*  The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein, the third time we've spoken on this podcast.
*  He is the wise turtle master oogway to my kung fu panda, one of my favorite people to talk to in
*  this world. A complicated and fascinating mind that I'm grateful to have the chance to accompany
*  in exploring this world through conversation on this podcast and on his, the latter called
*  The Portal. Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.
*  First is Grammarly, a service I use in my writing to check spelling, grammar, sentence structure,
*  and readability. Second is Sunbasket, a meal delivery service I use to add healthy variety
*  into my culinary life. Third is SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool I've ever come
*  across. I don't like looking at numbers, but somebody should. It helps you make good decisions.
*  And finally, ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years to protect my privacy on the internet.
*  Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.
*  As a side note, let me say that wherever this life takes me, I'm drawn to the possibility of having
*  many more conversations with Eric through the years. I think we have just the right kind of
*  contrasting worldviews and a deep respect and appreciation of each other's life stories
*  that creates for this magical experience in the realm of conversation that feels like we're
*  always looking for something that we never quite find, but are always better for having tried.
*  I'm not sure how or why the universe has connected Eric and me, but it did. And I would be a fool not
*  to trust its judgment and enjoy the journey. If somehow you like this podcast, please subscribe

*  Who's the greatest musician of all time? Would you say we were just off camera talking about
*  Eddie Van Halen? He unfortunately passed away. Who's the greatest musician of all time? Yeah.
*  Jonathan Richmond. Who's that? It's a weird question. So I'm going to give you a weird
*  answer. It's not because. Thank you. Okay. Jonathan Richmond. The reason I'm picking on him is that he
*  had a quote. He was the front man of a group called the modern lovers. And his quote was something
*  like, we have to be prepared to play music when our instruments are broken, the electricity is
*  out and it's raining, something like that. And I thought that that quote was very interesting
*  because what it said was you have to be able to strip this thing down farther and farther back
*  to get to something that is intrinsically musical. So we were having a conversation just now about
*  virtuosity. And we're talking about Eddie Van Halen and his recent passing. And that affected
*  me emotionally. I don't know whether it affected you. I was never a Van Halen the group fan,
*  but I revered Eddie Van Halen's capacity for innovation. I saw him like Rodney Mullin,
*  the skateboarder. I had dreamed of having the two of them on the same podcast just to talk about
*  what it's like to totally discontinuously innovate. And you posted a video of Spanish fly, I think,
*  and saying like, I didn't know the guitar could make those kinds of sounds. Like, what is this
*  voodoo magic? What is it? Well, this is the thing, right? The arpeggios that he did on a single string
*  are so fast and the attacks from the hammer-ons when they go at light speed as he did,
*  particularly, and the reason I chose that was that I wanted to strip out the electronics
*  because part of the claim will be is that he's a rock musician. And a lot of the innovations had
*  to do with things peculiar to sort of the electrified setup. His use of the whammy bar,
*  for example, or the Frankenstrat that he built from different pieces, right? All of those aspects,
*  in my opinion, are just dwarfed by his innovation and his musicianship. And that's why I chose
*  Spanish fly because everyone, of course, will go to something like Eruption or Running with the
*  Devil, which is the first things that they heard that let them know that there was a new force
*  erupting out of Southern California that was Eddie Van Halen, right? I mean, I'm in love with
*  the story of it. You're often so poetic about music, like it clearly touches your soul on some
*  kind of, on many levels. What is that? Is it deeper than just rocking out with the, in your convertible
*  Corvette 69? I imagine an Eric Weinstein just driving down the California highways blasting
*  some kind of music. Is it just like being able to be carefree for moments of time,
*  or is there something more fundamental that connects to like the theory of everything
*  in physics and life and all of that? How often do you have the chance,
*  for example, to hear mathematics performed as you do in Bach, right? Like something with that kind
*  of precision and elegance that can't really be grasped where, you know, to go back to Leonard
*  Cohen's famous line, the baffled King composing, right? Such a good song. Such a good song,
*  but it's also like individual verses of that song are insanely important. The baffled King
*  is how we often make music. We don't really understand what did we just do that broke that
*  person's heart sitting on the couch, right? And so it's a very strange thing that you should be
*  able to have. Think of it like you're a computer. You've got this weird open music port,
*  you know, port 37.8, you know, like it's not even supposed to be there. And suddenly somebody starts
*  playing guitar and they're making you feel things or, you know, like in particular,
*  particular instruments like the violin. It's so difficult. It's so unforgiving. And when it
*  gives up its secrets, it just, you know, it wraps its fingers around your heart and won't let go.
*  Sometimes I talk about head, heart and loins. When something can grab your head,
*  heart and your loins at the same moment and integrate them, there are very few opportunities
*  to live like that. And if you think about Eddie Van Halen, you know, as far as your head,
*  the musical innovations and the fact that he was drawing directly from the classical canon,
*  um, you know, really speaks to the idea that maybe rock is what, um, somebody like
*  Jimi Hendrix saw it as being, you know, an infinitely extensible medium, uh, in terms of
*  heart. Um, I always noticed the smile on his face. It's painful to look at an Eddie Van Halen solo
*  now, like sometimes you'll see the cigarette dripping off the side of his mouth and you're like,
*  that's going to kill you. And I'm not even worried about it for you. I'm worried about it for me.
*  You're going to rob. I don't even need to hear you play another note. I just like knowing that
*  you're in the world, that there is somebody that everyone looks to that nobody I've never heard a
*  guitarist say, eh, I don't know. I think he was okay. Like never heard it. You can hate him,
*  but you still think he was a genius. There are very few people like that in the world.
*  And then loins, those leaps, that guy was incredibly good looking and, you know,
*  skin tight pants, super athleticism. He completely owned the sexual, the male sexuality of the stage,
*  both being the completely dominant, you know, sort of mythical alpha male. I hate that expression,
*  but there you are. But also this kind of little boy with this mischievous smirk and, you know,
*  the sense that it all came together. How could you not eat that up?
*  You could just imagine the millions of like young teenage boys who are just like playing air guitar
*  in their room. Just that, yeah, basically dreaming of being that kind of God,
*  the most perfect example of what a human being can be. Yeah. It's fascinating to think.
*  It is. And then, you know, as in many of the cases with these bands,
*  you get these multiple talents in the same outfit. And I think that the original configuration with
*  David Lee Roth, I mean, David Lee Roth is such a hot mess at all times.
*  I would love you to talk to David Lee Roth. Like if that dance would be just gorgeous.
*  I don't know. Can you handle it? Can you ride that?
*  Probably not. Yeah. Probably not because I think
*  he's very, I get the feeling that he's very smart and very dysregulated. And I don't know that I
*  could like, like bring him down to earth for a moment. Well, I can also get pretty dysregulated,
*  you know? And so I don't know. I don't know whether it could be magic. It could be a
*  shit show. I don't know what you thought of his appearance on Rogan. That was an interesting one.
*  I loved it. But Joe and that and Joe does this sometimes. Sometimes he just sits back and listens
*  and he just lets like the music play, which works really well. I think you have a chance to kind of
*  jump into the chaos and then you'll just start and the places you will go, you may not even talk
*  about music for like hours. It might just go to this because he, I think lives in Japan. Like
*  there's a weird, he's been an EMT after he was a rock star. He chose to be kind of like,
*  I don't know, you know, it like there's depth to that man that hasn't been explored by him either.
*  So that'll be an exciting conversation. Can we go back to Larry Cohen?
*  Can we just, the things I feel when I listen to Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen or anything by him,
*  really. But that one, what's, let's go. What, what is it that song mean to you?
*  Is it love? Oh boy. Well, first of all, it's, it's, it's mystery. Like it starts off about mystery.
*  So what are you, what are you doing? You're doing this alternation between the two chords.
*  So three notes at the same time, one is called the, the tonic or you have the major and the
*  relative minor and he's alternating between them. There's only one note of difference between those
*  two chords. One of them would be feeling sad. One of them would be more joyous, typically described.
*  And so by altering one note, it's the minimal amount to take you back and forth between joy
*  and happiness as that's encoded in us. So he starts off with that. I heard there was this
*  scene David played the please the Lord, but you don't really care for music, do you?
*  That's really interesting because it's, he's using this technique called bathos, right? So the
*  alternation between the sublime and kind of the guttural or ridiculous or the mundane, right? So
*  he's like, but there's a bitterness to it too. Is it just play? Well, the way I hear it again,
*  great song allows for different interpretations. You happen to be asking me, so I'm going to impart
*  some stuff that probably isn't in the song, but why it speaks to me. And that's what makes it great.
*  The way I hear it is he doesn't believe the audience. You don't really care for music,
*  do you? Then what are you doing listening to this? You stupid idiots, you know, of course you,
*  of course you care for music. You're too cool to care. So I see through you and screw you.
*  That's like the kind of, that's, that's the energy I get. Then he does this weird thing.
*  It goes like this is where he should put the description of where he is in the chord
*  progression, which is the tonic, right? It goes like this. And then he hits the fourth and the
*  fifth, which are the two other major elements, the subdominant and the dominant in functional harmony.
*  So he's describing the chord progression in real time in the lyrics. There's two ways this can come
*  about in other songs. Like we had this example of, um, every time we say goodbye, do you know this
*  song? Every time we say goodbye. No, I think it was a Cole Porter maybe or Gershwin, maybe Porter.
*  I don't know. I cry a little, there is no love song finer, but how strange the change from major
*  to minor, right? Like it's beautiful use. Then, then there's a times when it's duplicitous. So
*  for example, you'll have, um, I guess my favorite examples of this are Johnny Cash's ring of fire.
*  I fell into a burning ring of fire. Then what does he do with the lyrics in the tune?
*  I went down, down, down. He goes up. Right. And so the idea is like, oh, okay. That was a head fake.
*  Right. And another one of these, um, you know, is Nina Simone's feeling good. Oh, okay. So what do
*  you get a bird's flying high? You know how I feel. Then sun up in the sky. You know how I feel.
*  That woman's voice doesn't give a damn. And yet she feels, but then what's the
*  Yeah. It's like heavy stripping music. It's, it's, you're not in a good place. You're probably in some
*  strip club with some last of your money. You're drinking lousy beer, some bad situation.
*  Yeah. And she's feeling good. No, it's funereal. It's oppressive. Right. I never thought of that
*  song that way. Wow. Well, you think of it as joyous. Yeah. No, no, no. If you think about it,
*  contrasted with Ray Charles, for example, you know, do you know, do you know lonely Avenue?
*  Because well, my room has got two windows, but the sunshine never comes through.
*  It's really depressed. It's the same sort of vibe as Nina, but she's claiming that she's in great
*  shape. So she's like a good case of the unreliable narrator. Leonard Cohen to me is talking about the
*  unreliable audience. That's too cool to be with the performer on stage. There are things that go
*  with the music, like the Cole Porter stuff that go against like the Johnny Cash. I think these are
*  the games that musicians play that the rest of us only sort of notice subliminally. Okay. Fourth,
*  the fifth, then he, when he, he should say something about the relative minor or the,
*  he's giving you the secret, the baffled King. In other words, he doesn't know why it works.
*  Did Paco Bell know why Paco Bell's cannon would work? It was a discovery. That's the whole thing.
*  Like some music is discovered and some music is invented. And he's talking about a musical
*  discovery. He's talking about the Pythagorean power of the wave equation and then superimpose
*  like there's two genius intellectual concepts behind music. One of which is the wave equation.
*  Usually we solve it for a one-dimensional medium because we're talking about strings or air
*  columns. Occasionally you're talking about things like hand pans or steel drums or metallophones or
*  gamelons, whatever. And those have a wave equation too. That's much more chaotic.
*  The other equation is this crazy thing that two to the 1912th is almost exactly equal to three,
*  which is what gave us even temperament. And so the tension between those two things is in fact,
*  one of these most beautiful stories inside of that system. That formula of the baffled King is a
*  discovery. He's not really composing it. The reason he's baffled, it's imagine that you took
*  a little brush and you started brushing off a pyramid under the sands. You might think that
*  you created the pyramid by your brushing, but in fact somebody else did it. That's why you're
*  baffled. Right? That's beautifully put. You're right. And as creating one of the greatest songs
*  of all time and as he's doing it, he's baffled. And he's within the song. And he Leonard is baffled
*  is my contention, but he knows enough to know that he's baffled. Right? And so the idea is that he
*  is composing, he has the audacity to compose as David. He's echoing David at a minimum.
*  And then in a later song, which I really wish we would discuss, that's totally dystopic and you
*  will not like it at all, is the future, which contains this line that I think I used in my
*  episode with Roger Penrose on the portal. Note the subtle plug. The portal, the portal, the portal.
*  I'm the little Jew that wrote the Bible. So there is this way in which Leonard Cohen,
*  I think, is constantly coming to the idea of being a biblical like scribe. And I think this
*  is one of the great things that, you know, you see Dylan doing this with all along the watch tower.
*  You saw Warren Zvon, who we should talk much more about doing this with a song called I
*  was in the house when the house burned down. Do you know this? No, this is embarrassing.
*  Sweetheart. This is a great day. Warren Zvon is one of the most important songwriters of our time.
*  And he's been largely forgotten by this generation. But you know, Bob Dylan would sing one of his
*  songs in tribute. I've heard Bob Dylan, you know, very small number of songwriters really move him.
*  Woody Guthrie, Gordon Lightfoot, and Warren Zvon. By the way, Bob Dylan, if you're out there,
*  appear on either one of our podcasts. We need to get your voice into a new medium for a new group.
*  Definitely. This is a time for Bob Dylan, my friend. Honestly, you've been doing an amazing
*  job in this space. One of the reasons I'm super excited to do this podcast again is that
*  I've learned some things about what I don't do well. And I also have sort of struggled with the
*  question, should I do those things better? Because what if it's, you know, I always use the same
*  example of the fitted sheet when you're trying to put a queen size fitted sheet on a king size
*  mattress. He's like, okay, I got that corner squared away. Then you get another corner that
*  pops off and they have to go back around. I wonder whether I can improve my style in the ways in which
*  I do. I think it's just a recognition of a difference. You do a better job of getting to the
*  soul of a really top intellectual guest and making them accessible and presenting them as themselves
*  for a huge number of people. And I'd give my eye tooth to be able to do that.
*  Do you ever think about this? Because I think about what is the greatest conversation I'll ever
*  have. You know, like in a sense, the portal, not to reduce it to anything, but there will be the
*  greatest conversation. You may have already had it, but it's very possible. If enough people like
*  me can keep twisting your arm to keep doing the portal, please, there'll be an amazing conversation.
*  One of the questions that I ask myself is like, who is the person that I'm especially equipped,
*  for some reason, I'm convinced on Putin. There's something in my head that says, I can do this man
*  better than anyone else in this world. I got this thought in my head about it. I don't know why.
*  And I'm convinced, but I think the universe works in that way. Like if it tells you,
*  it's going to happen. The way I would say it is that almost everybody who becomes a Supreme
*  Court justice believes at a very early age, they're going to become a Supreme Court justice.
*  Many people believe at an early age that they can do it, don't get there. But of those who get
*  there, almost all of them had this sort of, well, I call it pathological self-confidence. And
*  I do think you have pathological self-confidence and you also have humility. And most people would
*  hear those as a contradiction. I think that you would not be able to get away with what you do
*  if you didn't have the humility. And so I think, you know, the great danger is that your equation
*  becomes unbalanced, that you either lose the humility or you lose the humility overwhelms
*  the ego and the drive. Because right now you've got a Mexican standoff in your mind and
*  the rest of us are just benefiting. That's beautifully put. My Mexican standoffs aren't
*  as stable as yours. It's all reservoir dogs all the time. Yeah. But actually the person who that
*  describes is Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel thinks more different. People always say like, what does Peter
*  think about X, Y, and Z, P, and Q? It's like, well, do you want communist Peter? Do you want
*  hyper capitalist Peter? There's multiple minds in there. Oh my God. Right? On everything. That's why
*  he's successful is that he's got all these minds fighting each other. And so when people say Peter
*  is this or Peter is that, I just laugh because it like nobody who knows him would describe him as
*  having thoughts at the level that people are claiming. And I do think that, you know, in my case,
*  um, you know, there's also pathological epistemic humility. Like just, I know, I know how little,
*  I know how little I can do in one life. I know how many things I've screwed up.
*  I know how many things I've got wrong. And on the other hand, I know that if, if not,
*  you know, it's like Hillel's questions, you know, if I'm not for myself, who will be for me?
*  If I'm only for myself, what am I? If not now, when, you know, at some level, there's a question
*  about if I don't decide that someone is capable and that somebody is me, and I, if I apply that
*  to everyone else on the planet, then nobody's going to do anything. And so I do think that
*  one of the things that people like you and I get is who are you to say that? Right? F that man. Just
*  sign me up for some Dunning-Kruger.
*  Yeah, but it's multiple minds. Like you said, like this morning I was feeling so good and
*  confident about, I couldn't think no wrong. And I remember last night clearly thinking that I'm
*  the dumbest human who has ever lived and nothing I've ever said is worth anything. And what the
*  fuck am I doing with my life? Why am I scared? I was terrified of this conversation. Who the hell
*  am I? Because I'm an idiot. And cause, you know, Lex, it, but no, no, no, but this morning
*  I was the baddest motherfucker who's ever walked this earth. So I was, I was very conscious. I think
*  it was the coffee. I'm not sure. Maybe some sleep. This sounds very Russian and it involves multiple
*  beverages. Some of them being alcoholic, others containing caffeine. There's in fact, I can't
*  share the story behind it, but there is a bottle of vodka in the fridge.
*  Okay. So, uh, I mean, I should have hit you for coffee because this is a morning,
*  there's a morning show here. So I put out a call that we get a chance to have this conversation
*  and people ask these wonderful questions. A few people asked about depression and suicide.
*  This is a Russian program, so we'll have to go there. And I think about Leonard Cohen. And one
*  of the things that always kind of, um, broke my heart and kind of suffocated the hope I have for
*  just, uh, I don't know for love in a person's life is to hear how much, how much depression was a
*  part of Leonard Cohen's life and how much he suffered. I guess one way, I'm not sure where
*  we can go with this question, but do you think about the places that the mind can go?
*  Like these dark places? Yeah. Is there something
*  like where the only escape out is suicide, for example, that's the darkest version of it?
*  That I really think suicide is a big place and suicidal ideation and self-harm.
*  And we don't talk a lot about it. Um, it's, it's a similar problem to trying to talk about trans.
*  These are umbrella categories. And if the commonality is that somebody harms themselves,
*  but we don't know whether that's coming because of a problem in brain chemistry,
*  because of an event in their life, um, whether evolutionary programming for suicide is
*  weirdly normal, whether or not it might have a religious motivation.
*  There's, there's too many different forms of self-harm. It's something like the 10th largest
*  killer or thereabouts. Um, and I think that, you know, you can look at it from different angles.
*  Uh, I, I'm old enough to have, you know, had Pete Seeger come to my college when I was, uh,
*  university and to watch his good humor in the face of all adversity. Um, I think of Odetta,
*  I used to go to Odetta concerts. I don't know if you know who she is. Okay. This is going to be
*  one of the better days of your life. Check out Odetta when we're done with the interview. Um,
*  she was a civil rights figure, but also just had a profound voice and great musicianship.
*  So these people were in the struggle, right? And they, they saw lots of bad things happen
*  and they kept their humor about them. And, you know, the thing is that you can take on
*  the, the Veldschmerz, you know, the pain of the, of the planet, or you can try to do something
*  else, which is to be a happy warrior, even if the odds are terrible and the, and the cost of failure
*  is catastrophic. So even when surrounded by darkness, but the thing is with Leonard Cohen
*  is he created such beautiful music and yet it's like Anthony Bourdain the same. And yet they go
*  to this dark place and it could be, it's easy to say it's just biochemistry. There's a linkage
*  between this highly generative creative side and in some cases, dark depression in other cases,
*  not. So you can't say that it's tied the genius and madness are always, you know,
*  co-traveling or the beauty and pain are one in the same. What you can say is that there's a cluster
*  of people that tell you that for that cluster, there is a relationship between the darkness
*  and the beauty. And I do think that in part it's squaring circles that can't be squared,
*  you know, that we're just talking before about the inability to serve two perfect systems,
*  the perfect system of the wave equation and the perfect system of even temperament.
*  They're both perfect. They're not compatible. And once you realize that there is perfection
*  and an inability to make contact with perfection, I think, you know, you recognize that
*  there is no solution to this world. Yeah. That's weird with the poets and musicians.
*  Do you want to say this is a particular thing that you do, but then there's a Spanish fly by Van Halen
*  and then you realize, oh, well, what do you get out of Spanish fly by Van Halen?
*  I think it's very singular because of the fact that it's purely acoustic.
*  For some reason, I couldn't imagine Eddie Van Halen separate from the band in front of
*  thousands of people just screaming and rocking out with lights everywhere. And Spanish fly made me
*  think like, it made me imagine him sitting alone in a couch in a room.
*  I think that's who he was. I really do. I mean, believe me, I get it. He was a rock star,
*  a rock star, a rock god. Got it, got it, got it, got it. I'm almost positive that you can't get
*  to where he got to without being a complete introvert. Yeah. Like it made me imagine that
*  there's like some half naked supermodel walking around hoping that they can, you know,
*  do their thing together. And Eddie's completely disinterested. He'd be with the guitar.
*  He'd be with the guitar. Right? Yeah. Because like, honestly, at some level, in one case,
*  you know, maybe you're, maybe you're conquesting, maybe you're pursuing love and romance.
*  In the other case, you're talking about a relationship to the, to the order, the Creator,
*  the Almighty, whatever it is you want to call that substrate that is reality. And, you know,
*  do I believe that Eddie Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix and Paganini and Heifetz jacked into the,
*  you know, the true essence of the world? Yeah, they did. I don't think it's as good
*  as differential geometry. I'm sorry. I do think it's amazing for other reasons. And thank God,
*  because it's very difficult to communicate differential geometry at scale. But the thing
*  about eruption, for example, what level do you want to come into eruption? Do you want just the
*  sheer majesty and pageantry? Do you want the theatrics? Like you could put him on, on wires
*  and, you know, set his pants on fire or whatever. And, you know, it'd be, it'd be totally in keeping
*  with it. On the other hand, you want to have something completely precise
*  that, you know, shows off the virtuosity of what's possible with the Stratocaster.
*  Everything works. Multi-axis. But there's a precision to it, which, and which is very
*  different than Hendrix. There's a messiness to Hendrix that to me, somebody who has OCD
*  has always been struggling. How does Hendrix affect you? I mean, let's have the Jimi Hendrix
*  conversation. I don't know that we can do anything to it that hasn't already been done to it.
*  Maybe that's not true. Maybe the idea is that every generation has to have its Hendrix
*  conversation. And this is a long-form. It's Jimi Hendrix experience. Yeah.
*  So funny. Yeah. I hear you stole it from Joe Rogan.
*  Yeah. There's so many details. One, it hurt my
*  soul on so many levels that you can put a thumb over the guitar to, to play a note, to, to hold
*  the note. And it doesn't, because I wanted to be the Russian virtuoso that sits with his classical
*  guitar in perfect form, plays really fast with the fingers. And then you don't want, you want the
*  thumb to be perfectly relaxed and support you. That's the Russian conservatory student.
*  Conservatory student. Yeah. Then there's the Russian wild man.
*  Which one is that? Well, they're different Russian archetypes, right? So the completely
*  idiosyncratic Russian is very different in a weird way from the, you know, I can do this backwards
*  in any key in any sleep, in my sleep and in any time signature that you, you know, just, just snap
*  your fingers. We've discussed my piano tuner in previous episodes. No, no, that was offline
*  conversation. You told me the story. I should tell you the story. You should, you should
*  retell the story. There I was in darkest Manhattan with the world's shittiest. It wasn't even an
*  upright. It was a spinet piano. A friend had given it to me. The piano fell out of tune and I would
*  have to tune it. And the only tuner I knew was this Russian guy and I hated dealing with him.
*  There was something about his attitude that just really rubbed me the wrong way.
*  So anyway, my wife says tune that thing. So we get the piano tuner to come and he's tuning this.
*  He's like, are you sure? Are you sure you want to tune this, this piece of shit? You know, okay,
*  fine. So he's like, okay, it's your money. The phone rings and I have the phone ringer set
*  on a landline to Paganini Caprice 24. And immediately as the phone rings, he figures out
*  what key the phone ringer is and which is not the key that like list composed the variations on
*  on Caprice 24. And he starts going into theme and variations on Caprice 24
*  at some level I've never heard before, just jaw dropping it. And like the phone stops ringing.
*  We have this awkward silence. I said, I didn't know you were such a great piano player. And then
*  he says one of these things in Russian, you know, in Russian accent in English hurts in a way you
*  can't imagine. He said, no, you are the piano player. I am merely the piano tuner. It was just
*  like, oh man, through the heart. You know, it's kind of reminiscent. I'd love to hear actually
*  your opinion. This is reminiscent of the Goodwill hunting story. What do you think about that?
*  That movie, that movie, it's about it. It's MIT. It's, yeah, I guess when I think of that film,
*  I think about Matt Damon as a young guy, risking everything, giving up Harvard. I think, you know,
*  probably the most accomplished group of people in the world are people who choose to give up Harvard
*  voluntarily. Right? Bigger than Harvard. I think, you know, Ives was one of these people.
*  Bill Gates, of course. And then oddly, you know, Zuckerberg, but then Steve Jobs gave up a read.
*  And read is like the weirdest, craziest college in the world. People should pay much more attention
*  to read. And I'm sorry, it's going through a hard time at the moment, but what it was before the
*  current craziness is really an interesting story. Irregardless, as we say in the 617 area code,
*  I think that a lot of my reaction is to the real story of Matt Damon having this vision and being
*  the young guy to pull it off. And, you know, I also think about Robin Williams trying to explore
*  heart through this lens of acting. And, you know, as you and I, you've hung out with comedians,
*  they know that they are a screwed up bunch of people. They do. They're proud about it. They
*  really are. The idea that Robin Williams, who I saw many years ago when I was in LA,
*  in the comedy clubs around here, you know, he was a straight up crazy dysregulated genius in tremendous
*  pain and his desire to do it earnestly through acting rather than constantly by just sniping,
*  you know, or being a clown or showing us how fast his mind worked relative to ours.
*  I was really moved by that. I thought that he brought some authenticity
*  and took a huge risk for a comedian to be that real.
*  And again, like you said, it doesn't always have to be, but in that case, the madness and genius
*  were neighbors. That one couldn't have been any other way. Yeah. No, because his mind,
*  the thing about seeing him in a comedy club was that he would react to random stimulus in the
*  environment. You know, it could be a heckler. Sometimes you almost got the feeling that he
*  wanted a heckler because it gave him something to play against. Right. He was infinitely
*  instantly inventive. But I actually, to me, the best Robin Williams is, has he got closer and
*  closer to the end of his life because there was a sadness and he's almost fighting the sadness
*  with this improvisational, like the weapons he has is this wit and humor and this dancing that
*  he does with language. But, and then sometimes when you just fall silent, you can see the sadness.
*  You can see the sadness. And I don't know, there's something so beautiful about that.
*  It's like this bird with a broken wing that's like trying to fly, you know, and it's getting
*  older and older. And I mean, those, he would have made a one hell of a podcast guest. I'll tell you
*  that. That's a sad, yeah, I have some sadness that I really do think that part of what we call
*  podcasting is actually just getting to know a soul over and over again. Like,
*  maybe the idea is that this is talking about depression and sadness and heavy feelings
*  is not an American specialty. Seeing that in context with the beauty of life is a Russian
*  specialty. Like it is very much. Sounds like a diner menu. What? Yeah. You want the Russian
*  specialty. A big scoop of ice cream with tons of depression. I do think that we're in a really
*  terrifying and depressing time. And I think that part of it is that we don't know if something
*  huge is about to get started. And we don't even know what this is. I mean, we just sit here in
*  this weird world that is falling into some new state and we're not even super curious. It's like,
*  what the hell just happened? Everybody's got an answer. And I'm positive that all of those
*  answers are wrong. Let's, let's try to at least sneak up on the good answer. So the central core
*  of the answer is that the U S seemed to be the greatest thing in the world in large measure,
*  because we hadn't noticed that we were getting a benefit from having no plan, not having to make
*  a plan for low growth. As long as we had growth, we were in great shape. Let's imagine that there
*  was a, that you could run an experiment. You have a billion copies of earth and you start the initial
*  conditions slightly different on some giant number of planets. A lot of the things that were discovered
*  from the 1800s through the end of the 20th century are discovered in a period of time,
*  because a lot of that just has to do with once you crack the puzzle of getting better instruments,
*  you can see more. And the more you can see, the more you can make use of what you can see. And
*  it turns out there was lots of stuff to do with like, you know, germs or electron orbitals or,
*  you know, spectrum, electromagnetic spectrum. And so we got to do all of those things and the U S
*  roughly corresponded for a good chunk of its history with this bonanza. And so of course,
*  we look like an amazing genius country. We have no plan. Imagine that you could sell a car. You
*  don't have to put in seat belts. You don't have to put in airbags. You don't have to put in rear view
*  mirrors or sensors or rear view mirror. You could save a lot of money on a car by not putting in all
*  of the stuff to keep things from going wrong. And I think that's what we had. We had a machine
*  that as long as growth was insanely good, we plowed it back, the riches and spoils and treasure
*  back into the system and made more genius stuff. And we carried along a good chunk of humanity,
*  hundreds of millions of people. We did not have a plan for what happens when the growth goes below
*  the stall speed of our society. How confident should we be that the growth has slowed in a way
*  that is permanent rather than a slap in the face where-
*  Or is that the right concept? The right concept is, I try to use the same words over and over
*  again in case people see mold because then the perseveration actually gets somewhere. So I use
*  this analogy of the orchard because everyone talks about low-hanging fruit. They know the concept of
*  low-hanging fruit, but they don't think in terms of orchards. So they say things like,
*  you think we've picked all the low-hanging fruit, but I believe in the infinite inventiveness of the
*  human mind. It's like, okay, that doesn't even work as an analogy. What if the idea is we only
*  picked all the low-hanging fruit here and then we're having this stupid argument about low-hanging
*  fruit and we're not going and looking for new orchards. We're not planting new orchards. We're
*  not looking for forests. We're just sitting here arguing about low-hanging fruit. So my claim is
*  there's probably a lot more low-hanging fruit and it's not here. It's in other orchards. One of those
*  turned out to be the digital orchard. The digital orchard has not been as stagnant
*  as lots of these other, like the chemical orchard. I have faith that there is a small percentage of
*  the population, but not zero that's looking for those other orchards. I'm excited about one of
*  those orchards, which is, I believe there'll be robots in everybody's homes and that will unlock
*  some totally new thing, totally new set of technologies, ideas, the way we live life,
*  the productivity, everything. It'll change everything. So I'm excited about that orchard.
*  I'm roaming that orchard and wondering how the hell you bring back the ant that finds a new
*  source of food. I'm trying to find an apple I can bring back to the rest of the world.
*  Great. So you're in an explorer idiom.
*  And you have faith that there's enough of those.
*  I don't think there are very many of us. I mean, I'm one of them too.
*  How many does it take? It takes one ant. It takes one ant.
*  What are you talking about?
*  How many elons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
*  Okay. Let's imagine that we went, imagine some ant goes and finds a new source of food.
*  Yeah. Right. And then it comes back to the colony and it says, Hey, I think I found a new source
*  of food. And the initial reaction is you're not, you're not authorized to find new food.
*  What? Why would you try to go find new food? We're going to remove you from Twitter.
*  Yeah. And by the way, I think the fact that you think you're allowed to go find new shows
*  how privileged you are as an ant. Get out of the colony, kill him, kill him. Well,
*  that's probably not a great model for finding new orchards. And I think that what we find is that
*  where there's a system that allows somebody to ascend without a lot of gatekeeping,
*  you can have that. But you know, I saw this happen in hedge funds, hedge funds for a while
*  hoovered up a lot of talent because they were places that had funding and had freedom. And
*  in general, really smart people want to be free and they don't want to think a lot about
*  how they're going to feed themselves. They want to get lost in their minds.
*  So you can either give them productive places to play dangerous places to play.
*  You know, they're either going to break into computers or find vaccines for you
*  or build bombs or build companies. And we're not providing for the people who have to disrupt and
*  have to innovate and trying to channel that effort. We're so focused on this other thing,
*  which is like fairness and safety and fairness and safety, by the way, are really important.
*  I don't want to denigrate them, but the singular focus on fairness and safety without
*  in the same breath being focused on growth and discovery and creation
*  is going to doom us because what we're talking about is we're always talking about divvying up
*  the pie that is as opposed to the pie that will be imagine that you spent all your time trying to
*  divvy up the 13th century pie and you destroyed your ability to get to the 20th century. You'd
*  be an idiot. But one place I think I disagree with you is I don't think you need that many
*  people to empower the geniuses, the innovators, the people who refuse to spend most of their
*  days in meetings about fairness. This is good. Let's have a disagreement. I think podcasts and
*  whatever you call that medium, it's just one little example of a tool that you can give power to,
*  like you and your podcast can have the next Elon Musk and make him a star.
*  Now I see where you're going. Okay. There has been a series of places for people to play
*  and be free and we've lost them successively. What's a good place you remember? Because I
*  disagree with you there too. I think they're still there. You can still play.
*  You interviewed Noam Chomsky. Yes.
*  Okay. Noam Chomsky comes from an era where you can play.
*  Where you can play.
*  Where you could play.
*  At MIT.
*  At MIT.
*  And you can't play. This is where I disagree with you.
*  We've already had this. Go check the Clips channel for the Lex Friedman podcast.
*  I think I wasn't brave enough at that time and I'm not really brave enough now.
*  Come on.
*  Because I don't-
*  Where's the vodka?
*  It's a feeling and people are going to tear me apart. Oh, what are you and you speak from
*  emotion and facts.
*  Wait, wait, wait. What podcast is this? It's yours.
*  Yes.
*  Okay. Tell the people who are currently editing your brain, because I saw that move right now,
*  that they should go find another podcast. Let's get rid of some of your audience right now.
*  Please go find another podcast if you're editing my brain. Nevertheless,
*  all the self-doubt, they're sitting in that brain.
*  Oh my God. I can't stand to watch this, but all right. What is the self-doubt loop that you're in?
*  The thing is, when I walk the halls of MIT, there's bureaucracy, there's administrators
*  that never have done anything interesting in their entire lives. There's meetings. There's-
*  All the usual crap.
*  All the usual crap, but there's in the eyes of individuals, there's this glow of excitement.
*  That has nothing to do with career.
*  I understand this.
*  And it's still a playground. There's little pockets of playgrounds from which genius can
*  emerge still. And they're unaffected by diversity meetings or fairness meetings or blah blah blah.
*  I love to hear that.
*  Yeah? You don't think so?
*  I don't believe it. Because I've watched the change, Lex. I've watched people-
*  We are all editing ourselves all the time. I remember my old mind. I liked it better.
*  All of this relentless focus on critical race theory and critical theory, postmodernism,
*  fairness, social justice, it's making many of us into worse people.
*  Do you think the Matt Damon's of the character is paying attention to any of that?
*  You think that has an effect?
*  Have you seen what happened to Matt Damon himself?
*  Matt Damon has tried to say various things at various times that seem to be relatively
*  innocuous. He can't speak.
*  Let's not mix up. Matt Damon is just an actor.
*  He was just a Harvard student who came up with his own genius screenplay, acted and made it happen.
*  No. We're somewhere else.
*  You don't think you can build the rocket company out of MIT still?
*  I think that there are things that you can still do.
*  But we're losing them.
*  We lose them. We keep losing them.
*  I would say the biggest problem. Here, let me just say what I think the solution would be.
*  Is to fire anybody who is doesn't like who's not faculty, especially young faculty should have way
*  more power and administration should have much less power because right now the administration,
*  which used some of the whom used to be faculty, but they've lost the fire, the spark that gave them.
*  They've lost the memories of the playground.
*  So the people that admire and love the playground, like you could see it in their behavior,
*  should have way more power. And so we should create a systems that give them power.
*  You're very idealistic.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're very, you've got a huge heart.
*  It's a weird time because I don't want to dissuade you from believing beautiful things.
*  Because I see how potent you are. You do all these things,
*  jujitsu, guitar, podcasting, programming, computers, et cetera, et cetera.
*  I don't think you're right. I think we're in a really deeply screwed up place where even the
*  tiny number of, let me give you an alternate version of the dystopia. I do think that there
*  are people who are capable and there's still places to play and cause things to happen that
*  progress the story forward. But if you look at the fire that some of the people are in
*  who fit that profile, like how much crap has Elon Musk taken? Quite considerable.
*  Quite considerable. Right.
*  And not much yet admiration from the.
*  Craig Venter, Jim Watson. These are very difficult people.
*  Steve Jobs is a very difficult guy. You know?
*  Yeah. It is a bit heartbreaking to me. I mean, everybody is different generations.
*  I just, my mind is a little focused on Elon Musk because he's the modern person.
*  Well, you know him. I mean, he's a person to you.
*  I, it hurts my heart to see how few faculty and people with Nobel prizes and so on admire Elon.
*  Like how little prob he gets, he gets a lot of fans from like people who buy his products and,
*  you know, young minds, just excited. But like, why don't we, as an institution, why doesn't MIT
*  say that we want to, we, somebody amongst us will be the next Elon Musk and we want to encourage them.
*  Like say that, say that in meetings, say that like that's success.
*  No kidding. For us as MIT.
*  And they, instead there's this jealousy. It's like, well, here's the crazy.
*  Hear what Elon Musk tweeted. Did you, did you see like how responsible is what he's doing? How
*  the, like just saying all these things that are just dripping with jealousy and basically.
*  I want what he's got. That's the thing. Right. And if you, yeah, here's the weird thing.
*  Rivalry has a different signature. You see, when you know that you're never going to make it,
*  that's the position you take. What is it in Kung Fu Panda, which you've watched now?
*  Yes. Yes. What does Tai Lung say when he's looking for the dragon warrior and the furious
*  five come to defeat him on the bridge? One of them gives up Poe's name accidentally and Tai Lung
*  hears it. Poe. So that is his name. Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary.
*  Right. He's excited. Why is that? Well, you learn about this in boxing. Sometimes you'll see a
*  division or an MMA, which is lousy with talent. Just you can't swing a cat without hitting an
*  amazing, amazing athlete. Sometimes you'll have a division, which at that particular moment has one
*  star and no real competition in that weight class or something. That person is in bad shape because
*  you can't build a legend without the other. When you think of Muhammad Ali, what are the names
*  that you immediately think of? You have to think of the other heavyweights. Liston.
*  Right. So those opponents are in part what made Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali.
*  And that's why the Mayweather McGregor revelation that, okay, this guy has got his opponent's
*  picture in his house. How weird is that? Well, because without the opponent, you may not be
*  able to get there. Now I am not a huge fan of the wrong kinds of rivalries. You have examples in mind.
*  Well, there are rivalries where people take each other's credit and screw each other over. And then
*  there are other rivalries like the RNA Thai club, where these guys were so in love with what they
*  were doing that they couldn't wait to share everything. And Nobel prizes were so abundant
*  that most people got Nobel prizes just for being a member of the RNA Thai club and doing cool stuff.
*  And yeah, that's the golden sweet spot. Most of these people can't do what Elon is doing because
*  they can't break rules. They can't take the pressure. I'll tell you what really concerns
*  me about your perspective. I think that there are a lot of genius ideas inside of people who
*  don't have the stomach for conflict and derision. And I think a lot of those people are female.
*  And I think that until we come up with a world in which we can swat down the trolls,
*  where we can actually cause the trolls not to ruin everything. And I don't necessarily mean by
*  shutting them up. I don't necessarily mean by being brutal to them, but somehow separating off
*  people who are working and people who are trolling. I think that we're losing a huge amount of human
*  genius in part because women in particular are not necessarily going to push an idea if it results
*  in 10 years of being derided. Very few men are willing to do that either. But there are some of
*  us who are so dumb that we will pig-headedly stick to an idea for 10 years even if the world
*  collapses. I don't think that there are as many women who are going to make that calculation,
*  even if they know the idea is correct. And one of the things that I believe technology can help us
*  fight the trolls of all definitions of troll. I believe that a better Twitter can be built.
*  Interesting. I do not. I don't believe that a Twitter successor can be built that solves
*  most of the problems. I think you can always improve what we have, but I don't think that
*  converges in something that really works because I think ultimately the problem is in Twitter.
*  The problem is us. For example, I've recently made a very disturbing realization,
*  which is academics and trolls have very many similar behaviors.
*  Absolutely. It's largely a trolling community.
*  I tend to believe that the trolls are not, it's like the Peter Thiel mini-mind idea,
*  which in all of the trolls, there's the possibility of goodness. And all you have to do,
*  not all you have to do, what you have to do is create technology that incentivizes them to
*  to embrace, to discover, to embrace, to practice the better angels of their nature.
*  And I believe that people actually want to do that. The trolls is a short-term dopamine rush
*  of childish toxicity that all of us want to overcome. I believe that deep within,
*  we want to overcome that. I try to keep myself from believing what you believe.
*  Because you'll be disappointed if it's not true. Because it's dangerous because a lot of these
*  people are implacable foes and there aren't many of them, but when you meet somebody who's like,
*  yeah, I just like screwing people up. I'm here for the pain.
*  I just believe even in them, there's a good- There's a wonderful book that I'm going to
*  recommend to you where I hope this comes from. Maybe I've got the source wrong, but in any event,
*  it's a great book called Maximum City about Bombay. And I believe the conceit is that the
*  author leaves Bombay as a kid and comes back as an adult and he realizes he has to rediscover
*  the city because he can't live in the city he left. So he gets in contact with all of the
*  weird areas of the city and one of them is the underworld. He hangs out with the police, but
*  in the underworld, he's talking to contract killers. And he says, you know, it's really weird.
*  Everybody pleads for their life right before I kill them. And they always say this thing about
*  I've got two kids at home. He says, never say that to a contract killer because we have terrible
*  relationships with our parents. It doesn't endear us to you. And I was just thinking like, oh, wow.
*  So there's a minus sign in front of that statement. You're sitting there saying, you know,
*  I've got a three-year-old. It's like, okay, well, I'm going to take this
*  POS out of that kid's life. Maybe I'll have a chance. You don't know how people are wired.
*  And as much as I hate to say it, there are people whose wiring is so disturbing and so different
*  from yours that you will never guess why you can't reach them or how much pleasure they may have
*  gotten because they may have gone over a point of no return. Nevertheless, you are just a smart
*  guy who is using his intuition to make a hypothesis. You do not know this for sure.
*  And I am an, you know, whatever the hell I am, that has a different hypothesis that even
*  in the darkest human beings that seem to be only full of evil, there's a good person there that
*  could be discovered. And that's one of the reasons I love doing your show is that you have these
*  beliefs even as a Russian. The Russian special. As you know, the Russian, there is a weirdness,
*  which is a total cynicism and total idealism locked together, right? That's very much a part
*  of the Russian character. The reason I was, I was kept bothering you, kept bothering you to have
*  this conversation is I'm really worried about the next couple of months. No kidding. And if there's
*  anybody in this world that could help alleviate my worry by, by at least walking along with me
*  through this worry of mine, it's you. Do you think we're headed towards some kind of civil war,
*  some kind of division that explodes beyond just stuff on Twitter, but something that's really
*  destructive to the fabric of our society? Well, I believe we're in a revolution,
*  as you know, I've called it the no name revolution or N squared revolution. I've been talking about
*  it for years. I don't think, I think waiting for this to be called a civil war is not smart.
*  Only history will call it such fine. But I think that the problem is, is that you're encountering
*  things that you've never seen, trying to fit them into things that you already know.
*  Right. And. But history repeats itself. Yes. Ish.
*  You don't see lessons from history? I do. We see today. But I don't see it repeating itself.
*  What about violence? The famous quote is that it rhymes. It rhymes. I mean, the thing I guess I'm
*  speaking to is violence and. We're in there. The abstraction of violence. Imagine you were
*  coding up violence as an abstract class. Okay. Thank you for speaking to the audience.
*  Trying to lose these people. Come with me. Go on. No, no, no. I, I, I've dealt with your audience
*  and your audience contains the smartest people around. I guarantee you, if I say some stuff,
*  first of all, any wrong thing that I'll say, they're going to detail. So that'll be a little
*  bit of catnip to bring in the smart people, but they'll also digest it for each other.
*  It's one of the great lessons of long form podcasting. If you don't, if you don't waste
*  all your time explaining things, that's the job of the audience to do amongst themselves.
*  They're happy doing the work and those who aren't, they leave. Isn't that great? They'll leave the
*  people who don't want to struggle will leave and get rid of them. I think that the point is you,
*  you would want to say violence is defined relative to a context. So let's call it meta violence so
*  that we don't get into the problem. We already have a term for physical violence, right? So we
*  have meta violence and physical violence. I would say that physical violence is subclassed from
*  meta violence. Meta violence is the disruption of a system. It's sort of, you know, it's a,
*  you know, for example, if a cell dies, you can die through apoptosis or necrosis. Apoptosis is
*  controlled programmed cell death. Necrosis is just like, okay, this didn't work. That was a
*  violent disruption of the system. And this meta class is presumed in the documentation. Is it all
*  negative? No. What are you talking about? So this is part of the problem in the madness of our age,
*  right? Which is if you, if you open up a drawer in your, in your cabinet, right, in your kitchen,
*  and you see knives, spoons, and forks, do you have a sense that the spoons are good utensils and the
*  knives or forks are bad utensils because they're mean? I mean, like if you start thinking in these
*  terms, that knife is there to do violence. That's violence you want done, right? When I cut a mango,
*  I'm doing violence to the mango. The mango expects that I will do violence to it because otherwise
*  I won't be able to get the meat and it won't get its seed spread somewhere else. So in part,
*  violence is absolutely part of our story. So, okay, so there's this meta violence class.
*  Yeah. And what's- So the meta violence class is already, you know, it's a multiple inheritance
*  pattern. Whatever's going on right now inherits from meta violence. No, but there's certain
*  subclasses that allow evil to emerge. So what, what I'm specifically worried about is that-
*  What's on your mind, Lex? What's really going on?
*  Okay. I worry that amidst the chaos of these protests or the chaos that could be created by
*  the feeling that the election does not represent the voice of the people, like saying that
*  whoever gets quote unquote wins the election according to some kind of reporting of the
*  numbers that come out, that's not going to represent what people actually want, who people
*  actually want to be the leader. Like something in that narrative will create so much division
*  that people will resort to literal violence, like protests that really,
*  that the United States loses its united aspect. And because of that, because of that chaos intention,
*  evil people, evil forces, that my definition of evil is, you know, just cruel human beings
*  use that moment to attain power, the kind of power that is ultimately goes against the ideal
*  of the United States. That could be Donald Trump. That could be another human being. It doesn't
*  really matter. My worry is that love doesn't win out in this. The unity doesn't win out in this.
*  And I feel like you and I have responsibility. No small. Yeah, I know. And so how do we let love
*  win in this moment of potential chaos? You're going to have to become a fighter.
*  You have to, you're going to have to throw some serious punches if that's what you want.
*  You have to be Muhammad Ali here because the moment you start criticizing anything,
*  people, you have to be a masterful communicator because that's why you're here.
*  Look, Lex in part, your decency is allowing you to do things that you couldn't otherwise do. I
*  saw that you had Michael Malice on your podcast. Yeah. Now Michael Malice is, I think of somebody
*  who at his best is extremely shrewd and insightful. Yes. He's also got this trolling game,
*  which is quite open about, and you talk to him about it, which I can't stand.
*  And that's, this is the idea. Oh, grandpa doesn't get the internet. Well, I'm grandpa. I don't get
*  the internet. I don't love the trolling. Yeah. There are trolls of the past who were incredibly
*  good. I don't see any of the modern trolls as being that kind of genius level trolling the people
*  who deserve it in the way that they deserve it. Right now, what I see is that anything that stands
*  up gets cut down. Yeah. It's like anything earnest. You have to turn into cynicism and a meme.
*  It's this idea that the people who believe that the world is chaos and has no point are constantly
*  trying to let you know, don't try to use the internet for meaning, for decency, for goodness,
*  because we are going to find out that that's all sanctimonious hypocrisy and we will, we will make
*  you suffer. So I do think that there's a lot of sanctimonious hypocrisy in the world. Some of it,
*  mine, some of it yours, but we all have it. And the trolls somewhat remove that, but it's not a
*  judicious, kind, constructive, compassionate, caring version most of the time. And a lot of those trolls,
*  and I have this feeling about Michael Malice, I don't know whether it's right,
*  that there's somebody who deeply cares and loves beneath it. And that that's motivating some of the
*  trolling behavior. And you and I don't seem to be doing that. I don't see you as almost ever troll.
*  You and I are, I, I'm very much against trolling. I'm very much against trolling. It doesn't mean
*  that it's selective. You know, I'm not even, it's not even true. Like everything we say, we say like
*  I'm forward, I'm against it. This isn't my native language. I speak nuance. I don't speak this
*  internet shit. And the more I have to communicate through internet shit, right? I almost never take
*  a tweet seriously if it contains the letters LMAO, LOL, RTFOL. There's an interesting
*  effect where people say stuff and then finish it with LOL. You put it beautifully that it
*  indicates to me that this is a person, we've talked about like why I wear the stupid suit.
*  Yeah. Is like, this is anti, this is to fight the LOL at the end of sentences. It's take,
*  it's like stand up for the words you're saying. Yeah. Don't finish stuff with LOL,
*  removing completely the responsibility of the content of the sentence that preceded it.
*  Yeah. Also choosing the outfit that works both for men in black and the blues brothers,
*  not a terrible choice. Okay. But getting back, look, Lex, we're not in a position to do this.
*  You need to be seated in a different chair. Your chair is the wrong chair. You're in the wrong
*  chair. It's been so long. All right. I want to talk about you and Joe Biden.
*  Joe Biden was a 29 year old guy with nothing particular going on so far as I can tell.
*  Okay. I know people as impressive at age 29 as Joe Biden, you know, 12 rows back, three,
*  three deep, doesn't matter. Huge number of people. None of them my age can get to where he got to.
*  None of them my age can get to where he got to. Like we're all morons.
*  Anytime somebody takes out, like if you found Eddie Van Halen in a guitar shop,
*  you'd be angry. What is this guy doing repairing guitars?
*  Then somebody said, maybe he loves to repair guitars.
*  Yeah. I mean, what is your piano Russian piano tuner doing? What is my Russian piano? That was
*  the whole point of that story, which is what is it that happened in that life that converted
*  somebody? And I find this, for example, with Russian doctors who are, you know, technicians
*  in offices now, there's a huge amount of talent in the world that's not sitting in its proper seat.
*  And quite honestly, I've gotten to the point where my feeling is we've got to take the seats.
*  Right. And maybe we don't sit in them. Maybe the idea is that we take the seats and we put some
*  smart Gen Z person in the seat and say, look, no chanting. I don't want to hear you say, no justice,
*  no peace. If there aren't verbs, if it rhymes, it's wrong. Like I used to have this thing,
*  things that rhyme are more true. But like in general, if something starts at one, two, three,
*  four, I don't want to hear what the rest of your sentences. Yeah.
*  But I feel like the responsibility that you carry that I carry, this is where Joe Rogan generally
*  removes himself from being, I'm just a comedian. This idea of I'm just a comedian.
*  But at this moment in history, like history literally can pivot on the words of a tattooed
*  or ripped 50 year old comedian. And I think the same is true with you.
*  Okay. Well, I'm interested and I care. Speaking of lyrics, there are many here among us who feel
*  that life is but a joke. That's not us. The hour is getting late. That's not us. In the song,
*  the joker and the thief are on opposite sides of Jesus having this conversation over Jesus.
*  You and I, we've been through that. That's not our fate. That's somebody else's fate to throw spit
*  balls at the internet. That's not your fate. You're an earnest guy. You're filled with love.
*  You're getting the most amazing podcast guests. You're right. That's over the internet. This is
*  the point I'm trying to make that you're saying I'm just a grandpa. I don't know. No, I'm telling
*  you, you're going to get bigger and then you're going to get cut down. You're going to keep
*  ascending for a while, Lex. And then you're saying, and naturally there's, I'm telling you,
*  I watched the same process. People get up to a certain level. And one of the things that's
*  going on in my opinion with Joe Rogan is that when Joe Rogan starts to talk about his misgivings
*  about Joe Biden, in a way that you find at any bar in America about cognitive decline in a 77
*  year old who's about to be 78, I believe in November, we have never had anything remotely
*  as insane as a 78 year old person slated to win the White House. And you're saying when that idea
*  is being communicated, is there something about the disc concept you talk about? The system naturally
*  starts to- Some bad thing happens to Joe or one of Joe's close associates. The ability to destroy
*  people who become inconvenient has been documented. This is what we have done in the past. Whether we
*  are doing it now, we don't know because we are not doing this church committee too. In order to know
*  whether or not you are currently destroying American citizens as we did in the past and
*  as we have documented, as we found out in 1976, the federal government destroyed Americans who
*  had political beliefs that the government didn't want to continue. And I don't know whether you
*  are grasping that one interpretation of why John Stewart and why Joe Rogan and why Bill Maher
*  and all these people to some extent hide behind. It's a joke. It's because they're trying to find
*  a protected class. Is there someplace I can stand and speak the truth, which does not result in my
*  being garbage collected? Interesting. I guess you're right. My intuition is you can stand
*  as you gain more power, you can stand behind your work without a joke.
*  There's a fight over Joe Rogan right now. I mean, I've talked about it for a few years now.
*  People did not understand how big that program was. People didn't understand long-form podcasting.
*  I was derided by people who I think of as being very shrewd for believing in these podcasts as
*  a major force. And most of the people who derided me have said, wow, did I not get things?
*  It's like if you started to propose, you wanted to do the Sopranos in the era of 30-minute sitcoms.
*  You don't get it, man. The American people, they're not interested in these long plot storylines.
*  That's your weird thing? Nobody cares, dude. Everybody just wants short, fast, memorable.
*  And like, okay, so if you do that, you totally miss the opportunity.
*  The savvy people used to say, kid, let me tell you, nobody ever lost a dime underestimating the
*  intelligence of the American people. Well, that was totally wrong because they didn't calculate
*  opportunity costs. I have been talking about the problem of Joe for a long time. The problem is,
*  is that when the system wakes up, they're going to want to control it.
*  And they come up with new different mechanisms of doing that. I guess
*  one interesting one is cancel culture. Well, look at the number of people around Joe
*  who they've come after since they realized that Joe was really big. Joey Diaz, Brian Callan,
*  Chris D'Elia. Now, I'm not saying that those are all related, but I do notice that
*  there are at least correlations between when Joe says something, when something bad happens in
*  Joe's universe, it's easier for me to believe that that's happening when it's happening around
*  Joe himself. But I'm worried about my friend. And I don't necessarily want to push him
*  towards being more if he doesn't want it, because I don't think, I don't want to,
*  I don't want to conscript people. He's got a great life. He's got a great situation. He's done a huge
*  service. Thank God. Do you know, like how much do I owe Joe just for what he's done for you to say
*  nothing of what he's done for me or for Brett or for Sam or any of these people. And, you know,
*  I'd like to think that we all try to give back, but I'm worried about Joe. He's not worried.
*  One of the inspiring things about Joe is, I mean, he's in this war alone and the way he fights the
*  war is by just enjoying life. Well, that's his thing. As long as he stays close to things that
*  he loves and being, you know, one of the things he's honest about his drug use, he loves to hunt.
*  So he's just, he does a certain amount of like semi vice signaling up front.
*  And then you just also know him. This is why every time they try to take him down,
*  you use the N word, you know, it's like, unfortunately, everybody knows who Joe is.
*  And he, yes, he, he doesn't act as if he went to a fancy finishing school.
*  Right. That's not his energy. The fact that you've got some super smart guy who always
*  pretends to be a meathead, just like, you know, like, Hey, I'm a comedian. Like all these defenses
*  and disguises. Okay. You've got the super smart guy who, um, he's admitted to most of the things
*  that, you know, you can, you can take him down for him because everybody's been effectively in his den
*  or his basement. Think about that studio is his basement. People have hung out with Joe so many
*  hours that you can't tell them something about Joe, where they're going to say, wow, I'm going
*  to believe the New York times and not the hundreds of hours I've spent on the Joe Rogan experience.
*  But the cool thing is that this is what inspires me is that the way he's waging war against the
*  system is just by being a good person and, and talking enough hours in a week where that message
*  like bleeds throughout the words in the gaps between. And that, that's so inspiring to me
*  that the good people can win by just being good. And he's kind and he's tough. And he also,
*  he's no pushover. No, I always worry a little bit when I sit down in that chair,
*  you still get scared that he'll call you on some kind of bullshit that you weren't even aware of.
*  No, the first time I was on the show, the energy wasn't great between us. And it was in a sober
*  October situation. So I think I hadn't understood that. And maybe our egos got a little bit off.
*  I don't know. I mean, I was having fun, but maybe it was just too complicated life forms
*  getting to know each other. The first one was probably, yeah, that made me a little nervous
*  for the future. But then, you know, Joe and I have become friends, although sometimes we have
*  miscommunications like on Yom Kippur. I texted him and I said, Joe, you know, I want to apologize
*  for ways I've let you down as a friend that haven't been there for you and appreciate everything
*  you've done for me. Like I get this text back and like, what the fuck is your problem? You're great,
*  dude. I don't know what bad place you're in, but cheer up. It's like, Joe, do you have any Jews in
*  your life that apologize for what they've done? He was just like, dude, have you lost your mind?
*  What the hell's gotten into you? Yeah. What do you think? What do you think about the Spotify
*  thing? What about it? Ask me a question. He's now, as opposed to being just a comedian with a podcast,
*  he now is just a comedian with a podcast who stepped like in the middle of the center of
*  cancel culture, which is like, I know Spotify is in Sweden, but they represent Silicon Valley.
*  They represent the very kind of structures they contain and represent the kind of structures that
*  threaten to destroy the Elans of the world. And he just like stepped like with his Alex Jones and his
*  Joey Diaz just strolled right into the middle of it. I think it's awesome. I love it. But do you
*  think he'll, he's strong enough to, well, I don't know. I mean, I don't even know the right way to
*  ask this, but is he strong enough to persevere? It's a bit interesting. It's like when Alliance
*  decides, wow, that honey badger looks tasty. I'm going to swallow it whole, see what happens.
*  Because I talked to him offline. He really seems to be willing to give away the hundred million,
*  which gives him so much power. Oh, I don't. It's a powerful thing to be able to say, I don't,
*  yeah, to the honey badge. He just strolls in, but he's willing to walk away from anything in this.
*  Well, he's going to walk out the other side of the line. I don't think he's going to go out the way
*  he came in. Yeah. Well, you know what it is? It's Tommy Lee Jones entering the bug. This is like a
*  giant alien. He just walks into it. He just, he gets swallowed by the bug and he blasts out from
*  the inside. I have it as Tommy Lee Jones. Yeah. But anyway, Joe Rogan to you. Yeah. Is that my
*  feeling is this Spotify doesn't understand what they're messing with. I could be wrong,
*  but I'm not. No, you're right. I'm right. Because Joe doesn't need anything, man. I mean, this is
*  the weird thing about it. It's like, I'm sure that he loves all his toys, whatever, blah, blah, blah.
*  He's a rich guy. Yes. He's got F you money. He had F you money a long time ago. And you're not,
*  you know, the other thing about it's a bit weird being friends with a dude like that. It just is,
*  because like you call him up or he'll call you up. And he's like, what's going on in your life?
*  I don't know. Kind of depressed, trying to get some math done. What are you up? Oh dude, I can
*  cheer you up. I just came off of a 29,000 person stadium. It's like, oh cool. How'd you do that?
*  Oh, I don't know. I just announced it on Instagram a few days ago and it's filled up. It's like, oh,
*  damn. Yeah. I mean, that thing is so powerful. Yeah. So there you go. I mean, you could be that
*  too. The instant we go, it takes an interest in politics and saving the world. You might destroy
*  all of that. It's going bye-bye. I promise. I just disagree with you. I mean, cause you have to,
*  you have to do it. Like you've said this many times before. I'll bet you, I'll bet you a bottle of
*  Stoli that you can get, if you get Joe Rogan to get highly politically active and call out the
*  system for all the bullshit that it is in a very pointed and determined fashion.
*  And he doesn't get destroyed. I'll give you, I'll give you the vodka. The vodka? Yeah.
*  That sounds like a pretty damn good deal. But this, you've said this. I mean,
*  no living heroes, my friend, no living heroes. I just, no living heroes. It's, it's just difficult.
*  You just have to be good at it. I mean, if you just say generic political things, no, no, you,
*  you're going to be taken down. But the more heroic you are, the more beautiful you are,
*  the more you will be made to suffer. And if they cannot get you on reputation, if Jesus himself
*  came down, I don't know if I ever read, I probably have never read to you the hit piece I did on
*  Jesus. You don't know about this? No, I did not know. I did hit pieces on all of the best people
*  in the world. So whoever it was who cured cancer, you know, discovered new particles
*  or whatever it is, I did a hit piece against them to prove that I can do it to anybody
*  around anything at any time. Except Eddie Van Halen is what we're talking about.
*  Well, Eddie Van Halen is now dead, but if, if this was a, a situation, you know, hot for teacher
*  canceled. Disrespectful. Absolutely.
*  Also, you know, packaging, uh, female objectification for young men. Clearly Eddie
*  Van Halen is one of the worst people alive. But the skill, the incredible inspiration that is just
*  radiating from his music inspires so many millions that they will fight those canceled pieces. They
*  will fight those. This is your thing. You have this idea that there's a war between good and evil and
*  the good has already been decided. The good has already been decided. The good has already been
*  designated the winner. It's not true, but you're believing that it's true.
*  Take it till you make it. No, I mean, you gotta, it's motivating both of us.
*  Like I also believe that we're going to win because if I don't, then I can't get out of bed.
*  And it's pretty heavy at the moment. Do you think 2021
*  can, uh, can make us feel good about the trajectory of society? So like where we emerged from
*  this year, feeling good. Like there's a smile and their quietest face. And the next time we talk,
*  we'll be doing some kind of duet on guitar and not having this worried look on our faces.
*  No. Okay. But you've also promised you've gone to some house and this in a positive, uh,
*  positive. So, okay. So how do you, how do you turn the no around? What's the, you turn from the no
*  until we get some actually decent people in the right chairs who are not constantly thinking
*  about their next paycheck. I don't see a solution. Let me just say what the prerequisites for a
*  solution are and to, to let you know why I don't think it's coming. First of all, both of these
*  political parties, the leadership of them is disgusting. It has to go. They're tearing us
*  apart. They're, they, they lack the will to be Americans. They don't understand the subtlety
*  of the project. Uh, they're simply the people who figured out how to inhabit the seats. And
*  that is their great achievement. I believe that in order to solve this, you need people who can
*  integrate, who are not partisan at the level of the partisan warriors that we're seeing. People
*  who believe in dividing the pies of the future rather than the present pie as our main task
*  as Americans, because we are built around growth. I'm sorry to say it. Um,
*  you need an ability to have subtle conversations and you need the ability to exclude.
*  And, and, and, you know, at the moment, everyone knows that inclusion is good,
*  which it isn't. It's like saying, well, water is good. If I say water is good,
*  everybody will agree with me. It's not people drown. People need to get dehydrated. It can
*  be lifesaving or life ending. It, it isn't good or bad. Inclusion is not good or bad.
*  Inclusion is just inclusion. Exclusion is part of inclusion. We've taught people that they can
*  reason through the world as, um, sub, you know, Cocker spaniels, they just bark things at each
*  other. You know, I'm for safety. I'm for inclusion. I'm for growth. Oh, really?
*  Do you guys use verbs, dependent clauses? Are there compound complex sentences? Where are we
*  in this sea of nonsense? You have to be able to build a place where you have smart, talented
*  people who represent a diverse group of correct opinions. You need to get rid of almost all of
*  the people who have opinions that are antithetical to what we're trying to accomplish.
*  You need to give them insulation, which we're terrified because we don't trust anybody. So
*  everything has to be transparent. If you're going to the bathroom, I want those walls to be
*  plexiglass so I can see what you're doing. It's like, that's too much transparency. We have too
*  much and not enough at the same time. And then, you know, in essence, um, you need to ensure that
*  people aren't worried about feeding their family every four seconds for being real.
*  None of that is happening. And our billionaires, our billionaires are pathetic. What is the point
*  of billionaires? If you're not going to do billionaire type cool stuff, like saying F you,
*  and I'm going to throw, you know, $3 billion at the project of restoring the national conversation.
*  I don't grasp this. What is the point of creating obscene wealth if we don't have anyone smart
*  enough and caring enough to use it? So I agree with that, that last part for sure.
*  Let me slightly push back on the idea that the leaders themselves are broken. I feel like
*  this goes to the Joe Rogan, uh, Joe Biden and Trump having a debate on that program.
*  I feel like Joe Biden has a lot of really interesting ideas that he's almost forgot how
*  to communicate. He's been fake for so long within the system. Hillary was fake for too long. I'm
*  sure she had real ideas at the beginning that she still was campaigning on decades later.
*  But like if the system, if the platforms empowered you to search, to be honest, to be real,
*  to search for those ideas within yourself, like long form conversations do, then we,
*  even the Donald Trump and Joe Biden leaders we have now would, would take this country to a
*  better place that would unite people. So like we can keep the current Congress. We just need
*  to create better platforms. This is going to the intuition that there's good in Donald Trump.
*  There is depth and complexity and intelligence and the same with Joe Biden. There's good in Joe Biden.
*  And it's just, we're not incentivizing. I mean, there's several things I think are broken. One of
*  them is Twitter. The other is journalism. Just, it's just the platforms of us communicating with
*  each other. One of the reasons that I try to come up with unifying explanations is, is that, you know,
*  if you look at the number of wildfires in California, let's say that we've just seen,
*  if you treat them all as spontaneous, uncorrelated instances, it feels like, oh my God,
*  it's just whack them all. Every time I send a fire truck here, there's a fire over there.
*  So you want to come up with something like a central theory, which is why do I suddenly
*  have a problem when I hadn't had a problem before? So I look for these unifying explanations and I
*  found one the other day that really speaks to me. I mean, people are very frustrated because they've
*  been trained to think about this incorrectly in my opinion, but here's the graph that you need to
*  look at. On the X axis is time by year. And on the Y axis is something like average age
*  of a human. The title of the graph is any desirable situation involving institutions.
*  So that could be CEO. It could be tenured professor.
*  It could be who's getting grants. It could be the age at which people win Nobel prizes.
*  University presidents, all these things go up. In other words, for a long period of time,
*  the average age of the person in a desirable situation has been increasing
*  has been increasing something like nine months for every 12.
*  Those graphs have to go down at some point. The specter of brilliantly put of having five people
*  all born in the 1940s as the final entrance in the presidential context.
*  That makes no sense. Think about how bizarre a thing that nobody's even really talking about.
*  The last five people were all ancient by presidential standards, not one, not two,
*  but five. We are talking about a contest between somebody who is the oldest of the baby boomers.
*  The very beginning of the baby boom, summer of 46 birthday, fighting somebody who is in the silent
*  generation. The silent generation guy at a town hall in Florida gets this question from a gen
*  z guy saying, you know, what's going on with my future? Joe Biden has the audacity to say,
*  I'm a transitional president. You guys, the highly educated one.
*  When has any generation in history needed a transitional 78 year old person to take office?
*  It's bizarre. It's preposterous. That graph is the graph we can't talk about. That graph
*  is the graph of our destruction because it has the, you can make a one line argument, which is
*  sounds like ageism, which isn't a very good argument, but what it does is, is it muddles
*  the conversation and you always have to ask yourself the question. If this conversation
*  becomes muddled, who wins as a result of the muddling? Well, it's a battle, but so let's just
*  win it. Let's win the battle. You give, are you running for sure? I'll run. I was born in Russia.
*  You can't run. So, uh, but we Russians can hack elections. So we'll figure it out. Uh, this is me
*  officially announcing my run. I was born in St Petersburg, Florida. Yeah. Lex, what is it that
*  you really want to ask? I think I want to put some responsibility on the portal, the portal, the portal,
*  the portal, that the portal gives power to the people in that graph. Like, cause you, you put it
*  quite brilliantly that the people that move the world, their age has been going up and not move
*  the world, but put in the position where they get the chance to affect the world. The, these new
*  platforms, I think Twitter falls in, in them, give power to the younger people. It doesn't have to be
*  about Asian necessarily, but the younger thinking people. So that's a promising thing. And you are
*  like, uh, you're like Gandalf. You get to, you get to pick your Frodo's or whatever. I'm not very
*  good with the analogy, but the whole point is for you as Gandalf. I don't know that I make that much
*  sense. Gandalf makes sense. I don't know if people know how to fit me into this ecosystem.
*  I think there's something in my presentation that people find very confusing. No, figure it out. I'm
*  not, I disagree with you, but you need to look at the mirror and think like, what, what is it? Is it,
*  maybe you need a mustache. I don't know, but there's something about figuring out how to be
*  a charismatic communicator in this. And that that's the responsibility. You said like finishing
*  sentences with the LOL is painful for your soul. That's just how somebody lets me know. I don't
*  have to take their opinion seriously. Yeah. It's still the language, the, the way that people are
*  communicating and you're swimming that wave. You have a big platform. I'm, I have a growing platform.
*  It feels like this is the place to give power. I agree. But we're going to get swatted down.
*  I just don't think so. You're wrong. Why are you afraid of the big, like this is, I've studied it
*  because I've studied, let me ask you a question. Lacks.
*  I believe that every society is supposed to have a collection of what I call a break glass in case
*  of emergency people. Yeah. These are people who are universally loved and trusted by your society.
*  For example, David Attenborough, the great British naturalist and presenter, uh, recently came on
*  Instagram. He's worried about the planet. And I said, you know, look, there are very few of these
*  people left. Let's pay attention, find out what he has to say. Maybe, maybe he's going to be an
*  ass. Maybe he's going to be in it. Maybe he's going to say wrong things. Don't know. Tell me about
*  your top 10 universal American heroes. This is not a rhetorical question. No,
*  give me five. Everybody looks to that person and says, yep, the best of us.
*  Not divisive. Well, everybody's an interesting concept. I mean, Elon Musk is very divisive,
*  right? But I'm talking about overwhelmingly people would, would follow that person. If that person
*  gave a rousing, intelligent speech that said we must act now because we're in dire straits.
*  I think a lot of people fall in that category. For me, it would be, uh, and the, and the tech
*  world in the engineering, Elon Musk, Elon Musk, the rock. I'm thinking like, who is the most
*  eloquent actor? So like you think celebrities, so people with platforms, well known.
*  I believe like platform. Yeah. So this goes to Joe, Joe Rogan.
*  First two did not really impress me as being what I said, but okay.
*  Elon several years ago would have. Can you, can you try to Joe Rogan? Why do they fail? Why, why
*  does, why is it? Lots of people treat Joe Rogan as if he's some sort of right-wing racist because
*  they've never watched his program. They don't know who his friends. I don't know.
*  Oh, but when I thought you said everybody, I thought you meant a large enough people were
*  huge change can happen. Not actually literally everybody because I think people who've pulled
*  like people who've pulled off something where everybody's convinced that that person just
*  deeply. I think I've told you the story before, but the one time I've seen the power of a figure
*  like this, I mean, very few times I've been in a large crowd and I've seen people just moved
*  where they would do almost anything good, bad, and different because they were primed.
*  One was a Rolling Stones concert. The other one was Nelson Mandela coming to Boston.
*  And man, you've never seen anything like this. You check out the photos from the banks of the
*  Charles river when Nelson Mandela came. There are people that you need in your dark hours and we
*  can't agree on who they are. And as soon as they emerge, we tar them with shit. We get out the shit
*  branch. Yeah, I just disagree with you. So I think what do we disagree about? Okay. I think it doesn't
*  matter who it is. I think really good speeches are needed and I think a lot. I saw Killer Mike
*  try to give a good speech. Yeah, he did. Well, in Atlanta, right? Yeah. That was something.
*  Very impressed. Yeah. Even Killer Mike immediately gets into this, sell out.
*  Yeah, but he didn't take up the responsibility, I would say. He didn't. Of going bigger.
*  So he was speaking to the community and he was doing what he was doing.
*  On this particular moment, he's exceptional at it. And he was speaking to this particular moment.
*  He didn't take it a step further, which is like giving the same speech, but bigger than race,
*  bigger than this particular moment, but more about the American project.
*  You know, the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson? Yes. Yeah, there you go. That's a good
*  example. Sully, that guy until we screw him up is the kind of thing that I'm talking about.
*  Yeah, exactly. I mean, Jaco, maybe that's another. Jaco is pretty good.
*  Jaco is pretty good. Can't really tell if he's a Democrat or Republican. I don't know. He's
*  an American. That's for damn sure. Yeah. And I think there's a lot of folks. And then,
*  no, I think Jaco, there aren't. That's one of the reasons why Jaco is so important.
*  Yeah. Your podcast, The Portal, is something in my little universe, is something a lot of people
*  really love. And it moves them. They draw a lot of meaning from it. And also, especially in difficult
*  times. It gives them a comfort through this kind of, it's not just nuance. Even when you're talking
*  about chaos, there's love underneath all of it. And I think people would draw a lot of meaning
*  from it, which is why they are wondering why you haven't been doing that many podcasts,
*  or you haven't done it in maybe a month and a half or two months in this most difficult of times.
*  Is there a good reason? Yeah, there are lots of good reasons.
*  So the first one is kind of weird, which is everybody assumes that everyone wants to be famous.
*  And if you say, I don't want to be famous, it's like, oh, you're just saying that because you want
*  to be, everyone to think you're famous. You're not that famous. You know, okay. Yeah.
*  I don't love being as well known as I've become.
*  There's lots of things that are fun about it. It's wonderful that you can go to, I can go to any
*  city in the world and our portal listeners there. All I need to do is put out a tweet and 20 people
*  show up for a drink. And they're amazing people. And they're almost, I mean, you can see my live
*  Q and A's on my Instagram page. If you go to Eric R. Weinstein, I just pick somebody randomly. And
*  I was really worried about it at first. And, you know, maybe I should be worried about it,
*  but in general, people all over the world are just so positive. And so, you know,
*  Yeah. And thoughtful and deep in their story. That's because they're self-selected, right?
*  Yeah. But I don't like the fame. The thing we just described comes with the fame. It's a beautiful
*  thing. You don't, you're, you're worried that it's getting, it's ephemeral. It'll look like it'll turn
*  on you in a heartbeat. Yeah. It'll turn on you in a heartbeat. And the other problem is I don't,
*  I don't like my audience being my audience. I want to get closer to them. I want to talk to them. I
*  want to find out what's, what is this doing in your life? My house fills up with art that people
*  send me. The lightest thing is an effects pedal called something like, I don't know, it was a bow
*  tie overdrive from a guy in Mexico. Right? Yeah. You play electric, by the way, in a tiny little
*  tangent. Do you play electric? I have a Stratocaster, but it doesn't have a strap and I don't know what
*  to do with it. And I have a bad amp. So you should, you should, you should hook me up with the,
*  we'll find it a home maybe. Okay. You're starting to sense that this is too much.
*  No, I want to be, I want to be here. I want to do the work very simply.
*  I don't have an ability to fully explain myself. I don't want to claim that I don't love the fact
*  that how much love do we get from these programs? Like I generically, people are incredibly
*  generous. You know, people have begged me, set up a Patreon account and I haven't been able to do it.
*  I should do it. I've said to everybody, it's a business. It's a business. It's a business.
*  But like they're so used to being defrauded when somebody starts thinking about monetary incentives.
*  My goal was to say, I'm going to keep talking to you about, you want to know why I started doing ads
*  on my show was because I wanted people to think from the get-go, this is a business. This is what
*  I sound like when I'm selling. But you know, like you see, I've lost weight. A lot of that is due to
*  athletic greens, athletic greens, you know, um, code. Uh, what's the, I don't know what my promo
*  code is for athletic greens, probably athletic greens.com slash portal, but doesn't have a portal,
*  but you know, Fitbit who doesn't advertise has also been instrumental as well as a guy
*  named Steven Kates, who, you know, as a fan from the show, found me on the street and just said,
*  I'm a trainer. I want to help train you. It's got me on a, on a good pro, a good path.
*  So, you know, that's one paid advertiser and two people I'm calling out just because, you know,
*  two, two outfits, Steven Kates and Fitbit that have changed my life. I wanted people to say,
*  you know, you don't have to be afraid of advertising. If I do it in this way,
*  this is powering your show. But the whole issue of money is weird because people have these crazy
*  feelings like, Oh, wow. I knew he was a shill. He's a grifter. You know, okay. I didn't love that.
*  I didn't love the issues. So I didn't set up a Patreon. The security issues for talking and
*  being me are significant. And I don't have the kind of money to hire around the clock. I mean,
*  I desperately want to get to a level of wealth where I don't have to think about money.
*  I don't think it's, you know, some people want money because they, they, they need it for status.
*  I think I can handle status if I want it doing this. I don't want the status necessarily. And
*  I don't want, I'd want the status, but I don't want the fame that goes with it.
*  I want the money. I don't want to be seen as this is about money because it's about a substance.
*  Yeah. And try, you know, all of those things that's part of, I haven't solved these issues.
*  I've been feeling bad because people say, where's the portal word. We're desperate. These are
*  difficult times. We have an election coming up. And it's just like, do you think for a moment that
*  I want to explain that I actually got really uncomfortable being as well known as I was? And
*  then what is it that I want? Because I want to be better known and less well known at the same time.
*  It doesn't, there's nothing the audience can do. I don't want the audience to be the audience. That
*  doesn't make sense to people. I want it to be a business, but I don't think people need to fear
*  a business. If the business is open about being a business that, and then that's all to the side.
*  What you're seeing now in front of the election is an incredibly meta violent period in our online
*  existence. And I believe that anybody who attempts to say these two parties are completely screwed
*  at the moment. The leadership of these parties is unsolvable, unworkable. Everyone hears that from
*  inside the two party system. Oh, I get it. He's trying to subtract votes off of Biden. Oh, I get
*  it. He's trying to scuttle Trump. Oh, I get it. This is a play for his show because he's trying to
*  plug into discuss. There's a Bill Hicks routine on marketing. Have you ever seen this? Brilliant.
*  I recommend it to everyone where he comes out on stage and he says, are there any people in
*  marketing and sales in the audience? Woo. Yeah. Okay, great. Can you do us all a favor and die?
*  Everybody laughs. He's like, no, I'm not laughing. I'm being serious. He talks about how marketing
*  is horrible. You're like, where's this act going? Then he gets to the point of it. Oh, I know how
*  you marketing people think Bill's going after that resentment dollar. That's good dollar.
*  Let's get that resentment anti-marketing dollar. Yeah. It's like, no, that's not what I'm saying.
*  I really hate marketers. Oh, that's good. It's the authenticity dollar.
*  You can't escape this kind of negative marketing thought. And I guess
*  that gets to the issue that I don't want to be destroyed in advance of this election.
*  I don't think it's a good use of my relationship to my audience
*  to be broadcasting how completely ridiculous Donald Trump and Joe Biden are as candidates
*  for the president of the United States. Full stop. None of this makes any sense. These moderators
*  of these pseudo debates were in the wrong format with the wrong people. No part of this makes a
*  wit of sense. Can I try to push back several claims? One is
*  I don't believe the systems as they stand now can destroy their Einstein voice. The voice.
*  You're a child. I'm sorry to say that. But well, let me well, it's also possible. It's entirely
*  possible that you're the child. Okay. Because a child would say you would call other people
*  a child. Yeah. Get in the first blow. It's a big reveal. It's a tell.
*  Because the only power they have is to attack you psychologically. No. Well,
*  I believe that the army of people that love you is much more powerful than mainstream media,
*  than people that you might hear it say ridiculous things that you just said, which is try to reduce
*  you like the marketing. Yeah. Thinking I just believe there's an army. Maybe there's a better
*  term of people that see you for who you are and hungry. Like I'm not disputing those things.
*  And what I'm saying, I would venture to say as your therapist that you're actually
*  the battle is all in your mind that you have found these demons in the system
*  and they're just a tiny minority and it's all in your mind. They cannot actually
*  remove. They're not strong enough to remove the voice of Eric Weinstein to silence the voice.
*  I love this. This is some of the best fiction writing I've ever heard.
*  Let me tell you, I have relatives who've known me my entire life. Yeah. Where one article in
*  the New York Times, they will believe that over me. My contention is that only that has no power
*  except to affect your psychology. You know, you have to do is the Rogan thing, which is laugh.
*  Hearing me just laugh. I am laughing. I know, but more I'm telling you something. Yes. Okay.
*  The way this works is through ruin. Ruin can come to anyone. There's no one who cannot be ruined.
*  Every single person is signed up right now to be ruined by the system.
*  But don't you understand that you have more power than the system.
*  You can ruin the system, your Twitter account, the podcast. I agree. That's what I'm telling
*  you about the army. I agree that my Twitter account, my pocket, but what we've seen,
*  for example, you saw what happened to Brett's articles of unity project.
*  Yes. Okay. What happened? The, you mean from on the Twitter site, on the Twitter side, what happened?
*  What happened? Well, actually say the words, say the word. It was blocked or removed from Twitter.
*  Suspended. Sounds suspended. And okay. I have a direct line to Jack. Yeah. Okay. So I'm talking
*  to the CEO who I am crazy enough to still believe in. Good. I do too. I believe it somehow. There's
*  a very strange thing going on with Jack Dorsey. I cannot possibly reconcile the actions with the
*  person I've that that is a next level mind in there. I'm not, I don't know it well enough to
*  say that it's all next level. I'm not claiming he doesn't have any blind spots. Every smart person
*  I know has blind spots. I don't know what he's up against, blah, blah, blah. There's no way that the
*  Jack Dorsey that I've talked to and the Jack Dorsey that interacted over articles of unity can
*  be the same person. He is constrained by that company in some way that doesn't make sense to
*  me either that or he's the most duplicitous person on earth and I'm not believing it. I just don't
*  buy it. Okay. Something horrible is happening. I, my claim is I can remove you functionally from
*  the chessboard in a tiny number of moves. No matter who you are, no matter how virtuous or how much of
*  a bastard you've been your entire life, it doesn't take more than three or four moves to basically
*  neuter you as a force. Yeah. And I disagree that if that's possible, that means I'm not very good at
*  chess. Like unity 2020 was removed from Twitter because it's not good enough. Not within the system.
*  Like the army of people that feel the brilliance of the idea was too small. Okay. But fear,
*  uncertainty and doubt is the name of the game, the coin of the realm. Psychology though, it's not real
*  power. It just affects the mind. Okay. I have a reading assignment for you because you're Russian.
*  You'll really enjoy this as part of the great American tobacco settlement. The tobacco Institute
*  had to disgorge its archives of all of its strategies, all of its skullduggery and put it
*  on the web for all time so that we could all understand how the tobacco companies got together
*  and destroyed people. Right. You see tobacco destroys people. You can see, you know,
*  Scientology destroys people. There are various vindictive organizations that will not tolerate
*  reality and opposition to them. Let's take them down. Okay. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
*  So why aren't you doing the podcast to return? Because that's one of the weapons
*  because war. Well, first of all, if you're at war and I don't want to discuss strategy
*  on a podcast, right. But that's your misunderstanding. What did Montgomery say about
*  Rommel? But wasn't his line that I read your book, you beautiful bastard. It's like, why are you
*  using the tactics that you already explained? Okay. So one of the things I'm doing is I'm not
*  having a strategic conversation with you and a hundred, several hundred thousand of our closest
*  friends. I pulled back because this is not the battle that I know what I'm doing. I do not feel
*  passionately enough about defeating Donald Trump to elect Joe Biden, even if that's the way I'm
*  going to ultimately vote. Right. I don't believe in the Biden Democratic party. I don't believe in
*  the Trump Republican party. So yes, it's an incredibly consequential election, but to me,
*  it's like the Crips and the Bloods and the Latin Kings fighting over the right to extort, you know,
*  a business and the business trying to figure out who it wants to do the extorting.
*  But don't you think, listen, there's very few people that are as good with the English language
*  as you. Don't you think it's possible to draw a line that doesn't, that in between that finds
*  how we find our common humanity that ensures a better 2021 without having to say like
*  Donald Trump is evil or Joe Biden is incompetent or any of that just somehow draw a beautiful line.
*  So much pain. This election is chewing up the integrity of everyone who comments on it.
*  Lex, maybe they're not good enough. They're not good enough. No, I, but the hope is,
*  do you believe in me? Yes. You do. Yeah. Listen to me very carefully.
*  My spider sense, my intuition that has allowed me to survive in the space I've been mouthing off
*  since the eighties tells me this is a super dangerous time for smart people to be spending
*  the dry powder because the election doesn't make sense. It doesn't mean that I don't have a sense
*  that one outcome would be better than the other probably, but the variance on that, I'm not even
*  positive that I'm right. These two options are so completely inappropriate to the world of 2020.
*  What we need is so diametrically opposed to more boomers and more silent generation people
*  trying to sort out a highly technical world being mediated through social media.
*  We need more exclusion. We need more actual elites. The people we've called the elites are
*  not the elite. They need to go. Yeah. We need excellence, competence.
*  We need people who can be trusted behind closed doors and we need to close the doors so we can't
*  see what those people are doing. Here's the thing. Imagine that you had a bunch of people who'd all
*  seen action in combat, had all volunteered to be part of the armed services, had all come
*  from backgrounds where they didn't need to. So you were convinced that these people had put their
*  lives on the line for their country, not for a payday. Imagine you had 10 of these people
*  with technical backgrounds, men, women, black, white, Muslim, Jew, doesn't matter. Right?
*  I would trust those people and I'd close the door. I don't want to know what they talked about. I
*  don't want transparency into all of their negotiations. I want to know that they're
*  patriotic, that they see something in the world bigger than themselves and their family fortunes.
*  I want to know that they're courageous. I want to know that they've got all of our wellbeing
*  and I'm willing to roll the dice. And if they screw us over, I'm going to roll the dice.
*  I disagree with you there because there's a difference in those and Jaco because
*  you're not speaking to people with credentials.
*  No, I'm talking about self-credentialed people. I view Jaco as self-credentialed.
*  But the powerful thing about Jaco is he's not only self-credentialed, but he's
*  been real with people. The magical thing about Jaco is that he's been real with people.
*  The magical thing about Jaco isn't his book, isn't his life story, is he's been
*  talking on a podcast for a long time. There's something real that happens.
*  Okay. So if you took Dan Crenshaw and Tulsi Gabbard and you took Jaco Willing and maybe
*  Jesse Ventura, right? I see where you're going with this.
*  What? You can take Bernie Sanders, who's a lone voice. You take all of these people who've
*  really just risked. Why is Catherine Hepburn the best that Hollywood ever produced?
*  Because she told Hollywood to go fuck itself. Hard. They gave her four Academy Awards and she
*  said, love you, sweeties. I'm going to use them as the doorstops for the bathrooms in my house.
*  See, that's skill. That's what you were talking about. Be Catherine Hepburn.
*  Audrey Hepburn is pretty amazing, but Catherine Hepburn is next level.
*  That's what you're trying to say to me. I'm trying to figure it out, Lex. I don't have
*  the answer yet. What I do know is that this election is chewing people up. I mean two
*  separate things. One, the parties don't have enough integrity that if you comment either for
*  or against, there's a short sequence where you make a comment that's nuanced, you get referenced
*  to something. Take this thing about find people on both sides. That is non-resolved after N years,
*  whether the context should be reported or not. We are in some situation in which Democrats and
*  Republicans are primed to fight each other the way introducing two ants from two different ant
*  colonies always produces a battle. I don't want to be in that fray because those people are going
*  to kill each other mindlessly like robots. Until the election is concluded, do I think this is
*  dire? Yes. Could it be make or break? Absolutely. I'm not saying that. Do I know which way this goes?
*  I can make an excellent argument that we need to elect Joe Biden right now. We've got a situation
*  which can only be cured by voting for Joe Biden. I can make another argument that we could have a
*  situation that can only be cured by defeating Joe Biden right now and all of the things that
*  the modern Democratic Party represents. It's not the lady and the tiger. We're choosing between
*  the tiger and the tiger. It's the Sumatran tiger versus the Siberian tiger. I'm trying to think,
*  well, which tiger do I have a better chance against? The key problem for us politically
*  is that we have to divorce the concept of the center and moderation from kleptocracy.
*  Every time we try to say something like we need more moderate solutions, we need more pluralistic
*  solutions, people will say, wow, you just want to hand us right back into the swamp, don't you?
*  Those swamp people, because the moderates and the swamp people are the same people.
*  So then we have these two crazy wings. We can't have crazy right-wing people. I don't want any
*  tiki torch BS. We can't have crazy left-wing, don't attack my courthouse. Really don't attack
*  my courthouse. And we can't have moderates. It's like, okay, how do we install our children and
*  rape pillage and get these speaking fees when we're out of office and become cozy with the things
*  when we're supposed to be regulating them and then become their lobbyists
*  immediately when we leave office, all of this stuff. We need an entirely different system.
*  And I can't talk about that at the moment. When I talk, people say, oh, wow, so you're going to sit
*  this one out because you're a pussy because you're a coward. Great to know, Eric. We thought better
*  of you. Bye, click. I don't know what to do. But are you thinking of what to do? Yeah. Oh,
*  you better believe it. Look, Brett had this idea of Unity 2020, and I told him it was a
*  wrong idea. I didn't tell him that Unity 2024 was a wrong idea. I didn't tell him that Unity
*  2028 is a wrong idea. And if I were to make the case that he was right and I was wrong,
*  because he's now shuttered the thing, right? I would say that the case to be made that he
*  was correct was, is that by doing this in 2020, we found out what we were up against. It's good
*  to know that Twitter can turn this off at the drop of a hat. Great to know. It's good to know,
*  as we learned that you cannot have meetings of presidential candidates in a primary
*  that are not approved of by the party. Right? Like they've got this thing figured out,
*  so we don't have any way in. And now Unity 2024 makes sense because Unity 2020 was tried.
*  Okay. I don't know that we get to 2024 under all circumstances. And some we do and some we don't.
*  There's a game theoretic thing that I'm not sure you're accounting for, but you probably are. But
*  let me just make an argument. Is Jack Dorsey very likely listens to your podcasts? And
*  this is the power of these words. Something deep went wrong,
*  but we can change it with the power of words. Something went wrong at Twitter. They have so
*  much division on their platform. That's what I'm trying to say. They've gotten, it's not wrong.
*  They just don't know they're understaffed. They have no, they have an insoluble problem. Difficult
*  to solve. They have an insoluble problem. This is the argument I disagree because, well, all
*  right. I'd like to create a competitor. No. So then, you know, give it to me. Yeah. Create
*  the competitor. Show me that you actually have understood this because my guess is,
*  is that most of the things that you'll think about, I mean, I can tell you things I've talked to Jack
*  about, which I know would make Twitter much better. However, I think that this problem of
*  instantaneous communication across the planet and you subtract off all sorts of context and
*  mutual self-knowledge, the problem is us. It's not the platforms. You're thinking about a
*  technological solution. And I'm saying the problem is, is that we are ultimately the product.
*  And I just disagree with that. And there's a lot of, that's probably could save that for tomorrow.
*  I look forward to spending summers in your Villa. When you've, when you debut this product and I
*  would love to angel invest in it. By the way, in terms of money, I'll never have a Villa. Yeah.
*  No, I will always give away everything I own. Don't do that.
*  No, sorry. Uh, invest into like things like you mentioned, awesome things.
*  Invest fine, but a little bit of avuncular advice.
*  Don't pledge to be the person who disgorges themselves of security.
*  Money is freedom. That's what it is. It's a big hunking pile of freedom. Okay. You can choose
*  to use it as the freedom to imprison you if you don't, you know, so you can use it as freedom
*  to make yourself a prisoner of your money. But generally speaking, Lex money is freedom
*  and your voice is important. At least retain the amount of money security you need to follow Joe's
*  advice. What is the point of F you money? If you don't say F you, the number of people who have
*  F you money, who don't say F you indicates the number of people who chose the freedom of their
*  wealth to create a prison. They built a prison with the freedom they had and they walked into it,
*  locked the door. I think it's too difficult not to create it. The reason I want to give away the
*  money is because I just know my own psychology and you create prisons. Our human mind just creates
*  those prisons. The F you money is enough for basic shelter and basic food. That's, that's the optimal
*  don't have kids yet. This is a, okay. This is the problem. This is why I'm sitting. So this is me,
*  single Lex speaking, but future Lex, future Lex, I'm talking to future Lex single,
*  single present Lex, please don't listen. Don't be an ass. You're going to need some money and don't
*  make these pledges to say on a podcast. I'm saying, I want to save you from yourself.
*  You need money to do many of the beautiful things that we're counting on you to do. Don't F it up.
*  Can I talk to you about Roger Penrose? Sure. You've talked to Roger on the portal, but also
*  in between the lines and offline, just everything you've said about Roger Penrose for people who
*  don't know, he just recently, a few days ago, won the, uh, 2020 shared the 2020 Nobel prize for
*  physics. But it's clear to me that he had like a deep personal impact on you, a connection with
*  you, uh, in terms of both your love of mathematics, just the way you see the world. Like this is the
*  Eddie van Halen conversation. This was clearly somebody who's profound in your worldview. Can
*  can you talk about Roger? Can you talk about what it means that he won this highest of prizes
*  just in general? Let's celebrate the man. Yeah. Okay. So first of all, there are two other people
*  who won this prize. I'm sorry. I just didn't happen to know who they were before they won.
*  Roger is a very, it is not Roger in particular, but the class from which Roger comes that is so
*  important. So I would put Roger in the class of Feynman, Einstein, Dirac, Yang.
*  Put Whitten in there. I mean, Whitten is a special case, but
*  Whitten is weirdly the reverse of the Roger Penrose story, right? Because Whitten is the
*  first physicist to win a mathematical fields medal, the highest honor in mathematics.
*  Penrose is in some sense, a mathematician who's now won the Nobel prize. So it's a perfect sort
*  of a couplet. Um, Roger's class means everything to me. That's the highest achievement of the human
*  mind. I'd probably throw Bach in with Feynman and Dirac and company, right? Um,
*  I think that he was so inventive. It was very frustrating to watch this career. It's a little
*  bit frustrating to watch Feynman's career. Um, Feynman was so good and had he been born slightly
*  different at a slightly different time, I believe his claim on physics would be far greater. Um,
*  um, I feel like Penrose in some sense, it came up a very difficult path because you see,
*  Einstein effectively solved most of the most important problems in general relativity right
*  at the beginning. As a result, the children of Einstein are impoverished because there wasn't
*  as much to pick off of the trees and sell at the market. Whereas Bohr didn't and Planck didn't do
*  nearly as good of a job with quantum theory. So there's lots to do in quantum theory.
*  I think that Roger affected me personally, um, by a diagram that I saw in a paper of Herman Gluck
*  at the university of Pennsylvania. It was the first picture I'd ever seen of the hop vibration
*  sketched and that, you know, weirdly I brought that to the Rogan program, um, in order to sort
*  of convey the wonder. It was recapitulating my own journey. I think I probably saw that at like
*  16 or something. It just flipped my mind. Roger is incredibly visual. He's incredibly geometric.
*  He's incredibly sui generis. He just does his own thing. He's got lots of bets. None of them had
*  really come through the way you would hope. And I think they stretched the rules to be blunt about
*  it. Uh, to give him the prize. Yeah, I do. You said this thing on Twitter, which is beautiful
*  that every once in a while comes a human being that gives a value to the prize versus the prize
*  giving value to the human. Two different kinds of prizes. The reason that we care about the Nobel
*  prize isn't because of Alfred Nobel. It's because it came along at the right time to reward, um,
*  Einstein, Dirac, Schrodinger, Feynman. Most of the, most of the people who should have won
*  one, most of the awards are not good in the sense that they don't really follow.
*  The prize is used to rewrite history. That's the problem. So it's, you have, you should have a love
*  hate relationship with it because on the one hand it does focus the world on what really matters.
*  And on the other hand, it distorts what really matters. And both of those functions take place
*  simultaneously. In this case, I think that they violated their own rules slightly.
*  So it wasn't really clearly a case of a prediction and a discovery in the typical fashion,
*  but they like, we better give this award to somebody of that highest caliber to make sure
*  that the prize is fully funded with prestige going forward. That's, that's sort of my weird
*  speculative guess as to what happened. And so Roger's getting on in years and the person should
*  be alive. So they, uh, I think they bent the rules and I think they couldn't have bent it for a
*  better person. And I hope they will not bend the rules out of weakness, but out of strength in
*  future. It would be great to get Madame Wu and, uh, Emmy Nerder, a posthumous prize along with
*  Doug Prasher, George Sudarshan, uh, and George Zweig, as well as Ernst Stuckelberg Nobel prizes.
*  There've been some terrible omissions on the first two being females who revolutionized our view of
*  the world. And I take a very dim view of people pushing for prizes for people from ethnic groups
*  or genders or whatever, in order to make it plural and inclusive if it's not following the work.
*  And I feel very clear that in a few cases, we know there was a real problem with the Nobel committee
*  because, um, we have stunning accomplishments and try to get through a day as a physicist with that
*  Nerder's theorem and try to imagine the universe without Madame Wu's discovery that left and right
*  don't appear to be symmetric. I mean, these are terrible omissions and they're a huge blot on
*  science for not being more inclusive when it matters.
*  Yeah. So just like you said, the Nobel prizes plague by omissions as much as.
*  And distortions and dilutions, for example, Dirac and Schrodinger were, I believe, given the prize
*  in the same year, there's no reason that those two people needed to dilute each other. The same thing
*  with, um, you know, Dyson was an omission. Tomonaga probably got included in part because
*  we had an opportunity to show that something had happened on both sides of the Pacific after the
*  war. Um, but I don't think we needed to dilute, um, Weinberg or Feynman or Schwinger. It just makes
*  me, it makes me somewhat sick. All of these people are such important giants and it has to do with
*  the field. I think not wanting to create luminaries and superstars who could have defended the field
*  from budget cuts and worldly pressure. So I think it's really important that we have
*  absolute superstars because we produce superstars. We acknowledge them, we don't dilute them
*  and that we bend the rules to make sure that the prize stays funded with the prestige that comes
*  from giving it to the Roger Penrose's, uh, Albert Einstein's and Paul Dirac's of the world.
*  Can we talk a little bit about evil? Sure.
*  I haven't actually talked to you about this topic and it's been sitting on my mind
*  mostly because everybody at MIT is quiet about it, which is Jeffrey Epstein. I didn't get a chance
*  to experience what MIT was like at the time when Jeffrey Epstein was part of this,
*  but it's, I'd love to try to understand how evil was allowed to flourish in, in a place that I love.
*  Whether you think, maybe let me ask the question this way. Was it the man evil or was the system
*  evil or is evil too strong a word? Because what I see is the presence of, of this particular human
*  being in the eyes of many destroyed the reputations of many really strong scientists and also weakened
*  the ability to do the right thing. And so I think that's the reason why I think that's the
*  reason why I think that's the reason we're not allowed to talk about the human being.
*  And also weaken the ability, like weaken the institution of MIT by
*  making everybody quiet, like almost making them unable to say anything interesting or difficult.
*  Yeah. And what, what is that and what am I supposed to, uh,
*  Uh, we don't know. Why is everyone quiet about Jeff?
*  When I want to, I want to scream.
*  No, we don't know. Obviously I want to scream about it too. Right.
*  And I probably have said too much about Jeffrey Epstein.
*  Look, something horrible happened. I don't know what it is,
*  but something horrible happened. And you know,
*  at the one thing that, okay, let's just do this.
*  The first thing I need to do is I need to get rid of this woke crap about power
*  differentials. Okay. In general,
*  you can talk about hypergamy and power.
*  Differentials are Russell conjugates of the same concept,
*  just the way particular proportions and symmetries are mathematically
*  provable to be attractive, um, in females to males.
*  Male attractiveness is largely determined by male competence and ability to
*  amass power and success and all of these sorts of things.
*  The relationship between consenting adults is quite frankly,
*  not something I want to sort out the relationship between the sexuality of
*  adults and minors and particularly,
*  you know, there's the, the, the 17, 18 issue.
*  That's very different than 12, 13. Um,
*  we're talking about really sick depravity with respect to what it appears that
*  Jeffrey Epstein was involved in at some level.
*  I believe this story is super complicated in part because I think one thing
*  that Jeffrey Epstein was doing was providing money,
*  encouragement and support to scientists.
*  Another thing he was doing, I believe,
*  was giving tax advice to very rich people.
*  I believe another thing he was doing was, uh,
*  hooking very wealthy people up with young adult females.
*  Another thing he was doing,
*  I think was doing stuff with children that will curl your toes.
*  So between,
*  so there's an entire spectrum of different stuff and at the moment nobody can
*  pull apart or de-conflate anything because the woke thing comes over it and says,
*  you know, I think it's disgusting that, uh, you know,
*  that a 43 year old billionaire would be partying with a 23 year old.
*  Okay. Yeah. I don't want to adjudicate that.
*  I'm worried about 12 and 14 year olds that we're not talking about,
*  but I mostly, I don't think MIT was deep into pedophilia.
*  My guess is that that did not happen.
*  I don't think that the scientists were the targets of the really sick depraved
*  stuff. It's my guess. My,
*  but my guess is that what you're looking at was a government construct.
*  It may have been our government. It may have been a joint government project.
*  Maybe somebody else's government. I don't know.
*  I believe that in part we don't really understand Robert Maxwell.
*  Sorry. Who's Robert Maxwell?
*  Ghislaine Maxwell's father was very active in scientific publishing.
*  I don't know where peer review came from.
*  I would love to run down the relationship between peer review and Robert
*  Maxwell.
*  I would love to run down the missing fortune of Robert Maxwell and the
*  mysterious fortune of Jeffrey Epstein because I don't think Jeffrey Epstein
*  ever ran a hedge fund.
*  I don't think he was a money advisor the way people claimed.
*  So there's two things I want to talk about.
*  So one is the shallow conversations of woke identity politics that you're
*  referring to seems to be removing everyone's ability.
*  No, everyone's willingness. One of the things to talk about like,
*  what the hell is this person and how is he allowed? Most importantly,
*  to how do we prevent it in the future? And from the individual perspective,
*  the question for me is the same question I asked about 1930s Nazi Germany.
*  I've been reading way too much probably,
*  or not enough about that period currently is if I was in Germany at that time,
*  what is the heroic action to take? When I think about MIT with Jeffrey Epstein,
*  what is the heroic action to take? We're not talking about virtue signaling.
*  I wouldn't know what I would like to know what you're up against.
*  Lex, you're not hearing me. The problem here is what was Jeffrey Epstein?
*  Well, that question might be the heroic action to take.
*  That's all I'm trying to say. I'm just trying to get my first question.
*  You have to map the silence with Jeffrey Epstein.
*  What you're describing is a map of the silence at MIT.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, is there a map of the silence in Washington state around Jeffrey Epstein,
*  the Bay area, New York city?
*  The amount of silence around Jeffrey Epstein should be telling you everything.
*  The number of dogs that don't bark is like nothing we've ever seen.
*  You're exactly correct, but I want to know what is it telling us?
*  Because what it's telling me is not some kind of conspiracy,
*  but more a disappointing weakness.
*  We're not some kind of conspiracy.
*  Or my is not some kind of conspiracy, but you gotta be kidding.
*  No, you're so,
*  you're so afraid of saying the word conspiracy that you don't think it's a
*  conspiracy.
*  I personally,
*  I just think it's people who I thought were my heroes just being weak.
*  No, be of good cheer, sir.
*  A cheer.
*  Be of good cheer.
*  Of good cheer.
*  Yeah.
*  You think that there's a conspiracy.
*  I think there is a conspiracy.
*  That'd be a very impressive one.
*  That's the scale of it.
*  I tend to believe that large scale can only be an emergent phenomena.
*  Really?
*  I find this so fascinating.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I always see you as like a logic,
*  logic and love drive your drive, your soul.
*  You're very logical.
*  You're relentless.
*  Got a lot of love in your heart.
*  I believe that if you would review the video,
*  where is it from Dubai or Abu Dhabi of the mysterious hit on the hotel guest.
*  You ever seen this thing?
*  No.
*  Oh, it happened.
*  It's the assassination in 2010,
*  10 years ago of Mahmoud Al Mabu,
*  something like that in Dubai,
*  where I believe 26,
*  uh, separate individuals on multiple teams are shown converging,
*  coming in from all over the world on false passports,
*  uh, pretending to be tennis players or,
*  you know, business people or vacationers.
*  And all of these teams have different functions and they murder this guy in his,
*  in his hotel room and the Dubai,
*  I guess, chief of police or security officer was so,
*  uh, angered that he put together this amazing video that says,
*  we can completely detail what you did.
*  We caught you on closed circuit TV.
*  We don't know exactly who you are because your disguises and your false
*  passports, but yeah, 26 people converged to kill one.
*  No, I don't believe you.
*  I don't believe after co-intel pro an operation paperclip and,
*  uh, operation mockingbird, uh,
*  I don't know whether I should even bring up Rex 84 to not believe in conspiracies
*  is an idiocy.
*  So you, you have a sense that, uh,
*  evil can be as competent or more competent.
*  First of all, when evil wants to operate at scale,
*  it needs to make sure that people don't try to figure out evil.
*  When evil operates at scale,
*  from first principles,
*  you have to realize that evil must not want it investigated.
*  The most efficient way to keep yourself from being investigated.
*  If you are a,
*  an evil institutional player needs to do this repeatedly is to invest in a world
*  in which no one can afford to say the word conspiracy.
*  You will notice that there is a special radioactivity around the word
*  conspiracy. We have provable conspiracies. We have admitted to conspiracies.
*  You have been invited to conspiracy. There is no shortage.
*  Conspiracies are everywhere. Some of them are mundane.
*  Some of them are like price fixing cartels, you know,
*  or trade groups are generally speaking conspiracies.
*  So the first thing you have to realize is that all of us are under a,
*  in a mimetic complex where you can be taken off the chessboard by saying
*  conspiracy theorists get done. It's a one, it's like a one line proof.
*  We don't have to listen to Lex. He said he was a conspiracy theorist on this
*  show. Okay. That is partially distorting our conversation.
*  If you want to ask me about Jeffrey Epstein,
*  you have to agree with me that that is a logical description of what you would
*  have to have if you wanted to commit conspiracies is that you have to make
*  sure that people are dissuaded from investigating this. Okay.
*  Okay.
*  But it's a very, it's a fascinatingly difficult idea then,
*  because the world with conspiracy theories and the world without conspiracy
*  theories to the, to the shallow glance looks the same.
*  Well, my point there is responsible conspiracy theorize where you look at the
*  history of unearthed conspiracies and just like you would with any other topic,
*  just think about how different the rules in your mind are for conspiracy
*  theorizing versus X theorizing where X can be anything. Right.
*  It's like, if I say to you, um,
*  I can say the statement that average weight is not the same between widely
*  separated populations. You'd say, yeah,
*  I'd say average height is not the same between widely separated populations.
*  You'd say, yeah. Then I say, in fact,
*  no continuous variable that has,
*  that shows variation should be expected to be identical between widely separate.
*  Of course, they're like IQ. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Right.
*  So we have a violent reaction to specific topics.
*  So the first thing I want to do is just to notice that conspiracy has that built
*  into everyone's mind.
*  That's really important to state. Yeah. That's,
*  it's very interesting that and as a prerequisite,
*  as you're saying, that would be the first step.
*  If you wanted to pull off a conspiracy in a competent way,
*  that's you would have to first convince the world.
*  I just watched the film 1971 about my favorite conspiracy of all time.
*  I highly recommend it. 1971. Well,
*  the film is titled 1971 and it's about the citizens committee to investigate the
*  FBI, which was a run by a student of Murray Gelman,
*  a physicist and broke into FBI offices in Pennsylvania to steal files,
*  which allowed freedom of information requests that discovered a huge
*  conspiracy.
*  It was a conspiracy that unearthed a conspiracy inside the federal government,
*  a double conspiracy story,
*  which launched multiple conspiracies.
*  I think that the problem with modern Americans is that they are so timid that
*  they don't even learn about the history of conspiracies that we have absolutely
*  proven. So with that done,
*  Jeff Epstein, in my opinion, represented somebody's construction.
*  I don't,
*  it's scary to think about.
*  Yeah. Well, what part of the story isn't scary?
*  I in part did something which I imagine may get me destroyed
*  because I was more worried about being destroyed by somebody else.
*  I had a conversation with around Jeff Epstein, right?
*  So I'm just trying to like get,
*  let it be known that I don't know anything more than I've already said.
*  Now your friends at MIT,
*  their problem is,
*  is that Jeff Epstein showed up as the only person capable of continuing
*  US scientific tradition.
*  You see the US scientific tradition is a little bit like the Russian.
*  It's, it's combative.
*  Okay.
*  And we're a free society and we act like a free society.
*  We're a rich society and we research like we're a rich society.
*  That is historically, and then came the 1970s and William Proxmire and the
*  golden fleece awards and the idea that we have to,
*  we're paying too much and these are welfare queens and we're paying too much.
*  We're paying too much for welfare queens and lab coats and blah,
*  blah, blah, blah, blah. We need more transparency, more oversight.
*  Everything went to hell and the national culture of US science was lost.
*  The thing that produced all this prosperity and security and power was lost.
*  And then Jeff Epstein shows up and a tiny number of funders,
*  maybe Fred Cavley,
*  maybe Yuri Milner, maybe,
*  um, who else would be in this category? Uh, Peter Thiel to an extent.
*  Um, Howard Hughes would be the largest of these things,
*  which has different grant structures than the NIH gave people a modicum of risk
*  taking ability. Okay. Well, when Jeff Epstein showed up,
*  everybody wanted to take risk in science.
*  And suddenly a charismatic billionaire says, Hey, I can make that work for you.
*  Here's a hundred thousand dollars. Go, go research something crazy.
*  Well, that money was supposed to be provided by the federal
*  government under the terms of the endless frontier compact between the federal
*  government and the universities and the federal government and the taxpayers
*  welched. Okay.
*  So that's one place to lay the blame for Jeff Epstein as at the failure of the
*  federal government to honor its, to honor its commitment.
*  Yeah. Right. So the universities became psychopathic.
*  It's not like everybody doesn't remember what we're supposed to be doing to be
*  moral, but the point was there wasn't enough money to be moral.
*  So it was time to, uh,
*  to eye each other as a source of protein, as I like to say.
*  And in that process, Jeffrey Epstein said, Hey, come to my world.
*  We can do it like we used to do.
*  So in part, my point is,
*  is that almost none of your colleagues at MIT have that kind of religious
*  commitment to science that they're willing to go down with ship science.
*  The Galileo Galilei thing became very important to science because occasionally
*  you just have to say, look, this isn't about me and you.
*  This isn't about me and you.
*  I there isn't enough money in the world to buy the kind of legacy I want to
*  leave to this planet. This is one of the great things about science,
*  you know, potentially it's worth dying for.
*  Yeah. I'm glad you said it.
*  Science is one of the things that is best that's worth dying for.
*  I mean, I'm not eager to martyr myself,
*  but I've certainly risked my health, my fortune.
*  You know, I've destroyed myself economically over science and
*  and my, my, my,
*  my need to oppose these sons of bitches in chaired professorships who are
*  destroying our system along with everyone else.
*  Let me bring in grand master and into this
*  way. Master.
*  I think he's a grand master.
*  That would make him a chess playing turtle.
*  So I read some Wikipedia.
*  As she was a master, there's apparently only one grand master. That's a way.
*  Anyway, is the phrase grand master ever uttered in the script?
*  I don't think so. I don't think so. But there's a story. Oh, there's,
*  there's off off script cannon.
*  I'm going to call Glen burger right now and find out if any of this is true.
*  All right. You're not supposed to call out my journalistic integrity,
*  but master way, master way.
*  He says a couple of things I'd like to bring up with you.
*  So one as part of a longer quote recommends that you should find a battle worth
*  fighting.
*  We've talked about several battles just now.
*  What is the battle worth fighting for for Eric Weisstein in the next few months,
*  in the next year?
*  There's only one.
*  Well, it's the Moses. It's the Moses thing.
*  It's time to go. It's time to leave.
*  This place is over to get off the planet.
*  I, yeah, I freak people out when I say that, but like,
*  like look at your world.
*  You just got introduced to the problem of a virus. Wait,
*  wait till it's fusion devices.
*  And you understand what it means to have one interconnected planet with no
*  uncorrelated experiments happening anywhere else. You know,
*  so do you see the foray,
*  your work in physics and maybe like the echoes of it in a ship,
*  Elon, everybody who has a possible plan,
*  to avoid what is coming if we don't have one should work on the plan that he,
*  she thinks best. Right?
*  So Elon wants to do rockets. People misinterpret me. I,
*  Meta Eric says, I don't think that's a smart plan.
*  Regular Eric says
*  all people who have hope should do that thing.
*  Yeah, at least it's Mars, man.
*  At least it's the moon and Mars and maybe Titan and whatever.
*  And I don't think it'll work and it doesn't make sense. And it looks silly.
*  But that's exactly the kind of fight worth fighting.
*  But it's, it's the kind of,
*  it's for the same reason that I went on Brett's unity 2020 thing when I didn't
*  think it had a hope in hell and people are, you know, are making fun of it.
*  It's like,
*  we got to do things that make that make us feel dumb and silly and childish
*  that possibly have a hope of working. Okay. So everybody should do something.
*  My version of this,
*  I am the most hopeful about because I wouldn't have chosen to do it if I
*  thought that Daniel Schmack did burgers wisdom project was a better hope.
*  I'd do that. It's more down to earth in a certain way.
*  I just think that it's more probable. Look,
*  we got from a powered flight with the Wright brothers and wind tunnels to
*  sending back images from the surface of Titan via Huygens Cassini in less than
*  a century. Okay.
*  What we can do if we can change the laws of physics is something we can't even
*  conceive of. It may be that it buys us nothing.
*  And at least we will, we will know why we died on this planet.
*  As a small aside,
*  I think this is not the right time to take the full journey,
*  but I feel like you will guide me like master way did.
*  And I'm the Kung Fu Panda at some point.
*  They only have one conversation. We're on our like,
*  well, we're, we're, we're Jews and they weren't. So we talked too much,
*  but the guy doesn't have to be with words. You don't think Poe is Jewish.
*  It's debatable. We'll have to go back to the Wikipedia. Yeah. Okay.
*  Is there, um,
*  that you would guide me through some more intuition about the source of
*  source code, the source code of our universe.
*  Can you comment on where since we last spoke,
*  where your thinking has been has roamed around geometric community,
*  around that work in physics in this fight?
*  I'm trying to figure out when to release it and how,
*  I mean I've released the video and the video, quite honestly,
*  I think it has a very bizarre reaction.
*  I think one of the things that I've learned from the video,
*  cause the video is coming up on half a million views on YouTube alone to say
*  nothing of the, um, the audio, but
*  yeah, it produced a very strange reaction.
*  One of the things I don't think that I properly understood is that most
*  physicists don't talk in this geometric language.
*  I thought that more of the physics world probably had converted over into
*  manifolds, bundles, differential forms, connections, curvature, tensors, et cetera.
*  And I, I saw a lot of the comments would say things like,
*  I have a PhD in theoretical physics and I'm not even familiar with all of these
*  concepts.
*  And I think that was probably a distortion coming from living in Cambridge,
*  Massachusetts for almost 20 years.
*  So what's the solution to that?
*  Well, I mean, I can translate it into that.
*  I can make this make as much sense as anybody needs to.
*  My problem is my calculation is that as long as the boomers are still in charge,
*  the same people have these perverse incentives on them where they've invested
*  in these programs that didn't work.
*  So they're extremely hostile and kind of difficult to deal with.
*  The fact that I'm not a physicist, um, has its own set of issues,
*  which is that effectively it's like the hermit kingdom. They don't get any visitors.
*  And they don't necessarily want somebody, you know,
*  rolling up and saying, I know how to do physics. So I'm, I'm always very clear.
*  I'm not a physicist. Um, that said,
*  if I wait too long,
*  I don't know that theoretical physics is really going to exist after the boomers
*  because everyone in you, I think you had Wolfram on your program.
*  I don't remember whether he said this to you or Brian Keating,
*  but he said something like everybody got discouraged. It was too hard.
*  We can't do that guys. We cannot do that.
*  There's something about the renormalization revolution that innervated the physics
*  community because it taught them just because you can see in this energy regime
*  doesn't mean you can extrapolate somewhere else unless you understand how,
*  you know,
*  coupling Constance run and what kind of a UV fixed points exist,
*  blah, blah, blah. Somehow that discouraged people from guessing,
*  from believing everything became an effective theory.
*  The beauty of the effective theory wasn't taken to be really the beauty of the
*  universe, just the beauty of an energy level.
*  So I think that re normalization was one of the most important revolutions that
*  ever happened in science and also its interpretation by the physics community
*  was catastrophic. Well,
*  the story I'm telling myself is that in part I'm waiting for them to get weaker,
*  but on the other hand, I don't know that we have any time left. And so,
*  are you also thinking about ways of, uh, you know,
*  you know, the podcast medium is revolutionary for public,
*  for discourse for what I mean, I don't even know the right words for it.
*  Are you thinking of revolutionary ideas for re energizing the physics community?
*  So basically for communicating,
*  look, I have a fantasy. Okay.
*  My fantasy is that all of these things are the same problem.
*  And it goes back to this thing that I read about in, in Feynman's books,
*  about tartaglia. They asked him this question. Like,
*  what's the greatest thing that ever happened in math? And he says,
*  tartaglia is solution of the cubic. It's just like the weirdest answer.
*  So you're like, okay, I'll bite. Why is it tartaglia is solution of the cubic?
*  And he said,
*  because it was the first time a modern person had done something profound that
*  the ancients had failed to do. I was like, Oh, I got it.
*  It's the thing that opens up new psychology that says maybe things are
*  possible again. It's a new orchard.
*  New farmers, new people who can find fruit that they can pick.
*  And once you have one person do that, very often you get many,
*  like one of the things that we were talking about with Eddie Van Halen,
*  the reason that he created a revolution and somebody like Roy Buchanan did not
*  is that you could follow Eddie Van Halen.
*  You couldn't pioneer it and maybe you couldn't play as well and as cleanly and
*  as fast and as inventively, but you could follow.
*  Once you understand that there is a tapping principle, right?
*  It was just the beginning of something called percussive guitar.
*  Um, my belief is that once we start innovating in the present,
*  everything will come because everything that around us is screwed up.
*  On that, let me, with one last question, bring back master Oogway,
*  the probably the most famous quote of his, right?
*  With yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery, but today is a gift.
*  That is why it is called the present.
*  It's very beautiful. Although I would have gone with quit, don't quit noodles.
*  Don't noodles.
*  I feel like people need to know way too much context for that to make sense.
*  It's your audience to hell with context. Yep. They'll figure it out.
*  Well, let me ask, what are you grateful for today?
*  What is your present? We've talked about a lot of dark things,
*  but what do you brings you joy to your heart that I can't believe I'm lucky
*  enough to have this.
*  No, Naila and Zev, uh, my wife,
*  um, the fact that we've got our health, all the,
*  the little things saying grace after meals,
*  you're coming over for Friday night Shabbat dinner. So we'll say,
*  we'll bench together and say grace.
*  It's important to just like this bottle of water in front of me.
*  I made a point, um,
*  of just thinking about how wonderful it is that there's a quenching bottle that
*  happens to be placed in front of me because somebody cared. Yeah. You know,
*  so that small thing made a difference to me. Um,
*  I still have the strength for the fight so far.
*  I think that's something I'm grateful for.
*  I can't believe that I'm not more beaten down after all of this nonsense.
*  Um, I have the most interesting set of friends.
*  I really do. I mean,
*  I'm not that rich by monetary standards,
*  but if there were friend billionaires Forbes would be all over my ass.
*  Um, I just can't believe who I can talk to, you know,
*  at the drop of a hat and I'm really grateful.
*  I'm really grateful.
*  I think this is the end of something profound and it's the beginning of
*  whatever is next and whatever is next could be terminal.
*  Whatever is next could be amazing.
*  Whatever is next could be a return to the horrors of the early 20th century that
*  doesn't manage to go totally catastrophic, but you know,
*  takes hundreds of millions of lives in the process.
*  I'm grateful to having half of my life in the rear view mirror.
*  It may be it took place in a bubble and maybe it was unsustainable,
*  but it was nice to be able to move around the world without a mask.
*  Uh, it was nice to be able to see a little bit of the world,
*  even if it was from a, uh, a cot in a hostel in some country,
*  um, to fall in love.
*  Absolutely. I mean,
*  there's a good life to find the last Indian Jewish girl left.
*  Who knew?
*  Uh, you're a lucky guy. Well, let me just say,
*  actually there's something I wanted to just say before you get to that.
*  I forgot to say something.
*  Falling in love with an intellectual collaborator is a special thing that not
*  everybody gets a chance to do. I think when I met Pia,
*  I fell deeply in love with her, all her normal characteristics.
*  And I, she and I had an antagonistic relationship around, uh,
*  geometry and economics. And then weirdly,
*  you know, just like in a buddy picture where in the first half of the film,
*  they hate each other, uh,
*  the two fields like we're fighting with each other, cats and dogs. And finally,
*  you know, the sexual tension clearly was so,
*  so thick you could cut it with a knife and we came up with geometric
*  marginalism, which is this other theory, not geometric unity,
*  which allowed me to inhabit space
*  with somebody who I already knew intimately and had fallen in love with.
*  And to see the quality and beauty of their mind and to play into dance,
*  it's sort of the intellectual version of the tango. Um,
*  one of the most romantic periods of my life that doesn't fall into most people's
*  experience.
*  But that was a chance to see something totally unexpected.
*  Haven't really had it since because she doesn't want to revisit the material,
*  but something I'm super grateful for. That's very particular and unique.
*  But to flip the tables on you for, uh,
*  hundreds of thousands, I think millions of people
*  I can speak me and them are really grateful. One,
*  that you exist and two, sorry,
*  for your podcast.
*  And I do hope your voice in some form continues to,
*  to reverberate, I think in the,
*  at least in the 2021s and beyond, even if it takes a brief
*  pause.
*  We're pausing at the moment.
*  We've recorded some for future episodes and I'm recording for you.
*  I really appreciate that. I mean, it's, it's earnestness, uh,
*  trades at a discount at the moment because it's easy to make fun of it.
*  And one of the things I like best about you is that you and I are both fairly
*  earnest. We may, we may joke and jab, but honestly,
*  there's a project here in a world to win, as they say. Um, the thing that,
*  uh,
*  I want my and your listeners to know is that I'm not stepping away from the
*  podcast. Um,
*  because I don't appreciate that people really want more. It's not,
*  you know, this is hugely financially costly to me. Um,
*  I want to make sure you guys are getting the best that I can do and destroying
*  myself right in front of an election. I think Lex is incorrect.
*  I think that the forces that are trying to make sure that there aren't any
*  planes in the sky that aren't either colored red or colored blue,
*  um, is a big danger given how angry I am at the system.
*  And I don't want to be removed from the chessboard because if nobody's going to
*  talk about Jeff Epstein, there need to be people.
*  If nobody's going to talk about various things that we've talked about on these
*  programs, I want to make sure that I'm there.
*  Do I think that this is potentially an existential election? Yes.
*  Do I, my positive that I know that my way to bed is the right way out? No,
*  I'm not. I don't know people. I just don't know.
*  And where we are right now seems so dumb and so catastrophic in terms of how it
*  is chewing up smart people.
*  That I decided it's really not about cowardice because I,
*  it's hard for me to restrain myself. I have so many reactions every day.
*  Um,
*  this is really about trying to plan for all of our futures to make sure that I'm
*  around.
*  I had a huge concern that what happened to Brett's articles of unity was going to
*  happen to Brett. It's going to happen to the YouTube channels.
*  I want to make sure that we don't have all of our eggs in one basket.
*  So if something goes wrong over there, so you know,
*  that's the whole idea of it is to make sure that we're not going to be in a
*  mess. The whole idea of the intellectual dark web,
*  which is at some level a loose confederation,
*  it can become a strong confederation. If somebody wants to back it,
*  make it work, it can dissolve so that there really isn't anything.
*  Um, the thing is to be hard to kill because ultimately when the hit pieces come,
*  they don't come for what it is that they're angry at you about.
*  They come for where they can get you.
*  And so it's very important that right in front of an election, um,
*  yeah,
*  I think that the desire of the old system to defend itself,
*  uh, through reputational destruction is one of the most pernicious aspects of
*  the new America.
*  And we have to fight the ability to destroy reputations as a means of
*  institutions,
*  keeping individuals with podcasts and the ability to reach millions like through
*  substack, uh, out of their domain. I don't surrender this domain to them.
*  They have plenty of weaponry with which to fight us.
*  And I believe that they could remove you or me in an instant by the end of today,
*  if they wanted us off the chessboard, we would be off the chessboard.
*  I know that's not your perspective.
*  My goal is to stay here as long as possible to make sure that you have enough of
*  a counterbalancing set of ideas and to,
*  and to let and help other podcasts to start.
*  And my hope is, is that that works, but you know,
*  long heroism, short martyrdom is a good motto for anyone.
*  And I try to remember the short martyrdom part of that.
*  First of all, beautifully put. Second of all,
*  wait to end the conversation and the disagreement,
*  which is how you hook them for the next conversation to be continued.
*  When Lex says,
*  Eric, it's a huge honor. Thank you once again.
*  That's really appreciate every time we get together. Thanks buddy.

*  And now let me leave you with some words from Leonard Cohen in the song titled
*  Hallelujah. Well, maybe there's a God above,
*  but all I've ever learned from love was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.
*  And it's not a cry that you're here at night.
*  It's not somebody who's seen the light. It's a cold and it's a broken.
*  Hallelujah. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
