# Volodymyr Zelenskyy Ukraine, War, Peace, Putin, Trump, NATO, and Freedom  Lex Fridman Podcast #456
**Lex Fridman:** [January 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc)
*  I hope the key of airport will open soon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=0.0s)]
*  Then it will, it will be easier to fly in. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5.48s)]
*  I think that the war will end and president Trump may be the first [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6.28s)]
*  leader to travel here by airplane. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11.16s)]
*  I think it would be, it would be symbolic by airplane. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=13.36s)]
*  Again, January 25th around that date, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=16.64s)]
*  Flying in, meeting the air force one. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=19.32s)]
*  That would be cool. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=21.8s)]
*  There is a perception of corruption. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=23.28s)]
*  People like Donald Trump and Elon Musk really care. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=25.68s)]
*  About fighting corruption. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=29.52s)]
*  What can you say to them to gain their trust that the money is going [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=32.24s)]
*  towards this fight for freedom towards the war effort? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  In most cases, we did not receive money. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  We received weapons and where we saw risks that something could be a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  weapon, we would slap everyone on the wrist. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  And believe me, this is not only about Ukraine on the supply chain. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=51.64s)]
*  Everywhere there are some or other people and companies who want to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  make money because everyone makes money on the war. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  We did not profit from the war. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=64.92s)]
*  If we found someone, believe me, we slapped everyone on the wrist. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=66.72s)]
*  And, and we did that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=71.04s)]
*  We did that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=73.12s)]
*  And we will continue to do so because, because to this day, when someone [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  says that Ukraine was selling weapons and by the way, Russia was the one [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=79.84s)]
*  pushing this narrative, we always responded our soldiers would kill such [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=85.28s)]
*  people with their own hands, without any trial. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=90.4s)]
*  Do you honestly think anyone could steal weapons by the truckload when we [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=94.76s)]
*  ourselves don't have enough on the front lines and yet we have to provide [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=98.92s)]
*  proof to defend ourselves because when there's an abundance of such [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=102.8s)]
*  misinformation, distrust starts to grow. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=106.92s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=111.28s)]
*  People listen to various media outlets, see this and lose faith in you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=111.92s)]
*  In the end, you lose trust and with it, you lose support. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=116.92s)]
*  Therefore, believe me, we are fighting more against disinformation than [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=122.88s)]
*  against particular cases, although I still emphasize once again, at the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=128.24s)]
*  everyday level, such things are still important. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  We catch these, these people and we fight them as if Putin wants to sit down and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=137.92s)]
*  talk, but Ukraine does not. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=146.04s)]
*  This is not true. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  I think that yes, he is in fact, ready to talk. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=151.28s)]
*  Did you talk to him? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=155.12s)]
*  On the phone or what? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  How do you normally talk to him? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=157.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  Normally by the sea. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  The same as with you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=161.32s)]
*  He invites you to the sea with me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=162.48s)]
*  Just the three of us. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=164.44s)]
*  No, no, one of us may drown. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  Who are you good at swimming? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=168.2s)]
*  Yes, I am a good swimmer. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=169.6s)]
*  You're a good swimmer. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, if you think that the president of a country is completely crazy, it is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=171.6s)]
*  really hard to come to an agreement with him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  You have to look at him as a serious person who loves his country and loves [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=181.04s)]
*  the people in his country and he conducts, yes, destructive military actions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=186.92s)]
*  Who are you talking about now? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=190.64s)]
*  Who loves his country? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=191.76s)]
*  Putin. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=192.88s)]
*  Do you think he doesn't love his country? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=194.32s)]
*  No. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=196.84s)]
*  What is his country? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  He happened to consider Ukraine his country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=198.68s)]
*  What is his country? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  When do you think there will be presidential elections in Ukraine? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=202.88s)]
*  The following is a conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=209.64s)]
*  It was an intense, raw and heartfelt conversation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=216.92s)]
*  My goal for which was to understand and to do all I can to push for peace. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=220.0s)]
*  Please allow me to say a few words, first about language, then about the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=227.64s)]
*  president and finally about history. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  Please skip ahead straight to our conversation if you like. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=234.88s)]
*  We spoke in a mix of languages, continuously switching from Ukrainian to Russian to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  English. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=244.48s)]
*  So the interpreter was barely hanging on. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=245.56s)]
*  It was indeed in many ways, a wild ride of a conversation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=249.76s)]
*  As the president said, the first of many. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=254.44s)]
*  Language, like many other things in a time of war is a big deal. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=258.12s)]
*  We had a choice, speaking Russian, Ukrainian or English. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=263.2s)]
*  The president does speak some English, but he's far from fluent in it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=267.32s)]
*  And I sadly don't speak Ukrainian. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=271.8s)]
*  Yet. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  So Russian is the only common language we're both fluent in. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=275.72s)]
*  In case you don't know, the Russian language is one that the president speaks [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=279.68s)]
*  fluently and was his primary language for most of his life. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=283.2s)]
*  It's the language I also speak fluently, to the degree I speak any language [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=287.0s)]
*  fluently, as does a large fraction of the Ukrainian population. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=292.72s)]
*  So the most dynamic and powerful conversation between us would be in Russian [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  without an interpreter, who in this case added about two to three second delay, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=302.67999999999995s)]
*  and frankly, translated partially and poorly, for me at least. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=308.76s)]
*  Taking away my ability to feel the humor, the wit, the brilliance, the pain, the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=313.84s)]
*  anger, the humanity of the person sitting before me that I could clearly feel when [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=318.4s)]
*  he was speaking fluently in the language I understand, Russian. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=324.4s)]
*  But all that said, war changes everything. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=329.24s)]
*  The Ukrainian language has become a symbol of the Ukrainian people's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=333.6s)]
*  fight for freedom and independence. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=337.32s)]
*  So we had a difficult choice of three languages and faced with that choice, we [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=340.92s)]
*  said yes to all three, to the consternation and dismay of the translators. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=346.24s)]
*  We make captions and voiceover audio tracks available in English, Ukrainian, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=353.36s)]
*  and Russian, so you can listen either to a version that is all one language or to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=359.68s)]
*  the original mixed language version with subtitles in your preferred language. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=365.24s)]
*  The default is English overdub. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=369.24s)]
*  On YouTube, you can switch between language audio tracks by clicking the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=372.24s)]
*  settings gear icon, then clicking audio track, and then selecting the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  language you prefer, English, Ukrainian, Russian. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=382.24s)]
*  To listen to the original mixed language version, please select the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=387.76s)]
*  English UK audio track. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  Big thank you to 11 Labs for their help with overdubbing using a mix of AI and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=395.76s)]
*  humans. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=401.0s)]
*  We will continue to explore how to break down the barriers that language creates [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=402.36s)]
*  with AI and otherwise. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=407.2s)]
*  This is a difficult but important endeavor. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=409.24s)]
*  Language, after all, is much more than a cold sequence of facts and logic [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=413.04s)]
*  statements. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=417.44s)]
*  There are words, when spoken in the right sequence and at the right time, that can [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=418.68s)]
*  shake the world and turn the tides of history, that can start and end wars. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=424.52s)]
*  Great leaders can find those words and great translators can help these words [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=432.72s)]
*  reverberate to the outskirts of a divided civilization. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=437.8s)]
*  On another note, let me say that President Zelensky is a truly remarkable [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=442.56s)]
*  person and a historic figure. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=447.16s)]
*  I say this as somebody who deeply understands the geopolitical complexity [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=451.08000000000004s)]
*  and history of the region. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=455.36s)]
*  I am from this region. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=457.40000000000003s)]
*  My parents were both born in Ukraine, Kiev and Kharkiv, both my [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  grandfathers too. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  I was born in Tajikistan and lived for a time there, then in Kiev, then Moscow, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=465.76s)]
*  then United States. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=472.88s)]
*  And while I am now for almost 30 years and to the day I die, I am a proud [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  American. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=481.56s)]
*  My family roots grow deep in the soil of nations that comprised the Soviet Union, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  including Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Tajikistan. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=488.6s)]
*  I've gotten to know and have spoken for hours with members of the president's [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=492.8s)]
*  team and people close to him. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=496.04s)]
*  I spoke to hundreds of Ukrainians since 2022, including soldiers, civilians, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=498.56s)]
*  politicians, artists, religious leaders, journalists, economists, historians and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=504.56s)]
*  technologists. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=509.48s)]
*  I've listened to hundreds of hours of programs that both support and criticize [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=511.24s)]
*  the president in Ukraine, in Russia, in the United States. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=515.64s)]
*  I've read countless books about this war and the long arc of history that led up [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=520.64s)]
*  to it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=525.5999999999999s)]
*  A force to recommend too, at this moment, I would say the Russo-Ukrainian War by [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=527.16s)]
*  Serhii Plohy and The Showman by Simon Schuster, which is a good personal [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=532.24s)]
*  behind the scenes biography of the president focused on 2022. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=539.16s)]
*  But there are many, many more. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=543.7199999999999s)]
*  This is why I can comfortably say that he is a truly singular and remarkable [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=546.1600000000001s)]
*  human being. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=551.76s)]
*  It was an honor and pleasure to talk with him on and off the mic. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=553.2800000000001s)]
*  Now, it is true that I plan to travel to Moscow and to speak with President [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=558.5200000000001s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  And I hope to be back in Kiev as well. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=566.0400000000001s)]
*  As President Zelensky said, this was our first of many more meetings. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=568.4000000000001s)]
*  In all these cases, I seek to do my small part in pushing for peace. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=572.84s)]
*  And in doing all this, I'm deeply grateful for the trust people have given me on all [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=578.2s)]
*  sides. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=582.8s)]
*  For the people attacking me, sometimes lying about me, for the critics in the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=584.64s)]
*  stands, chanting the latest slogans of the mass hysteria machine like the sheep [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=589.92s)]
*  and animal farm. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=595.44s)]
*  I love you too. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=597.4s)]
*  And I assure you that drawing lines between good and evil on a world map is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=598.76s)]
*  much easier than seeing that line between good and evil in every human being, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=604.92s)]
*  including you and me. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=610.48s)]
*  This is what I try to do. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=613.72s)]
*  I'm simply a human being who seeks to find and surface the humanity in others. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=615.52s)]
*  And as I've said, no amount of money, fame, power, access can buy my life [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=620.44s)]
*  by my opinion or my integrity. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=627.92s)]
*  Now, finally, please allow me to briefly overview some history to give background [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=631.7199999999999s)]
*  for several topics that President Zelensky references in this conversation. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=637.12s)]
*  I recommend my conversation with Sergey Plohi and many others about the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=641.36s)]
*  history of the region. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=645.12s)]
*  But here, let me start with 1991, when Ukraine declared its independence and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=646.56s)]
*  the Soviet Union collapsed. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  From this point on, Russia-Ukraine relations were defined in large part by [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  whether Ukraine aligned more with Russia or with the West, meaning Europe, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=659.3599999999999s)]
*  United States, NATO, and so on. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=664.52s)]
*  In 2004, with the Orange Revolution, a pro-Western candidate, Viktor [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=667.56s)]
*  Yushchenko became president. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=672.4s)]
*  In 2010, it went the other way. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=674.5999999999999s)]
*  A pro-Russia candidate, Viktor Yanukovych became president. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=677.0s)]
*  The internal tensions grew, and in 2013, Yurmaidan protests broke out over [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=682.24s)]
*  Yanukovych's decision to suspend talks with the European Union in favor [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=687.36s)]
*  of closer ties with Russia. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=691.92s)]
*  This set forward a chain of important events in 2014. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=694.32s)]
*  On the politics front, Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia, leading to [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=697.72s)]
*  the election of a pro-Western president. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=702.52s)]
*  Also in 2014, on the war front, Russia annexed Crimea and war broke out in [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=705.4799999999999s)]
*  the Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine, which eventually killed over 14,000 [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=711.64s)]
*  people and continued all the way to 2022, when on February 24th, 2022, Russian [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=716.3599999999999s)]
*  forces initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=724.92s)]
*  This is when the world started to really pay attention. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=729.88s)]
*  Now, some history of peace talks. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=733.4s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky won the presidency in 2019, and he discusses in this [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=735.52s)]
*  conversation the ceasefire agreements he made with Vladimir Putin in 2019, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=740.68s)]
*  which was one of many attempts at peace, from the two Minsk agreements in 2014 [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=746.36s)]
*  and 15, to a series of ceasefire agreements in 2018, 19, and 20, all of [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=751.8s)]
*  which failed, in part or in whole. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=758.92s)]
*  All this shows just how difficult ceasefire and peace negotiations are, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=763.6s)]
*  but they are not impossible. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=768.2s)]
*  It is always worth trying over and over again to find the path to peace. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=770.68s)]
*  I believe that presidents Zelensky, Putin, and Trump should meet soon after [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=775.76s)]
*  January 20th this year and give everything they got to negotiate a [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=781.04s)]
*  ceasefire and security guarantees that pave the way for long lasting peace. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=785.92s)]
*  We discussed several ideas for this in this conversation. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=791.92s)]
*  As I said, this was one of my main goals here, to push for peace. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=796.4s)]
*  This trip to Kiev and this conversation was a truly special moment for me in my life. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=801.56s)]
*  It is one I will never forget. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=808.04s)]
*  So to reflect, I say a few more words and answer some questions at the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  very end, if you like to listen. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=813.9599999999999s)]
*  But here, let me say thank you. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=816.1999999999999s)]
*  To everyone for your support over the years. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=819.9200000000001s)]
*  It means the world. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=822.76s)]
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=825.64s)]
*  And now, dear friends, here's the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=827.9200000000001s)]
*  If we can explain why the Ukrainian language is very important, our conversation [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=835.36s)]
*  will be most effective and impactful if we speak in Russian. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=838.9200000000001s)]
*  I speak Russian perfectly, of course, and I understand everything you are talking about. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=841.44s)]
*  However, I can't respond in Russian the entire interview. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=845.96s)]
*  It's because this is how it is today. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  I am not making anything up. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=852.0s)]
*  You can see it all for yourself. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=854.12s)]
*  You can feel and hear it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=855.8000000000001s)]
*  Today, there were 73 missile attacks against us and people were killed. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=857.36s)]
*  There were over 100 drones today. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=862.0400000000001s)]
*  And this is a daily occurrence. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=865.0s)]
*  The people who attack us, they speak Russian. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=868.24s)]
*  They attack people who were only recently told that this was actually in defense of [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=872.36s)]
*  Russian speaking people. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=877.08s)]
*  And this is why I respect me, neither the leader or director of today's Russia, nor [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=879.0s)]
*  the people. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=885.84s)]
*  I just, that's it. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=886.5200000000001s)]
*  And I don't think that you can just pretend that nothing's happening and give Putin a [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=889.2s)]
*  pass once again for saying that we are one people, that we speak one language, et cetera. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=897.56s)]
*  They speak the language of weapons. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=903.52s)]
*  That is a fact. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=905.2399999999999s)]
*  And we are peaceful people, peaceful people who want to protect themselves and defend [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=906.52s)]
*  their freedom and their human choice. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=913.64s)]
*  You know, at the beginning of the war, I addressed Russians in Russian. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=916.92s)]
*  Zero effect. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=928.4399999999999s)]
*  They're mute. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=930.76s)]
*  They do not listen. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=933.16s)]
*  They did not listen. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=934.8399999999999s)]
*  Some are afraid. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=936.5999999999999s)]
*  Some have other issues. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=937.56s)]
*  They have different reasons. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=938.52s)]
*  It's like when a person is drowning, drowning and people walk by because they can't hear [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=939.8399999999999s)]
*  them and someone walks on by crying, afraid to save them. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=943.92s)]
*  It doesn't change anything for the one drowning. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=948.28s)]
*  They need someone to help them. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=951.64s)]
*  This is why I honestly despise these people as they are deaf. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=953.8s)]
*  They began the occupation in the supposed defense of the Russian language. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=957.5999999999999s)]
*  And that's why, with all due respect, I would like to give an interview in Ukrainian. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=963.76s)]
*  This is very, this is very important to me. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=969.0799999999999s)]
*  If there are some points that you want me to explain in Russian, I can certainly do that. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=974.36s)]
*  I can certainly occasionally speak Russian. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=982.76s)]
*  But in general, in general, no, I'm not sure that that you will understand me completely. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=985.16s)]
*  Despite your Ukrainian roots, you are a citizen of the United States, right? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=992.5999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=999.28s)]
*  That's why I'm surprised that you don't understand. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1000.92s)]
*  Well, it was a long time ago. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1006.56s)]
*  I understand that it was a long time ago. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1007.92s)]
*  Moreover, a lot has changed. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1010.88s)]
*  A lot has changed. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1016.4399999999999s)]
*  If I may please allow me to say this in Russian. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1018.84s)]
*  Yes, many things have changed, but I have hope. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1021.8s)]
*  I hope that today many Russians will hear this, that Vladimir Putin will hear this, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1026.96s)]
*  that the American president, Donald Trump and the American people will hear this, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1031.84s)]
*  that everyone will hear this. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1035.76s)]
*  And yes, Ukrainian language is important symbolically, but what is also important [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1037.6s)]
*  is that we understand each other well. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1042.9599999999998s)]
*  For Donald Trump? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1044.4399999999998s)]
*  Is it important for Donald Trump, whether I speak Russian or not? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1045.7199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1048.9199999999998s)]
*  Because unfortunately, and it hurts to admit, but I cannot speak or understand [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1049.76s)]
*  Ukrainian yet, so your wit, dynamism and your humanity will not come [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  through as well and as quickly. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1058.9199999999998s)]
*  Remember, I need to wait for two to three seconds to hear it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1061.1599999999999s)]
*  You have a great sense of humor, great stories with an interpreter translating. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1064.24s)]
*  I simply won't see this, but I understand that it's painful. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1070.16s)]
*  Another reason is that I hoped we could show that even though it is sometimes [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1075.44s)]
*  said that Russian is banned in Ukraine. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1081.2800000000002s)]
*  This is not true. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1083.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm speaking Russian now, right? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1084.8000000000002s)]
*  We have people who speak Russian. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1086.6000000000001s)]
*  This is not true. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1088.0800000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1088.92s)]
*  It's not. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1089.2800000000002s)]
*  It's really not true. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1090.72s)]
*  We disrespect Russian now because of Russians. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1092.68s)]
*  That's all. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1096.32s)]
*  When they were saving Russian speakers, they killed Russian speakers, many [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1097.0s)]
*  people who actually, many of whom are in the East, right? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1102.04s)]
*  In the East, they live. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1107.28s)]
*  Lived in the East. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1109.24s)]
*  They destroyed their houses, destroyed their lives. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1110.72s)]
*  It's not a rhetorical thing. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1113.6s)]
*  It's not all talk and blah, blah, blah. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1114.68s)]
*  I don't have time for blah, blah, blah. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1116.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1118.36s)]
*  So it's a very, very, very important and sensitive moment. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  The message is that we are not one nation. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1123.52s)]
*  We are not, you know, the same country. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1126.4799999999998s)]
*  We're different countries. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1129.52s)]
*  Yes, different countries. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1132.0s)]
*  And I think what is most important is what we're talking about. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1133.1999999999998s)]
*  Not how we're speaking about it. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1139.9599999999998s)]
*  This is what I think. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1142.1999999999998s)]
*  You're a smart guy. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1143.36s)]
*  So you have a lot of experience in dialogue of this kind. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1144.5600000000002s)]
*  That's why I think you will, you will understand me. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1148.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1152.68s)]
*  I, anyway, I think it is far better for Donald Trump to hear my English, not my Russian. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1153.3600000000001s)]
*  Your English is much better than my Ukrainian. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1161.68s)]
*  You're getting better and better. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1164.88s)]
*  That's true. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1165.76s)]
*  I'm a very honest guy. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1166.44s)]
*  That's why I will be very honest with you. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1168.5600000000002s)]
*  Your Ukrainian is not very good, but we will, but we will work on it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1171.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1175.76s)]
*  I have many flaws. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  That's one of them. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1177.28s)]
*  Sometimes I can speak English. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1178.6399999999999s)]
*  Sometimes as I understand, we can be very flexible, right? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1180.36s)]
*  Very flexible. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1184.28s)]
*  Spanish, Swahili. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1185.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1187.96s)]
*  You see? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1188.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1188.72s)]
*  Javier Molina needs to understand this. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1189.1599999999999s)]
*  So by the way, Javier understood me without any words. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1190.84s)]
*  The language of love. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1195.36s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1196.76s)]
*  Of respect. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1197.56s)]
*  Respect. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1198.44s)]
*  I respect him. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1198.84s)]
*  I had a very good conversation with him. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1199.88s)]
*  Really brilliant. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1201.76s)]
*  May I sometimes speak Russian and sometimes English? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1203.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1205.24s)]
*  You can use any language you like. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1205.8s)]
*  And I think that's a very good rule for this first meeting between us. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1208.0s)]
*  As you said, maybe we will meet in the future for the second time. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1212.04s)]
*  Second and third and fourth? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1215.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1217.32s)]
*  This is, this is good. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1217.64s)]
*  You can ask questions in the language you'd like, and I will answer in the language I can. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1219.16s)]
*  Well, you said you wanted to meet by the sea at some point. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1223.92s)]
*  So for our next meeting, let's meet by the sea. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1227.4s)]
*  With pleasure. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1230.36s)]
*  Next time it would be much better to meet by our Ukrainian black or our Azoff Sea. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1231.28s)]
*  You know, I've been to a lot of, I have traveled to many cities in Ukraine, but I [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1237.48s)]
*  have never been to Odessa and everyone tells me that and I don't know why. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1242.32s)]
*  You have to. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1246.16s)]
*  Can you explain to me why everyone loves Odessa so much? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1247.68s)]
*  What's there? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1251.68s)]
*  You know, what's in Odessa? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1253.68s)]
*  That's how they say it. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1255.92s)]
*  What's there in Odessa? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1257.0s)]
*  We've got it all. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1258.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1259.16s)]
*  Odessa. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1260.72s)]
*  I love Odessa because of its particular temperament. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1261.48s)]
*  People have their own, their own accent and it's so, there are many nationalities, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1266.36s)]
*  you know, there are a lot of, lot of stories, authentic Odessa cuisine. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1271.44s)]
*  By the way, you know, the cuisine is very different from others. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1277.24s)]
*  The dishes are not like any other dishes and everything is very tasty. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1281.28s)]
*  Also, there are beautiful people and today, you know, you understand people very well, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1284.76s)]
*  especially after, after the attacks on Odessa, you understand what the people are like, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1294.0s)]
*  just how Odessites are very Ukrainian. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1301.16s)]
*  And that's, that's very cool. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1304.76s)]
*  I love Odessa. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1306.88s)]
*  I go there several times a year. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1307.96s)]
*  I go there several times a year now because, well, now because of strengthening [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1310.6s)]
*  of air defense systems, because of this grain corridor, et cetera. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1316.52s)]
*  I go there more often. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1320.8s)]
*  They have the sun there. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1324.56s)]
*  They have the sea. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1326.1999999999998s)]

*  interesting for you to have a look at it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1377.92s)]

*  Um, if we can go back many years, World War II, tell me the story of your [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1423.44s)]
*  grandfather who fought in World War II. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1429.0s)]
*  My grandfather, he, he graduated from the military, military academy. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1432.52s)]
*  And from the very beginning of the war, he went to fight. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1440.6000000000001s)]
*  He was in the infantry and he fought through the entire war. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1444.04s)]
*  He had many wounds. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1448.3600000000001s)]
*  As they used to say back then, his chest is covered in metals. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1449.56s)]
*  And it's true. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1453.56s)]
*  He had more than 30. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1454.52s)]
*  Yes, more than 30. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1457.88s)]
*  He was the kind of man he was such. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1459.48s)]
*  He was such a serious man. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1464.0800000000002s)]
*  I loved him very much. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1466.96s)]
*  Um, and we had a very close relationship. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1469.1200000000001s)]
*  Um, he didn't like to tell details about the war. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1472.68s)]
*  He never, he never boasted. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1476.0s)]
*  Although I asked him as a boy would, how many fascists did you kill? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1479.04s)]
*  He never talked about it. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1485.8400000000001s)]
*  He believed that the war was a great, a great tragedy. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1487.44s)]
*  Uh, a tragedy for everyone. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1493.24s)]
*  And, uh, Ukraine was occupied and it was a tragedy for Ukraine, a tragedy for [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1497.64s)]
*  Europe and a tragedy for the Jewish people, his own brothers, his entire [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1504.28s)]
*  family were executed. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1511.16s)]
*  They were tortured by fascists who had occupied Ukraine and their village. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1514.24s)]
*  His father was the head of the village and he was killed. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1523.32s)]
*  They were shot. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1529.24s)]
*  And he was killed. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1530.64s)]
*  They were shot. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1531.96s)]
*  It was a mass, a mass grave, right? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1534.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1539.24s)]
*  It was a communal burial. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1539.92s)]
*  Some of them were killed outright and others were, they were buried alive. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1541.36s)]
*  His four brothers, they all went to war. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1547.44s)]
*  As soon as the war began, they were all there. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1550.6s)]
*  Um, he was the only one who had a military education and they all died [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1553.6s)]
*  in the war. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1560.16s)]
*  He was the only one who came back. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1561.8000000000002s)]
*  He had nobody. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1564.0s)]
*  He came back and he found, found my grandmother, his future wife. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1566.28s)]
*  And she was, she managed, what was it called then? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1575.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1578.48s)]
*  They don't have them anymore. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1578.92s)]
*  It was a childcare facility and orphanage, so to speak, a place where orphans lived. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1580.52s)]
*  Children who, who don't have parents, children of war. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1588.96s)]
*  And she managed this childcare facility with difficult children, as they used to [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1594.48s)]
*  call them, difficult children who went through the war, who saw their parents [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1599.76s)]
*  killed and this is how they met because, um, these difficult children, they, well, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1605.24s)]
*  sometimes behave differently. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1613.96s)]
*  They could steal something. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1615.36s)]
*  Do something bad. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1616.56s)]
*  There were, um, many, many children in the orphanage. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1618.1599999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's how she met my grandfather and I loved him very much. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1624.3999999999999s)]
*  And I think that my grandfather frankly would never have believed [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1632.12s)]
*  that this war is possible. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1638.76s)]
*  He would never have believed it because he worked in the police after the war. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1641.48s)]
*  He was a Colonel. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1645.76s)]
*  He worked in criminal investigation all his life. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1647.52s)]
*  So he fought with bandits all his life after the second world war. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1653.72s)]
*  But also I believe he fought for justice all his life and we all lived in one apartment. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1663.04s)]
*  And even after his death, I lived with both of my grandmothers and my parents, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1670.6s)]
*  two grandmothers who both lost their husbands. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1676.48s)]
*  Both of them died. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1680.48s)]
*  Well, it was an ordinary family, an ordinary family that lived like everyone [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1682.44s)]
*  lived back then in the Soviet Union. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1688.2s)]
*  And even after the Soviets in the nineties, we lived in one apartment all together. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1690.96s)]
*  We lived in one apartment all together. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1696.92s)]
*  What else is there to say? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1701.36s)]
*  But I think the most important thing was values, respect. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1703.72s)]
*  They gave me an education. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1709.92s)]
*  My parents gave me an education. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1712.08s)]
*  No one left me money or apartments, so I didn't inherit anything material. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1714.12s)]
*  But I believe that our real inheritance is here in our minds and in our hearts. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1720.0s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1726.48s)]
*  One second. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1735.48s)]
*  So if I'm sorry, if you tell a joke, I will laugh about one, two or three seconds later. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1737.08s)]
*  There's a delay. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1744.52s)]
*  So ordinary family, but not an ordinary time. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1746.2s)]
*  World War Two. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1751.1200000000001s)]
*  World War Two. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1752.4s)]
*  Speaking of mass graves, I was at Bob and Yar yesterday. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1753.92s)]
*  A large part of my family died there. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1757.72s)]
*  In moments like this, such a place serves as a stark reminder of the profound [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1760.08s)]
*  historical gravity of the Second World War. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1764.2s)]
*  I remember, I remember this song from my youth on June 22nd at four o'clock. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1768.44s)]
*  Keeve was bombed and the war began. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1774.48s)]
*  I always wondered how it would feel to live in a moment when, when everything changed. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1776.68s)]
*  The path of humanity completely shifts in a single moment. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1782.2s)]
*  Just like that. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1786.0800000000002s)]
*  What do you think, what do you think about that moment in 1941? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1787.52s)]
*  Now after the 2022 invasion, how do you perceive the Second World War [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1793.76s)]
*  after you have witnessed all of it? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1797.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, um, well, firstly, I think it's a very, very, very, very, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1800.3200000000002s)]
*  the war actually started earlier. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1807.44s)]
*  It started here in Ukraine. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1811.0s)]
*  Keeve was bombed as you quoted, but the war had already begun before that. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1813.0800000000002s)]
*  And I think I perceived it, um, as a start of the full scale invasion. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1819.92s)]
*  Well, I think it's hard. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1829.16s)]
*  It's hard to understand. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1835.4s)]
*  Why nobody wants to listen, look at and analyze history. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1837.48s)]
*  War, the rise of fascism and Nazism, the emergence of Hitler, Goebbels [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1845.96s)]
*  and their entire team at the time. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1854.48s)]
*  This wasn't just about one party or even one country. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1856.8400000000001s)]
*  It was, uh, essentially a wave, a wave of hatred, a wave of one race, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1860.72s)]
*  um, one race above the rest. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1872.8000000000002s)]
*  They were in fact constructing and ultimately implemented a theory around [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1877.3200000000002s)]
*  this idea later seizing Europe. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1882.64s)]
*  Um, they created a theory of one nation, one race, one world, their world. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1886.1200000000001s)]
*  Of course, this idea is absolutely senseless, but it has become radicalized [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1893.64s)]
*  over the years and even gained support. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1898.96s)]
*  A vision of one world and in principle, the so-called Russian world, the ideology [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1903.4s)]
*  Putin promotes and imposes, it wasn't originally like that. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1909.28s)]
*  He was a different person back then, or maybe he was always like this, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1914.3999999999999s)]
*  but his rhetoric was different. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1918.1599999999999s)]
*  At the beginning, remember he talked about the EU and even about Russia's [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1920.24s)]
*  future being tied to NATO. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1924.8799999999999s)]
*  There were even talks of joining the European Union, NATO. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1926.52s)]
*  He spoke about shared values with the West. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1930.0s)]
*  That's how it all sounded back then. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1932.6399999999999s)]
*  And we must also look at Hitler who was seriously, um, before the radical idea [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1934.9599999999998s)]
*  of taking over the whole world, he actually made certain steps and everyone [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1942.92s)]
*  believed he was helping the economy. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1950.3200000000002s)]
*  And to be fair, he did take some steps in that direction, but he [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1952.52s)]
*  was a terrifying person. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1957.44s)]
*  None of those actions justify him, nor do they excuse his actions. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1960.96s)]
*  And that's why we cannot look at the second world war as if it started in 1939. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1967.1200000000001s)]
*  It didn't begin in 1941 either. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1972.2s)]
*  We need to draw conclusions. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1974.96s)]
*  When did it start? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1976.68s)]
*  With the weaknesses of the world. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1977.92s)]
*  The division of European states, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, all of this [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1981.0s)]
*  happened before 1941, people who were more informed, those who dug deeper, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1986.04s)]
*  whether they were politicians or not, whether they were from different walks [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1991.64s)]
*  of life, including business, which was different back then, were [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=1997.92s)]
*  speaking about all of this. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2004.5600000000002s)]
*  Hitler won't stop. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2007.0s)]
*  There'll be a world war. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2009.96s)]
*  Hitler will destroy nations. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2012.88s)]
*  Nations. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2016.16s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2017.5200000000002s)]
*  Someone looked the other way. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2018.5200000000002s)]
*  What I told you about Europe was sinking then I gave you an example of it, but [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2020.44s)]
*  the whole world looked the other way and didn't pay attention and said, no, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2025.76s)]
*  we can negotiate with him. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2030.44s)]
*  I'm telling you, he is okay. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2032.68s)]
*  We can negotiate with him. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2034.0s)]
*  He's just more right-leaning or it does not matter what they said. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2035.2s)]
*  He's just, he's just pro, very pro nationalist. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2038.64s)]
*  This is all nonsense and this is not the first time. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2045.2s)]
*  And Hitler isn't the first such case in history. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2050.96s)]
*  We're dealing with a person who is allowed to stick to this desire to destroy. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2055.3199999999997s)]
*  He was consumed by it and enjoying it. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2067.4799999999996s)]
*  And what happened to Hitler? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2070.52s)]
*  Now, what about Putin? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2072.0s)]
*  This invasion was also at four in the morning, around four in the morning. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2074.08s)]
*  There were missile strikes on Ukraine. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2079.24s)]
*  This is the same. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2081.8399999999997s)]
*  I believe that intentions are also the same, but more on that later. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2082.92s)]
*  By the way, you tell me if this is too long, you can stop me. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2087.0s)]
*  Never long enough. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2093.0s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2094.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2095.1200000000003s)]
*  So it happened here around four in the morning. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2095.6800000000003s)]
*  I, before this, I must honestly say, everyone said something, predicted [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2099.6800000000003s)]
*  something, et cetera, but I asked only for one thing. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2109.0400000000004s)]
*  Primarily from the United States. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2112.96s)]
*  If you are sure, if you have the evidence, if you talk to him and he tells you that [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2114.92s)]
*  there'll be an invasion, if all this scares you, I only asked for two things. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2119.5200000000004s)]
*  Send us weapons or better yet, strengthen us with preventive measures. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2125.0800000000004s)]
*  So there would be no war. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2132.32s)]
*  It wasn't the weapons that I was asking for. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2135.6800000000003s)]
*  I asked for sanctions. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2138.84s)]
*  Intimidate him. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2140.7200000000003s)]
*  Please don't say that if he comes, if he crosses borders, if he kills, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2141.72s)]
*  we're imposing sanctions. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2147.16s)]
*  Well, this is complete bullshit. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2148.72s)]
*  Sorry, but really. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2150.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, I understand this. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2153.72s)]
*  Oh, wonderful. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2154.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2155.2799999999997s)]
*  I understood one word. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2155.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2157.7999999999997s)]
*  So they did not help. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2160.64s)]
*  I believe that no, and this is a fact. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2163.0s)]
*  We didn't receive help. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2166.2s)]
*  If we assume that words are help, well, then yes, we received a lot of it because [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2168.7599999999998s)]
*  there were plenty of words, even more than plenty. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2175.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2180.64s)]
*  At four in the morning, there were strikes. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2182.92s)]
*  Morally, is it possible to prepare for war? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2187.7999999999997s)]
*  No, it doesn't happen. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2191.2799999999997s)]
*  Like you read in books, see in movies and so on. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2193.0s)]
*  What happens to you? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2196.2799999999997s)]
*  I was just looking at my wife and children. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2197.8s)]
*  My children were asleep, but my wife was awake. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2201.12s)]
*  There were strikes, missile strikes. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2204.52s)]
*  We heard them. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2207.12s)]
*  To you as a living person, how can this be? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2211.32s)]
*  You just can't fully believe this. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2217.04s)]
*  You just don't understand why now given everything that happened [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2221.8s)]
*  in World War II when millions of people died, none of it mattered. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2227.16s)]
*  Still at four, at four in the morning, around four, three forty, three forty five. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2236.68s)]
*  Remember around this time? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2242.44s)]
*  Yes, there were missile strikes. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2243.92s)]
*  And later, by the way, a few days after, after the first days of the war, I [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2246.52s)]
*  spoke with Lukashenko on the phone and he apologized. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2256.08s)]
*  And he said that it was not me. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2264.2s)]
*  Missiles were launched from my territory and Putin was the one launching them. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2266.72s)]
*  These are his words. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2272.48s)]
*  I have witnesses and I apologize, he said. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2274.2799999999997s)]
*  But believe me, that's what he told me. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2278.88s)]
*  Volodya, this is not me. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2281.08s)]
*  I'm not in charge, he told me. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2284.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm not in charge. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2286.08s)]
*  These are just missiles. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2287.0s)]
*  This is Putin. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2288.16s)]
*  I told him, don't do that. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2289.0s)]
*  This was done without me. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2290.88s)]
*  That's it. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2293.16s)]
*  He just on the phone. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2294.16s)]
*  I remember this conversation. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2296.44s)]
*  I told him that I believed. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2298.92s)]
*  I told him, you are a murderer too. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2301.4s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2304.4s)]
*  And he told me, you must understand. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2306.7599999999998s)]
*  You can't fight the Russians. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2310.04s)]
*  I told him that we never fought them. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2311.6s)]
*  I said, it's war. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2313.36s)]
*  The missiles came from your land, from Belarus. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2315.32s)]
*  How did you allow this? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2318.56s)]
*  Then he replied, all right, retaliate then. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2320.32s)]
*  I still remember him telling me, hit the refinery. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2324.52s)]
*  You know how much I care about it. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2329.4s)]
*  Moser oil refinery, is that it? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2330.88s)]
*  Can't recall. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2332.64s)]
*  Moser oil refinery. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2333.76s)]
*  I told him, what are you on about? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2335.12s)]
*  What retaliation? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2337.88s)]
*  Forgive me, Volodya. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2340.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2342.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2342.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2342.76s)]
*  This, this was at five in the morning? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2343.64s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2346.12s)]
*  This was during the first or maybe the second day, second or third day of the war. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2346.68s)]
*  Ah, I see. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2350.56s)]
*  Well, after that, I went back home. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2351.68s)]
*  I was home with my children, with my wife. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2356.04s)]
*  I just went to my wife very quickly that night at four o'clock. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2361.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2364.7999999999997s)]
*  And just told her, get the children, get ready. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2365.08s)]
*  You'll probably need to go to my office very soon. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2368.0s)]
*  And I left. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2371.12s)]
*  That's it. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2371.9599999999996s)]
*  At this moment, you're, you're no longer a father. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2373.7599999999998s)]
*  What happened to me, unfortunately, because I believe that this is, and not [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2379.08s)]
*  only do I believe, I understand, especially now that all of this is the most important [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2386.2s)]
*  thing because your country is your family. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2391.56s)]
*  The strength is in your family and this is the most important thing. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2397.04s)]
*  And I'm the president and therefore I had to stop being a father in my own family. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2400.8s)]
*  And my wife had to do everything. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2406.6000000000004s)]
*  She had to do everything regarding children, regarding safety. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2409.0800000000004s)]
*  And, and I had to deal with the state because I'm the president and this is my duty. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2414.1600000000003s)]
*  And I, by the way, am, am, am taking this very seriously. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2420.52s)]
*  I went to the office and here we are now. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2426.88s)]
*  You're very welcome. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2429.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, at that moment, on February 24th, 2022, everything changed again, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2431.36s)]
*  just like in June, 1941, everything changed and, uh, history took a turn. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2437.36s)]
*  The history of humanity took a turn. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2443.5600000000004s)]
*  And for you too, you were the president. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2445.8s)]
*  Uh, you were, you were talking about fighting corruption, about the country's [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2450.32s)]
*  freedom, about interesting and innovative reforms, but that morning, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2454.6800000000003s)]
*  of February 22nd, everything changed. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2460.96s)]
*  Could you tell me about that morning? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2464.2400000000002s)]
*  The details of your actions? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2465.92s)]
*  When you had to quickly make difficult decisions. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2469.6400000000003s)]
*  Uh, what was the process for you? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2474.32s)]
*  How did you make these decisions? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2476.4s)]
*  Did you discuss them with people you trust to understand how to respond to this invasion [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  in every technical, political, and military aspect? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2484.6400000000003s)]
*  What was the process for you? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2490.2400000000002s)]
*  How did you make the decision? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2491.44s)]
*  According to our legislation in principle, I'm, I'm, I'm the supreme [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2493.88s)]
*  commander of the armed forces of Ukraine. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2499.1600000000003s)]
*  So I had to give corresponding orders. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2501.4s)]
*  Yes, I have a military office. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2504.52s)]
*  And then later there was a military headquarters where all key people gathered. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2506.8s)]
*  This is not only about the military, it's about energy. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2510.76s)]
*  Et cetera, all key things. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2513.12s)]
*  But at that moment, I made the decisions quickly and without a doubt. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2514.56s)]
*  And, and I cannot say that I am just that kind of person. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2521.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm just a living person who believed that if help is needed right now to, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2526.2s)]
*  to help, to help evacuate people, help with children, several cities were blocked. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2531.7599999999998s)]
*  Several cities were blocked. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2538.6s)]
*  I was only thinking about how to deliver food there within, within a day. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2540.6s)]
*  We did a lot of things, although we understood that, that they, in fact, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2547.12s)]
*  occupy part of our state and it, we distributed weapons to people. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2554.92s)]
*  That's how it was. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2566.88s)]
*  Trucks came and simply distributed weapons to people so that they could [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2569.4s)]
*  defend the capital to ordinary people, just on the street, to ordinary people. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2574.52s)]
*  Who, who understood that if the Russians entered a city, then we would have the [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2580.2400000000002s)]
*  same thing that's happening in other cities per the information we received. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2586.92s)]
*  Um, thanks to digitalization, by the way, we had very good [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2591.92s)]
*  digitalization before this and we preserved a lot. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2596.52s)]
*  And even when they were surrounding certain cities, a lot of things still [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2600.32s)]
*  worked, the banking system, the internet, we had television and thanks to this, I [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2607.08s)]
*  made several decisions to ensure that people are united and have all the information. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2613.12s)]
*  Russia is very good at spreading large scale disinformation. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2621.32s)]
*  Fortunately, I have two decades of experience, two decades of experience [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2626.96s)]
*  managing a production studio, TV channels and large media resources. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2633.56s)]
*  I understood that we needed to build an information network very quickly. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2641.4s)]
*  Thanks to this, I began to address the people constantly. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2647.6s)]
*  This happened several times, three to five times a day. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2651.08s)]
*  In fact, I became that, uh, uh, an information source for people who were [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2654.36s)]
*  in cities that were cut off from other information. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2662.6800000000003s)]
*  And it was very important for me to keep, uh, all things digital, to keep the [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2667.1200000000003s)]
*  internet, to stay in touch with everyone, with all the people. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2672.52s)]
*  Initially, that's the contact we had. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2677.7200000000003s)]
*  And then, uh, we also build a media platform. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2679.64s)]
*  So, um, where we had all the news agencies, agencies of Ukraine, and this [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2683.8399999999997s)]
*  network was called Marathon and it was also very important for the people to [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2690.48s)]
*  trust us and people had to receive information. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2696.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2699.64s)]
*  There were waves. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2700.6s)]
*  There were waves of Russian on the first day who said he ran away. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2702.2799999999997s)]
*  I had to go out into the street. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2708.4s)]
*  I left the office and went outside. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2711.0s)]
*  I had to do this because I was showing that this was no green screen, you know, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2713.28s)]
*  to show that it was the street, not some digital, some digital manipulation. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2717.64s)]
*  I mean, I did these things. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2724.04s)]
*  Then I touched various objects. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2725.48s)]
*  Now people might think that these are small things, but I was actually [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2727.6800000000003s)]
*  showing that I was in a real place. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2732.04s)]
*  All of this had an impact. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2735.3599999999997s)]
*  I was absolutely sure of my actions and these contacts, several contacts. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2736.8799999999997s)]
*  And then I spoke to the Russians. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2743.0s)]
*  I addressed Russians. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2745.4399999999996s)]
*  I really did. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2746.4399999999996s)]
*  And then only after that I gathered, it was the first day when I invited [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2747.68s)]
*  all of the journalists here, wasn't it? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2753.16s)]
*  That was on the first day, I think, well, not here, here to the [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2755.2799999999997s)]
*  press center in this building. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2760.4799999999996s)]
*  I talked to journalists. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2762.1600000000003s)]
*  I asked them not to leave because we needed weapons. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2764.56s)]
*  At that moment, they were handing out rifles to people. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2768.6000000000004s)]
*  And for me, journalists and media platforms were essential voices. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2773.32s)]
*  There were, there were various journalists from different countries [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2778.4s)]
*  here and they were essentially stuck. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2782.28s)]
*  And I asked them for contacts. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2785.88s)]
*  Those were the people who were there. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2788.1200000000003s)]
*  I asked them for contacts, those who had access to Russians, Belarusians, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2789.8s)]
*  Kazakhs who understood everything, the same information. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2797.32s)]
*  And I spoke to them and I spoke to them and spoke in Russian. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2800.8s)]
*  I told them, you must stop Putin. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2805.32s)]
*  This is terrible. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2809.52s)]
*  This is horror. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2810.44s)]
*  This is war. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2811.0800000000004s)]
*  You must stop him. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2811.92s)]
*  And if you stand up now, if you speak out and if you go out into the [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2813.0s)]
*  streets, this was very important. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2816.1600000000003s)]
*  I spoke to them in Russian to show them that there was no problem and that all [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2818.56s)]
*  of these pretexts were, were made up. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2823.36s)]
*  This is why it's so painful to talk about the Russian language too, because [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2828.36s)]
*  look, if a person does not want to listen, they will not listen no [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2833.08s)]
*  matter what language we speak. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2837.68s)]
*  I disagree with you here. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2839.44s)]
*  I think and hope that many people in Russia will hear us today. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2841.44s)]
*  They blocked YouTube recently. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2847.08s)]
*  Are you aware of this in their country? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2849.92s)]
*  I know. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2852.64s)]
*  And I simply guarantee that this conversation will travel fast on the internet. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2854.0s)]
*  Everyone will hear you. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2858.24s)]
*  They will hear you, including the president of Russia will hear you. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2859.3199999999997s)]
*  This is why I have hope. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2863.36s)]
*  He is actually deaf, even if he speaks to you, he is deaf by his very nature. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2866.4s)]
*  Do you understand the difference? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2873.2s)]
*  You know, for instance, when you talk to Musk, you're talking to an innovator, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2874.96s)]
*  a scientist about rockets. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2886.56s)]
*  You talk about how to save on costs and how they land. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2888.76s)]
*  And on the other hand, Putin doesn't launch rockets to save money, but to kill people. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2893.4s)]
*  Do you think you can talk to Putin about technology? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2898.8s)]
*  Your guys were interviewing him and he told them about, about tribal history. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2905.0s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2912.16s)]
*  Imagine a Russian man in his country listening to him. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2914.08s)]
*  You know what Musk is about? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2917.56s)]
*  Technology, Mars, artificial intelligence, and this guy, Putin is standing there, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2919.76s)]
*  bare-assed, pontificating about tribes. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2924.04s)]
*  You've got to understand. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2927.76s)]
*  You think that when you do interviews, like Mr. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2930.04s)]
*  Tucker, who did an interview there, that, that you're about to make them friends. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2932.8s)]
*  How could you? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2939.68s)]
*  What does this have to do with friends? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2942.12s)]
*  He's different. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2944.64s)]
*  He is, he is simply different. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2946.68s)]
*  But it's still necessary. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2949.48s)]
*  A mammoth stands before you. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2950.56s)]
*  By the way, I must say that when you said bare-assed, it was not translated. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2953.72s)]
*  Could the interpreter please translate? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2958.12s)]
*  This is so that you can understand. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2959.96s)]
*  Now he explained everything to me. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2961.56s)]
*  I understand. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2962.84s)]
*  That's great. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2963.68s)]
*  I fully understand. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2964.36s)]
*  That's great. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2965.52s)]
*  But we still need to talk. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2966.6s)]
*  One should always speak with someone who listens and you must speak. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2968.08s)]
*  When you know that this will benefit you, bring peace and calm to the [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2973.2400000000002s)]
*  world, not the other way around. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2978.4s)]
*  I love President Trump's message. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2982.16s)]
*  When he speaks, I think that we share a position on peace through strength. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2985.32s)]
*  That is very important. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2991.52s)]
*  It means that if you are strong, you can speak and we need to be strong. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=2992.96s)]
*  And Ukraine has to be strong, strong enough. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3000.48s)]
*  Otherwise, what for? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3005.6800000000003s)]
*  So he, you, you know who, like, like Voldemort, who [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3006.88s)]
*  must, who must not be named. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3015.2s)]
*  Yes, he's, he's like Voldemort. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3019.12s)]
*  He thrives, subsists and lives on being subjectivized. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3022.12s)]
*  Instead of isolation, he is offered to step out into the light. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3028.56s)]
*  He's darkness personified and you offer him, as it were, to be subjectivized. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3033.8399999999997s)]
*  Why? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3040.7999999999997s)]
*  There's only one reason. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3041.8s)]
*  Fear. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3045.0400000000004s)]
*  And you say, we need to talk. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3046.84s)]
*  Listen, we need to be in a strong position and not talk, but end the war. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3049.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3055.92s)]
*  Yes, it is possible through dialogue. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3056.6800000000003s)]
*  We're not opposed to it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3058.84s)]
*  You just need to be in a strong position to make the other person want it. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3061.28s)]
*  Do you think he wants to end the war? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3067.32s)]
*  That's what you suggested. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3068.88s)]
*  I think this is naive. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3070.36s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3071.6400000000003s)]
*  With all due respect, it's naive to think he wants to finish the war. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3072.32s)]
*  It's, uh, tell you what, the circumstances, sorry for interrupting. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3077.7200000000003s)]
*  There's something we need. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3083.48s)]
*  I think that President Trump not only has will, he has all these possibilities. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3085.04s)]
*  And it's not just talk. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3091.56s)]
*  I really count on him. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3093.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think that our people really count on him. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3095.0s)]
*  So he has enough power to pressure him to pressure Putin, not into wanting to stop it. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3097.28s)]
*  No, he will not want to, to pressure him to actually stop it. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3108.76s)]
*  That is the difference. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3112.4s)]
*  Don't rely on his will. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3113.6400000000003s)]
*  Putin's will to stop. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3115.7200000000003s)]
*  You won't see it. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3117.6000000000004s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3119.48s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3120.2400000000002s)]
*  No, sorry. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3121.52s)]
*  I interrupted you first, but I think that you're right. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3122.2000000000003s)]
*  I interrupted you first, but what I would want, I do have what some, uh, what some might call [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3125.84s)]
*  a naive dream of you sitting down with Putin and Trump and negotiating a deal about, uh, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3133.76s)]
*  a ceasefire and together finding a path to long-term peace. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3140.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think this requires strength, requires negotiations. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3145.1200000000003s)]
*  There are a lot of carrots and sticks here that can be used to make a real deal. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3152.1200000000003s)]
*  And Trump is very keen on making a deal and ready to negotiate. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3156.48s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3161.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3162.48s)]
*  I just really want you and I to be on the same page. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3164.32s)]
*  Uh, it's very important to be in the same information space. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3170.56s)]
*  Extremely important. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3175.4s)]
*  Uh, let's talk a bit about the ceasefire. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3178.7200000000003s)]
*  Let me describe the situation to you. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3182.28s)]
*  In December, 2019 in Normandy, in Paris at the Elysee Palace, Macron, Merkel, Putin, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3186.0s)]
*  and I agreed on the ceasefire. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3194.1200000000003s)]
*  The U S wasn't there. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3198.84s)]
*  And this, by the way, was a weak point of the meeting. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3200.2400000000002s)]
*  If you'd like, we can later discuss why they weren't there. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3203.8s)]
*  It's a security guarantee thing in general. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3208.4s)]
*  It's Germany's position, et cetera. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3211.08s)]
*  We agreed on an exchange of hostages and all for all exchange. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3215.16s)]
*  We made a deal to exchange everyone for everyone. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3219.48s)]
*  I think you know that. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3221.6s)]
*  And there was also a meeting that lasted many hours, a meeting where we made, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3222.52s)]
*  we made a deal with him. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3228.68s)]
*  Everyone was tired. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3230.7599999999998s)]
*  It was just the two of us in the end. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3231.92s)]
*  And I proposed a ceasefire, by the way, no one in Ukraine believed, few believed in the [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3234.56s)]
*  ceasefire and he wanted troop withdrawal. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3242.4799999999996s)]
*  I calculated that if there were a withdrawal of troops from the line of contact, the way [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3245.16s)]
*  Russians proposed, it would take 20 years. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3250.3999999999996s)]
*  I proved it to him just in terms of time, square kilometers, namely the length of the [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3253.8799999999997s)]
*  line of contact or delimitation line. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3260.12s)]
*  And we agreed on what I told him that it will not work out. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3263.16s)]
*  But but I, I had many points because I was deeply involved in the issue. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3268.68s)]
*  I was involved very deeply. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3274.6s)]
*  It's my thing in general. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3276.3599999999997s)]
*  If I start doing something, I can't stand there like that guy I spoke about with my [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3278.2799999999997s)]
*  ass out, you know. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3283.7999999999997s)]
*  I must be dressed. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3286.8799999999997s)]
*  I must be prepared. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3289.6s)]
*  I must be prepared better. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3291.2s)]
*  Better than anyone in front of me. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3294.56s)]
*  You do sports, right? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3298.0800000000004s)]
*  I practiced for many years and we know what fights are like, what boxing is, what [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3300.1600000000003s)]
*  type boxing is. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3306.36s)]
*  This is what I did. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3307.44s)]
*  And I loved it very much. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3308.76s)]
*  When you step into the ring, you understand everything pretty much. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3310.52s)]
*  And so I stepped into it and I was, I was definitely well prepared. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3316.48s)]
*  But he wasn't. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3323.44s)]
*  No. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3325.0s)]
*  He was not deeply involved in the process. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3326.32s)]
*  What border? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3329.0s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3331.04s)]
*  How long will it take to disengage troops? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3332.32s)]
*  And why wasn't he involved? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3334.7200000000003s)]
*  You want to know? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3336.2400000000002s)]
*  Because he wasn't going to do any of this. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3337.6000000000004s)]
*  This is what confused me. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3340.4s)]
*  If you are not deeply involved in the issue, well then you, it's, it's as if you [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3341.92s)]
*  don't really need the result. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3349.04s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3350.96s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3353.2000000000003s)]
*  We agreed that there will be gas continuation, gas transit in 2019. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3354.16s)]
*  We agreed with him. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3364.88s)]
*  This was the security for Europe. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3366.08s)]
*  Merkel asked me for it. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3367.8s)]
*  And this was extremely important for Germany. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3370.36s)]
*  We agreed with him. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3374.48s)]
*  Secondly, we agreed that for him, it was just money. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3376.7599999999998s)]
*  So secondly, we agreed on an exchange. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3380.84s)]
*  For me, this was the most important thing for them. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3384.64s)]
*  Gas was for me, was the people. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3387.32s)]
*  And this is a fact because I wanted to have a humanitarian advantage so that there [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3391.0s)]
*  would be further meetings that would lead to sustained peace. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3397.36s)]
*  And third, ceasefire. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3403.24s)]
*  Ceasefire you spoke about. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3406.96s)]
*  What happened? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3410.16s)]
*  The gas contract was signed because he needed it. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3412.28s)]
*  And by the way, he knew everything about it. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3415.84s)]
*  As for exchange, we took the first step and exchanged the people. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3418.88s)]
*  Regarding the ceasefire. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3428.36s)]
*  Well, they started killing us in about a month. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3430.88s)]
*  So I called him and I told him, we agreed on a ceasefire, didn't we? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3436.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, it wasn't a piece of toilet paper, was it? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3446.04s)]
*  This is serious business. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3448.2799999999997s)]
*  Or so it seemed. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3450.36s)]
*  It really was serious. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3451.52s)]
*  Merkel, Macron, you and I, we all agreed on this together. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3453.56s)]
*  A ceasefire is important, isn't it? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3459.44s)]
*  Not for New Year's because everyone was celebrating New Year's. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3461.8s)]
*  And now they're offering us a Christmas ceasefire. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3465.2400000000002s)]
*  It's all the same. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3467.6400000000003s)]
*  A ceasefire for two, three days just to get some praise. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3468.6000000000004s)]
*  But this isn't a performance. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3471.32s)]
*  This isn't some kind of theater. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3472.88s)]
*  No, this, this is about people's lives. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3474.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3477.04s)]
*  After that, I called him a few more times. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3478.88s)]
*  I think I only had two, three calls with him in total. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3481.52s)]
*  I asked him for a ceasefire. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3485.2000000000003s)]
*  He told me it couldn't be. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3486.44s)]
*  We will, we will figure it out now. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3488.24s)]
*  People from, people from the occupied territory, Russians and separatists. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3490.9199999999996s)]
*  They were all there together. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3496.2799999999997s)]
*  They continued to shoot and kill our people. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3499.4399999999996s)]
*  Yes, the front lines were quiet, but they killed people. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3502.3199999999997s)]
*  They were killing people and I kept calling him. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3510.3199999999997s)]
*  I called again and again, but there was nothing. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3513.04s)]
*  Until after a few months, the Russians stopped answering the phone. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3515.9199999999996s)]
*  We did not have any contact since. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3520.04s)]
*  I wanted another meeting like we had in Normandy. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3523.64s)]
*  I wanted the next meeting. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3527.24s)]
*  I wanted to find a solution, but the Russians refused. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3529.04s)]
*  We tried to make it happen through various European countries and not [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3534.04s)]
*  only European, but the Russians refused. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3538.24s)]
*  They passed along some kind of agreement. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3540.8399999999997s)]
*  The Russians refused. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3542.84s)]
*  They passed along some kind of bullshit, made excuses. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3544.2400000000002s)]
*  They didn't want it. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3547.6400000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, they were sending their snipers. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3549.44s)]
*  We had evidence, living proof, even video evidence, because some [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3553.2400000000002s)]
*  of them were captured back then. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3557.44s)]
*  Those were the snipers in training. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3559.2400000000002s)]
*  They were training them. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3561.04s)]
*  They were training them. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3562.44s)]
*  And later those snipers operated in Syria and Africa. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3563.6400000000003s)]
*  These snipers were training in our country in the East. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3568.44s)]
*  Ukrainians were living targets. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3572.64s)]
*  They were shooting from the other side, killing people, women, people, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3575.44s)]
*  children. They were shooting. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3579.84s)]
*  It was a hunt. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3582.04s)]
*  By the way, it was in the Russian speaking region in the East where, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3583.44s)]
*  according to him, everyone is speaking Russian. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3588.04s)]
*  That's where they were shooting, where the situation currently is [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3590.24s)]
*  the most tense. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3594.64s)]
*  They killed people. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3596.14s)]
*  We sent this information, sent pictures. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3597.44s)]
*  We sent them to the UN, sent them everywhere. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3600.24s)]
*  We worked very hard, very persistently. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3603.24s)]
*  I met with everyone. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3606.04s)]
*  But who thought of Ukraine back then? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3607.24s)]
*  They didn't notice it much. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3610.24s)]
*  They didn't pay much attention to Crimea being illegally occupied either. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3611.84s)]
*  And to be honest, the United States of America too, everyone was [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3618.24s)]
*  somewhat silent about this issue. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3622.84s)]
*  That's how it was. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3624.44s)]
*  It was like that before a full-scale war. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3625.84s)]
*  I want to ask you a question about the ceasefire. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3630.84s)]
*  For example, in Mariupol today, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3636.44s)]
*  there are American and Ukrainian journalists, and everyone will tell [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3643.84s)]
*  you who had contact, who has contact now with Mariupol, who fled from [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3649.2400000000002s)]
*  there in the last minutes just before the occupation, or who was able [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3655.44s)]
*  to leave to escape after the occupation. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3660.04s)]
*  Chernoff, who won an Oscar, was among them. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3662.84s)]
*  And the journalists that left Mariupol, they are here. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3666.44s)]
*  By the way, we had a conversation. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3670.44s)]
*  They will tell you that 20,000, 30,000 civilians were tortured and buried [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3675.04s)]
*  there. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3681.64s)]
*  We do not know the number of victims. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3682.2400000000002s)]
*  People who didn't want to work with them, who refused to cooperate with them. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3685.44s)]
*  People who went on strikes to protest. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3689.2400000000002s)]
*  People who did not want to work with the Russians who occupied Mariupol. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3691.44s)]
*  And this is one example, just with this city. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3694.84s)]
*  And I have a question for you. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3697.04s)]
*  What about the millions of children? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3698.84s)]
*  And I will ask you in Russian so that you hear this without delay. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3701.04s)]

*  What if we just arranged a ceasefire without understanding what would happen [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3707.84s)]
*  next? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3711.44s)]
*  Without understanding what will happen to Ukraine's security guarantees? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3712.24s)]
*  What about the millions of children in the occupied territories? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3717.8399999999997s)]
*  What should I tell them? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3721.24s)]
*  What am I to tell them? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3723.4399999999996s)]
*  What is it I should tell them? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3724.64s)]
*  What? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3727.04s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3728.24s)]
*  Hey, all of you over there, see ya. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3730.4399999999996s)]
*  And those tens of thousands of people buried there, they were. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3733.24s)]
*  Is that what we want? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3737.04s)]
*  Are we ready to forgive them for this? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3738.8399999999997s)]
*  We must at least take the first step. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3742.24s)]
*  If this is a ceasefire, we must know that there is a security guarantee [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3745.64s)]
*  for the part of Ukraine under our control. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3749.8399999999997s)]
*  We need it so that he will not come back. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3752.64s)]
*  This is very important. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3757.04s)]
*  And what do we say to the people who live in those territories? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3758.4399999999996s)]
*  These are millions of people. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3761.8399999999997s)]
*  Did you know that since 2014 in Donetsk, in the Crimea, this is happening in [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3763.24s)]
*  Melitopol as well? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3770.24s)]
*  As in Berdyansk now, they are making all these kids of drafting age go and fight. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3772.4399999999996s)]
*  And if they don't go, they will be killed. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3783.64s)]
*  This is, do you understand what's happening? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3785.8399999999997s)]
*  That is why a ceasefire, everything I said, what I wish for and I believe in [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3789.24s)]
*  President Trump's power to use all of this information to come up with a way [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3797.84s)]
*  to make Ukraine strong and be strong. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3804.6400000000003s)]
*  Why am I saying that? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3811.04s)]
*  I will give you an example. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3813.84s)]
*  President Trump will be in the same situation as I was in 2019. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3817.84s)]
*  Precisely the same situation. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3824.84s)]
*  I want to end the war. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3826.84s)]
*  We want a lasting peace for Ukraine. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3828.44s)]
*  We must do this. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3831.04s)]
*  The ceasefire, exchange people and then diplomatically return all territories. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3832.2400000000002s)]
*  And we will do this through diplomacy. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3837.84s)]
*  What will happen next with President Trump? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3841.44s)]
*  If the ceasefire happens without security guarantees, at least for the territory [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3844.84s)]
*  we control, what does he get? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3850.44s)]
*  If he manages to make a ceasefire deal and three months later, Putin launches a new [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3852.8399999999997s)]
*  wave of attacks, what will Trump look like? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3861.64s)]
*  What will Ukraine look like? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3865.8399999999997s)]
*  What will everyone look like? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3869.04s)]
*  Putin will just do it. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3872.24s)]
*  And why would Putin do it? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3873.64s)]
*  Because today he's afraid of Trump. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3875.64s)]
*  But once Trump manages, for example, to do a ceasefire deal without serious [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3878.44s)]
*  security guarantees for Ukraine, he will give a pass to Putin. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3887.2400000000002s)]
*  Not that he wants to. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3891.2400000000002s)]
*  No, he does not want that. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3892.64s)]
*  I believe in what he says. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3894.04s)]
*  But he will give Putin an opportunity because in Putin's head, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3896.04s)]
*  he wants me to fight with Trump. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3901.64s)]
*  Putin's plan is to end the occupation of our territory. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3904.04s)]
*  This is in his sick head. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3908.44s)]
*  And I'm absolutely sure of this. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3912.2400000000002s)]
*  That is why I told you don't wait for Putin to want to stop the war. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3915.64s)]
*  Pressure him so that he is forced to stop the war. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3922.44s)]
*  That's important. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3928.64s)]
*  It's important to say that what you said about the children is a tragedy. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3930.64s)]
*  War is hell. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3934.2400000000002s)]
*  But let me say again, we must find a path. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3935.64s)]
*  To peace. There is one. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3938.44s)]
*  What is it? There is one. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3940.2400000000002s)]
*  Before ceasefire, strong Ukraine. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3942.2400000000002s)]
*  Strong Ukraine's position. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3944.84s)]
*  Yes, we can speak about it with Trump. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3946.2400000000002s)]
*  For me, we can we can speak about security guarantees. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3949.2400000000002s)]
*  But a quick step, a quick step is NATO. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3953.84s)]
*  A partial membership NATO. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3958.64s)]
*  Yes, I understand. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3961.04s)]
*  I understand. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3963.2400000000002s)]
*  I understand Trump's feelings about NATO. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3964.2400000000002s)]
*  I heard him. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3965.84s)]
*  He's thinking through all of it, of course. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3967.2400000000002s)]
*  But anyway, yes, NATO is a strong security guarantee for all the people, for us. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3970.04s)]
*  Part of security guarantees. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3976.6400000000003s)]
*  The second part is the arms aid package, which we will not use. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3978.6400000000003s)]
*  If a ceasefire works, nobody will use the weapons. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3983.04s)]
*  For what? But it has to stay. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3987.84s)]
*  But with all due respect to the United States and to the administration, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3990.04s)]
*  not like before, I don't want the same situation like we had with Biden. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3995.04s)]
*  I ask for sanctions now, please. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=3999.84s)]
*  And weapons now. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4002.44s)]
*  And then we will see if they start it again. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4004.2400000000002s)]
*  Of course, we'll be happy if you'll give us more and you will stand with us shoulder to shoulder. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4007.2400000000002s)]
*  Of course, that is right. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4012.2400000000002s)]
*  But but it's different when you have weapons. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4013.44s)]
*  Putin wouldn't have been able to occupy so much territory. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4019.6400000000003s)]
*  It was very difficult for us to push him out. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4023.24s)]
*  But we didn't have weapons before. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4026.24s)]
*  And that is the same situation. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4028.24s)]
*  It can be the same situation. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4029.84s)]
*  I'm just sharing this with you. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4031.84s)]
*  Like I said at the very beginning, I want to be very honest with you and with your audience. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4033.84s)]
*  Yes, it's true. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4039.04s)]
*  If we do not have security guarantees, Putin will come again. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4040.64s)]
*  To make it clear, let's describe the idea that you are speaking about. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4044.84s)]
*  I would like to offer you other ideas, too. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4050.44s)]
*  But right now, your idea is that NATO accepts Ukraine minus the five regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Khursan and Crimea. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4052.44s)]
*  Just so you understand the situation, the invitation to NATO is legislatively issued to Ukraine. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4063.44s)]
*  So to us, all those territories are still Ukraine. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4072.04s)]
*  But NATO so far can only act in the part that is under Ukrainian control. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4076.84s)]
*  This can be negotiated. I am sure about that. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4082.44s)]
*  Yes, this would not be a great success for us. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4085.44s)]
*  But if we see a diplomatic way to end the war, this is one of the ways. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4089.44s)]
*  So it is. Sorry. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4095.44s)]
*  That is a start. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4097.4400000000005s)]
*  Secondly, weapons, arms aid package. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4099.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm not ready to discuss this publicly right now. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4104.4400000000005s)]
*  It's all written down. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4107.4400000000005s)]
*  And President Trump might have seen it or not. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4108.4400000000005s)]
*  But we've got no secrets from him. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4111.24s)]
*  Yes. But mostly it depends on the willingness of the United States. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4113.24s)]
*  Because some of it will come from the EU, some from the United States. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4117.24s)]
*  Of course, together. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4122.24s)]
*  So not just from the United States. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4123.24s)]
*  No, no, no. We need unity with this package. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4125.24s)]
*  So the package and sanctions. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4128.24s)]
*  Yes, sanctions. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4131.24s)]
*  But I think it's in the interest of all the smart people to not have Russian energy on the market in general. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4133.24s)]
*  So he has to stop it. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4140.04s)]
*  That's all. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4142.04s)]
*  It's fine. American oil, American gas is okay. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4143.04s)]
*  Why not? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4146.04s)]
*  And it's cheaper. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4147.04s)]
*  So it will be cheaper for the whole world. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4148.04s)]
*  The money will go to the United States. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4150.04s)]
*  And I think he will be happy. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4152.04s)]
*  And the President and your people will be happy. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4154.04s)]
*  But it's your decision. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4157.04s)]
*  I'm just sharing. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4158.04s)]
*  Yes, and cheap oil. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4159.04s)]
*  So Putin won't have so much money for the war. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4160.04s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4164.04s)]
*  But this is difficult because it's a lot. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4166.04s)]
*  You're saying to continue the sanctions on Russia to accept Ukraine into NATO. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4167.84s)]
*  I need to ask you some difficult questions about this. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4172.84s)]
*  Yes, go on. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4175.84s)]
*  I trust and respect your words today. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4176.84s)]
*  Many people respect and love you in America. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4178.84s)]
*  Trump respects you. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4181.84s)]
*  Loves me? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4183.84s)]
*  Oh, come on now. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4185.84s)]
*  Remember last time you corrected me when I said that you love Javier Millet? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4187.84s)]
*  You said, no, no, no. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4190.84s)]
*  I respect him. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4191.84s)]
*  So let's not talk about love today. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4192.84s)]
*  But could we talk seriously about guaranteeing Russia's security? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4195.64s)]
*  Okay, can I interview you a little? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4201.64s)]
*  Question is, what land is the war happening on? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4203.64s)]
*  And where did it start? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4206.64s)]
*  On our soil, on our territory. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4208.64s)]
*  International law was violated. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4211.64s)]
*  The sovereignty of our country was violated. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4213.64s)]
*  Civilians were killed. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4217.64s)]
*  Tens of thousands of our people were taken hostage. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4219.64s)]
*  And everyone was taken hostage. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4222.64s)]
*  Everyone will tell you this happened. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4225.64s)]
*  This is what happened. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4229.64s)]
*  When I speak with the Global South, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4231.64s)]
*  which is trying to balance the two sides because of the history, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4233.64s)]
*  because of their roots, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4235.64s)]
*  and because of their shared economic interests, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4237.64s)]
*  with Russia in the past, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4241.64s)]
*  and now, of course, when you talk to them, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4243.64s)]
*  they are speaking a little bit like you. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4247.64s)]
*  I mean, they're balancing a little bit, you know. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4250.64s)]
*  A little bit in between. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4253.44s)]
*  But we will work on it. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4255.44s)]
*  It's our first meeting. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4257.44s)]
*  During the second one, you will be more on our side. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4259.44s)]
*  But it's just... [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4261.44s)]
*  You're very convincing. Very charismatic. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4263.44s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4265.44s)]
*  But when I speak with them, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4266.44s)]
*  when I speak, it's very important. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4268.44s)]
*  Even with their balancing attitude towards the war, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4271.44s)]
*  they all recognize that this is a war. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4277.44s)]
*  This is not just internal conflict. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4283.44s)]
*  This is a full-scale war. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4287.44s)]
*  That began, that Putin began. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4292.44s)]
*  And all of them, all of them, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4296.44s)]
*  if you talk to them, they say... [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4298.44s)]
*  But then they all recognize that, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4302.44s)]
*  that it's his own big mistake, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4304.44s)]
*  Putin's mistake, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4311.44s)]
*  and that he's not right. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4312.24s)]
*  That's why I said, no, no, he's not right. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4315.24s)]
*  And you have to begin from this. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4318.24s)]
*  If you begin at the middle, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4320.24s)]
*  between Ukraine and Russia, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4322.24s)]
*  of course we can speak like this. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4324.24s)]
*  You are in the middle and say, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4326.24s)]
*  okay, what's going on? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4327.24s)]
*  There is a fight. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4328.24s)]
*  Where is the fight? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4329.24s)]
*  It's not the fight like in Europe. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4330.24s)]
*  When Napoleon is fighting against somebody [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4333.24s)]
*  in the middle of Europe. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4338.24s)]
*  No, this is not in the middle of somewhere of the planet. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4340.04s)]
*  Not the planet. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4344.04s)]
*  It's concretely on our land. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4345.04s)]
*  So one country with one army, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4347.04s)]
*  one person came to another. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4352.04s)]
*  That's it. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4355.04s)]
*  It's very clear. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4356.04s)]
*  Again, I would like us to find a path to peace. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4358.04s)]
*  So let us nevertheless try to start in the middle. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4361.04s)]
*  What other ideas do you think, Mike? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4365.04s)]
*  You are a very intelligent person. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4367.04s)]
*  And... [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4368.84s)]
*  Your Russian isn't that good either. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4369.84s)]
*  And I told you that this is only our first meeting. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4371.84s)]
*  My English is not very good either. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4375.84s)]
*  Your English is very good. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4377.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4378.84s)]
*  To be honest, I'm terrible at speaking in every language. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4379.84s)]
*  Well, there are other ideas. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4382.84s)]
*  For instance, sorry to say this. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4384.84s)]
*  It sounds crazy. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4386.84s)]
*  Please. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4387.84s)]
*  What if both Ukraine and Russia are accepted into NATO? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4388.84s)]
*  Putin himself spoke about Russia, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4391.84s)]
*  maybe about NATO. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4394.84s)]
*  What you just said is very correct. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4396.64s)]
*  What are the guarantees for Russia? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4399.64s)]
*  It's not like I'm even interested what happens to them. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4402.64s)]
*  To be honest, I don't care what will happen to them in the future [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4405.64s)]
*  after the war ends. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4408.64s)]
*  But... [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4410.64s)]
*  These are our borders. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4412.64s)]
*  And we must understand what is going on there. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4415.64s)]
*  Well, the NATO guarantees for Ukraine. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4418.64s)]
*  Actually, this is also a security guarantee for the Russians. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4421.64s)]
*  Frankly, I talked about this many times before. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4425.44s)]
*  Sorry, I'm speaking figuratively, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4429.44s)]
*  but as an example, if you were a father who lost his children, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4432.44s)]
*  a grown man, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4436.44s)]
*  a grown man, a man, an adult, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4438.44s)]
*  and the war has ended [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4442.44s)]
*  and he never got justice for real. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4445.44s)]
*  For example, somebody decides to free support [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4450.44s)]
*  We won't give you anything. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4453.24s)]
*  You can't fight, you can't continue. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4455.24s)]
*  So we stop when we stop. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4457.24s)]
*  Without any guarantees, without any support, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4459.24s)]
*  without financing, without... [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4461.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4463.24s)]
*  And nobody is held accountable [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4465.24s)]
*  but the man lost his children. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4469.24s)]
*  He will not get anything. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4471.24s)]
*  None of the killers will be in prison. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4474.24s)]
*  All the sanctions will be removed [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4477.24s)]
*  and he lost his children. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4480.24s)]
*  And we have thousands of such people. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4483.24s)]
*  Why do you think they will not go to Russia? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4486.24s)]
*  We'll find a way and we'll not kill the Russian soldiers there [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4491.24s)]
*  or somebody there. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4495.24s)]
*  Why wouldn't they? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4497.24s)]
*  It's human nature. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4498.24s)]
*  It's not about us. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4499.24s)]
*  It's everyone. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4501.24s)]
*  Read American writers. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4502.24s)]
*  Always after any war. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4504.24s)]
*  If there is no justice for people, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4508.24s)]
*  there must be punishment for the crime. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4512.04s)]
*  It is only justice. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4514.04s)]
*  How come my child was taken away? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4516.04s)]
*  The war took him. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4518.04s)]
*  This is very scary. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4520.04s)]
*  And even whether it was my son [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4522.04s)]
*  who was fulfilling his constitutional duty [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4524.04s)]
*  or simply a missile that struck a civilian child [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4527.04s)]
*  and if there is no justice [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4530.04s)]
*  and the killers are not punished, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4532.04s)]
*  why wouldn't these people come back with hate? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4534.04s)]
*  They will definitely come back. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4536.84s)]
*  So when we talk about NATO, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4538.84s)]
*  NATO is not only stopping Russia. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4541.84s)]
*  Do not forget, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4546.84s)]
*  NATO is stopping us too [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4547.84s)]
*  because there will not be justice for everyone. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4552.84s)]
*  We know that NATO does not have the right [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4556.84s)]
*  to solve certain issues with war. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4558.84s)]
*  NATO is a security alliance. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4562.64s)]
*  It is protection, not brainwashing. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4564.64s)]
*  What Putin claims that this is offensive is not true. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4567.64s)]
*  NATO is a defensive alliance, a security alliance [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4571.64s)]
*  and it is security for Russia. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4575.64s)]
*  But unfortunately, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4577.64s)]
*  there are many options for peace [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4578.64s)]
*  that don't involve NATO inviting Ukraine as a member. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4581.64s)]
*  Can you imagine a country like Russia [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4586.64s)]
*  as a member? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4589.44s)]
*  Can you imagine security guarantees [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4591.44s)]
*  without NATO membership? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4593.44s)]
*  For example, if America simply leaves NATO, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4595.44s)]
*  I believe there is a high likelihood [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4599.44s)]
*  that Donald Trump would do such a thing. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4601.44s)]
*  I think it's very bad for NATO. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4604.44s)]
*  That's the end. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4607.44s)]
*  That's the death of NATO. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4609.44s)]
*  It is a pity because I think [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4612.44s)]
*  that it's a very good alliance. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4614.44s)]
*  Maybe not everything is good there [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4615.44s)]
*  from the bureaucracy or money, et cetera. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4617.24s)]
*  But totally, countries who are in NATO, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4620.24s)]
*  they don't fight. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4624.24s)]
*  There is no war on the land of any of these NATO countries. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4627.24s)]
*  I think that is the answer. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4632.24s)]
*  It works or not. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4634.24s)]
*  It works politically or militarily. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4636.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4638.24s)]
*  But it works. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4639.24s)]
*  So without Trump, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4640.24s)]
*  without the United States of America, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4642.24s)]
*  there will not be NATO. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4645.24s)]
*  That is the first. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4646.04s)]
*  So, and you say, can we imagine that? [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4648.04s)]
*  That what? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4652.04s)]
*  That there could be security guarantee without... [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4653.04s)]
*  No, we don't need guarantees [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4655.04s)]
*  without the United States. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4658.04s)]
*  That's it because the United States [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4660.04s)]
*  is a very strong, powerful country. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4662.04s)]
*  The United States puts the point. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4665.04s)]
*  Of course, Putin said that it's just the Soviet Union [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4667.04s)]
*  where, by the way, Ukraine was the second [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4671.04s)]
*  strong republic militarily. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4673.84s)]
*  Yes, by the way, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4675.84s)]
*  but he, of course, always forgets about it. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4676.84s)]
*  But during the World War II, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4680.84s)]
*  without help of the United States, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4683.84s)]
*  support of your troops, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4685.84s)]
*  support of your industry, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4687.84s)]
*  industrially, militarily, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4689.84s)]
*  without your money, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4691.84s)]
*  without your people, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4692.84s)]
*  Hitler could win. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4694.84s)]
*  So the United States helped a lot. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4699.84s)]
*  Of course, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4701.84s)]
*  Europe, USSR, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4702.64s)]
*  and of course, everybody fought. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4705.64s)]
*  Everybody did a lot. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4707.64s)]
*  But without the United States, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4709.64s)]
*  it couldn't be such... [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4711.64s)]
*  I don't use the word success [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4713.64s)]
*  because I think that there is no war [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4715.64s)]
*  which ends successfully [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4718.64s)]
*  because this is a war. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4720.64s)]
*  Seven figure losses, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4721.64s)]
*  heavy losses in World War II, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4723.64s)]
*  millions of people. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4726.64s)]
*  And that's why without the United States, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4727.64s)]
*  security guarantees are not possible. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4730.44s)]
*  I mean these security guarantees [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4732.44s)]
*  which can prevent Russian aggression. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4735.44s)]
*  Of course, we have security guarantees [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4738.44s)]
*  bilaterally with some countries [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4740.44s)]
*  financing support of our internal [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4742.44s)]
*  military and defending [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4745.44s)]
*  and humanitarian issues [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4747.44s)]
*  and demining, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4749.44s)]
*  which is very important, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4750.44s)]
*  and helping our children [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4751.44s)]
*  in the school networks. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4753.44s)]
*  By the way, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4754.44s)]
*  this is a very sensitive point. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4755.44s)]
*  How many? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4757.44s)]
*  How many bomb shelters? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4758.44s)]
*  How many bomb shelters? [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4759.24s)]
*  How many bomb shelters we built [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4761.24s)]
*  with the partners for the children? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4763.24s)]
*  And it's a pity that they are underground. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4765.24s)]
*  But can you imagine their eyes? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4767.24s)]
*  When they came after COVID, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4770.24s)]
*  you understand what does it mean, COVID, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4772.24s)]
*  but they had COVID and the war [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4774.24s)]
*  and together they didn't see each other [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4776.24s)]
*  for so many years. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4778.24s)]
*  And when they saw each other [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4779.24s)]
*  even underground, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4782.24s)]
*  they were very happy and smiling. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4784.24s)]
*  So we have such security guarantees, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4787.04s)]
*  but it's not enough to prevent. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4791.04s)]
*  Yes, preventive measures also work [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4795.04s)]
*  to prevent the aggression of Putin. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4797.04s)]
*  To stop. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4799.04s)]
*  Your English is better than my Russian. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4801.04s)]
*  This is so, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4803.04s)]
*  this is wonderful. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4804.04s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4805.04s)]
*  I'm just giving you compliments. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4807.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4808.04s)]
*  You're supposed to do that kind of thing [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4809.04s)]
*  to a president. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4810.04s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4811.04s)]
*  Okay, once again. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4812.04s)]
*  Come on. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4815.04s)]
*  Without NATO guarantees, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4815.84s)]
*  I have a dream that, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4817.84s)]
*  let's say on January 25 [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4819.84s)]
*  or sometime at the end of January this year, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4821.84s)]
*  you will sit down with Donald Trump [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4824.84s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4827.84s)]
*  and together negotiate a ceasefire [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4829.84s)]
*  with strict security guarantees [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4831.84s)]
*  and an agreement will be signed. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4834.84s)]
*  What will this look like without NATO? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4839.84s)]
*  I will make it clear. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4841.84s)]
*  And so first of all, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4843.84s)]
*  January 25th or some other day. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4845.84s)]
*  Well, you just call it January 25th. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4848.84s)]
*  And I don't mind. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4851.84s)]
*  It's my birthday. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4852.84s)]
*  And we sit down. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4854.84s)]
*  First of all with Trump. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4859.84s)]
*  We agree with him on how [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4863.84s)]
*  we can stop the war, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4865.84s)]
*  stop Putin. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4868.84s)]
*  It is important for us to sit down [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4870.84s)]
*  with him. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4873.84s)]
*  Secondly, it is very important for us [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4875.84s)]
*  that Europe, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4877.84s)]
*  which is very important for us [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4880.84s)]
*  because we are part of Europe [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4882.84s)]
*  and not only geographically, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4885.84s)]
*  geopolitically, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4887.84s)]
*  but also in the European Union [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4888.84s)]
*  where we will be. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4890.84s)]
*  For us, it is very important [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4891.84s)]
*  that Europe also has a voice. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4892.84s)]
*  It's the second thing. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4896.84s)]
*  It won't be long [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4898.84s)]
*  because Europe will be looking at us [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4900.84s)]
*  and will be looking at Trump. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4902.84s)]
*  And by the way, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4904.64s)]
*  I now see that [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4906.64s)]
*  when I talk about something [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4908.64s)]
*  with Donald Trump, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4909.64s)]
*  whether we meet in person [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4910.64s)]
*  or we just have a call, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4912.64s)]
*  all the European leaders [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4914.64s)]
*  always ask, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4915.64s)]
*  how was it? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4916.64s)]
*  This shows the influence of [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4917.64s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4919.64s)]
*  And this has never happened before [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4921.64s)]
*  with an American president. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4923.64s)]
*  I tell you from my experience, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4926.64s)]
*  this also gives you confidence, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4928.64s)]
*  you know, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4931.64s)]
*  that we can stop this war. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4932.44s)]
*  That is why we and Trump come first [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4935.44s)]
*  and Europe will support [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4937.44s)]
*  Ukraine's position [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4939.44s)]
*  because they understand [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4941.44s)]
*  that Ukraine has every right [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4943.44s)]
*  to have its voice heard in this [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4945.44s)]
*  because we are at war. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4948.44s)]
*  Trump and I will come to an agreement [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4950.44s)]
*  and then if, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4953.44s)]
*  and I am sure that he can offer [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4955.44s)]
*  strong security guarantees [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4957.44s)]
*  together with Europe [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4960.44s)]
*  we can talk to the Russians. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4962.44s)]
*  That's right. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4965.44s)]
*  Not just three of us [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4966.44s)]
*  sitting down at once. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4967.44s)]
*  And you still talk to me like that. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4971.44s)]
*  Do you know how? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4974.44s)]
*  As if Putin wants to sit down [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4976.44s)]
*  and talk, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4978.44s)]
*  but Ukraine does not. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4979.44s)]
*  This is not true. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4981.44s)]
*  I think that, yes, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4982.44s)]
*  he is in fact ready to talk. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4983.44s)]
*  Did you talk to him? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4986.44s)]
*  On the phone or what? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4987.44s)]
*  How do you normally talk to him? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4989.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4990.44s)]
*  No, normally by the sea. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4991.24s)]
*  The same as with you. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4993.24s)]
*  He invites you to the sea with me. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4994.24s)]
*  Just the three of us. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4996.24s)]
*  No, no, one of us may drown. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4997.24s)]
*  Who? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=4999.24s)]
*  Are you good at swimming? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5000.24s)]
*  Yes, I am a good swimmer. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5001.24s)]
*  You're a good swimmer. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5002.24s)]
*  Well... [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5003.24s)]
*  And I would like to add [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5005.24s)]
*  that if you have any contact with them [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5007.24s)]
*  I just want to hear what happens then. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5010.24s)]
*  I have never talked to Vladimir Putin [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5013.24s)]
*  but I have a feeling [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5015.24s)]
*  that he is ready [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5017.24s)]
*  because Donald Trump is ready. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5019.24s)]
*  I hope you are ready. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5021.24s)]
*  And this is not just a feeling [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5024.24s)]
*  but a dream. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5025.24s)]
*  I have a dream here [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5027.24s)]
*  that the three of you will get together in a room [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5029.24s)]
*  and make peace. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5032.24s)]
*  And I want to understand what it looks like, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5036.24s)]
*  what security guarantees look like [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5038.24s)]
*  that would satisfy Ukraine [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5040.24s)]
*  and would satisfy Russia. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5041.24s)]
*  Ukraine needs security guarantees [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5044.24s)]
*  first and foremost. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5047.24s)]
*  We are in danger. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5048.24s)]
*  That is why they are called so. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5050.04s)]
*  This is no joke to me. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5053.04s)]
*  Let's take a few steps back. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5056.04s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5059.04s)]
*  Why are security guarantees [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5063.04s)]
*  a strong position of Ukraine, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5065.04s)]
*  strong weapons and so on so important? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5067.04s)]
*  I will give you [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5069.04s)]
*  a little history lesson. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5072.04s)]
*  Although I think you have prepared yourself [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5073.04s)]
*  and know everything perfectly, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5076.04s)]
*  well, you can correct me on that. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5077.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5079.84s)]
*  Ukraine had [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5081.84s)]
*  security guarantees, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5084.84s)]
*  the Budapest Memorandum. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5085.84s)]
*  Nuclear weapons are the security guarantees [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5086.84s)]
*  that Ukraine had. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5088.84s)]
*  Ukraine had nuclear weapons. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5090.84s)]
*  I do not want to characterize it as good or bad. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5092.84s)]
*  Today, the fact that we do not have them is bad. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5095.84s)]
*  Why? [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5098.84s)]
*  Because this is war. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5099.84s)]
*  Today we are at war. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5100.84s)]
*  Because you unleashed, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5102.84s)]
*  because you have unleashed [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5104.84s)]
*  the hands of a nuclear power. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5106.64s)]
*  A nuclear power is fighting against us, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5108.64s)]
*  against Ukraine, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5111.64s)]
*  and doing what it wants. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5113.64s)]
*  By the way, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5114.64s)]
*  even you are now talking about [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5115.64s)]
*  ceasefire, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5117.64s)]
*  just a ceasefire. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5118.64s)]
*  Maybe give flowers to Putin, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5121.64s)]
*  maybe to say [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5124.64s)]
*  thank you so much for these years, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5125.64s)]
*  that was a great part of my life. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5127.64s)]
*  No, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5129.64s)]
*  we are not just ready for this. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5130.64s)]
*  Why? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5132.64s)]
*  The Budapest Memorandum [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5133.64s)]
*  Budapest Memorandum, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5135.44s)]
*  nuclear weapons, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5137.44s)]
*  this is what we had. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5138.44s)]
*  Ukraine used them for protection. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5139.44s)]
*  This does not mean that someone attacked us. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5141.44s)]
*  That does not mean that we would have used it. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5144.44s)]
*  We had that opportunity. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5146.44s)]
*  These were our security guarantees. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5148.44s)]
*  Why am I talking about this in detail? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5150.44s)]
*  Because if you take the Budapest Memorandum, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5152.44s)]
*  by the way, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5155.44s)]
*  I discussed this with President Trump. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5156.44s)]
*  We have not finished this conversation yet. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5158.44s)]
*  We will continue it. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5161.44s)]
*  Regarding the Budapest Memorandum, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5162.44s)]
*  the Budapest Memorandum [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5164.24s)]
*  included security guarantees for Ukraine. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5165.24s)]
*  At first, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5168.24s)]

*  Merkel. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5498.64s)]
*  So she opposes [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5499.64s)]
*  and she forced everyone not to give [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5500.64s)]
*  Ukraine an invitation to join NATO [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5502.64s)]

*  Seriously, Republicans were in favor. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5506.64s)]
*  The U.S. was in favor [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5508.64s)]
*  because Republicans [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5510.44s)]
*  and Bush were not afraid of anyone. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5512.44s)]
*  They were not afraid of anyone [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5515.44s)]
*  and they knew that Ukraine rightly wanted [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5517.44s)]
*  to join NATO. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5519.44s)]
*  She chooses so. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5520.44s)]
*  And what is the question? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5521.44s)]
*  Well, people made their choice. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5523.44s)]
*  Well, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5524.44s)]
*  and the Russians will not look that way. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5525.44s)]
*  That was not the case then. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5528.44s)]
*  Why? [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5529.44s)]
*  Because the Russians were [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5530.44s)]
*  different. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5532.44s)]

*  hundreds of meetings were held. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5543.44s)]
*  I have had hundreds of meetings [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5546.44s)]
*  since 2019. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5550.44s)]
*  We could not think about a ceasefire. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5553.44s)]
*  A ceasefire is our offer. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5555.44s)]
*  This is not somebody's suggestion. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5558.44s)]
*  This is mine. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5561.44s)]
*  I would like... [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5562.44s)]
*  I wanted to in Ukraine. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5564.44s)]
*  Society was divided. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5566.44s)]
*  Not everyone wanted to. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5569.24s)]
*  Half did not want to. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5571.24s)]
*  Half were against. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5572.24s)]
*  Half were in favor. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5573.24s)]
*  Some of them shouted, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5574.24s)]
*  do not believe it. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5575.24s)]
*  Some of them shouted, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5576.24s)]
*  believe it. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5577.24s)]
*  I am the president of Ukraine. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5578.24s)]
*  I was given a mandate of trust [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5581.24s)]
*  by 70% of the population [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5583.24s)]
*  to take appropriate steps [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5585.24s)]
*  and I made them. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5587.24s)]
*  This is not a joke. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5589.24s)]
*  We'll just sit the three of us. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5591.24s)]
*  I am simply telling you what is. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5593.24s)]
*  This is how can I tell you. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5596.24s)]
*  These meetings must be serious [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5599.24s)]
*  and prepared. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5603.24s)]
*  And prepared with those who want peace. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5605.24s)]
*  Ukraine wants peace. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5608.24s)]
*  U.S. wants peace. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5609.24s)]
*  We have to sit down with Trump [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5611.24s)]
*  and that is 100%. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5612.24s)]
*  First and foremost, number one. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5614.24s)]
*  Moreover, he told me on the phone [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5616.24s)]
*  that he is waiting for us to meet [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5618.24s)]
*  and there will be an official visit [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5621.24s)]
*  and my visit would be [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5624.24s)]
*  the first or one of the first to him. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5626.24s)]
*  And for him, this topic is very important. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5628.04s)]
*  I know that he has his own matters, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5630.04s)]
*  American issues, I understand. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5633.04s)]
*  I heard his election program, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5635.04s)]
*  but regarding international affairs, [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5637.04s)]
*  I think our issue is [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5639.04s)]
*  one of the most pressing issues [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5641.04s)]
*  for President Trump. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5643.04s)]
*  Therefore, I believe very much [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5645.04s)]
*  I trust his words [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5646.04s)]
*  and I hope we will meet again. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5647.04s)]
*  We need to prepare. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5649.04s)]
*  We have many plans to build on [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5652.04s)]
*  and they exist [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5654.04s)]
*  and they are supported by many countries. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5655.04s)]
*  But we need his vision. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5658.04s)]
*  He needs to look at all these details [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5661.04s)]
*  but his vision, please. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5664.04s)]
*  Because he can't stop Putin [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5666.04s)]
*  because Putin is afraid of him. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5668.04s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5671.04s)]
*  But Trump is a president [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5673.04s)]
*  of a democratic country [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5675.04s)]
*  and he does not come for life. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5677.04s)]
*  He is not Putin. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5679.04s)]
*  He will not come for 25 years. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5681.04s)]
*  He will come for his term. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5683.04s)]
*  Please tell me [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5686.04s)]
*  well, for example, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5688.04s)]
*  he came for four years [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5690.04s)]
*  and for the fifth year, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5692.04s)]
*  Putin came with a war. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5696.04s)]
*  Will it make Trump [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5698.04s)]
*  feel better that there was no war [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5699.04s)]
*  during his time [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5701.04s)]
*  and that Ukraine was destroyed after him? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5702.04s)]
*  Why destroyed? [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5704.04s)]
*  Putin is whoever, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5707.04s)]
*  a killer whoever, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5708.04s)]
*  but not a fool. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5709.04s)]
*  He will be prepared. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5711.04s)]
*  He knows all mistakes. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5715.04s)]
*  He understands how we defeated his army [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5716.84s)]
*  after the invasion began. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5719.84s)]
*  He realized that this was not a Soviet war [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5721.84s)]
*  and that this would not happen with us. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5723.84s)]
*  He will prepare. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5725.84s)]
*  He will let everything [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5727.84s)]
*  into arms production. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5728.84s)]
*  He will have lots of weapons [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5729.84s)]
*  and there will be a very large army [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5731.84s)]
*  and you think that [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5733.84s)]
*  after such humiliation, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5734.84s)]
*  four years without a war, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5737.84s)]
*  he did not finish us. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5739.84s)]
*  He will return [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5741.84s)]
*  and fight only against Ukraine. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5742.84s)]
*  He will destroy everything around [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5745.64s)]
*  and if you say there is a risk [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5748.64s)]
*  that Trump, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5750.64s)]
*  President Trump, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5751.64s)]
*  will withdraw from NATO, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5752.64s)]
*  for example, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5753.64s)]
*  this is a decision [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5754.64s)]
*  of the United States. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5755.64s)]
*  I'm simply saying that [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5756.64s)]

*  Why did Hitler conquer all of Europe then? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5767.64s)]
*  Almost. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5770.64s)]

*  What are the largest armies? [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5779.44s)]
*  We have the largest army. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5781.44s)]
*  The Ukrainian army [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5783.44s)]
*  is the largest in Europe. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5785.44s)]
*  The second place after us [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5788.44s)]

*  200,000? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5795.44s)]

*  We have 980. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5799.44s)]

*  of European nations [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5803.44s)]
*  will not be enough. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5804.44s)]
*  Yes, it's not going to be enough. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5805.44s)]

*  It all protects you. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5819.44s)]
*  First of all, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5821.44s)]
*  look at one example. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5822.44s)]
*  North Korea. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5826.44s)]
*  Just look at this example. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5828.44s)]
*  12,000 [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5831.44s)]
*  has arrived. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5833.24s)]
*  Today, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5837.24s)]
*  3,800 [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5839.24s)]
*  killed [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5841.24s)]
*  or wounded. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5842.24s)]
*  They can bring more. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5846.24s)]
*  30,000, 40,000 [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5849.24s)]
*  or maybe [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5854.24s)]
*  500. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5856.24s)]
*  They can bring many people. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5860.24s)]
*  Why? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5862.24s)]
*  Because they have order, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5863.24s)]
*  autocracy, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5865.24s)]
*  and everything. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5866.24s)]
*  Can Europe bring people together? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5867.24s)]
*  No. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5870.24s)]
*  Will Europe be able to build an army [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5872.24s)]
*  consisting of 2 to 3 million people? [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5874.24s)]
*  No Europe will not want to do this. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5877.24s)]
*  And for what? [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5879.24s)]
*  We definitely don't want a world war with you. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5880.24s)]
*  There is no such purpose. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5883.24s)]
*  There is no such purpose as [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5885.24s)]
*  gathering everyone. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5886.24s)]
*  We do not want any war. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5888.24s)]
*  We want to stop the Russians. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5889.24s)]
*  And they invite [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5890.24s)]
*  North Korean soldiers. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5891.04s)]
*  Invited. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5894.04s)]
*  Their faces are burned. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5899.04s)]
*  They themselves [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5902.04s)]
*  burn their faces. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5903.04s)]
*  Those who cannot escape, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5905.04s)]
*  injured or killed. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5906.04s)]
*  There is a video. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5909.04s)]
*  Everything I'm telling you, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5910.04s)]
*  there is evidence of this. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5911.04s)]
*  So that they are [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5914.04s)]
*  not recognizable, right? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5916.04s)]
*  It means [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5919.04s)]
*  what does it mean? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5919.84s)]
*  It's out of values [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5922.84s)]
*  which share Europe. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5923.84s)]
*  Europe counts. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5925.84s)]
*  It means that those guys [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5927.84s)]
*  they don't count [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5931.84s)]
*  Rahuyut. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5932.84s)]
*  It's count, yes? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5933.84s)]
*  They don't count [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5934.84s)]
*  the number of people. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5935.84s)]
*  That is the answer. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5937.84s)]
*  Can they move more? [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5938.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5939.84s)]
*  Can they move [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5940.84s)]
*  dozens of thousands? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5941.84s)]
*  Yes, because we see [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5942.84s)]
*  what they have. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5943.84s)]
*  Last year for example, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5944.84s)]
*  Europe gave us [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5946.84s)]
*  one million artillery rounds. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5948.64s)]
*  We produced [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5952.64s)]
*  a lot ourselves. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5954.64s)]
*  But they gave us initiative. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5955.64s)]
*  It was initiative. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5958.64s)]
*  One million artillery rounds [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5959.64s)]
*  and of 155 and et cetera. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5963.64s)]
*  We produced more. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5969.64s)]
*  But North Korea [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5972.64s)]
*  gave Putin [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5974.64s)]
*  3.7 [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5976.64s)]
*  and just gave him. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5978.64s)]
*  So he also has a deficit for today. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5980.64s)]
*  It means he needs what? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5983.64s)]
*  He needs time. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5984.64s)]
*  But the number of soldiers [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5986.64s)]
*  and the number of artillery rounds [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5988.64s)]
*  is not everything. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5991.64s)]
*  As you have said, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5993.64s)]
*  let's say Donald Trump [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5995.64s)]
*  guarantees [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5996.64s)]
*  security for four years. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=5998.64s)]
*  You can form partnerships [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6001.64s)]
*  with India, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6002.64s)]

*  the punishment, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6007.44s)]
*  the stick, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6008.44s)]
*  on oil prices for example, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6009.44s)]
*  if any aggressive action is taken. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6011.44s)]
*  You can actually even build, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6014.44s)]
*  I've met a lot of incredible [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6017.44s)]
*  Ukrainian tech people, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6018.44s)]
*  IT people. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6021.44s)]
*  You can build great companies [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6023.44s)]
*  that form partnerships [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6024.44s)]
*  with the United States, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6025.44s)]

*  with China. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6027.44s)]

*  against aggression of [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6031.44s)]
*  however many million [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6034.44s)]

*  during this time [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6059.44s)]
*  you need just cooperation, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6061.44s)]
*  a lot of money [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6062.44s)]
*  for this military industry. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6063.44s)]
*  In Ukraine or in Europe, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6066.24s)]
*  with India, Saudi Arabia, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6069.24s)]
*  Saudi and the United States, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6071.24s)]
*  you need a lot of money. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6073.24s)]
*  So the question is [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6075.24s)]
*  where you will get it. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6076.24s)]
*  So my answer was to Trump. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6077.24s)]
*  I said this is one of [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6079.24s)]
*  the security guarantees, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6080.24s)]
*  take 300 billions [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6082.24s)]
*  of frozen Russian assets. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6084.24s)]
*  We will take it. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6087.24s)]
*  Take money, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6088.24s)]
*  what we need for our [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6090.24s)]
*  interior production, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6091.24s)]
*  and we will buy all the weapons [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6092.24s)]
*  from the United States. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6093.24s)]
*  We don't need gifts, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6094.24s)]
*  from the United States. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6095.04s)]
*  It will be very good [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6096.04s)]
*  for your industry. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6098.04s)]
*  For the United States, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6099.04s)]
*  we will put money there, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6101.04s)]
*  Russian money. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6102.04s)]
*  Not Ukrainian, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6103.04s)]
*  not European, [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6104.04s)]
*  Russian money, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6105.04s)]
*  Russian assets. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6106.04s)]
*  They have to pay for this. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6107.04s)]
*  We will put it [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6108.04s)]
*  and we will make it. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6109.04s)]
*  This is one of [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6110.04s)]
*  security guarantees? [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6111.04s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6112.04s)]
*  Because this is a military [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6113.04s)]
*  guarantee, yes. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6115.04s)]
*  But then the second you said [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6116.04s)]
*  that energy price [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6119.04s)]
*  and a lot of money [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6121.04s)]
*  and a lot of energy price [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6122.84s)]
*  and a lot of sanctions on products [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6124.84s)]
*  and the Russian shadow fleet [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6127.84s)]
*  and etc. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6129.84s)]
*  That is the second answer [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6130.84s)]
*  we spoke about before. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6131.84s)]
*  Yes, put more sanctions on them. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6133.84s)]
*  More sanctions. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6135.84s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6137.84s)]
*  Not to take off sanctions. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6138.84s)]
*  It's okay with you, [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6140.84s)]
*  but it's not going to be okay [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6141.84s)]
*  with the president of Russia. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6143.84s)]
*  Yes, but I'm not thinking [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6144.84s)]
*  how it will be very good for him. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6146.84s)]
*  He's still a killer. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6148.84s)]
*  I understand, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6149.84s)]
*  but unfortunately, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6150.84s)]
*  the reality is [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6151.64s)]
*  that a compromise is needed [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6152.64s)]
*  in order to reach an agreement. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6154.64s)]
*  So in your understanding [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6155.64s)]
*  the fact that he is no in jail [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6156.64s)]
*  after all the murders, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6158.64s)]
*  he is not in jail [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6159.64s)]
*  assuming all the murders, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6160.64s)]
*  and no one in the world [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6161.64s)]
*  is able to put him in his place, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6163.64s)]
*  send him to prison. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6165.64s)]
*  Do you think this is [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6167.64s)]
*  a small compromise? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6168.64s)]
*  This is not a small compromise [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6169.64s)]
*  and to forgive him [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6171.64s)]
*  will not be a small compromise. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6173.64s)]
*  To forgive. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6175.64s)]
*  No one will forgive. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6176.64s)]
*  This is absolutely impossible [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6177.64s)]
*  to forgive him. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6178.64s)]
*  We cannot get into the head [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6179.64s)]
*  and soul of a person [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6180.44s)]
*  who lost their family. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6181.44s)]
*  Nobody never will accept this. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6182.44s)]
*  Absolutely impossible. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6184.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6186.44s)]
*  Do you have children? [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6187.44s)]
*  No, not yet, [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6188.44s)]
*  but I would like to. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6189.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6190.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6191.44s)]
*  God bless. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6192.44s)]
*  And this is the most important thing in life. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6193.44s)]
*  And they simply took away [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6194.44s)]
*  the most precious thing from you, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6195.44s)]
*  will you ask? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6196.44s)]
*  Who ruined your life [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6198.44s)]
*  before going to rip their head off? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6200.44s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6202.44s)]
*  They took your child away. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6203.44s)]
*  Are you going to ask [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6205.44s)]
*  who did this? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6206.44s)]
*  And they will answer [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6207.44s)]
*  that that dude did this. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6208.44s)]
*  You will say, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6209.44s)]
*  oh, well then there are no questions. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6210.44s)]
*  No. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6212.44s)]
*  No. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6213.44s)]
*  No, you will go fucking hell [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6214.44s)]
*  and bite their head off [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6215.44s)]
*  and it will be fair. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6217.44s)]
*  Can murderers be forgiven? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6220.44s)]
*  That's why [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6222.44s)]
*  you make [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6224.44s)]
*  security guarantees. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6226.44s)]
*  What I told you [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6227.44s)]
*  for those who are here [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6228.44s)]
*  and what we control [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6230.44s)]
*  and what will not happen [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6231.44s)]
*  and that those who lost [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6232.44s)]
*  we will [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6234.44s)]
*  we will [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6235.44s)]
*  we will never forget [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6236.44s)]
*  and a matter of time. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6237.44s)]
*  I said when you gave us NATO, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6239.24s)]
*  I just said [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6241.24s)]
*  this means that [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6242.24s)]
*  after a while [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6243.24s)]
*  everything I said about NATO [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6244.24s)]
*  after a while [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6245.24s)]
*  Ukraine will not go against Russia [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6247.24s)]
*  and Russia [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6250.24s)]
*  will not go against Ukraine [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6251.24s)]
*  because you are in NATO. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6253.24s)]
*  I am just saying [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6254.24s)]
*  is not that a compromise? [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6255.24s)]
*  So NATO is a compromise. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6256.24s)]
*  This is not just a security guarantee [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6258.24s)]
*  in my opinion. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6260.24s)]
*  Look, when rockets [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6263.24s)]
*  were attacking Israel [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6264.24s)]
*  and Israel is not in NATO [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6266.24s)]
*  NATO countries' aircrafts [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6269.24s)]
*  were deployed. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6271.24s)]
*  Air defense [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6274.24s)]
*  the air defense worked [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6276.24s)]
*  operated by [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6279.24s)]
*  different [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6281.24s)]
*  Middle Eastern countries. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6283.24s)]
*  These are also [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6284.24s)]

*  it can only [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6874.84s)]
*  happen [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6875.84s)]
*  the way it always has [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6877.84s)]
*  always has in history [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6878.84s)]

*  this will happen [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6884.84s)]

*  they are guilty [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6887.84s)]
*  and as I told you [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6888.84s)]
*  the guilty are different [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6890.84s)]
*  both those who participated [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6891.84s)]

*  and those who [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6894.84s)]
*  remain silent [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6895.84s)]
*  because [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6896.84s)]
*  silence is also about participating [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6897.84s)]
*  in my opinion [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6901.84s)]
*  can I ask about [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6907.84s)]
*  Donald Trump [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6908.84s)]
*  we've already mentioned him a lot [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6909.84s)]
*  but [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6910.84s)]
*  let's focus there [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6911.84s)]
*  what do you admire [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6913.84s)]

*  about Donald Trump [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6916.84s)]
*  and also maybe [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6917.84s)]
*  why do you think he won [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6919.84s)]
*  overwhelmingly [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6921.84s)]
*  the election in 2024 [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6923.84s)]

*  he was stronger [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6927.84s)]
*  he was much more stronger [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6929.84s)]
*  than Kamala Harris [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6932.84s)]
*  Biden first [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6933.84s)]
*  and then Kamala Harris [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6935.84s)]
*  yes [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6936.84s)]
*  he showed that he can [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6937.84s)]
*  he can [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6938.84s)]
*  intellectually [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6939.64s)]

*  physically [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6942.64s)]
*  it wasn't important point [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6943.64s)]
*  to show that [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6945.64s)]
*  if you want to have a strong country [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6946.64s)]
*  you have to be strong [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6948.64s)]
*  and he was strong [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6949.64s)]
*  and this number of [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6950.64s)]
*  rallies what I said [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6951.64s)]
*  is not a simple thing [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6952.64s)]

*  he [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6958.64s)]
*  he doesn't have any questions [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=6959.64s)]

*  of the United States [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7003.64s)]
*  for him [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7004.64s)]
*  his priority [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7005.64s)]
*  is his questions [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7006.64s)]
*  in the United States [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7007.64s)]

*  that he will finish the war [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7014.64s)]
*  and I [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7015.64s)]
*  hope very much [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7016.64s)]
*  because [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7019.64s)]
*  I think that [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7021.64s)]
*  that our people [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7022.64s)]

*  his idea [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7025.64s)]
*  and that's why [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7026.64s)]
*  I said it is for me [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7027.64s)]
*  it's very very important [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7029.64s)]

*  that [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7079.64s)]
*  Putin doesn't want to stop the war [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7080.64s)]

*  you said that there's some things [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7134.44s)]
*  about the war that [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7136.44s)]
*  maybe [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7137.44s)]
*  Americans don't understand [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7138.44s)]
*  so we talked about Putin [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7140.44s)]
*  we talked about the security guarantees [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7142.44s)]

*  I think [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7184.44s)]
*  for him [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7186.44s)]
*  this is [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7187.44s)]

*  I just don't want to [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7222.44s)]
*  people need to know details [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7223.44s)]
*  for example [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7225.44s)]
*  Georgia [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7226.44s)]
*  which was headed towards the EU and NATO [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7227.44s)]

*  fact that they have frozen conflicts [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7234.44s)]
*  they have in Abkhazia [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7236.44s)]
*  what we have with Donbass [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7237.24s)]
*  which is controlled by militant rebels [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7239.24s)]
*  Abkhazia is not developing [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7241.24s)]
*  it's just a part [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7242.24s)]
*  a very beautiful part of Georgia [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7243.24s)]
*  that has died [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7245.24s)]
*  and if you have the opportunity [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7246.24s)]
*  then [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7248.24s)]
*  go there someday [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7249.24s)]
*  you will understand [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7250.24s)]

*  because Putin wanted to [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7252.24s)]
*  he wanted not to allow them to develop [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7253.24s)]

*  it's very important for him [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7267.04s)]

*  in Ukraine [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7372.44s)]

*  Putin would like to see [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7402.44s)]
*  is a weak NATO [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7404.44s)]

*  simply cannot survive [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7414.44s)]
*  and prevent me [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7415.44s)]
*  from building [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7417.44s)]

*  with Trump [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7420.44s)]
*  I think these two steps [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7421.44s)]
*  leaving NATO [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=7423.44s)]

*  2019 [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8295.44s)]
*  in big part [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8296.44s)]
*  your message of fighting corruption [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8297.44s)]
*  but there's a lot of accusations [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8299.44s)]
*  that during war [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8301.44s)]
*  I mentioned [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8303.44s)]
*  $9 trillion in the United States [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8304.44s)]
*  war [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8306.44s)]
*  breeds corruption [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8307.44s)]
*  so can you speak to that [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8309.44s)]
*  how you have been fighting corruption [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8311.44s)]
*  and can you respond to the accusations [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8314.44s)]
*  that has been corruption [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8316.44s)]
*  in Ukraine [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8318.44s)]
*  you know it's very simple [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8320.44s)]
*  first of all [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8321.44s)]
*  we really have a very sophisticated [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8322.24s)]
*  anti-corruption system [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8325.24s)]
*  sophisticated not in the sense [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8326.24s)]
*  that it's difficult to understand [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8328.24s)]
*  but in that [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8329.24s)]
*  it really consists of many elements [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8330.24s)]
*  it's the most [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8332.24s)]
*  sophisticated in all of Europe [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8333.24s)]
*  this is another requirement [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8336.24s)]
*  of the European Union [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8338.24s)]
*  it was a requirement for [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8339.24s)]
*  Ukraine [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8341.24s)]
*  and [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8342.24s)]
*  for many years Ukraine [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8343.24s)]
*  was not trusted [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8345.24s)]
*  I want to tell you that under me [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8346.24s)]
*  we all voted for bills [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8348.24s)]
*  and we all voted for [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8350.24s)]
*  all the anti-corruption reforms [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8351.24s)]
*  all [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8354.24s)]
*  well almost all reforms [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8355.24s)]
*  and [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8357.24s)]
*  all anti-corruption bodies today [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8358.24s)]
*  are independent [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8360.24s)]
*  they work [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8361.24s)]
*  as requested [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8362.24s)]
*  I still believe that they are not perfect yet [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8364.24s)]
*  there are many issues [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8367.24s)]
*  there is a judicial system [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8368.24s)]
*  but also a judicial reform [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8370.24s)]
*  that our partners [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8372.24s)]
*  the United States [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8373.24s)]
*  plus the EU [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8374.24s)]
*  demanded from us [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8375.24s)]
*  this is all written out [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8377.24s)]
*  this is written out [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8379.24s)]
*  this is written out [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8380.04s)]
*  in specific laws [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8381.04s)]
*  in specific decrees [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8383.04s)]
*  in specific decisions [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8384.04s)]
*  we did this [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8386.04s)]
*  we've done [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8387.04s)]
*  99% of this [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8388.04s)]
*  if something has not been done [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8390.04s)]
*  it means [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8392.04s)]
*  that it is on the way [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8393.04s)]
*  but [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8394.04s)]
*  in principle all this exists [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8395.04s)]
*  and there is no such system [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8396.04s)]
*  as we have in Europe [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8398.04s)]
*  to say [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8399.04s)]
*  that we do not have corruption [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8400.04s)]
*  would be lying [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8402.04s)]
*  we just talk [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8403.04s)]
*  about it openly [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8404.04s)]
*  we are genuinely fighting against it [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8405.04s)]
*  look we have [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8408.04s)]
*  sitting in our prison [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8408.84s)]
*  Ihor Kolomoisky [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8410.84s)]
*  who is [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8412.84s)]
*  the most [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8413.84s)]
*  influential [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8414.84s)]
*  Ukrainian [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8415.84s)]
*  oligarch [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8416.84s)]
*  since independence [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8417.84s)]
*  and no one could do anything about him [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8419.84s)]
*  the United States of America [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8421.84s)]
*  wanted to have Kolomoisky [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8422.84s)]
*  and they went to great lengths [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8424.84s)]
*  because of money laundering [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8426.84s)]
*  etc. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8427.84s)]
*  there are criminal cases [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8428.84s)]
*  in the United States [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8430.84s)]
*  I think in Delaware [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8431.84s)]
*  something like that [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8432.84s)]
*  neither Europe could do anything about it [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8433.84s)]
*  that is [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8435.84s)]
*  we did a lot with our partners [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8436.84s)]
*  with our oligarchs [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8438.84s)]
*  Russian oligarchs [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8439.84s)]
*  sanctions were imposed [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8441.84s)]
*  they were thrown out [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8443.84s)]
*  some of them fled the state [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8444.84s)]
*  but they are all [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8446.84s)]
*  they are all under sanctions [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8447.84s)]
*  we exchanged [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8449.84s)]
*  some of them [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8450.84s)]
*  for our soldiers [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8451.84s)]
*  such as Medvedchuk [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8452.84s)]
*  to whose daughter [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8454.84s)]
*  Putin is godfather [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8455.84s)]
*  that is [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8457.84s)]
*  we fought against the [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8458.84s)]
*  strongest influential oligarchs [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8460.84s)]
*  which [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8463.84s)]
*  are [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8465.84s)]
*  and we're in Ukraine [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8467.64s)]
*  and we eliminated a lot of corruption [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8468.64s)]
*  of course corruption exists [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8470.64s)]
*  in everyday life [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8471.64s)]
*  it exists [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8473.64s)]
*  but institutionally [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8474.64s)]
*  I am sure [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8476.64s)]
*  that Ukraine will overcome all this [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8477.64s)]
*  this takes a little time [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8479.64s)]
*  I would say honestly [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8481.64s)]
*  that [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8482.64s)]
*  listen what we call corruption [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8484.64s)]
*  and in some state of the world [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8488.64s)]
*  is called lobbyism [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8490.64s)]
*  but this does not mean [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8492.64s)]
*  that there is no corruption there [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8494.64s)]
*  let's take the aid [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8496.44s)]

*  except for the war [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8508.44s)]
*  we received weapons [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8510.44s)]
*  from the United States of America [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8512.44s)]
*  from Europe [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8514.44s)]
*  if we take for example [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8515.44s)]
*  money from the United States of America [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8516.44s)]
*  during all this time of the war [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8520.44s)]

*  just as an example [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8542.24s)]

*  this is the second [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8549.24s)]
*  here is [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8551.24s)]
*  just one small example [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8552.24s)]
*  for you [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8554.24s)]
*  when the United States began [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8555.24s)]
*  to transfer us weapons [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8557.24s)]
*  it was American money [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8559.24s)]
*  but American weapons [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8562.24s)]
*  money for these weapons [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8564.24s)]
*  I had [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8566.24s)]
*  as a president [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8568.24s)]
*  I had cargo jets [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8569.24s)]
*  not in Ukraine [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8572.24s)]
*  because of the war [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8573.24s)]
*  we moved them very quickly to Europe [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8574.24s)]
*  we had cargo [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8576.24s)]
*  we have good cargo fleet [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8578.24s)]
*  very good [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8581.24s)]
*  of [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8582.24s)]
*  because of Antonov [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8583.24s)]
*  so I asked [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8585.24s)]
*  American side [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8589.24s)]
*  to grant me the opportunity [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8591.24s)]
*  because our jets [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8592.24s)]
*  are at another [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8594.24s)]
*  airfield [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8597.24s)]
*  and I asked [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8599.24s)]
*  America [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8601.24s)]
*  to give me the opportunity [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8602.24s)]
*  to use our jets [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8604.24s)]
*  for transfer [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8606.24s)]
*  not to pay a lot [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8607.24s)]
*  to whom [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8609.24s)]
*  to your companies [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8610.24s)]
*  to American companies [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8611.24s)]
*  so I didn't get this opportunity [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8613.04s)]
*  my jets [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8616.04s)]
*  stayed put [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8617.04s)]
*  and the United States jets [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8619.04s)]
*  cargo jets [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8621.04s)]
*  moved these weapons [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8622.04s)]
*  but everywhere [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8625.04s)]
*  you have to [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8626.04s)]
*  spend money [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8627.04s)]
*  so [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8629.04s)]
*  we could get more weapons [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8632.04s)]
*  but we have to pay for this [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8634.04s)]
*  very expensive [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8636.04s)]
*  fleet [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8638.04s)]
*  my question [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8639.04s)]
*  is this corruption or not [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8641.04s)]
*  or lobbyism [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8643.04s)]
*  what is it [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8645.04s)]
*  you mean corruption [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8646.04s)]
*  on the part of the US companies [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8647.04s)]
*  yes making such decisions [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8649.04s)]
*  the lobbying for such decisions [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8651.04s)]
*  involves some companies [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8653.04s)]
*  that make these decisions [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8654.04s)]
*  but I can't be open about it [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8656.04s)]
*  and I couldn't speak loudly about it [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8658.04s)]
*  I didn't want [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8660.04s)]
*  nor did I intend to cause any scandals to arise [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8662.04s)]
*  because otherwise [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8664.04s)]
*  you can freeze the support [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8665.04s)]
*  and that's it [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8667.04s)]
*  and that's why [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8668.04s)]
*  when we talk about corruption [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8669.04s)]
*  we must ask [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8670.04s)]
*  who is involved [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8671.04s)]
*  if we had 177 [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8673.04s)]
*  and if we get the half [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8675.04s)]
*  where is the half [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8676.04s)]
*  if you will find [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8680.04s)]
*  the second half [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8682.04s)]
*  you will find [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8683.04s)]
*  corruption [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8684.04s)]
*  there is a perception of corruption [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8685.04s)]
*  people like Donald Trump [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8687.04s)]
*  and Elon Musk really care [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8689.04s)]
*  about fighting corruption [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8691.04s)]
*  what can you say to them [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8694.04s)]
*  to gain their trust [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8696.04s)]
*  that the money is going towards [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8698.04s)]
*  this fight for freedom [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8700.04s)]
*  towards the war effort [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8701.04s)]
*  in most cases [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8703.04s)]
*  we did not receive money [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8704.04s)]
*  we received weapons [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8705.04s)]
*  and where we saw risks [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8708.04s)]
*  that something could be a weapon [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8710.04s)]
*  we would slap everyone on the wrist [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8712.04s)]
*  and believe me [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8714.04s)]
*  this is not only about Ukraine [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8715.04s)]
*  on the supply chain [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8717.04s)]
*  everywhere [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8719.04s)]
*  there are some or other [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8720.04s)]
*  people and companies [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8722.04s)]
*  who want to make money [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8723.04s)]
*  because everyone makes money [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8724.04s)]
*  on the war [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8725.04s)]
*  we did not profit from the war [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8727.04s)]
*  if we found someone [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8729.04s)]
*  believe me [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8730.04s)]
*  we slapped everyone on the wrist [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8731.04s)]
*  and we did that [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8733.04s)]
*  we did that [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8735.04s)]
*  and we will continue to do so [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8736.04s)]
*  because to this day [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8738.04s)]
*  when someone says [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8741.04s)]
*  that Ukraine was selling weapons [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8742.04s)]
*  and by the way [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8744.04s)]
*  Russia was the one [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8746.04s)]
*  pushing this narrative [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8747.04s)]
*  we always responded [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8748.04s)]
*  our soldiers would kill such people [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8750.04s)]
*  with their own hands [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8753.04s)]
*  without any trial [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8755.04s)]
*  do you honestly think [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8757.04s)]
*  anyone could steal weapons [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8758.04s)]
*  by the truckload [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8759.04s)]
*  when we ourselves [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8760.04s)]
*  don't have enough [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8761.04s)]
*  on the front lines [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8761.84s)]
*  and yet [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8762.84s)]
*  we have to provide proof [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8763.84s)]
*  to defend ourselves [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8764.84s)]
*  because when [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8765.84s)]
*  there's an abundance [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8766.84s)]
*  of such misinformation [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8767.84s)]
*  distrust starts to grow [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8769.84s)]
*  and you're right [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8771.84s)]
*  people listen to various [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8773.84s)]
*  media outlets [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8774.84s)]
*  see this [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8775.84s)]
*  and lose faith in you [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8776.84s)]
*  in the end [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8777.84s)]
*  you lose trust [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8778.84s)]
*  and with it [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8780.84s)]
*  you lose support [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8781.84s)]
*  therefore [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8783.84s)]
*  believe me [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8785.84s)]
*  we are fighting more [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8786.84s)]
*  against disinformation [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8787.84s)]
*  than against particular cases [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8789.84s)]
*  although [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8791.84s)]
*  I still emphasize [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8792.84s)]
*  once again [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8793.84s)]
*  at the everyday level [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8794.84s)]
*  such things [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8796.84s)]
*  are still important [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8797.84s)]
*  we catch these [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8798.84s)]
*  these people [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8800.84s)]
*  and we fight them [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8801.84s)]

*  first of all [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8940.24s)]

*  for that [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8952.24s)]
*  I think we need [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8953.24s)]
*  I would like him to come to Ukraine [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8954.24s)]
*  to talk to people here [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8956.24s)]
*  and to look around [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8958.24s)]
*  and so on [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8960.24s)]
*  Has Elon visited Kiev [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8961.24s)]
*  or Ukraine yet? [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8962.24s)]
*  No [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8963.24s)]
*  I hope the Kiev airport [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8964.24s)]
*  will open soon [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8966.24s)]
*  then it will [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8967.04s)]
*  it will be easier to fly in [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8968.04s)]
*  Yes [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8970.04s)]
*  I am [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8971.04s)]
*  I am looking forward to it [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8972.04s)]
*  maybe we will open it [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8974.04s)]
*  but only [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8975.04s)]
*  and you must understand [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8976.04s)]
*  if the war is over [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8977.04s)]
*  there must be sustainable peace [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8978.04s)]
*  and air defense systems [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8980.04s)]
*  to be honest [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8982.04s)]
*  and we must ensure [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8983.04s)]
*  that they are long lasting [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8984.04s)]
*  and effective [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8985.04s)]
*  let's take the airport [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8986.04s)]
*  for example [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8987.04s)]
*  and let's focus [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8988.04s)]
*  on the airport in Zhezhchow [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8990.04s)]
*  which you know very well [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8992.04s)]
*  as it is handling [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8993.04s)]
*  important cargo [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8994.04s)]
*  for Ukraine and Poland [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8995.84s)]
*  and there are patriot systems there [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8997.84s)]
*  because everyone understands [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=8999.84s)]
*  what the risk is [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9000.84s)]
*  well Russia is a risk [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9001.84s)]
*  and therefore we need [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9003.84s)]
*  air defense systems [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9004.84s)]
*  and today [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9006.84s)]
*  today take for example [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9007.84s)]
*  the air defense system [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9008.84s)]
*  of one city or another [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9010.84s)]
*  that is being shelled [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9012.84s)]
*  and move it [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9013.84s)]
*  move it to the airport [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9014.84s)]
*  well [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9016.84s)]
*  that would be dishonest [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9017.84s)]
*  people are more important [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9019.84s)]
*  than planes [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9020.84s)]
*  but there will be a moment [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9022.84s)]
*  and Trump by the way [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9024.64s)]
*  I think that the war will end [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9025.64s)]
*  and President Trump [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9027.64s)]
*  may be the first leader [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9029.64s)]
*  to travel here by airplane [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9031.64s)]
*  I think it would be [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9033.64s)]
*  it would be symbolic by airplane [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9034.64s)]
*  again [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9036.64s)]
*  January 25th [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9037.64s)]

*  President Trump's inauguration [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9055.44s)]
*  I would like to [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9057.44s)]
*  of course [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9058.44s)]
*  I will be considering [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9061.44s)]
*  what is happening then [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9063.44s)]
*  in the war [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9065.44s)]
*  because there are moments [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9066.44s)]
*  of difficulties [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9067.44s)]
*  escalation [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9068.44s)]

*  well [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9073.44s)]
*  I can't [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9074.44s)]
*  I can't come [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9075.44s)]
*  especially during the war [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9076.44s)]
*  unless President Trump [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9078.44s)]
*  invites me [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9079.44s)]
*  personally [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9080.44s)]
*  I'm not sure it's proper to come [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9082.24s)]
*  because [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9084.24s)]
*  I know that in general [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9085.24s)]
*  leaders are [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9086.24s)]
*  for some reason [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9087.24s)]
*  not usually invited [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9088.24s)]

*  of America [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9095.24s)]
*  well and I know [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9097.24s)]
*  that there are leaders [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9098.24s)]
*  who can simply come [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9099.24s)]
*  want to come [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9101.24s)]
*  and will come [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9102.24s)]
*  yeah I know [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9104.24s)]
*  and I know [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9106.24s)]
*  the temperament [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9107.24s)]
*  of some of these people [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9109.24s)]
*  they can come [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9110.24s)]
*  at their discretion [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9112.24s)]
*  this is very [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9113.24s)]
*  very difficult for me [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9115.24s)]
*  I am the kind of person [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9116.24s)]
*  that cannot [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9117.24s)]
*  come [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9119.24s)]
*  without an invitation [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9120.24s)]
*  this is Putin [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9122.24s)]
*  we did not invite him [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9123.24s)]
*  he came to us [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9124.24s)]
*  so to say [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9125.24s)]
*  and me [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9126.24s)]
*  I can't do that [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9128.24s)]
*  no [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9129.24s)]
*  but didn't he publicly say that [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9130.24s)]
*  it would be great [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9131.24s)]
*  if you came to the inauguration [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9132.24s)]
*  or you mean [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9133.24s)]
*  did he invite it officially [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9134.24s)]
*  no [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9135.24s)]
*  wait look look [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9136.24s)]
*  listen [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9137.24s)]
*  I am against any bureaucracy [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9138.24s)]
*  I get rid of it [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9139.24s)]
*  as [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9141.24s)]
*  as much as I can [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9142.24s)]
*  but [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9143.24s)]
*  well [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9144.24s)]
*  you know [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9146.24s)]
*  there are some complexities [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9147.24s)]
*  involving security [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9149.24s)]
*  I decide [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9150.24s)]
*  and I fly [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9151.24s)]
*  and [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9152.24s)]
*  the United States of America [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9153.24s)]
*  officially provides [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9155.24s)]
*  security [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9156.24s)]
*  not that I need this [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9157.24s)]
*  mind you [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9158.24s)]
*  I do not ask for helicopters [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9159.24s)]
*  to fly around [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9160.24s)]
*  and protect me [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9161.24s)]
*  but they will simply do it [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9162.24s)]
*  themselves [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9163.24s)]
*  the security service itself [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9164.24s)]
*  they had [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9166.24s)]
*  to do it [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9167.24s)]
*  I don't want it [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9168.24s)]
*  and sometimes [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9169.24s)]
*  I don't need it [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9170.24s)]
*  and I am asking them [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9171.24s)]
*  for example [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9172.24s)]
*  before the war [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9173.24s)]
*  I think [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9175.24s)]
*  yes it was [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9176.24s)]
*  before the war [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9177.24s)]
*  I just [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9178.24s)]
*  I had a meeting [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9179.24s)]
*  yes with President Trump [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9180.24s)]
*  it was in 2019 [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9181.24s)]
*  I just wanted [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9183.24s)]
*  just wanted to go for a [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9184.24s)]
*  run early in the morning [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9185.24s)]
*  because I really wanted to exercise [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9186.24s)]
*  and they [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9188.24s)]
*  those tall bodyguards [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9189.24s)]
*  a lot of them [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9191.24s)]
*  they decided to join me [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9192.24s)]
*  but I couldn't really do it [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9194.24s)]
*  because [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9195.24s)]
*  they were in suits [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9196.24s)]
*  and I was in sportswear [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9197.24s)]
*  I said no [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9199.24s)]

*  you know [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9203.24s)]
*  I don't want to [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9204.24s)]
*  disturb anybody [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9205.24s)]

*  problems with me [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9207.24s)]
*  and that's [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9208.24s)]
*  that's why [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9209.24s)]
*  if [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9210.24s)]

*  and [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9232.24s)]
*  and I think it's important [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9233.24s)]
*  it's important [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9234.24s)]
*  alright [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9235.24s)]
*  let's get back to a serious question [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9236.24s)]
*  sometimes they say it in America [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9238.24s)]
*  this question of [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9240.24s)]
*  who is really in power [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9241.24s)]
*  so [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9242.24s)]
*  let me ask [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9243.24s)]
*  is someone controlling you [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9244.24s)]
*  for example oligarchs [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9246.24s)]
*  American politicians [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9248.24s)]
*  Bermak [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9250.24s)]
*  I wanted to bring this up [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9254.24s)]
*  because [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9256.24s)]
*  I have been here [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9257.24s)]
*  in Ukraine [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9259.24s)]
*  since [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9260.24s)]
*  the [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9261.04s)]
*  twice since [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9262.04s)]
*  the invasion of [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9263.04s)]
*  2022 [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9265.04s)]
*  and one of the things I've learned [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9266.04s)]
*  well [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9267.04s)]
*  is that [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9268.04s)]
*  actually nobody controls you [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9269.04s)]
*  and [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9271.04s)]
*  this is [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9272.04s)]
*  this is one of your strengths [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9273.04s)]
*  as a president [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9274.04s)]
*  as a person [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9275.04s)]
*  that [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9276.04s)]
*  oligarchs [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9277.04s)]
*  and other rich and powerful people like that [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9279.04s)]
*  cannot control you [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9281.04s)]
*  can you explain why that is [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9283.04s)]
*  how you see it [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9284.04s)]
*  I think [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9285.04s)]
*  and it is indeed true [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9287.04s)]
*  that I'm generally difficult [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9289.04s)]
*  to deal with [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9291.04s)]
*  I am [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9293.04s)]
*  an ambitious person [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9295.04s)]
*  I can't submit to anyone [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9297.04s)]
*  I can live by rules [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9300.04s)]
*  by laws [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9301.04s)]
*  I believe that [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9303.04s)]
*  this is the only thing that [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9305.04s)]
*  can control any person [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9307.04s)]
*  today [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9309.04s)]
*  these are the rules [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9310.04s)]
*  and laws [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9311.04s)]
*  of the society or state [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9313.04s)]
*  where you live [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9315.04s)]
*  and I believe [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9317.04s)]
*  that this is the most important thing [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9318.04s)]
*  there is no person [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9319.84s)]
*  who could control me [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9320.84s)]
*  as I once told [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9321.84s)]
*  President Trump [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9322.84s)]
*  when we had a meeting [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9324.84s)]
*  by the way [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9325.84s)]
*  journalists asked [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9326.84s)]
*  if Trump [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9328.84s)]
*  influenced me [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9329.84s)]
*  during the phone call [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9330.84s)]
*  I told him [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9331.84s)]
*  I told the journalist [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9332.84s)]
*  the truth then [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9333.84s)]
*  who can influence me [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9334.84s)]
*  only my [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9336.84s)]
*  my boy [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9337.84s)]
*  my son [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9338.84s)]
*  this is a fact [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9339.84s)]
*  when he calls asking for something [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9340.84s)]
*  well then I lift up my arms [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9342.84s)]
*  yes [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9344.84s)]
*  and I cannot do anything about it [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9345.84s)]
*  because [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9346.84s)]
*  children are children [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9347.84s)]
*  I have so little time with them [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9348.64s)]
*  and therefore [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9350.64s)]
*  when there are these moments [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9351.64s)]
*  they are precious [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9352.64s)]
*  and important to me [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9353.64s)]
*  I am ready to do anything [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9354.64s)]
*  also probably my parents [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9357.64s)]
*  they are an authority for me [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9360.64s)]
*  beyond that [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9363.64s)]
*  I view it more as [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9365.64s)]
*  a system [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9367.64s)]
*  no one can control the president [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9368.64s)]
*  therefore [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9370.64s)]
*  we have oligarchs [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9371.64s)]
*  who either fled [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9372.64s)]
*  or are in prison [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9373.64s)]
*  because oligarchs [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9375.64s)]
*  usually control cash flows [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9376.64s)]
*  and people [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9378.64s)]
*  and influence politics [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9379.64s)]
*  and we have concrete examples [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9381.64s)]
*  with sentences [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9383.64s)]
*  they are not just under house arrest [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9384.64s)]
*  not just that [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9386.64s)]
*  there are some judgments [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9387.64s)]
*  under which their assets were frozen [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9389.64s)]
*  or sanctions were imposed [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9391.64s)]
*  there are specific people [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9392.64s)]
*  who are behind bars [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9394.64s)]
*  I think this is the answer [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9395.64s)]
*  regarding the influence [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9397.64s)]
*  would they like to influence me [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9398.64s)]
*  in the same way [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9400.64s)]
*  as any president of Ukraine [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9401.64s)]
*  because [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9403.64s)]
*  finance and cash flows [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9404.64s)]
*  always influence politics [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9406.64s)]
*  well [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9408.64s)]
*  at least [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9409.64s)]
*  they want to do this [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9410.64s)]
*  this is regarding the influence [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9413.64s)]
*  and other people [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9416.64s)]
*  on the vertical [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9417.64s)]
*  they [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9418.64s)]
*  perform tasks [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9420.64s)]
*  as my [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9421.64s)]
*  my managers [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9422.64s)]
*  Andri you mentioned [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9424.64s)]
*  is one of those [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9425.64s)]
*  managers [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9427.64s)]
*  well [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9428.64s)]
*  I am glad that [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9429.64s)]
*  I have such people [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9432.64s)]
*  well [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9434.64s)]
*  probably [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9435.64s)]
*  there is nothing else [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9436.64s)]
*  there is nothing else to add here [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9437.44s)]
*  I will just say that your team that I spoke with [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9439.44s)]
*  is an excellent team [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9442.44s)]

*  one last question [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9447.44s)]
*  the future of Ukraine [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9448.44s)]
*  if you look 5, 10, 20 years into the future [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9449.44s)]
*  what can help Ukraine flourish economically [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9452.44s)]
*  culturally, politically in the future [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9455.44s)]
*  digital [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9457.44s)]
*  it's very important [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9459.44s)]
*  digitalization of all the process [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9460.44s)]
*  we began this work [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9462.44s)]
*  we have special ministry of digital transformation [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9463.44s)]

*  this is the name for all of these services [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9472.44s)]
*  yeah [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9474.44s)]
*  so I think that is the most important [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9475.44s)]
*  this is [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9477.44s)]
*  again [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9478.44s)]
*  this is not only convenient [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9479.44s)]
*  that will cancel [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9481.44s)]
*  all the [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9482.44s)]
*  any [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9483.44s)]
*  possibilities for future corruption [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9484.44s)]
*  because you don't have any [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9486.44s)]
*  you know [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9488.44s)]
*  you don't have any personal connections with people in the government or elsewhere [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9489.44s)]
*  so [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9492.44s)]
*  you are just on your phone or any other device [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9493.44s)]
*  that's it [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9495.44s)]
*  and I think we are doing very well [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9496.24s)]
*  we are the best in Europe [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9498.24s)]
*  all of Europe recognizes it [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9500.24s)]
*  some countries of the African Union asked [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9502.24s)]
*  us to provide this [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9505.24s)]
*  the same service [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9507.24s)]
*  and we will do it [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9508.24s)]
*  after the war [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9509.24s)]
*  immediately [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9510.24s)]
*  and I think that we can bring money to Ukraine from this [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9511.24s)]
*  and I think what we also need [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9515.24s)]
*  we need a tax reform [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9517.24s)]
*  I think it will be very important [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9519.24s)]
*  for the businesses to return [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9521.24s)]
*  a lot of support will come [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9523.24s)]
*  I think from USA [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9525.04s)]
*  business investment [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9527.04s)]
*  not as direct aid to us [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9528.04s)]
*  just to the private sector and resources [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9531.04s)]
*  and I mentioned this to President Trump [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9534.04s)]
*  and to some European leaders [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9536.04s)]
*  who are our key strategic partners [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9538.04s)]
*  that will be happy [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9540.04s)]
*  especially with the Americans [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9542.04s)]
*  will be happy to sign these contracts [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9543.04s)]
*  and engage [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9546.04s)]
*  in joint investments in many areas [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9547.04s)]
*  and [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9550.04s)]
*  I think we can [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9551.04s)]
*  we can develop [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9553.04s)]
*  we can develop oil, gas, green energy [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9553.84s)]
*  including solar power [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9555.84s)]
*  and we already have the resources [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9557.84s)]
*  we can invest money into this [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9559.84s)]
*  we have oil reserves in the Black Sea [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9561.84s)]
*  that we can [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9563.84s)]
*  we can exploit [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9565.84s)]
*  and we need your [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9566.84s)]
*  expertise [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9569.84s)]
*  and [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9570.84s)]
*  the investment of your companies [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9571.84s)]
*  we have gold and uranium [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9573.84s)]
*  reserves [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9575.84s)]
*  the largest in Europe [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9576.84s)]
*  by the way [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9577.84s)]
*  which is also very important [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9578.84s)]
*  for example Russia has pushed [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9580.84s)]
*  France [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9582.84s)]
*  out of Africa [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9583.84s)]
*  they urgently need uranium [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9584.84s)]
*  which we have [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9586.84s)]
*  so we are ready to open up for investments [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9587.84s)]
*  and [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9589.84s)]
*  this will give us [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9591.84s)]
*  of course opportunities [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9592.84s)]
*  jobs for people [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9594.84s)]
*  revenue [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9596.84s)]
*  I don't want cheap labor honestly [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9597.84s)]
*  what I truly want [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9599.84s)]
*  especially after the war [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9600.84s)]
*  to open up for those people [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9602.84s)]
*  who can really contribute [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9604.84s)]
*  and earn [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9606.84s)]
*  yes [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9607.84s)]
*  and give a reason to the 8 million people [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9608.84s)]
*  to come back [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9610.84s)]
*  yes [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9611.84s)]
*  it's so important [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9612.64s)]
*  and they will come [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9614.64s)]
*  and we will recover and rebuild [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9616.64s)]
*  Ukraine [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9618.64s)]
*  we will be very open to companies [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9619.64s)]
*  and of course we will welcome [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9621.64s)]
*  our people back [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9623.64s)]
*  it's so important [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9625.64s)]
*  culturally [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9626.64s)]
*  I think the most important thing is to remain open [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9628.64s)]
*  and not change our direction [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9631.64s)]
*  because culturally aligning with Russia [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9633.64s)]
*  it's one idea [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9635.64s)]
*  while aligning with Europe [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9636.64s)]
*  is another [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9638.64s)]
*  our people have chosen Europe [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9639.64s)]
*  it's their choice [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9641.64s)]
*  our choice [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9642.64s)]
*  the choice of our nation [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9643.64s)]
*  and I think it's very important [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9644.64s)]
*  but first you have to end the war [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9645.64s)]
*  yes you're right [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9647.64s)]
*  and we will [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9648.64s)]
*  we want peace you know [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9649.64s)]
*  I mean [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9651.64s)]
*  just to make it clear [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9652.64s)]
*  we want peace [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9653.64s)]
*  just what I always say [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9655.64s)]
*  you have to come to Ukraine [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9657.64s)]
*  and see for yourself [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9658.64s)]
*  and people will tell you [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9659.64s)]
*  no we can't [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9661.64s)]
*  forgive [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9662.64s)]
*  those murders who took our [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9664.64s)]
*  our lives [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9667.64s)]
*  but we still want to [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9669.64s)]
*  make peace [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9671.44s)]
*  and honestly I think [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9672.44s)]
*  that the highest approval rating [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9674.44s)]
*  of the President of the United States [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9676.44s)]
*  of Trump [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9678.44s)]
*  now [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9680.44s)]

*  really [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9685.44s)]
*  believe that he [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9687.44s)]
*  can truly help [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9689.44s)]
*  bring peace [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9691.44s)]
*  now they have [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9693.44s)]
*  faith [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9694.44s)]
*  faith [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9696.44s)]
*  that he can make it happen [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9697.44s)]

*  and that he will make sure [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9702.24s)]
*  Putin doesn't get everything he wants [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9704.24s)]
*  this is very important [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9707.24s)]
*  and it's why we believe that we [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9709.24s)]

*  for listening to this conversation [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9730.04s)]
*  with the President of Ukraine [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9732.04s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9734.04s)]
*  and now [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9736.04s)]
*  let me answer some questions [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9737.04s)]
*  and try to reflect on [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9739.04s)]
*  and articulate some things [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9741.04s)]
*  I've been thinking about [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9742.04s)]
*  if you would like to submit questions [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9743.04s)]
*  including in audio and video form [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9745.04s)]

*  slash contact [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9754.04s)]
*  first [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9756.04s)]
*  I got a bunch of questions about [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9757.04s)]
*  this [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9759.04s)]
*  so let me chat about the topic of language [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9760.04s)]
*  and [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9763.04s)]
*  let's say the mechanics of [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9764.04s)]
*  multilingual conversation [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9765.04s)]
*  perhaps the details are interesting [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9768.04s)]
*  to some people [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9769.04s)]
*  it also allows me to reflect back [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9771.04s)]
*  on the puzzle of it [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9772.04s)]
*  in this episode [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9774.04s)]
*  and what I can do better next time [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9775.04s)]
*  I already explained in the intro [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9778.04s)]
*  the symbolic, historic, and geopolitical [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9780.04s)]
*  complexity of the choice of language [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9782.04s)]
*  in the conversation [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9785.04s)]
*  with President Zelensky [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9786.04s)]
*  as I said [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9787.84s)]
*  the Russian language [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9788.84s)]
*  is one that the president speaks [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9789.84s)]
*  fluently [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9790.84s)]
*  and was his primary language [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9791.84s)]
*  for most of his life [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9793.84s)]
*  I speak Russian fluently as well [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9794.84s)]
*  it's the only common language [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9797.84s)]
*  we are both fluent in [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9799.84s)]
*  so any other combination of languages [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9801.84s)]
*  required an interpreter [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9803.84s)]
*  including when I spoke English [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9805.84s)]
*  he did need an interpreter [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9807.84s)]
*  when I spoke English [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9809.84s)]
*  and [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9810.84s)]
*  just like I was [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9811.84s)]
*  was visibly encumbered [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9812.84s)]
*  and annoyed [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9814.84s)]
*  by the process of interpretation [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9815.84s)]
*  this is why I tried to speak in Russian [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9817.84s)]
*  to the president [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9819.84s)]
*  instead of English [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9820.84s)]
*  so that he can directly understand me [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9821.84s)]
*  without an interpreter [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9823.84s)]
*  I'm willing to take the hit for that [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9825.84s)]
*  as I am for everything else [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9827.84s)]
*  I'm not trying to protect myself [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9830.84s)]
*  I'm trying to do [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9832.84s)]
*  whatever is best [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9833.84s)]
*  for the conversation [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9834.84s)]
*  for understanding [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9835.84s)]
*  though it has been [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9837.84s)]
*  getting harder and harder [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9839.84s)]
*  to stay open [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9840.84s)]
*  vulnerable [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9841.84s)]
*  and raw [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9842.84s)]
*  in public [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9843.84s)]
*  while the [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9844.84s)]
*  swarming [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9845.84s)]
*  the swarms [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9846.64s)]
*  of chanting internet mobs [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9848.64s)]
*  stop by with their torches [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9850.64s)]
*  and their color-coded hats [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9851.64s)]
*  flags, frogs, pronouns [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9853.64s)]
*  and hashtags [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9855.64s)]
*  anyway there is a lot of nuanced aspects [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9857.64s)]
*  of the conversational language [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9859.64s)]
*  that I would like to explain here [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9862.64s)]
*  I'll try to be brief [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9864.64s)]
*  I can recommend a lot of books [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9866.64s)]
*  on this topic of language [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9868.64s)]
*  and communication [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9869.64s)]
*  that reveal just how amazing [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9870.64s)]
*  this technology of language is [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9871.64s)]
*  for example [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9873.64s)]
*  for a good overview [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9874.64s)]
*  I recommend John McWhorter's books [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9876.64s)]
*  and especially his lecture series [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9878.64s)]
*  for the great courses on language [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9880.64s)]
*  there are several [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9882.64s)]
*  in the story of human language series [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9883.64s)]
*  he gives a great discussion [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9886.64s)]
*  on spoken language [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9888.64s)]
*  versus written language [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9890.64s)]
*  and that spoken language [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9891.64s)]
*  often relaxes the rules of communication [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9892.64s)]
*  it uses shorter packets of words [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9894.64s)]
*  loads in a bunch of subtle cues [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9898.64s)]
*  and meanings [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9900.64s)]
*  all of which [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9901.64s)]
*  like I'm trying to describe [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9903.64s)]
*  are lost when there's an interpreter [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9905.44s)]
*  in the loop [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9907.44s)]
*  let me also describe [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9909.44s)]
*  some relevant characteristics [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9910.44s)]
*  of my peculiar language [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9911.44s)]
*  abilities in quotes [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9914.44s)]
*  I was never good at speaking [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9916.44s)]
*  I listen, think and understand [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9918.44s)]
*  better than I speak [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9920.44s)]
*  for me this is true [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9921.44s)]
*  for both English [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9923.44s)]
*  and Russian [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9925.44s)]
*  but it is especially true for Russian [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9926.44s)]
*  the Russian language [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9928.44s)]
*  allows for much more room for wit [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9930.44s)]
*  non-standard terms of phrase [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9932.44s)]
*  metaphors [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9934.44s)]
*  humor, rhyme, musicality [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9935.44s)]
*  and let's say [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9937.44s)]
*  deforming of words [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9939.44s)]
*  that create a lot of room for creativity [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9941.44s)]
*  and how meaning and emotion are conveyed [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9943.44s)]
*  you could do the same in English [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9945.44s)]
*  but it's harder [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9947.44s)]
*  I actually find that [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9948.44s)]
*  Brits are sometimes very good at this [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9950.44s)]
*  like one of my favorite humans to talk to [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9953.44s)]
*  is Douglas Murray [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9955.44s)]
*  setting the content of the conversation aside [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9956.44s)]
*  the sheer linguistic brilliance [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9959.44s)]
*  and wit of dialogue [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9961.44s)]
*  with Douglas [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9963.44s)]
*  is a journey in itself [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9964.24s)]
*  I think Christopher Hitchens [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9966.24s)]
*  had the same [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9968.24s)]
*  and many others [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9969.24s)]
*  like I said, especially Brits [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9971.24s)]
*  anyway, I'm able to detect [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9973.24s)]
*  and understand [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9976.24s)]
*  a lot of dynamism and humor [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9977.24s)]
*  in the Russian language [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9979.24s)]
*  but I'm slow to generate it [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9981.24s)]
*  in part because I just don't practice [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9983.24s)]
*  I have very few Russian speaking friends [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9985.24s)]
*  funny enough [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9988.24s)]
*  most of them are Ukrainian [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9989.24s)]
*  but they speak with me [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9991.24s)]
*  and each other in Russian [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9992.24s)]
*  but of course, as I mentioned [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9994.24s)]
*  this is slowly changing [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9996.24s)]
*  due to the war [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9997.24s)]
*  but I tried to speak to the president in Russian [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=9999.24s)]
*  so he would avoid needing an interpreter [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10002.24s)]
*  as much as possible [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10005.24s)]
*  one of the things [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10007.24s)]
*  I want to improve for next time [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10008.24s)]
*  is to make sure I get very good equipment [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10010.24s)]
*  for interpretation [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10012.24s)]
*  and arrange for an interpreter I trust [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10013.24s)]
*  to be exceptionally good [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10015.24s)]
*  for the dynamism [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10017.24s)]
*  and the endurance [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10018.24s)]
*  of a three-hour conversation [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10021.24s)]
*  in the style that I tried to do [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10023.04s)]
*  just to give you some [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10025.04s)]
*  behind-the-scenes details [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10026.04s)]
*  of the experience [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10027.04s)]
*  so equipment-wise, funny enough [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10029.04s)]
*  it's not actually so trivial [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10031.04s)]
*  to set up wireless connections [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10033.04s)]
*  from us, the two people [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10035.04s)]
*  talking to the interpreter [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10037.04s)]
*  and then back to us [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10038.04s)]
*  in a way that's super robust [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10040.04s)]
*  and has clean audio [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10042.04s)]
*  the audio I had in my ear [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10044.04s)]
*  from the interpreter [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10046.04s)]
*  had a loud background noise [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10047.04s)]
*  so the whole time [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10049.04s)]
*  I'm hearing a [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10050.04s)]
*  shhh sound [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10050.84s)]
*  with the voice [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10052.84s)]
*  of the interpreter [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10054.84s)]
*  coming in very quietly [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10055.84s)]
*  what a wonderful experience [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10057.84s)]
*  this whole life is, frankly [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10059.84s)]
*  plus his translation [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10062.84s)]
*  was often incomplete [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10064.84s)]
*  at least for me [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10065.84s)]
*  so I had to put together [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10066.84s)]
*  those puzzle pieces continuously [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10068.84s)]
*  but again, it worked out [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10070.84s)]
*  and hopefully our constant [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10073.84s)]
*  switching of languages [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10074.84s)]
*  and having a meta discussion [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10075.84s)]
*  about language [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10077.84s)]
*  provided good insights [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10078.84s)]
*  as to the complexity [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10079.64s)]
*  of this fight [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10080.64s)]
*  for a nation's identity [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10081.64s)]
*  and sovereignty [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10082.64s)]
*  that Ukraine has gone through [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10083.64s)]
*  behind the scenes, off mic [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10085.64s)]
*  on a personal level [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10087.64s)]
*  President Zelensky [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10089.64s)]
*  was funny, thoughtful [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10090.64s)]
*  and just a kind-hearted person [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10093.64s)]
*  and really, the whole team [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10095.64s)]
*  were just great people [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10097.64s)]
*  it was an experience [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10099.64s)]
*  I'll never forget [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10100.64s)]
*  after the conversation [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10102.64s)]
*  was recorded [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10103.64s)]
*  the next challenge [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10104.64s)]
*  was to translate all of this [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10105.64s)]
*  and overdub it [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10107.64s)]
*  and do it super quickly [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10108.44s)]
*  like these words [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10110.44s)]
*  I'm speaking now [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10111.44s)]
*  have to be translated [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10112.44s)]
*  and dubbed into Ukrainian [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10114.44s)]
*  and Russian [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10116.44s)]
*  11 Labs were really helpful here [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10118.44s)]
*  especially in bringing [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10121.44s)]
*  the President's voice to life [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10122.44s)]
*  in different languages [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10123.44s)]
*  but even more than that [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10125.44s)]
*  they're just an amazing team [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10127.44s)]
*  who inspired me [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10129.44s)]
*  and everyone involved [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10130.44s)]
*  please go support [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10132.44s)]
*  11 Labs [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10133.44s)]
*  they are a great company [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10134.44s)]
*  and great people [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10136.44s)]
*  the translation [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10137.24s)]
*  is separate from the text of speech [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10138.24s)]
*  and was done in part by AI [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10140.24s)]
*  and a lot by human [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10143.24s)]
*  this is where the fact [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10145.24s)]
*  that we had constant switching [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10146.24s)]
*  between three languages [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10147.24s)]
*  was a real challenge [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10148.24s)]
*  so there are six transition mappings [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10150.24s)]
*  that have to be done [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10153.24s)]
*  English to Ukrainian and Russian [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10155.24s)]
*  Ukrainian to English and Russian [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10157.24s)]
*  and then Russian to English [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10159.24s)]
*  and Ukrainian [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10160.24s)]
*  continuously [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10162.24s)]
*  and then [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10164.24s)]
*  sentence by sentence [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10167.24s)]
*  sometimes word by word [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10169.24s)]
*  and each combination of language [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10171.24s)]
*  to language translation [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10173.24s)]
*  is best done by a person [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10174.24s)]
*  who specializes in that kind of mapping [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10175.24s)]
*  so it was all a beautiful mess [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10178.24s)]
*  all of it [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10180.24s)]
*  and on top of all that [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10181.24s)]
*  great translation is super hard [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10183.24s)]
*  for example [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10185.24s)]
*  I've read and listened to [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10186.24s)]
*  a lot of the CF scheme [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10187.24s)]
*  both English and Russian [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10188.24s)]
*  and studied the process [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10190.24s)]
*  of how these books are translated [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10191.24s)]
*  by various translators [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10193.24s)]
*  you can spend a week [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10195.24s)]
*  discussing how to translate [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10196.04s)]
*  a single important sentence well [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10198.04s)]
*  obviously in this situation [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10200.04s)]
*  we don't have weeks [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10202.04s)]
*  we have hours [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10203.04s)]
*  for the whole thing [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10205.04s)]
*  one of the things I regret [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10206.04s)]
*  is not putting enough time [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10208.04s)]
*  into the hiring [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10209.04s)]
*  and selecting great translators [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10210.04s)]
*  from Russian and Ukrainian [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10212.04s)]
*  to English especially [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10214.04s)]
*  I think translation is an art [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10216.04s)]
*  so getting a good translator [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10218.04s)]
*  that works well with us [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10220.04s)]
*  is a process that needs more [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10222.04s)]
*  time and effort [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10224.04s)]
*  I'll be doing that more this month [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10224.84s)]
*  by the way [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10226.84s)]
*  we have a small [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10227.84s)]
*  but amazing team [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10229.84s)]

*  we'd love to work with you [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10240.84s)]
*  like I said about 11 Labs [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10242.84s)]
*  there are a few things [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10244.84s)]
*  as awesome in life [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10245.84s)]
*  as being able to work hard [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10247.84s)]
*  with an amazing team [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10249.84s)]
*  towards a mission [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10250.84s)]
*  all of us are passionate about [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10251.84s)]
*  anyway [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10253.84s)]
*  I'll probably be doing [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10254.84s)]
*  a few more interviews [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10255.84s)]
*  in the Russian language [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10256.84s)]
*  I do have a lingering goal [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10258.84s)]
*  of interviewing [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10259.84s)]
*  the mathematician Gagore Perlman [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10260.84s)]
*  but there's also others [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10263.84s)]
*  I will also work on improving [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10265.84s)]
*  my whole pipeline [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10266.84s)]
*  both equipment wise [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10267.84s)]
*  and interpreter wise [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10268.84s)]
*  in doing these conversations [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10270.84s)]
*  in other languages [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10272.84s)]
*  because there are many [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10274.84s)]
*  that I would like to do [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10275.84s)]
*  in languages I don't speak at all [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10276.84s)]
*  like Chinese, Mandarin [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10278.84s)]
*  or Spanish, Arabic, Hindi [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10279.84s)]
*  Portuguese, French, German [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10281.84s)]
*  I see language [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10284.84s)]
*  as both a barrier [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10285.84s)]
*  for communication [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10286.84s)]
*  and a portal [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10288.84s)]
*  into understanding [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10289.84s)]
*  the spirit of a people [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10290.84s)]
*  connected by that language [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10291.84s)]
*  it's all a weird [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10293.84s)]
*  and beautiful puzzle [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10294.84s)]
*  and I'm just excited [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10295.84s)]
*  to get the chance [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10296.84s)]
*  to explore it [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10297.84s)]
*  alright [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10299.84s)]
*  I got a question [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10300.84s)]
*  on how I prepare [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10301.84s)]
*  for podcasts [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10302.84s)]
*  so this has evolved [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10304.84s)]
*  and expanded more and more [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10306.84s)]
*  over time [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10307.84s)]
*  there are some podcasts [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10308.84s)]
*  that I prepare [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10309.84s)]
*  hundreds of hours for [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10310.84s)]
*  in AI terms [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10312.84s)]
*  I say [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10314.84s)]
*  first I'm training [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10315.84s)]
*  a solid background model [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10316.84s)]
*  by consuming as much [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10317.84s)]
*  variety on the topic [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10318.84s)]
*  as possible [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10319.84s)]
*  a lot of this [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10320.84s)]
*  comes down to [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10321.84s)]
*  picking high signal sources [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10322.84s)]
*  whether it's blogs [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10324.84s)]
*  books, podcasts [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10325.84s)]
*  YouTube videos [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10326.84s)]
*  X accounts [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10327.84s)]
*  and so on [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10328.84s)]
*  for this conversation [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10329.84s)]
*  with President Zelensky [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10330.84s)]
*  for example [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10332.84s)]
*  since February 2022 [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10333.84s)]
*  I've spoken with [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10335.84s)]
*  hundreds of people [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10336.84s)]
*  on the ground [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10337.84s)]
*  I've read [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10338.84s)]
*  Kindle or audiobook [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10339.84s)]
*  about 10 books [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10340.84s)]
*  fully [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10342.84s)]
*  and then I skimmed [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10343.64s)]
*  about 20 more [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10345.64s)]
*  and I don't mean [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10347.64s)]
*  books about Zelensky [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10348.64s)]
*  although he does [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10349.64s)]
*  appear in some of them [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10350.64s)]
*  I mean books where [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10351.64s)]
*  this conversation [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10353.64s)]
*  was fully in the back [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10354.64s)]
*  of my mind [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10355.64s)]
*  as I'm reading the book [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10356.64s)]
*  so for example [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10357.64s)]
*  I read Red Famine [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10359.64s)]
*  by Anna Applebaum [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10361.64s)]
*  it's about Hallamore [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10363.64s)]
*  does it directly [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10365.64s)]
*  relate to Zelensky [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10366.64s)]
*  not on the surface [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10367.64s)]
*  no [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10368.64s)]
*  but it sort of [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10369.64s)]
*  continues to weave [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10370.64s)]
*  the fabric of my [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10371.64s)]
*  understanding [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10372.64s)]
*  of a people [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10373.64s)]
*  of the history [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10374.64s)]
*  of the region [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10375.64s)]
*  but it's really important [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10376.64s)]
*  for me to read books [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10379.64s)]
*  from various perspectives [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10380.64s)]
*  and I'm always trying [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10382.64s)]
*  to calculate the bias [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10383.64s)]
*  under which [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10384.64s)]
*  the author operates [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10385.64s)]
*  and adjusting [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10387.64s)]
*  for that in my brain [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10388.64s)]
*  as I integrate [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10389.64s)]
*  the information [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10390.64s)]
*  for example [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10392.64s)]
*  Anna Applebaum's book [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10393.64s)]
*  Gulag [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10394.64s)]
*  is very different [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10395.64s)]
*  from Alexander Solzhenitsyn's [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10396.64s)]
*  Gulag Archipelago [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10398.64s)]
*  the former [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10400.64s)]
*  is a rigorous [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10401.64s)]
*  comprehensive [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10402.64s)]
*  account [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10403.64s)]
*  the latter [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10404.64s)]
*  is a literary [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10405.64s)]
*  psychological [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10406.64s)]
*  and personal [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10407.64s)]
*  portrait [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10408.64s)]
*  of Soviet society [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10409.64s)]
*  both [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10411.64s)]
*  I think [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10412.64s)]
*  are extremely valuable [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10413.64s)]
*  on the bias front [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10414.64s)]
*  for example [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10415.64s)]
*  The Rise and Fall [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10416.64s)]
*  of the Third Reich [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10417.64s)]
*  by William Schire [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10418.64s)]
*  is a good example [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10419.64s)]
*  it is full of bias [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10420.64s)]
*  but [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10421.64s)]
*  he was there [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10422.64s)]
*  and to me [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10423.64s)]
*  he has written [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10424.64s)]
*  probably [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10425.64s)]
*  one of the greatest [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10426.64s)]
*  if not the greatest book [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10427.64s)]
*  on the Third Reich [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10428.64s)]
*  ever [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10429.64s)]
*  but like I said [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10430.64s)]
*  it has a lot of [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10431.64s)]
*  inaccuracies [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10432.64s)]
*  you can read about them [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10433.64s)]
*  online if you like [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10434.64s)]

*  and in all cases [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10437.64s)]
*  is to adjust [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10438.64s)]
*  based on my understanding [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10439.64s)]
*  of the author's biases [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10440.64s)]

*  from the text [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10443.64s)]

*  aside [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10447.64s)]

*  I'll stop [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10474.44s)]
*  think for a few seconds [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10475.44s)]
*  and then do speech to text [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10476.44s)]
*  note in Google Keep [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10478.44s)]

*  old school [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10486.44s)]
*  and eventually [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10488.44s)]
*  I get a gigantic pile [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10489.44s)]
*  of thoughts [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10490.44s)]
*  and notes [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10491.44s)]
*  that I look over [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10492.44s)]
*  to refresh my memory [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10493.44s)]
*  but for the most part [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10494.44s)]
*  I just throw them out [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10495.44s)]

*  at least for me [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10507.44s)]
*  and I do try a lot [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10508.44s)]
*  for insight extraction [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10509.44s)]
*  or insight generation purposes [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10511.44s)]
*  I should mention [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10513.44s)]

*  what I remember well [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10520.44s)]
*  is that [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10521.44s)]
*  I have those high level ideas [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10522.44s)]

*  for better or for worse [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10525.44s)]

*  to express them [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10533.44s)]
*  makes me sound [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10534.44s)]
*  simplistic [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10536.44s)]
*  and even unprepared [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10537.44s)]
*  I'm not [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10539.44s)]
*  but that's life [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10540.44s)]
*  we have to accept our flaws [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10542.44s)]

*  aside from books [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10545.44s)]
*  I also listen to [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10546.44s)]

*  of the episode [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10552.44s)]
*  I listen probably [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10553.44s)]

*  who to listen to [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10561.44s)]
*  based not on their perspective [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10562.44s)]

*  signal to noise ratio [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10565.44s)]

*  this turns out to be [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10575.44s)]
*  a lot of hours of prep [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10576.44s)]

*  X hours per episode [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10578.44s)]

*  so fast enough [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10985.24s)]
*  I think where [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10987.24s)]
*  it feels like [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10989.24s)]
*  I can think freely [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10990.24s)]
*  without the physical [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10991.24s)]
*  bottlenecks [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10993.24s)]
*  and constraints [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10994.24s)]
*  of my fingers moving [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10995.24s)]
*  the bit rate [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10997.24s)]
*  in Neuralink [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=10999.24s)]
*  parlance [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11001.24s)]
*  is high enough for me [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11002.24s)]
*  to not feel like [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11003.24s)]
*  there is cognitive friction [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11004.24s)]
*  of any kind [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11005.24s)]
*  but the real answer [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11006.24s)]
*  may be the deeper [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11007.24s)]
*  more honest answer [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11008.24s)]
*  or something else [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11009.24s)]
*  I've used the Kinesis keyboard [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11010.24s)]
*  for over 20 years [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11011.24s)]
*  so maybe it's [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11014.24s)]
*  like one of those love stories [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11015.24s)]
*  where a guy and a girl [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11018.24s)]
*  love each other [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11019.24s)]
*  and you try to quib [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11021.24s)]
*  because it doesn't quite work [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11022.24s)]
*  but every time you leave [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11024.24s)]
*  you ask yourself why [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11025.24s)]
*  and then you realize [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11027.24s)]
*  that when you're together [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11028.24s)]
*  your life is just full [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11031.24s)]
*  of simple joys [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11032.24s)]
*  so what's the point [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11033.24s)]
*  of leaving [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11034.24s)]
*  what's the point of life [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11036.24s)]
*  if not to keep close to you [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11037.24s)]
*  the things that bring you joy [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11038.24s)]
*  Deleon [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11040.24s)]
*  like this keyboard [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11041.24s)]
*  it brings me joy [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11043.24s)]
*  it's a bad metaphor [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11045.24s)]
*  over anthropomorphized [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11048.24s)]
*  perhaps [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11049.24s)]
*  but I never promised [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11050.24s)]
*  a good one [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11051.24s)]
*  I'm like a cheap motel [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11052.24s)]
*  on a road trip [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11053.24s)]
*  low quality [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11054.24s)]
*  with a car [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11055.24s)]
*  I do have some good motel stories [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11057.24s)]
*  for another time [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11059.24s)]
*  this does not feel [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11060.24s)]
*  like the appropriate time [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11061.24s)]
*  all that said [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11063.24s)]
*  to disagree with myself [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11064.24s)]
*  I did use Emacs also [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11065.24s)]
*  for over 20 years [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11067.24s)]
*  and in a single week [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11068.24s)]
*  recently switched to VS Code [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11070.24s)]
*  and then cursor [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11072.24s)]
*  and never looked back [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11073.24s)]
*  so take my romantic nature [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11075.24s)]
*  with a grain of salt [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11077.24s)]
*  so yes [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11079.24s)]
*  eventually I'll have to leave [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11080.24s)]
*  but for now [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11081.24s)]
*  you'll keep finding me [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11082.24s)]
*  on occasion [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11083.24s)]
*  in a random airport [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11084.24s)]
*  listening to brown noise [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11085.24s)]
*  writing away the hours [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11087.24s)]
*  on this kinesis keyboard [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11088.24s)]
*  now [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11090.24s)]
*  if you see me without it [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11092.24s)]
*  maybe it'll give you [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11094.24s)]
*  the same change of melancholy [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11095.24s)]
*  feeling I feel now [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11096.24s)]
*  in looking back [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11098.24s)]
*  to that airport [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11099.24s)]
*  in Detroit [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11100.24s)]
*  anyway [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11103.24s)]
*  more about my travel setup [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11104.24s)]
*  if anyone's curious [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11106.24s)]
*  I usually do travel [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11107.24s)]
*  with a Windows laptop [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11109.24s)]
*  but I am mostly using [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11110.24s)]
*  Linux on it through WSL [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11112.24s)]
*  Windows Subsystem for Linux [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11114.24s)]
*  and in some cases [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11115.24s)]
*  I'm dual booting [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11116.24s)]
*  Linux and Windows [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11117.24s)]
*  I also need to be able to video edit [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11119.24s)]
*  so on longer trips [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11121.24s)]
*  I usually have a bigger laptop [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11123.24s)]
*  with a bigger screen [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11125.24s)]
*  lots of memory [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11126.24s)]
*  good CPU [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11127.24s)]
*  good GPU [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11128.24s)]
*  all of that helps with [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11129.24s)]
*  video editing on Adobe Premiere [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11130.24s)]
*  in general [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11132.24s)]
*  I'm extremely minimalist [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11133.24s)]
*  except for the few [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11135.24s)]
*  let's call them [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11137.24s)]
*  sentimental things [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11138.24s)]
*  like all my podcast [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11140.24s)]

*  fits into a small suitcase [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11143.24s)]
*  I try to keep it [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11144.04s)]
*  as simple as possible [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11145.04s)]
*  thank you for the question [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11146.04s)]

*  I think it's time [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11151.04s)]
*  to bring things to a close [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc&t=11152.04s)]
