# Ryan Graves: UFOs, Fighter Jets, and Aliens | Lex Fridman Podcast #308
**Lex Fridman:** [August 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLDp-aYnR1Y)
*  How are these interacting with our fighters if they are?
*  How are they interacting with the weather and their environment?
*  How are they interacting with each other?
*  So can we look at these and how they're interacting, perhaps as a swarm,
*  especially off the East Coast, where this is happening all the time
*  with multiple objects?
*  The following is a conversation with Lieutenant Ryan Graves,
*  former Navy fighter pilot, including roles as a combat lead, landing
*  signals officer and rescue mission commander.
*  He and people in his squadron detected UFOs on multiple occasions,
*  and he has been one of the few people willing to speak publicly
*  about these experiences and about the importance of investigating these sightings,
*  especially for national security reasons.
*  Ryan has a degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering from WPI
*  and an interest in career roles in advanced technology development,
*  including multi-agent collaborative autonomy, machine learning,
*  assisted air to air combat, manned and unmanned teaming technologies,
*  and most recently, development of materials through quantum simulation.
*  This is a Lex Freeman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Ryan Graves.
*  What did you think of the new Top Gun movie?
*  How accurate was it? Let's start there.
*  I thought the flying was really accurate.
*  I thought the the type of flying they did and how they approached the actual mission,
*  of course, had a lot of liberties.
*  But one thing that seems to be hard to capture on these types of things
*  are the the chess game that's going on while that type of flying is happening.
*  The chess game between like in a dogfight between the
*  the pilots and the enemy or between the different pilots.
*  I'll even speak to just that particular mission they flew there.
*  And for that particular mission, it's kind of a chess game
*  with yourself to to get everything in place.
*  So what kind of flight they flew was called a high threat scenario,
*  which means they have to ingress low due to the surface to air threats,
*  the integrated air defense systems that are nearby.
*  And they have to ingress low and pop up like we see in the movie.
*  And in that particular movie, that was a preplanned strike.
*  They knew exactly where they were going.
*  But there's a scenario where we have to operate in that type of environment.
*  And we don't know exactly where we're going to strike
*  or going to be adapting to real time targets.
*  And so in that scenario, you would have one of those fighters down low
*  like that operating as a mission commander, as a forward air controller.
*  And he's out there calling shots, joining on those other players
*  in order to ensure they're pointed at the right target.
*  So so that's a bit of the chess game that he'll be playing.
*  Can you actually describe for people who haven't seen the movie
*  what the mission actually is? Yeah.
*  What's involved in the mission?
*  So in this particular mission,
*  it's kind of what we would call a preplanned strike.
*  So there's a known location that's in a heavily defended area.
*  And the air crew, in this case, I believe, was four F-18s
*  on the initial package.
*  Their job was to ingress very low down a canyon
*  to stay out of the radar window of the surface to air threats.
*  What does ingress mean?
*  Ingress means that they're going to be pushing from a start location
*  towards a target or the objective.
*  So there's an ingress portion of the mission and an egress portion of the mission.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Like the entrance and the exit. Correct.
*  That type of thing. Got it.
*  But it changes our mindset tactically quite a bit, right?
*  Because when we're entering someplace, we have the option to enter.
*  But when we go drop a bomb on location, we're exiting.
*  We don't have that luxury. We don't have that option.
*  So it actually changes our tactics and our aggression level.
*  Got it. And so they were flying low to the ground.
*  And then there is a surface to air missiles
*  that force them to have to fly low.
*  Is that a realistic thing?
*  It is realistic.
*  So driving those aircraft in the clutter, you know, all radar systems
*  or most, I should say, are essentially line of sight.
*  And so they're going to be limited by the horizon or any clutter out there.
*  And even a number of radars, if they are located up high
*  and looking down towards that aircraft, the clutter, all the
*  the objects such as trees and canyons
*  can have effect on radar systems.
*  And so it can be a type of camouflage.
*  So that's a camouflage for the radar.
*  But what about the surface to air missile?
*  Is that is that a legitimate way to avoid missiles?
*  Is fly solo like fly, I guess, below their their level?
*  As far as I know, you know, you can fly under any radar right now.
*  We don't have necessarily radars that can look through anything.
*  So there is always going to be the ability to mask yourself.
*  But with a larger number of assets and distributed communication networks,
*  where those radars are looking makes all the difference.
*  And I said they were ingressing past an IAS, and that's an integrated
*  air defense system.
*  And that linking of air defense systems is what makes it
*  so hard, so complicated, is that the sensors and the weapons
*  are disassociated from each other so that if you took out the target
*  that was shooting at you, it still has the ability to to intercept
*  you from another radar location.
*  So it's distributed and it's stronger that way.
*  You mean the the surface to air missiles,
*  if you like, it's a it's a distributed system in that if you take out one,
*  they're still able to sort of integrate information
*  about your location and strike at you. Correct.
*  And there's a lot of complication that can go, you know, once we start
*  thinking about distributed systems like that and the ability to self
*  heal and repair and adapt to losses.
*  It's an interesting area.
*  Are you responsible for thinking about that when you're flying an airplane?
*  To some degree, when we ingress to an area like that, we're presented
*  with information about targets, air to air or air to surface
*  or surface to air, I should say.
*  And we can essentially see where
*  essentially the danger zone, if you will, is located.
*  And so essentially we would stay out of that.
*  And so having a full picture of the environment is extremely important
*  because, you know, at the end of the day, if we go in that circle,
*  we can die pretty quickly.
*  So it's absolutely crucial.
*  So there's regions that have higher and lower danger
*  based on your understanding of the actual whatever the the the the surface,
*  the air missiles systems are.
*  So you can kind of know.
*  That's interesting.
*  I wonder how automated that could be to especially when you don't know.
*  It seems like in the movie, they knew the location of everything.
*  I imagine that's less known in most cases.
*  And also a lot of those systems might be a little bit more ghetto,
*  if I can use that technical term like I've gotten ad hoc, maybe is the
*  I don't know. But, you know, having just recently visited Ukraine
*  and seeing a lot of aspects of the way that war is fought,
*  there's a lot of improvised type of systems.
*  So you take high, high tech, like advanced technology.
*  But the way you deploy it and the way you organize it is very
*  improvised and ad hoc and is responding to the uncertainty
*  in a dynamic environment.
*  And so from an enemy perspective, or whoever is trying to deal
*  with that kind of system, it's hard to figure it out because it's like me.
*  I played tennis for a long time and it's always easier to play.
*  This is true for all sports.
*  Play tennis against a good tennis player versus a crappy tennis
*  because the crappy tennis player is full of uncertainty.
*  And that's really difficult to deal with.
*  It seemed like in the movie, the systems were really well organized.
*  And so you could plan.
*  And there's a very nice ravine that went right down the middle of them.
*  That's how movies work, isn't it? Yeah.
*  But no, I absolutely agree.
*  So, you know, what you say is a very good point.
*  And as you know, if we were to take a chunk of airspace
*  and break it up into little bits, you know, there'd be places
*  that are better to fly or less, less good to fly.
*  And, you know, we are seeing that now with what they call manned on manned teaming.
*  We see tactical aircraft or some type of aircraft or platform
*  that's being automated.
*  And it's not being automated in traditional sense,
*  where people think aircrew are flying them around to conduct missions.
*  But it's very high level, objective orientated
*  mission planning that allows the aircrew to act more as a mission planner,
*  mission commander, verse having to just pick the right assets
*  or fly them around and or manipulate them somewhat physically.
*  So actually going back to the chess thing, can you elaborate on what you mean
*  playing a game of chess with yourself?
*  What's when you're flying that mission?
*  What exactly do you mean by that?
*  Well, there's a few people you're usually fighting against in the air.
*  You know, there's the bad guys and then there's physics and and mother nature.
*  Right. So
*  when we're down at about 100 feet,
*  it's a chess game to stay alive for the pilot.
*  And it's a chess game for the whizzo to process the information he needs
*  and then communicate it to all those other aircraft that were flying around
*  to ensure that they're putting their weapons on the right target.
*  What's the whizzo?
*  Whizzo is a weapons systems officer.
*  He's a backsteader who is not a pilot, but they're responsible
*  for radar manipulation and communications and weapons
*  deployments of certain natures.
*  So the chess game is against physics, against the enemy.
*  Time. Time.
*  What about your own psychology, fear, uncertainty?
*  No, no, there's no time for that type of self reflection while we're flying.
*  I want to get I want to get to that, but I don't want to forget
*  the point that you made about increased randomness being a tactical advantage.
*  You know, as we as you mentioned, you know, you can introduce autonomy into there.
*  And when you when you bring autonomy in there,
*  and my expectation would be as we bring different abilities
*  and machine learning, as we gather more data,
*  we're going to be able to bring the tactical environment around that jet.
*  The war space that it goes into will almost be at a stochastic level
*  from the enemy's perspective, where it'll almost seem like
*  every tactical environment they go in will be random and yet very deadly
*  because the system is providing a new tactical
*  solution, essentially, for that particular scenario,
*  instead of just training to particular tactics that have to be
*  reputable and trainable and lethal, right.
*  But not necessarily the most lethal because they have to be trainable.
*  But if we can introduce AI into that and to and to have a level of randomness
*  or at least the appearance of randomness to the complexity.
*  You know, I would like a stochastic tactical advantage
*  because even our own blue fighters wouldn't be able to engage in that fight
*  because it would be unsafe, essentially, for anything else.
*  And I think that's where we have to drive to, because otherwise,
*  it's always this chicken and mouse cat game about whose tactics and who knows what.
*  But if knowledge is no longer a factor, it's going to make things a lot different.
*  That's really interesting.
*  So out of the many things
*  that are part of your expertise, your your journey, you're also working
*  autonomous and semi-autonomous systems, the use of AI and machine
*  learning and manned on man teaming, all that kind of stuff.
*  We'll talk about it.
*  But you're saying sort of when people think about the use of AI
*  in war, military systems, they think about like
*  computer vision for perception or processing of sensor information
*  in order to extract from it actionable knowledge kind of thing.
*  But you're saying you could also use it to generate
*  randomness that's difficult to work with in a like a game theoretic way.
*  Like it's difficult to respond for human operators to respond to.
*  Exactly. That's really interesting.
*  OK, so back to Tom Cruise and Tom Gunn.
*  What about the dogfighting?
*  What aspects of that were accurate?
*  So dogfighting is kind of an interesting conversation
*  because it's not the most tactically relevant skill set nowadays
*  by traditional standards, because the ranges with which we engage
*  and play weapons are very significant.
*  And so if we're in a scenario or in a dogfight like that,
*  a lot of things have probably gone wrong.
*  Right. And that's kind of how this mission was set up.
*  Right. It was a, you know, a no win type scenario, most likely.
*  And so for a dogfight, the aircraft size and the ranges and the turn
*  radiuses make it so it's not very theatrical. Right.
*  The aircraft looks small.
*  And while it's intense with the systems I have and the sensors
*  and what I'm feeling and all that, if you know, we've done it and we've done it.
*  Right. We take video of that.
*  And it's just like a blue sky and you see a little dot out there.
*  So not very interesting.
*  And so anytime it really looks interesting in dogfight arena,
*  that's most likely fiction because we really only get close for,
*  you know, a millisecond as we're dipping past each other at the merge.
*  You're breaking my heart. Right. I know.
*  No, I understand.
*  You can go and have fun, but, you know, in a dogfight specifically.
*  Maybe that was more common in the earlier wars, the World War
*  two and before that, where the is it due to the sort of the range
*  and the effectiveness of the weapon systems involved?
*  Correct. And the accuracy of the targeting systems at range.
*  But there's also a train of thought that hasn't actually been tested out yet,
*  which is with the advent of advanced electronic warfare, EW
*  and or unmanned assets, the battle space may get so complex
*  and missiles may essentially just get dropped out of the sky or wasted
*  such that you're going to be in close with either IR missiles or guns.
*  If it's a no kidding.
*  You know, must defend type scenario.
*  First of all, what's electronic warfare?
*  You know, it's basically trying to get control of electromagnetic spectrum
*  for the interest of whatever operation is going on.
*  So in the tactical environment, a lot of that is trying to deceive the radar.
*  Or can we deceive the missile or just, you know, stop their guidance?
*  Things of that nature.
*  And it's a battle in the space of information, of digital information.
*  Yeah. Well, that's why to have 35.
*  Right. F-22 is a big expensive aircraft and it was made to be
*  a great fighter.
*  But the F-35 is not as great of a fighter, but it's it's an electronic warfare
*  and mission commander platform of the future,
*  where information is what's going to win the war instead of the best dogfighter.
*  And so it's interesting dichotomy there.
*  What's the best airplane ever made fighter jet ever made?
*  I know the aviators in the in the audience are going to hate my answer
*  because they're going to want that sexy, you know, muscly
*  F-14 Tomcat type fighter or or maybe P-51 type aircraft.
*  But the F-35 is maybe not the best dogfighter,
*  but it doesn't have to get in a dogfight, right?
*  It's like how you'd be the best knife fighters, not getting a knife fight sometimes.
*  Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II looks pretty sexy.
*  There's two real strengths you can have as a fighter.
*  You can you can have the ability to kind of out muscle your fighter,
*  your opponent and beat them on G's and power and rate around on them.
*  And then there's the other side of that, which is you can be overly maneuverable.
*  You can bleed energy quickly.
*  And that's what the F-18 was good at, because it had to be heavier to land on aircraft carry.
*  We had to give it extra bulk.
*  But it also needs special mechanisms to slow down enough to land on aircraft carriers.
*  So it made it very maneuverable.
*  And what that leads to a lot of times, the ability to get maybe the first shot
*  in a fight, which is very good.
*  But if you do make that sharp turn, you're going to bleed a lot of your energy away
*  and be more susceptible for follow on shots if that one is less susceptible.
*  And so there's just kind of aggression, non-aggression, game
*  you can play depending on the type of aircraft you're fighting.
*  Where does the F-35 land on that spectrum?
*  F-35 land somewhere behind the F-22s.
*  So there'll probably be a row of F-22s or F-18s and F-35 will be out back,
*  but it'll be enabling a lot of the warfare that's happening in front.
*  Is it one of the more expensive planes because of all the stuff on it?
*  It certainly is. Yeah.
*  In the movie, they have Tom Cruise fly over Mach 10.
*  So maybe can you say, what are the different speeds?
*  Accelerations feel like Mach 1, 2, 3 or hypersonic.
*  Have you ever flown hypersonic? No.
*  Is it get how tough does it get?
*  I'm just going to call out the BS of ejecting at Mach 10, just for the record,
*  because in the movie, there's been, I think, at least one ejection
*  that was supersonic.
*  And I'll just say, it was not pretty, but he survived.
*  So there have to be some interesting mechanisms to eject successfully at Mach 10.
*  But I'll digress on that for the moment.
*  Yeah, that seemed very strange.
*  And he just walked away from it. But anyway, so, you know, he seemed disheveled.
*  OK, it's Tom Cruise.
*  You know, it's like Chuck Norris or something indestructible.
*  And this is what it was an age. Yeah.
*  But anyway, so what
*  what's interesting to say about the experience of
*  as you go up, does it get more and more difficult?
*  In the end of the day, crossing the sound barrier is much like crossing
*  the speed limit on the highway. You don't really notice anything.
*  To cross that, at least in F-18, because we have a lot more weight
*  than most fighters, is typically we'll do that in a descent.
*  We'll do that full afterburner, just dumping gas into the engine.
*  And so that'll get us over the fastest I think I've gone with about 1.28.
*  But what's interesting, people realize, is that if I take that throttle
*  and I'm an afterburner and I just bring it back and just bring it back to mill,
*  which is full power, just not afterburner, the deceleration is so strong
*  due to the air friction that it throw you forward in your straps.
*  Almost, you know, I would say, you know, maybe like 70 percent
*  as strong almost as as trapping on the boat is pretty strong.
*  So it's almost like a reverse car crash just for the deceleration.
*  So acceleration, you know, is usually kind of slow and you don't feel anything,
*  of course, when you're crossing through it.
*  But the deceleration is pretty violent.
*  The deceleration is violent, huh? OK.
*  But is there is there a fundamental difference between like Mach 1
*  and hypersonic Mach 5 and so on?
*  Does it require like super special training?
*  And is that something that's used often in warfare?
*  Is that not really that?
*  No, so hypersonic human flight, if it exists, it's not something
*  that's employed tactically in in any sense right now that I'm aware of.
*  So, you know, I think of hypersonic technology,
*  I think of missiles and weapons systems and delivery platform.
*  I don't think of fighter aircraft necessarily.
*  I can think of bomber or reconnaissance aircraft, perhaps.
*  But those would be more efficient, very long, long range.
*  I imagine acceleration would be kind of gentle, honestly.
*  The thing you experience is the acceleration, not the actual speed.
*  There's been just a small tangent, a lot of discussion
*  about hypersonic nuclear weapons, like missiles from, you know, Russia
*  bragging about that.
*  Is this something that's a significant concern or is it just a way to flex
*  about different kinds of weapon systems?
*  Hypersonics, I do think, pose a challenge for our detection systems
*  because there are, you know, there are
*  there are design considerations in these sensor systems as always.
*  Right. And when you build them and the technology progresses to a point
*  where maybe it's not feasible to use that technology,
*  you know, there's a problem.
*  But with the, you know, the all domain and kind of cross domain
*  data linking capabilities we have, it's less of, you know,
*  it's more of an integrated picture, I'll say.
*  And so the hypersonics are really what it is, is how fast can we detect
*  and destroy a problem?
*  You're just shortening the time available to do that.
*  We call something like that the kill chain, right?
*  It's it's from locating a target and identifying it.
*  And, you know, essentially authorizing its destruction by whatever means
*  employing and then actually following up to ensure that you did
*  what you said you were going to do in some sense.
*  Right. Does it need another reattacks, something of that nature?
*  And so there's an old dog fighting framework you could call it.
*  It's called the OODA loop that kind of made its way in the engineering
*  of business now. But the old observe, orientate, decide act was
*  initially a fighter mechanism in order to get inside that kill
*  chain of your opponent and break it up so that he can't
*  process his kill chain on you.
*  And so hypersonics, a way of shortening those those windows of opportunity
*  to to react to that.
*  I wanted to like how much do you have to shorten it in order for
*  the defense systems not to work anymore?
*  It seems like it's very, you know, I.
*  I'm both often horrified by the thought of nuclear war,
*  but at the same time wonder what that looks like.
*  When I dream of extreme competence in defense systems,
*  I imagine that not a single nuclear weapon can reach the United States
*  by missile with the defense systems or defense systems.
*  But then again, I also understand that these are extremely complicated
*  systems, the amount of integration required.
*  And because you're not using them, I mean, this is exactly
*  there could be, you know, there's like an intern somewhere
*  that like forgot to update the code, the Fortran code that like is going to be
*  make the different because you don't have the opportunity to really thoroughly test,
*  which is really scary.
*  Of course, the systems are probably incredible if they could be tested,
*  but because they can't be really thoroughly tested in actual
*  in an actual attack.
*  I wonder.
*  I mean, I guess one assumption there would be that these hypersonic
*  missiles would only be launched in the case of attack.
*  It'd be interesting if there were other hypersonic objects that we could use to flex those systems.
*  Another thing that actually happened, I just have a million questions I want to ask you.
*  It's fascinating to me is there's a bird strike on the plane.
*  Does that happen often?
*  Yeah, it's a serious damage to the engine and they made it seem like it's a serious,
*  exactly serious issue.
*  I've hit birds.
*  I've I know someone that took a turkey vulture to the front of the plane.
*  I know someone that took a turkey vulture to the face through the cockpit,
*  shattered the cockpit, knocked them out.
*  I think that it actually, I don't know personally about the story.
*  I know from the command I was at and I believe the back seater had to punch out
*  and punch them both out because he was unconscious in the front seat from the bird.
*  It can kill you from hitting you.
*  It's like a bowling ball going 250 miles an hour.
*  It can take out an engine very easily.
*  Every airport I've flown at in the Navy, I've had to check the bird condition, if you will,
*  to see how many birds.
*  We've had to cancel flights because there's too many of them around the airport.
*  Some airports even have bird radars, military airports.
*  Is there systems that monitor the bird condition?
*  There is, yeah.
*  There's actual radar systems and you can go in the certain bases you have to call up
*  and they'll tell you what it is for the day or for that hour and other ones have it in
*  their weather report that goes out over the radio.
*  What are some technological solutions to this or is this just
*  because it's a low probability event, there's no real solution for it?
*  I would say it's not a low probability event.
*  This is happening a lot.
*  Although the hits themselves aren't necessarily that common or I'll say a catastrophic hit,
*  either a near miss or a hit or the pilot having to actively maneuver to avoid it is pretty common.
*  It seems stressful.
*  It is.
*  It's so common in fact that we know that you never want to go under a bird if you see it in
*  front of you.
*  You always want to try to go over it because what they'll do immediately if they see you is
*  and you startle them, they'll bring their wings in and just drop straight down to try to get out
*  of the path.
*  It's interesting.
*  I didn't know they did that.
*  If you try to go under them, they're going to be dropping into you.
*  You typically want to try to go above them.
*  Is this something you can train for or no?
*  Is this one of those things you have to really experience?
*  It's a skill set that you somewhat train for in the duties of being a fighter pilot in a sense.
*  Being able to react to your environment very quickly and make decisions quickly.
*  Is that one of the more absurd things, challenges you have to deal with in flying?
*  Is there other things, maybe weather conditions, harsh weather conditions?
*  Is there something that we maybe don't often think about in terms of the challenges of flying?
*  Birds in a way aren't a ridiculous threat for us.
*  It's a safety threat that anything physical in the air is something that we really have to be
*  careful about.
*  Whether we're flying formation off of the aircraft right next to us or whether it's a turkey vulture
*  at 2,000 feet or a flock of 5,000 birds at the runway and we have to wave off.
*  Although they're low probability, a lot of bases will have actual environmental
*  protecting agency employees that are responsible for safely removing migratory birds or different
*  animals that may be in the runways or flying about.
*  Wow.
*  I didn't know what a turkey vulture is and it really does look like a mix between a
*  vulture and a turkey.
*  And look kind of dumb.
*  No offense to turkey vultures.
*  In that movie, who was the enemy nation?
*  I guess they were implying it's Iran or is it Russia?
*  I didn't think they were implying any particular nation state, frankly.
*  I think they did a somewhat decent job of having some ambiguous fifth generation fighters.
*  The location and the stockpile.
*  I get how the story kind of insinuates certain things but they seemed to do a good job of not
*  having anything directly pointing to another nation which I thought was the good move.
*  I enjoy these type of movies as an aviator and as an American because it's a feel good movie but
*  we shouldn't be celebrating going to war with any particular country.
*  China, Russia, whoever may have these weapons.
*  It's fun to watch but it would be an incredibly serious event to be employing these weapons.
*  Yeah, we'll talk about war in general because the movie is kind of celebrating
*  the human side of things and also the incredible technology involved but there's also the cost of
*  war and the seriousness of war and the suffering involved with war,
*  not just in the fighting but in the death of civilians and all those kinds of things.
*  Well, you were a Navy pilot.
*  Let's talk a little bit more seriously about this.
*  You were twice deployed in the Middle East flying the F-18F Super Hornet.
*  Can you briefly tell the story of your career as a Navy pilot?
*  Sure.
*  So I joined the Navy in 2009 right after college.
*  I went to officer boot camp, officer candidate school.
*  I applied as a pilot and I got in as a pilot.
*  That was the advantage of going that way is that I could essentially choose what I wanted and if I
*  got in, great. If not, I didn't get stuck doing something else.
*  So you knew you wanted to be a pilot.
*  I did. I joined. I went through my initial training. I went through primary flight training
*  that all aviators go through and I did well enough that one of the first lessons I teach
*  you in the Navy is that you can have a great career in the Navy and you can see the world
*  and do what you want but at the end of the day, it's all about the needs of the Navy and what they
*  need. So they may not have the platform you like or you may not necessarily get to choose your own
*  adventure here but I was lucky enough that there was one jet slot in my class and I was lucky enough,
*  fortunate enough to get it.
*  It was a jet slot.
*  So yeah, what that means is that I was assigned actually tail hook at that point which meant I
*  would go trained to fly aircraft that land on aircraft carriers and there's essentially three
*  aircraft that do that at the time is the F-18 and the E-2 and the C-2. C-2 is kind of like the mail
*  truck for the boat. E-2 is one of the big radar dish on top and then there's all the F-18s.
*  So E-2 is comms, the C-2 mail truck?
*  C-2 basically is for mail. They're on the shore and they're the ones that bring supplies to the
*  ship via air and people.
*  Sorry if I missed it. Is it a plane or is it a helicopter?
*  It's a plane.
*  All right and the F-18 is a fighter jet.
*  So I select a tail hook which meant I could get one of those other ones but
*  80% of them or so are jets so I was in a good spot at that point and that's when I went to
*  Merdy, Mississippi to fly my first jet which was the T-45 Goss Hawk.
*  Cool. So what kind of plane is that? Is that what you were doing your training on?
*  That's the jet aircraft you get in before you actually go to the F-18. It is carrier capable
*  so go to the boat for the first time in it during the day, drop fake bombs, do dogfighting,
*  low levels, formation flying day and night.
*  Wow it's a pretty plane.
*  Yeah and it looks like a cone so that no one hits it.
*  Okay so it's usually not used for fighting, it's used for training?
*  It's used for training how to fight.
*  Got it. So what was that like? Was that the first time you were sort of really getting into it?
*  Yeah that was really interesting because before that it was a 600 horsepower prop plane.
*  Going from that to the T-45 is one of like the biggest jumps in power and like
*  Navy you know machine operation.
*  How much horsepower does the T-45 have approximately?
*  Any like 15,000 or so.
*  So it's a huge jump from 600 you said horsepower about? Cool so it's a big big leap.
*  But it's a jet you know so it performs differently it's faster right and what that means not just
*  because it's faster your whole mind needs to be faster everything happens faster in the air now
*  right those comms happen faster your landing gear has to come up faster everything just happens
*  faster in a jet and so it's a big jump and I'll never forget going on my first flight in that
*  aircraft it was a formation flight for someone else and I was just in the back watching and
*  there was an instructor in the flight and so what that means is instructors in a single aircraft and
*  then there's three or four other aircraft and they're learning how to do joins and they're
*  learning how to fly in formation and as a new student in the back it's amazing right because
*  you know photo op time and all this like I'm seeing aircraft up close for the first time it's awesome
*  and on the way back we couldn't get our landing gear down ironically so it you know to make a
*  long story short because it's overall not that exciting we couldn't get the gear down we actually
*  went to go do a control ejection to the target area that where that is about 15 20 miles to the
*  north of the base did you wait did you just say that's not that exciting well I because that to
*  me is pretty exciting so that I mean how first of all I mean that must be terrifying like early
*  on in your careers haven't haven't seen those things that yeah like how often does that kind
*  of thing happen decent more than you would think more than you would think there was no significant
*  panic this is like misunderstood this is what has to be done in this case I think I was probably
*  just too dumb to realize the significance of it because as a new student you know not really
*  appreciating you know just what is ahead of me if we are ejecting but at the time it was more it
*  was just like rote right because I was back there and then I went from a observer mode to a I'm
*  going to provide you the help that I can provide you as member of this crew you know mode and so
*  it was less about I'm you know on this 20 mile trip and thinking about my how vulnerable I am
*  you know we're going through checklists we're talking to people we're getting ready so
*  no it wasn't it wasn't fearful and the whole time we were doing one of these to try to get the
*  the gear down so we're unloading the jet and then loading it back to try to get the gear out
*  with the stick and um and it came down it came down halfway um there just on its own so it came
*  back around and we did like a safety trap in case there was a problem with the gear that was my
*  first flight you know a little bit of serendipity but I'm going to fast forward a bit and I went
*  back to the squadron as an instructor about uh five or six years later and I was an aviation
*  safety officer at this point which meant I was responsible for investigating mishaps and a a
*  student went in and he he went in the back seat of a form flight just like the one I went on uh and
*  he went out and he ended up ejecting on that flight exact same type of flight uh they went out and
*  they had a runaway trim scenario and it caused the aircraft essentially just inverted itself almost
*  180 degrees uh at about 600 feet over the ground and they punched out just slightly outside the
*  ejection window at about 300 400 feet or so but they were completely fine um so you know and then
*  about two months later we had another ejection about three months after that we had another
*  ejection so um unfortunately you know it can it can be more common than people think what does it
*  feel like to get ejected thankfully I don't know I can describe it to you I can tell you what it's
*  like from what I've heard but I truly think it's one of those things that you just don't understand
*  until it happens uh it's like instantaneous about 250 g's which is only possible because of inertia
*  in our blood right so you can actually get like 250 300 g's for like a few milliseconds and then
*  it backs off to like 40 or 50 g's to get you away from the vehicle itself and so um you know you
*  may lose consciousness um if you do you know who knows where you wake up um you know you could be
*  in a tree you could still be falling uh you can be in the water so the physics of that is fascinating
*  how they eject safely do you know the story about how that was tested at all I don't know the full
*  story but uh there was I'm guessing nobody knows the full story it's probably a lot of shady stuff
*  going on but anyway uh you mean like in the early early days or they took a flight dock up to a
*  rocket sled and just see how much their body could take it and he turned a lot of his body into in the
*  mush in the in the process of getting that science done but he saved a lot of lives
*  people used to be tougher back in the day
*  that's how science used to be done um so how did your training continue so how did take me
*  take me farther through your career uh as you work towards graduating towards the f-18s so in vt9
*  where I was a student there's two phases there's an intermediate and an advanced intermediate is
*  getting very comfortable with the aircraft and at that point you truly hear all right you're going
*  jets now or you're going to go one of the other aircraft that land on the aircraft carrier I was
*  told I was going if you know jets at that point and then we go into same squadron same aircraft
*  same instructors but it's called advanced now and now we're learning how to dogfight for the first
*  time we're doing what we call tactical formation which is just like aggressive position keeping
*  um we are doing um dogfighting and low levels and all sorts of great stuff so it's really that first
*  introduction to that tactical environment and putting you really putting g's on the jet on your
*  body and maneuvering is there a like tactical formation is collaborating with other fighter
*  jets a part of that it is so flying in a that's what you mean by formation so literally having
*  an awareness is this done for you or are you as a human supposed to understand
*  understand like where you are in the formation how to maintain formation all that kind of stuff
*  yeah is it done autonomously or manually there's a great autonomy point on the end of this I've
*  thought about so but what we do it's all manual so I'm looking at his wing and I'm looking at
*  um different visual checkpoints that form like a triangle right like an equal level triangle
*  essentially and then as that triangle you know is no longer equal I can tell my relative position
*  against that aircraft right that's really cool uh and so that's what I'm staring at for sometimes
*  hours on end you know several feet away doing one of these from in the weather that's all it is
*  so you get it's almost like is it peripheral vision or is it no we're staring directly at it
*  the peripheral is coming on my on my um that's interesting stuff right my sensors and all my
*  instruments and so he is my gyroscope at that point right wow you're flying not looking straight
*  correct I'm flying like this for hours it can hurt your neck we don't like doing this as much
*  and I don't think it's just me right it's a weird thing where when you're like this it's actually
*  harder to fly formation slightly than here because being in line of your hand movements and of the
*  aircraft somehow has an effect on our ability to be more precise and comfortable it's strange
*  so but so there's a symmetry to the formation usually so one of the people on the other side
*  really don't like being on that side is it is it does it who gets like the short straw
*  how do you decide which side of the formation you are it's a good question too because there's
*  there's kind of rank in some sense so if it's a four person formation right you have a division
*  lead who's qualified to lead a whole division but maybe the other ones aren't and he has a dash two
*  and that's his wingman essentially and then in a division there's two other aircraft and then you
*  have another senior flight leader that's the dash three position and then you have dash four
*  the last one and if you are all lined up on one side like fingertip um one two three four that
*  dash four guy is going to be at the end of that whip so if you're flying formation each one's
*  making you know movements relative to the lead dash four is kind of you know at the end of that
*  error you know and so his movements are kind of like a whip it's very difficult to fly in that
*  position in close can you elaborate this is because of the air the aerodynamics so what's a whip if
*  this is the flight lead and this is dash two flight lead is rock steady and just doing his thing
*  flight two is going to be working that triangle moving a little bit right and he has this small
*  air bubble that he's doing his best to stay and then but dash three is flying off dash two and
*  so his air bubble is dash two's plus his own and so it gets more and more stressful as you get
*  farther out yeah okay um what's the experience of that staring for long periods of time
*  and trying to maintain formation how stressful is that because like you know we're doing that
*  when we drive staying in lane and that becomes after you get pretty good at it it becomes
*  somewhat it's still stressful um which actually surprisingly stressful when you look at like
*  lane keeping systems they actually relieve that stress somehow and it's actually creates a much
*  more pleasant experience while you're still able to maintain situational awareness and like
*  stay awake which is really interesting like i don't think people realize how stressful it is to
*  lane keep when they drive so this is even more stressful so are you that do do you think about
*  that or is this um yeah i guess how stressful is it from a psychology perspective it's very stressful
*  uh when so i taught students how to do this as well and so at our feet we have two riders
*  and if i'm flying off of flight lead over here what you'll find a lot of times is you'll be flying
*  or you like if i'm the instructor and the student's flying i'll start to notice that he's having a
*  harder and harder time keeping position yeah what i'll notice typically is he's locked out his leg
*  the lock out the leg that's closest to the aircraft they're flying against and push on the rudder
*  subconsciously because their whole body's trying to get away from the aircraft because they're so
*  uncomfortable being close to it and so i'll tell them i can i can fix their form with just a couple
*  words i'll say wiggle your toes and they'll wiggle their toes and they'll realize and they'll loosen
*  all the muscles in their legs they realize they've been locked up and their formation flying will get
*  a lot better uh and so you know there's a lot of stress associated with that there's some interesting
*  psychological or um visual uh issues such as um vertigo as you're flying so if you're flying
*  with him and then you fly right to a cloud right that's when it's very stressful because you have
*  to be very close in order to maintain visual you might be on a thunderstorm right uh and so you have
*  to be very tight you might start raining um and then he's turning but you might not even know that
*  you might not even be able to see that turn and so all of a sudden you might look while you're in a
*  turn thinking you were straight and level and you look just maybe back at your instruments very
*  quick and you realize you're like in a 30 degree turn and your whole concept of where you are in
*  the world starts getting very confused and you immediately get this this sense of it's weird
*  like i look at the HUD and it it feels all my sense are telling me it's spinning but it's not
*  you know and so i have to trust my instruments even though it feels like it's spinning and the
*  same thing can happen when you're flying formation off of someone and it it can be very um very
*  dangerous and um disorientating but the point is to try to regain awareness by trusting the instruments
*  like like distrust all your human senses and just use the instruments to rebuild situational
*  awareness not in this particular case because our situational awareness is based is predicated
*  off of our flight lead so in a sense i'm just trusting his movements and so he's my gyroscope
*  but you're absolutely right and if i was by myself i would trust my instruments but i can't just stop
*  flying form and trust my instruments because now i'm going to hit him oh yeah you have to pay
*  attention to him so he's my reference so the instruments are not helping you significantly
*  with his positioning not it's all completely manual so is there a future where some of that
*  is autonomous yeah and i've thought about automating that flight regime but when i
*  started thinking about it i you know realized that all the formation keeping that we do
*  is designed to enhance the aviators ability to maintain sight right so we fly very tight
*  formation so that we can go in weather and to reduce groups of traffic coming into the boat
*  we fly in one particular position so that all of all of the flight crew can look down the line
*  and see the flight lead so everything is based everything has to do with the two air crew
*  visually maintaining sight of each other and defending each other right in a combat spread
*  i might be looking i may be three miles away from him flying formation directly beam and looking
*  around and make sure nothing's there so as i'm looking into automating this process i thought
*  well you know sure it's easy to get a bunch of aircraft to fly in formation off each other right
*  it's it's trivial but why you know what is the best formation why are they doing that and that
*  opened up a much more interesting regime of operations and flight mechanics and that's when
*  we get back to that kind of stochastic mindset where we can bring in aircraft close to do some
*  type of normal flying or reduce congestion around airports but when we consider flying in
*  or formation a tactical environment we can be much more effective with non-traditional
*  formation keeping or perhaps no formation keeping perhaps so autonomy used for formation keeping
*  not for convenience but for the introduction of randomness that's hard to a real-time mission
*  planner yeah and then that's where you also have some human modification so it's like manned unmanned
*  teaming enters that picture so you use some of the human intuition and adjustment of this formation
*  the formation itself has some uncertainty i mean it's such an interesting dance i think that is
*  the most fascinating application of artificial intelligence is when it's human ai collaboration
*  that that semi-autonomous dance that you see in these semi-autonomous vehicle systems
*  in terms of cars being driving but also in the safety critical situation of a airplane
*  for fighter jet especially when you're flying fast it's i mean in a split second you have to
*  make all these kinds of decisions and it feels like an ai system can do as much harm as it can
*  help and so to get that right is a really fascinating challenge one of the challenges
*  too isn't just the the algorithms of the autonomy itself but how it senses the environment that of
*  course is going to be what all these decisions are based off of and that's a challenge in this type
*  of environment well i gotta ask so uh f18 what's it like to fly a fighter jet as best i mean what
*  to you is beautiful powerful what do you love about the experience of flying for me you know
*  and i think i'm i'm an outlier a bit it wasn't necessarily the that flying itself right it wasn't
*  necessarily the the soaring over the clouds and you know looking down at the earth from upside down
*  you know i i came to love that and but it wasn't necessarily the passion that drove me there i just
*  had no exposure to that the only exposure i had was was reading and going in the woods and
*  science fiction and and all that and so you know what seemed to kind of drive me towards that
*  was just a desire to really be operating as close to what i thought was the edge of technology or
*  science and that's the path that i chose to try to get close to that i thought that being in a in a
*  fighter jet uh and you know all the tools and the technology and the knowledge and the challenges
*  and the you know failures and victories that would come with that just seemed like something that
*  i wanted to be a part of uh and it wasn't necessarily about the flying but it was about
*  the challenge and like i said as a person from a small town you know small high school being able
*  to get my hands you know or even just near something of such technological significance was
*  kind of empowering for me and that's kind of what bore the the level of flight from there you know
*  becoming you know having some level of mastery in that aircraft it really feels like an extension
*  of your body and once i got there then then the kind of the love of flying kind of followed so you
*  sort of one is the man mastery over the machine and second is the machine is like the greatest
*  thing that humans have ever created arguably the the like things that lackey martin and others
*  have built i mean the engineering in that yeah it's um however you feel about war which is one of
*  the sad things about human civilization is um war inspires the engineering of tools that are
*  incredible and it's like maybe without war if we look at human history we would not build some of
*  the incredible things we built so in order to win wars to stop wars we build these incredible systems
*  that perhaps propagate war and that's a that's another discussion i'll ask you about but this
*  do you this is like um this is a chance to experience the greatest engineering humans
*  have ever been able to do like similar i suppose that astronauts feel like when they're flying i
*  wanted to be an astronaut i wanted to take that route i was gonna apply to test pilot school
*  um it just didn't work out for me uh i ended up having a broken foot during my window but
*  long story short i ended up after my time in my fleet squadron and we can get back to the rest of
*  the timeline if you want but i went to be an instructor pilot instead right and then you know
*  i i was talking about this with a squadron mate earlier today about how you know i certainly
*  wouldn't be talking with lex today if i ended up going to test pilot school you know i was that i
*  never would have i never would have had the i would have maybe recklessness i don't know but the
*  willingness to have a conversation about uap while i was you know i that led me to the decision to
*  get out once i went there and it kind of enabled me to talk about uap more publicly uh and if i
*  stayed in the navy then i don't think that would have happened i wouldn't have been able to
*  if i went that route well as a small tangent do you hope to travel to mars one day do you
*  think you'll step foot on mars one day if you asked me that five years ago i would have said
*  yes i want to in fact i would like to die on mars um now today now i have some hesitations and i have
*  some hesitations because i'm hopeful and optimistic and i think that you know i think
*  that we are truly like on the brink of a very wide technological revolution that's going to
*  kind of move us how we used to move information and data in in this last century we're going to
*  be manipulating and managing matter in that next century and so i think that i think our reach as
*  human as humans are going to get a lot wider a lot faster than people may realize or at least
*  wait are you getting like super ambitious beyond mars is that what you're saying well i mean like
*  mars seems kind of boring i want to go beyond that is that what do you mean the reach of humanity
*  across all kinds of technologies or do you mean literally across space across space you know so
*  you know we're going to be i think that as artificial intelligence and machine learning
*  starts broaching further into the topic of science or the area of science and we start working through
*  new physics we start working through or i should say past the einsteinian frameworks
*  as we kind of get a better idea of what space time is or isn't we may have we may find you know
*  answers that we didn't know that we were looking for and we may have more opportunity and i'm not
*  saying this is something i'm you know betting the farm on of course but maybe maybe that's a road
*  i want to explore on earth instead of on mars maybe there's technology that can be brought to
*  bear with new science and harder engineering that is a road that doesn't go past mars to get
*  outside the solar system so there's different ways to explore the universe than the traditional
*  rocket systems if we can continue sort of your journey you said what that you were attracted to
*  the the incredibly advanced technologies that they have 20 of the f-18s and just the fighter
*  jets in general let me ask another question which seems incredibly difficult to do
*  which is landing on a carrier or taking off from a carrier and landing on a carrier so
*  what's that like what are the challenges of that taking off pretty easy is procedurally somewhat
*  complex where there's a lot of moving parts almost like a clock you know you're almost in a pocket
*  watch so since then you're a part of the machinery and so long as you press the right buttons and do
*  the right things and you're gonna go shooting off the front so there's like a checklist to fall and
*  there's several people involved in that checklist and you just got to follow the checklist correctly
*  essentially yep lots of ways to screw it up but you'll know how to screw it up but landing on the
*  back of the boat is a whole different animal there's a lot more variables there's essentially
*  one or two people responsible for the success of that the landing signal officer who actually
*  represents a team of specially trained aviators who are responsible for helping that aviator land
*  on the boat and the pilot himself and it it is a hard task to actually fly precisely enough to be
*  good at it so to fly quote-unquote the perfect pass you essentially have to fly your head through
*  a one foot by one foot box that's essentially the target you're shooting for plus or minus probably
*  about five knots on airspeed although we don't really judge it by airspeed it's something called
*  angle of attack but generally you know pretty tight parameters there and you can do everything
*  perfect and still fail right so when we go to touchdown we immediately bring the power up
*  and we rotate as if we were doing as if we were bouncing off the deck and if we catch it then
*  we slow down and then someone tells us to bring the power back which we do we don't do it on our
*  own because it's such a violent experience you can think you're trapped or not or something breaks
*  and you you bring your throttle back that's a very serious thing it happened best of us you know i'll
*  admit i've done it once when i first got to the squadron it's called ease guns the land and so
*  you know i came in the boat and i brought the power i cracked the power back a little bit before i've
*  been told to her that my aircraft had finished settling in and i was a big faux pas right so
*  especially as a new guy so it's it's a very serious business there's a lot of eyes on you
*  and there's a lot of ways to screw it up but the physical you know rush of like having a great pass
*  and then like there's just a like the crash of into the boat and all that the physical sensation
*  from it you know when everything's going great you know it's top of the world it's a great feeling
*  how much of it is feel how much of it is instruments how much is other people just
*  doing the work for you catching you as long as you do everything right there's a few systems we use
*  one is called the ball and that ball is external to our aircraft and it's b a l l ball like ball
*  it's a it's a ifloss landing system which stands for something very long convoluted but essentially
*  it's a mirror with lights on it and you see the light at a different cell based on your position
*  relative to an ideal glide slope yeah so if you're right on it you're right in the middle and if
*  you're below you're low and as i add power and maneuver the aircraft that ball you know i see
*  that ball rise i see the ball low it's a lagging indicator though right and your jet is a a lagging
*  engine too right it takes time to spool up the engine so that adds to the complexity you have
*  to think ahead a bit um you know so you don't want to um you can't just bring the power up and leave
*  it there you have to bring the power up touch it bring it back uh and oh by the way your landing
*  area is moving not just away from you but also on an angle right because we have an angle deck
*  and so you're constantly doing one of these to correct yourself as you go so stressful and you
*  every time you do one of those yeah maybe it's a 30 degree angle bank right i'm losing lift
*  right yeah and so i have to compensate with power each time i do that so i'm doing another one because
*  you have to maintain um the same level you're always lowering like it's a constant rate of
*  descent that's increasing from about 200 feet per minute to about 650 and every time you do this
*  that's messing with that okay so you have to compensate you're doing that manually do that
*  manually all right and then of course as you come down that glide slope uh it becomes more and more
*  narrow and you have to of course um modulate your inputs such that they're smaller and smaller
*  because they have a bigger and bigger effect as you get closer in um and what happens too when you
*  get in close is that right before you cross over if this is the boat right here your table right
*  before you kind of get your wings over the boat itself this big wind from the the main tower of
*  the boat is where it dips down so the wind actually goes down it's called the burble and it'll actually
*  pull the aircraft down increase your rate of descent so at that particular point you need to
*  you know increase your power and try to compensate against that and so that's kind
*  of a third variable that's trying to screw you up on your way down what's the most difficult
*  conditions in which you had to land or you've seen somebody had to land because i think you were also
*  um the signal officer as well that was yeah that was the head landing signal officer for
*  for my squadron see you you've probably seen some tough landings i have i've seen a a ramp strike
*  which is when a part of the aircraft hits before um the landing area which is basically the round
*  out of the boat that is before the landing area so they basically struck the back of the boat
*  coming in yeah it was just their hook so it wasn't the aircraft um and they were fine that one was
*  kind of ugly but it like rips that part of the aircraft absolutely and then you land on your
*  bellies that kind of thing in this particular case it hit and then it gave and essentially
*  dragged the hook on the on the surface after that and so he was able to grab a wire at that point
*  when does that kind of thing happen just a miscalculation by the pilot or is it uh weather
*  conditions i wouldn't even call it a miscalculation i mean i'm going to put the blame on the pilot
*  because he's the only one in the cockpit but then the day he's reacting to the situations he's
*  dealing with and so it may be errors or he may be doing the best with you know the conditions that
*  he's been given on that particular one you just got two high rated signs very common and that's
*  what you see it with new pilots you see with older pilots right new ones and complacent ones
*  what you see is they'll um try to make the ball go right where they want it in close they think
*  they can beat the game a little bit and they try to and so we we have sayings we teach we teach
*  pilots you know as a landing signal officer we tell them like don't recenter the high ball in close
*  it's one of the rules to live by and so when the ball's up high don't try to bring it back in close
*  to like the center point when you're when you're in close because what you're doing is you bring the
*  power off and you're going to crash right down and that's what happens right because you got the
*  verbal pulling you down you might be correcting which is decreasing your lift and then you have
*  that type of maneuver so how are you supposed to do all of this in harsh weather conditions
*  so that's the one i wanted to tell you about that's the hardest one and what you hear is
*  if you hear 99 taxi lights on that's a really shitty day 99 taxi lights on what's that mean
*  so everyone put your taxi lights on because you're about to land on the boat and you don't see the
*  boat weather is so bad that the landing signal officer on the boat can't see you either and you
*  can't see the boat and you won't be able to see it when you touch down so we call that a zero zero
*  landing and you turn on the taxi light so that the lso who has a radio in his hand that looks like
*  a phone from 1980 is talking directly to the pilot and he's looking at that little light in the rain
*  and he's telling him you're high you're low power things like that come right back to left and
*  literally talking him down to land on the boat right there and the pilot usually it comes as a
*  surprise the pilot the landing because he's just listening to the voice can't see the ball can't
*  see the boat and all of a sudden you just hit the boat you crash crash we're going about 1600
*  feet per minute descent at that point so you're still you're going super fast so all this is
*  happening fast you don't know you don't know what at the moment it's going to hit so you're just
*  going into the darkness and just waiting for it to hit maybe not dark though a lot of times it's
*  white into the light you're going into into the light it's and then there's a voice from an 80s
*  phone i got it this this is terrible but so that you still you still have to so this kind of thing
*  happens you still have to land sometimes you just don't have a place to divert but you know in a
*  sense we're trained for that because we do the night landings as well and i think you'll find
*  this interesting but i always found that the night landings where in these particular cases
*  you're usually lined up behind the boat maybe 10 15 miles whereas the other ones it's like a tight
*  circle the landing pattern and so we can potentially see the boat way out there
*  if the lights were on which they're not but we can maybe see like the string of aircraft in front
*  of us but what's what's interesting is that it can take a while i can tell you might be 15 miles out
*  and your lights are turned down as dim as possible you have a cloud deck maybe at six or seven
*  thousand feet so that the starlight there's no moon but let's say the starlight's blocked out
*  right because just the starlight alone no moon you can see the boat you can see the water but
*  when that goes away it's like closing your eyes right you can't tell anything it could be upside
*  down it could be in any position and for me it was almost a meditative process that i had to snap
*  myself back out of when i was on like a long straightaway and then i would see the light
*  pop up in the sea of darkness right no lights anywhere can't even see the horizon and i just
*  see a light out there my instruments are telling me and they're turned down as far as they can go
*  right so i can barely see them so my eyes can adjust and i'm just staring at this light in the
*  distance and it's just very meditative and staham behind you and and then like four miles you know
*  almost like oh the light is a little bit bigger and you almost kind of have to snap back to it
*  and be like i need to like kind of like look around a little bit and engage my brain like back to my
*  body and like yeah do this because you're gonna have to actually land well is there just you said
*  you don't necessarily feel the romantic notion of the whole thing but is there some aspects of
*  flying where you look up and maybe you see the star the stars or um yeah that kind of thing that
*  you just like holy crap how do humans accomplish all of this like am i actually flying right now
*  i used to have those moments on the boat when i was catching planes land i would
*  i would they were trapped in every night time and it's just all this chaos in the middle of the
*  ocean and nothing and i would have these moments i'd be like how the hell did i end up here you
*  know there's one moment in time next to an aircraft landing on a boat in the middle of the ocean you
*  know where did my life you know how did my life go to end up here how interesting but what i did
*  start to enjoy was the night vision goggles and putting those on and looking up at the stars
*  flying around especially over the ocean what do they look like and there's just so many there's
*  just so many stars that you know you normally can't see they're shooting stars all the time
*  almost every flight you'd see them with the goggles on so it was a great pleasure to take
*  advantage of the lack of light pollution in some cases especially on deployment to go grab some
*  goggles at night go out some quiet spot in the ship that no one can see me and just kind of look
*  around you know yeah it's humbling quick break bathroom break i wouldn't mind a quick quick
*  stretch of legs you got a few cool patches i do so this is a vfa 11 red rippers patch
*  typically going actually on our arm so this is actually what we call the boars head or arnold
*  so this is actually the the boars head from the gordon's gin bottle so yeah in 1918 we were in the
*  we were in london or the uk somewhere and we apparently partied with the owner and founder of
*  gordon's gin we had a great time and there's a signed letter in our ready room that says we
*  can use the logo and perpetuity oh nice and yeah so i'd like to give you that patch
*  i drank quite a bit of good so this is good and then i'd like to give you that coin
*  from from our squadron the red rippers that's a badass name
*  thank you brother you're welcome so let's jump around a little bit but
*  let me ask you about this one set of experiences that you had and people in your squadron had
*  so you and a few people in the squadron either detected ufos on your instruments or saw them
*  directly tell me the full story of these ufo sightings and uh to the smallest technical details
*  because i love those i'll do my best so we returned from and when i say we i mean my not my squadron
*  but vfa 11 the red rippers uh i was a a somewhat junior pilot at the time i joined them on deployment
*  2012 where they had been already out there for about six months or so
*  operating in the vicinity of afghanistan i joined them and then we we flew back and still as a
*  relatively new guy we came back and we entered what's considered a maintenance phase where we
*  slow down the tactical flying a bit uh kind of recuperate do some maintenance on the aircraft
*  and our particular model of the f-18 the lot the lot number was plumbed for the particular things
*  that were needed to upgrade the radar from what's known as the abg 73 to the abg 79 and the abg 73
*  is a mechanically uh scanned array radar uh it's a you know perfectly fine radar but the ace of radar
*  is kind of a you know magnitude jump in capability kind of a an analog digital
*  kind of mindset so got it so it's a leap to digital uh abg 73 so i these things on a carrier like what
*  are we talking about here this is how big is a radar yeah so this is actually the radars in the
*  f-18 itself okay so when you say that we're chosen this is to test uh the upgrade to the new the 79
*  abg 79 less of an uh test and more of just hey it's your turn to get the upgrade like we're all
*  going to these better radars um they were building ones off the off the line with the new radar
*  but we were this weird transitionary squadron in the middle that transitioned from the older
*  ones to the new ones but it's not particularly rare to fly with different types of radar because
*  in the and we call the fleet replacement squadron essentially the training ground for the f-18
*  you have all sorts of f-18s with different radars so um you are used to having multiple ones but in
*  the actual deployable combat squadron um we upgraded and when we upgraded we saw that
*  there were objects on the radar that we were seeing the next day in in this with this new radar that
*  weren't there with the old radar and these were sometimes you know the same day you might go in
*  two flights the one in the morning might be with the older radar the one evening with the new radar
*  and you and you'd see the objects with the with the new radar and that's not overly surprising in
*  some sense uh they are more sensitive uh perhaps they're not filtering out everything they should
*  be yet or perhaps there's some other type of error uh maybe it needs to be calibrated whatever it was
*  relatively new and we were somewhat used to there being software problems with these types of things
*  occasionally just like anything else and so okay maybe this is a radar software malfunction we're
*  getting some false tracks as we call them um what were you seeing and so what we would see are
*  representations of the object so this is off of our radar we're not seeing a visual image here
*  this is kind of like a what's being displayed to us almost like in a gaming fashion right like our
*  the icon right so the icon is showing us hey something is there and here's the parameters
*  i can understand about it so this is in the cockpit there's a display that's showing
*  um some visualization with the radars detecting correct and there's two different ways to do that
*  the first one is like the actual data like the radar where um i am it's showing me the data kind
*  of as if it's in front of me and i'm selecting those contacts and there's another screen called
*  the situational awareness page and that's kind of a god's eye view that brings all that data in the
*  one spot and so i'm going to talk about this from the sa page from the situational awareness page
*  versus the individual radar ones because it's easier but sorry sorry to linger on that so the
*  individual displays are like first person and then the sa is when you say god's eye view is like from
*  the top the integration of all that information as if it's looking down onto the earth yes is that a
*  good way to summarize it is but for the aviator it's slightly different because those two radar
*  displays i talked about are at the bottom of that display is kind of representative of where i am
*  and so i see what's in front of me got it whereas the situational awareness page
*  the aircraft is located in the center of that and then all around me you know based off of the data
*  link and wherever i'm getting information from i can see that whole where page i can see how
*  the situation so i'm going to kind of talk about this from the situational awareness page which is
*  a top-down view just to kind of frame our minds instead of jumping around and so what we would see
*  out there is we'd see these indications that something would be there and they would have a
*  track file that track file that thing that represents the object has a line coming out of
*  it and that represents it's called the target aspect indicator and there's some tracking from
*  the radar correct so it's showing you where the object's going this is all pretty cool that the
*  radar can do all this so radar locks in on different objects and it tracks them over time correct
*  that's coming from the radar that's like built-in feature okay cool out there we're seeing it
*  and we don't have to necessarily like pull things into our our tracker in some sense right like
*  it's all out there and then we can kind of choose to highlight on stuff or to kind of focus in on
*  it more so but the information should all be out there and so we'd see that target aspect indicator
*  that that line on a typical aircraft you know it would kind of look like this it would be coming
*  out and it would go steady and if they turn you know it would be like and you see them turn right
*  like it's not magic but this object they would the target aspect would kind of be like all over
*  the place like kind of randomly in the 360 degrees you know from that top down view that line would
*  be in any place so kind of you know is it unable to determine the the target aspect is it stationary
*  you know and that's just how it puts it out and it's not used to seeing it so i'm not saying that's
*  necessarily super weird but it was different than what we were used to seeing because we weren't
*  used to seeing stationary objects out there very much and what was also interesting is that these
*  weren't just stationary on a zero wind day right these are stationary at 20 000 feet 15 000 feet
*  500 feet you know with with the wind blowing you know and so much like the sea you know when we're
*  up there fighting it affects everything we consider the wind when we're you know shooting missiles
*  when we're flying or fuel considerations it's like operating you know in that volume of air like the
*  ocean everything's going with the current and so anything that doesn't go with the current you know
*  is immediately kind of identifiable and strange and that's why these were initially strangers
*  because they would be stationary against the wind so if you had something like a good drone
*  in a windy conditions what would that look like would it it would have not come off as stationary
*  would it sort of float about kind of thing no i think what the drone technology we have today
*  they could stay within a pretty tight location well i meant like dji drone not like i'm saying
*  like generically speaking i would not not a military drone no i have a dji drone myself even
*  and you know maybe not 100 knots but if that thing's in 30 or 40 knot winds you know the amount
*  of distance it's going to be kind of doing one of these like that change is not something i'm going
*  to detect from maybe many miles away interesting so it could look very stationary but that wasn't
*  necessarily you know and what's interesting about this story is that there's not like the one smoking
*  gun right you have to kind of look at everything and that's what you know i don't like about
*  the department of defense and just generally people's take on this is that everything is kind
*  of based around a single image you know or that that one case but a lot of the interestingness
*  comes from the duration or the time it's been out there how they're interacting relative to other
*  objects out there and you don't get that information when you just look at a frame for a second you
*  know everyone kind of bites off on the shiny object but so you yourself from your particular
*  slice of things you've experienced and seen directly or indirectly you've kind of built up
*  an intuition about what are the things that were being seen i want to go that far i've just been
*  able to you know eliminate some some variables because of how long i've observed it so like you
*  said yes kind of drones stay in a particular position against the wind like that certainly
*  but i don't think it can do that and then go 0.8 mach for four hours after that you know and so
*  when you when you look at outside of that once that moment in time then it eliminates a lot of
*  the potential things it could be at least from my perspective so what kind of stuff did you see
*  yeah in the instruments we'd see them flying in patterns kind of racetrack patterns or circular
*  patterns or just going kind of straight east i occasionally see them supersonic 1.1 1.2 mach
*  but typically 0.6 to 0.8 mach just for extremely extended periods of time you know essentially
*  all the time and this is airspace where there's not supposed to be anything else at all and it's
*  pretty far out there it starts 10 miles off the coast goes like 300 miles can you say the location
*  that we're talking about off the coast of virginia beach got it and so nobody is supposed to be out
*  there it's possible for people to be there it's not necessarily restricted but it's well monitored
*  and we're out there every day all day and so you know people know to stay clear if a cessna goes
*  bumbling in there everyone's going to know about it fa is going to you know call them out going to
*  tell us about it so um encouragements happen not a big deal but um they're pretty rare honestly
*  because everyone knows the area and we've been operating there for decades and what are the
*  trajectories 0.6 to 0.8 mach that these objects were taking typically they would be in some type
*  of circular pattern or kind of racetrack pattern when they were at those speeds or i just see them
*  kind of and it wasn't always like a mechanical flight description and when i say that i mean like
*  an autopilot is going to be just very precise right it's going to be locked on straight and
*  whereas i could see an airplane i could tell if the pilot's flying it right because it's not going
*  to be perfect the computer is not controlling it and these seemed more like that not that they were
*  imprecise but that they were even much more erratic than that so like it wasn't like a straight line
*  in a turn it was just kind of like a you know weird drift like that in that direction you know
*  so it wasn't controlled by a dumb computer or uh not not the suspected computers so it wasn't
*  controlled by autopilot kind of technology it's not the sense that i got so how many people have
*  seen them in the squadron uh sort of how many times were they seen how many um were there times
*  when there's multiple objects once we started seeing them on the radar enough and we would get
*  close enough we'd actually see them on our FLIR as well so our advanced targeting uh
*  pod uh it's essentially a infrared camera that we use for targeting mostly in the air to surface
*  environment we don't use it in the air to air arena it's just not that good of a tool frankly
*  but um we would see IR energy emitting from that location where the radar was dropping us off so
*  you know the radar we'd lock onto the object and our sensors would all look there and so then we
*  could see that it's looking at that right piece of sky but uh there's energy actually coming from
*  there so now we started thinking that okay maybe not radar malfunctions maybe more maybe something
*  is physically here of course and then people started to try to fly by and see it and at this
*  point you know i would say maybe 80 to 90 percent of our squadron have probably seen one of these on
*  the radar at this point everyone was aware of it there was small communication i think between
*  squadrons of the same area that had the same radar so i knew it wasn't just our squadron for
*  whatever strange reason um because they would be other squadron would be out there and we would
*  talk to them like hey like careful there's an object are you aware of that you know so like
*  they would be aware of it and then of course people would want to go see what they look like
*  right so people would try to fly by i try to fly by him i like how that's an of course of course
*  of course you don't want to fly by it you know there's an uh there's a argument against that
*  kind of perspective that maybe the thing is dangerous so maybe we don't but perhaps that's
*  part of the reason you want to fly by it is to understand better what it is if it's a threat
*  we have a lot of context now that we did it back then you know and so it was still a hey is this a
*  balloon is this a drone you know at a certain point and we're also aware of you know potential
*  intelligence gathering operations that could be going on we're up there flying our tactics we're
*  emitting uh we're practicing our ew you know we're turning at particular times like there's stuff
*  that can be learned it's not a secret and you know countries keep different fishing vessels and
*  whatnot in international waters off there so it's not exactly a secret that uh we're being observed
*  out there so to think that a foreign hospital or a foreign nation would want to um you know somehow
*  intercept information whether that's um our radar signals or our jamming capabilities to try to
*  um break that down or understand it better be ready for that next fight um i mean that's what
*  that's what scares me about this scenario because we didn't jump right to aliens or ufos we thought
*  you know this is a radar malfunction we need to be aware of it's a safety issue and then
*  you know this could be a a tactical problem right here because everything we do is based off of a
*  crypto and and locate you know locations everything's classified we do out there right and so over
*  time if you gather enough data about those fights and just monitor them forever just like uh some
*  nations uh do with other uh piece of technology or software um they could probably learn a lot
*  so we have to be cognizant of the fact and defend against it so what can you say about the other
*  characteristics of these objects like shape size texture luminosity how else do you describe object
*  is there something that could be said so you said like this is the tecton radar step one now you have
*  flier images that can give you a sense that that's actually a physical object what else can be said
*  about those physical objects so eventually someone did see one with their own eyeballs
*  um multiple people and it and they saw it in a somewhat interesting way um the object presented
*  itself at the exact altitude and geographic location of the entry points into our working areas
*  so we enter at a very specific point at a certain altitude and people leave the areas the same point
*  at a lower altitude probably one of the busiest pieces of sky on the eastern seaboard so two
*  jets from my squadron went out and they went flying and they entered the area one of these
*  objects went right between the aircraft as they're flying in formation and the object
*  went between the aircraft they went between the object i think i don't think that the object was
*  moving i don't think it aggressively went at them i think it was located still there and then they
*  flew through it um but they didn't have it on their radar um and that would i think the radar
*  might have been malfunctioning i don't know that for sure i would like to look into it but my
*  supposition is that if their radar was malfunctioning it would make sense that they wouldn't avoid the
*  object that was there because they knew these were physical at that point um and we we would go up to
*  these objects all the time time and try to see them we couldn't see them and we didn't know what
*  it was um was it were they just not there were being fooled was something happening were they
*  were they moving dropping altitude the last minute you know we're going by pretty quick so it's
*  difficult to tell um but perhaps if his radar wasn't working it wasn't receiving energy from the jet
*  and the jet of course didn't know that he was there and so whatever the case was they flew
*  right by and they described it just as a dark gray or black cube um inside a clear translucent
*  sphere and the kind of the apex of the little cube were touching the inside of that sphere
*  that's an image that's haunting so what do they think it is what did they think at that moment
*  uh that they is it just this kind of cloud of uncertainty that they're just describing a
*  geometric object it's not on radar so it's unclear what it is um yeah what was uh the
*  any kind of other description they've had of it in terms of the intuition from a pilot's perspective
*  you know you have to kind of identify what a thing is to answer the first part they they actually
*  canceled the flight and came back because they were you know it's like if there's one of these
*  out here and one was hitting them and it's right there then um you know perhaps we need to get a
*  different jet with better radar but so they came back and they're in their gear and they're they're
*  talking to the front desk and talking to skipper and like hey we almost hit one of those damn
*  things out there and this kind of was one of those kind of slight watershed moments where we all were
*  kind of like all right like this is a serious deal now yeah you know maybe it was a maybe we thought
*  they were balloons or drones or malfunctions or maybe we thought it was spying but then the day
*  if we're going to hit one of these things and we need to you know we need to take care of the
*  situation and that's actually when we started submitting hazard reports or haz reps to the
*  naval to the naval aviation safety kind of communication network and it's it you know it's
*  not like a big proactive thing where people are going to investigate it's more of a data collection
*  mechanism so that you can kind of share that aggregate data and make sure things are progressing
*  so it wasn't a mechanism that would result in action being taken but we were hoping to at
*  least get the message out to whomever was maybe running a classified program that we were not
*  aware of or something like that that hey like you could kill somebody here like you've you've grown
*  too big for your britches here take a step back so that was that was our concern at that point
*  that's kind of where we were thinking this was going what's the protocol for shooting at a thing
*  was was uh was there a concern that it's a direct threat not just surveillance but
*  a thing that could be yeah a threat at least from my perspective like that never really crossed into
*  my mind i thought it was potentially an intelligence um you know failure that could be being watched and
*  information gathered but i didn't think that it was something that would proactively engage me in
*  a hostile manner it wouldn't really make sense either too it would be shocking to like have one
*  of these objects take out an f-18 but there's no real tactical advantage other than fear perhaps
*  psychological yeah i've learned a lot about the psychological warfare in ukraine
*  there's a big part of the war in terms of when you talk about siege warfare about warfare wars
*  that last for many years for many months and then perhaps could extend to years but yes um it didn't
*  seem it didn't fit your conception of a threatening entity correct
*  so looking back now from the all the pieces of data you've integrated
*  you've personally added what do you think it could be i don't know i don't know what it could be i
*  think we've been able to categorize it successfully into a few buckets we've been able to say that you
*  know this could be u.s technology that someone put in the wrong piece of sky or you know perhaps
*  was developed and tested in an inappropriate spot by someone that wasn't paying best practices
*  is there uh sorry to interrupt is there a sort of modularity to the way the the military operates
*  the way it's possible for one branch not to know about the tests of another yeah i think it's
*  perfectly reasonable to think that that could occur right and so if we just make that assumption
*  we can integrate that into our analysis here and just say okay but at the point we're at now you
*  know we have to assume that that's not the case right with everything that's been going on in the
*  statements have been made and the hearings i think that if it was a a non-communication issue um we're
*  in big trouble at this point what about it being an object from another nation from china from russia
*  or even one of our allies perhaps right maybe that's you know i don't think it's um controversial to
*  say that our adult allies could be gathering information about us or anything of that nature
*  but that would be an extreme case but i think it's just important to say right to not just say russia
*  or china and just call them the bad guys and assume that if they don't have it no one can do it
*  and so from my perspective you know anyone else anyone else and it doesn't necessarily need to be
*  a foreign power it could be a non-government entity perhaps although i think that's very unlikely but
*  again these are these are things you must consider if you kind of throw everything
*  everything other than the u.s under under scrutiny but you know from what has been reported and the
*  behaviors that have been seen it would be i would expect to see remnants of that technology elsewhere
*  in the economy there seems to be too many things that require advanced technology that would be
*  beneficial commercially as well as in other military applications for it to be completely
*  locked away by one of our competitors now i could see us perhaps locking something away if we're
*  already in the lead and having it to pull out as needed but for someone that's perhaps in a power
*  struggle and they're in second place they might be more aggressive with the development of different
*  types of technology willing to accept bigger risks do you think it could be natural phenomena
*  that we don't yet understand i think that there are a number of things that this is going to be
*  right i don't think there's one thing at the end of the day but i certainly think that that is part
*  of what some of this could be i don't think it's what we were seeing on the east coast and i don't
*  think it is related to the roosevelt incident or i'll even go out and say the nimitz incident but
*  what's the roosevelt incident the roosevelt incident typically referred to as a gimbal
*  and or the go fast video and then the nimitz is from what the david fravor has witnessed directly
*  spoken about we'll talk about that as well i just love to get your um your sort of interpretation
*  of those incidents but yeah so in this particular case natural phenomena could be a part of the
*  picture but you're saying not the whole picture yes yes and we can't discount it oh the other
*  thing is what about the failure of pilot eyesight like sort of some deep mixture of actual direct
*  vision human vision system failure and like psychology like um seeing something weird
*  and then filling in the gaps because you in order to make sense of the weird i've tried to
*  expose myself to a scenarios like that that i don't necessarily think are right but i've explored
*  them to see if they could have some truth and one example is let's imagine a scenario where if we're
*  seeing these objects every day off the east coast i can imagine a technology or an operation where
*  you had some type of traditional propulsion system operating drones in order to gather data like we
*  discussed and i could i could envision a clever enough adversary that could perhaps destroy or
*  somehow remove these objects and replace them with new objects essentially when we're not looking
*  right and that accounts for the large airborne time and so i i explore options like that and i
*  try to see you know what what evidence and assumptions need to be made in order to prove
*  or disprove that and you know you would need so much infrastructure you know you need some you'd
*  need so many assets and so i try to explore some of those fallacies and some of those concerns and
*  as aviators we're trained into many uh like actual physical like eyesight and kind of illusion
*  training so like at nighttime flying there's so many things that can happen flying with false
*  horizons and so we receive hours of of training on that type of of stuff but this just falls
*  outside the category from my perspective what was the visibility conditions when in the times
*  when people were able to see it and then we we just earlier discussed complete nighttime darkness
*  in this case was was it during the day it was a perfectly clear day that that that particular
*  incident yep in a world that's full of mystery i have to ask what do you think
*  is the possibility that it's not of this earth origin i like the term non-human intelligence in
*  a sense because again there's someone there's a lot of assumptions in there that may cause us
*  to go down the wrong roads it could you know these could be something that are weather phenomena of
*  earth right or something else that is just something we don't understand i can't imagine
*  right now that's still of this earth if we consider extraterrestrials or something that came from a
*  physical place far away in space time you know that leads us to some detection assumptions that
*  we would need to make and so i just try to not categorize it under anything and just say hey is
*  this demonstrating intelligence and start from there as a single object what can we learn about
*  it kinematically how it's performing what does that mean for its energy source what does that
*  mean for the g-forces inside and then step it out a level and say okay how are these interacting with
*  our fighters if they are how are they interacting with the weather and their environment how are
*  they interacting with each other so can we look at these and how they're interacting perhaps as a
*  swarm especially off the east coast where this is happening all the time with multiple objects
*  right and so we might be able to determine some things about their maybe you know sensor capabilities
*  or the areas of focus you know if we can determine how they're working in conjunction with each other
*  but you know seeing one little flash of an object doesn't provide that type of insight
*  but we have the systems for but and it's kind of you know an irony but it's it's a fact of life
*  the reality that many of these well-deployed highly capable systems are held under the military
*  umbrella which makes it difficult to provide that data for scientific analysis so there's probably
*  a lot more data on these objects that's not being that's not made available probably even
*  within the military for analysis i think so yeah i think there's a lot of data that could be made
*  available and you know that's one of the reasons why you know i've been engaged with the american
*  institute of aeronautics and astronautics to build you know a large resources of cross-domain
*  expertise so that if or when that data is available or that there's additional analysis needed
*  you know we can spin up those teams and make that analysis so there was a recently a house
*  intelligence subcommittee hearing on ufos that you were a part of what was the goal of that hearing
*  and can you maybe summarize what you heard the hearings from my perspective uh seemed a bit
*  disingenuous uh kind of top level i think um who was it run by sorry to interrupt like who were the
*  people involved and what was the goal of the stated goal congressman andre carson uh did chair the
*  committee and he he was i think ultimately responsible for bringing it all together
*  you know i think the intent from congress was to try to bring light to what has been happening with
*  the navy and to help show the american people that um congress is taking this serious because
*  something serious is happening but you know the sense i got seemed a bit disingenuous they talked
*  around it a lot they you know advertised their um their love of science fiction um but they you know
*  they didn't treat this i would say in the manner it deserved as a potential tactical threat if it's
*  coming from a foreign power um and i get it though at the same day they have very specific objectives
*  within the dod right they have a very important job their job isn't necessarily to do exploratory
*  science for no reason um so i i applaud and i encourage their efforts on the intelligence side
*  to help understand this um but my concern is that they uh play a role they're not well suited for
*  which is is doing science and the pentagon is opening a new office to investigate ufos called
*  all domain anomaly resolution office what do you think about this office do you think it can help
*  alleviate in the in the way which this hearing perhaps has failed to improve more the scientific
*  rigor and the seriousness of investigating ufos i think that remains to be seen i think it's a step
*  in the right direction but it's a step that was taken because the previous step didn't happen
*  right so the aoi msg was the progeny essentially of the aero or arrow and you know the name was
*  changed because nothing was happening and it was essentially just a confusing mess of words that
*  were created to make this topic unpalatable um that airborne object identification synchronization
*  management group quite the mouthful i practice that but the new all domain anomaly resolution office
*  you know from my perspective at least at least the perspective that they're putting out they
*  they seem to want to be open they put out a twitter handle they're out they're going out
*  on twitter and communicating saying they want to keep this open but you know that's going to run
*  into a classification wall well so uh dr sean corpacic seems like an interesting guy he does
*  yes so he's got a um evan looked in too deeply but he he seems to have sort of he's coming from
*  like a science research perspective like a background so he he might be at least in the right
*  mindset the right background to kind of lead a serious investigation i think so i'll just say
*  generally um you know the office has been receptive to aiwa reaching out in order to collaborate
*  which has been a positive sign um also passed the same kudos to um dr spurgill and nasa's uh
*  effort as well i i see these organizations that are standing up i do see them as as good faith
*  efforts that are coming about through a lot of difficulty and negotiation most likely right and
*  i see these as as a small door opening that if we can take advantage of can lead to a much more
*  productive relationship between these organizations how do you put pressure on this kind of thing
*  does it come from the civilian leadership does it come from sort of congress and presidents does
*  it come from the public does the public have any power to put pressure on this or is the the the
*  giant wall of bureaucracy going to protect it against any public pressure what do you think
*  i think we've been in in that latter state for a while but you know society seems to be a bit
*  different nowadays you know we have the ability to communicate and to group and to to form
*  relationships in a way that hadn't been able to be present in the past we've been able to
*  do research for better or worse on our own you know in a way that hasn't been able to happen before
*  and so i sense that people are a bit less willing to kind of buy the bottom line statement from
*  those in power as they used to be back when they didn't have access to those tools and so i do
*  think there is a massive role for the general society general populace to play to show that
*  they are interested in this because it's not that i don't think the politicians or the leaders
*  in the in the pentagon it's not that they don't like this topic necessarily or think it's toxic
*  per se but they exist in a culture where this has been toxic and they don't feel comfortable
*  talking about it and these are people that have spent their entire careers you know working
*  towards a goal and getting to very high positions within government and so this is very against
*  their nature to take a stance on a topic like this and so the fact that these are standing up
*  even if they do have a small budget or if they struggled a bit at first i still think it's a
*  massive change you know and it's a big step away from that stigma that has been pervading this
*  topic for so long and you're actually part of alleviating the stigma for some somebody that's
*  as credible as intelligent as like varied in background able to speak about these things
*  that's a big risk that you took but it's extremely valuable because it's alleviating the stigma i
*  thank you for saying that but it didn't feel like much of a risk for me you know i didn't come out
*  about aliens right or whatever i i had a safety problem that i started asking questions about
*  and you know i went down a road as a navy trained aviation safety officer right that sent me to
*  school for six weeks in pensacola to be a safety officer you know we're almost hitting these
*  objects and it's not something that happened in the past and we want to understand it it's
*  happening right now like these these occurrences are still happening aviators are flying right now
*  are still flying by these things and in fact i mentioned i was a instructor pilot i had a student
*  call me about eight months ago or so and he's like hey sir you know i made it to the fleet finally
*  you know i had trained him how to fly and then he goes to f-18 he goes another year of training
*  and then he gets out to his squadron on the east coast and he's flying with a senior member of the
*  base n.a.s oceania where the fighters fly out of senior 05 or 06 and it was kind of a bad weather
*  day and so they said hey you know if the weather's not good enough for us to do this dog fighting set
*  we'll we'll go out and do a uap hunt you know i see we can't find any things or take a look at
*  them you know i don't know if it was ingest or not but you know this they i actually would say
*  it's not ingest because there were there were notices that were being briefed about this being
*  a safety hazard at this point and so i now that i think about it it likely wasn't ingest long story
*  short they went flying the weather was too bad they did go into ufo and they physically saw one
*  you know and he called me up and said hey sir i saw a cuban sphere they're still out here you
*  know years later and so it's almost like a generational issue you know for these fighter
*  pilots at least on east coast but that's great that they can talk about it right exactly exactly
*  they feel at least comfortable they have a reporting mechanism and so that was one of the
*  problems that i noticed that we have a lot of reporting mechanisms to take care of safety
*  issues and and even tactical issues when the time's right in order to keep track of what's going on
*  but there's no way to communicate about this sure we could submit a hazard report but nothing's
*  actually being investigated and if this is a tactical vulnerability or something more
*  it deserves attention if i could ask your sort of uh take your opinion of the different
*  ufo sightings that the god has released videos on so what do you think about the tic tac ufo
*  that uh david fravor and others have cited that's a you know truly anomalous experience um
*  i can't i can't do like mental models in my head to find potential solutions to
*  discredit that right like as much as i try right just as a logical process as a practice i can't
*  pick it apart in in the way that we were just talking about a moment ago about you know
*  thousands of drones being like sent up in very tricky manners right i can't really bring myself
*  to a clever solution that you know other than just saying the pilots are lying or it was error
*  you know and i believe you know i know david fravor you know i consider him a friend we talk a lot
*  i have zero zero reason to disbelieve anything he says yeah i agree with you uh but in terms of
*  the actual ufo is there something anomalous and interesting to you about that particular case
*  maybe um one interesting aspect there is how much do i understand about the
*  water surface and underwater aspects of these ufo's it seems like a lot of the discussions about
*  is about the movement of this particular thing that seems to be weird anomalous seems to defy
*  physics but what about stuff that's happening underwater that's interesting to me if i had
*  advanced technology i would certainly like to operate in part underwater because you can hide
*  a lot of stuff there you think it would be somewhat as easy as traveling through interstellar space at
*  least right yeah um you know i wish i had a great answer for that but as an aviator that's a kind of
*  a black box for us you know we don't have great what i would call cross-domain tracking right i
*  can't see something go underwater and then follow it underwater so it's literally not your domain
*  like underwater like leave that for somebody else yeah and you know i i use that terminology
*  because it's it's kind of important right um cross-domain tracking uh is something that we
*  haven't had to necessarily worry about right because airplanes operated in the air and
*  submarines operated underwater and space planes operating in space right but you know there's
*  going to be you know that's going to blur i think as as we move along here especially in the air and
*  space regime and being able to perhaps transition my radar contact at 40 000 feet to another radar
*  system that can track it up to 200 000 feet you know that might be a value and so we seem to be
*  missing that right now so what about the go fast and the gimbal videos that you mentioned earlier
*  there was like what's interesting there to you so the gimbal i'll talk about that one first i was
*  airborne for that one um the person that recorded it was a good friend of mine uh but i mean both
*  air crew i knew both of them but the the wizard himself uh very close friends with went through a
*  lot of her training together uh we went to the same fleet squadron uh he ended up transitioning
*  to be a pilot and then came to where i was instructing so i got to instruct him a bit
*  on his transition um and you know the way that was was was we went out on a a air-to-air training
*  mission so uh simulating a air fight against our own guys they're acting like the bad guys and kind
*  of go head to head against each other and when we fly on those missions we all fly out together
*  more or less we set up and then we kind of atright from the fight as we either you know run out of
*  gas or something happens and so people usually go back onesies or twosies uh and so the air crew
*  that recorded the gimbal they were going back to the boat and we were on what's called a workup
*  training event and so this is like a month on the boat where we're essentially conducting more time
*  operations more or less uh to stress ourselves out and to kind of do the last training block
*  before we go on deployment essentially so it's pretty high stress they actually do send aircraft
*  from like land bases to kind of try to penetrate and we're expected to go intercept them and so
*  we're kind of practicing like we play and so he saw these objects on the radar um the gimbal and
*  a fleet of other aircraft or vehicles and he initially thought it was part of the training
*  exercise that they were sending something in to to try to penetrate the airspace and so they you
*  know they flew over to it and as they got close enough to get on the FLIR um you know i think
*  everyone has heard their reaction um and they realized that it wasn't something they were
*  expecting to see can you actually describe what's in the video and what's the reaction in case they
*  haven't seen it yeah a lot of swearing uh but so what you see on the FLIR footage is a black or
*  white depending when you look at it object that's somewhat shaped like a gimbal it appears almost as
*  if someone put two plates together and then there seems to be almost like a small funnel of fire
*  energy that's at the top of the bottom of those plates in a sense so almost as if you know there's
*  a stick going in between two plates but not that pronounced right so there's an energy field that
*  kind of went to a funnel on the top and the bottom at least that's how it's being portrayed
*  on the FLIR um there's a lot of conversation about that being glare things that nature but
*  it was actually a very tight IR image it just was nondescript shape which was interesting
*  typically we would see the skin of the aircraft we can see the flames coming out of the exhaust
*  especially at those ranges um but and there was no flames or there's no exhaust here there was no
*  exhaust there was no you know there was no out outgassing of repellent in any manner right it
*  was just an object that had nothing emitting from it that was stationary in the sky well not
*  stationary but it was it was um moving along a path right it wasn't falling out of the sky
*  and it continued along if we were to consider it from a god's eye view again on the SA page
*  it continued along in a path and from the perspective top down view it just went in
*  no direction so no um just an instantaneous direction change from that perspective
*  you also hear them you know very excitedly talking on the tapes about um you know whatever the heck
*  this thing is and look at the SA there's a whole formation of them and so the SA is a situational
*  awareness page and again it's a large display that gives that god's eye view of all the radar
*  contacts so the video is actually showing just one and then they're speaking about many of them
*  correct on the on the SA display correct and what they essentially saw was if we were consider
*  above the object north so it's kind of offset to the north of the object um there was a formation
*  about somewhere between four and six of these objects in a rough wedge formation you know so
*  kind of side by side like this um and again not in a like autopilot type manner where it was very
*  stiff it was very kind of non-mechanical the flight mechanics again and these objects were in that
*  formation and they were going along and then they turned pretty sharply but they still had a radius
*  of turn and then went back in the opposite direction and during that turn it was they were kind of
*  like all over the place like it wasn't tight they weren't even like super they weren't flying in a
*  way i would expect them to be flying in relation to a flight lead they were flying as if they were
*  flying close to each other but not in formation which was kind of strange right um and then when
*  they rolled out they kind of tightened backed up like so when they basically they started that
*  turn and then 180 degrees out essentially they started flowing in the opposite direction and
*  kind of got back in that formation and while that was happening the gimbal object was proceeding was
*  a left to right and as as those uh the formation kind of turned up to the north and was just
*  passing back it the gimbal just kind of went back in the opposite direction so to follow it back
*  in that direction um and in the in the flier itself you know you see the object uh changes
*  orientation quite a bit so you see it um more or less level maybe k-ended about 45 degrees
*  and then you see it kind of moving around like this almost as if it was a is a gimbal
*  i've come to learn after some you know having seen some research online and and people really
*  looking into this that it seemed that the object actually climbed during that maneuver and so
*  the reason it looked like it turned immediately is because it turned like this it turned uh in a
*  vertical fashion like that which is pretty interesting that's kind of like another example
*  of a flight mechanics that we don't normally operate because we don't change our directions
*  by maneuvering in the vertical if we can help it it's you're just killing the fuel you know and so
*  if you're like a surveillance platform looking to spend as much time around something you're not
*  gonna you know climb 500 feet every time you make a turn unless you're tom cruise unless you're tom
*  cruise naturally okay so is that one of the more impressive flight mechanics you've seen in in the
*  in video forms or not the direct i site reports but like in terms of video evidence that we have
*  i think so we we were seeing a lot of these but we weren't just going on recording them all day we
*  we just kind of put them in that safety bucket be like all right there's objects over there we're
*  just not going to go near it you know and so we weren't putting our sensors on them that much
*  so we were gathering the data kind of secondarily but we weren't primarily focusing on it to see
*  all the details so that's so fascinating because you have a busy day you have a lot to do all right
*  well there's some weird stuff going on there we're just not going to go there and that says
*  something about sort of the um about human nature about the the way that bureaucracy is function the
*  way the military functions it fills up your day with busy important things and you don't get to
*  i mean that is something that i'm in a sort of absurd way worry about which is like we fill our
*  days with so much busyness then when truly beautiful things happen whatever they are
*  truly anomalous things we just won't pay attention because they don't fit our busy schedule
*  beautiful i think that's right on the nose and it's on my nose because you know i didn't give this
*  topic the attention it deserved until i left right until i left and i went to be an instructor
*  pilot where i had more time you know i had more downtime to kind of process and think and get out
*  of exactly what you just described and that's kind of what broke me out of it and got me thinking
*  more about it why do you think the d.o.d released these videos it's a great question did the d.o.d
*  release here they kind of get out on their own in some sense so i don't know the answer to that
*  question but my understanding of the situation is that the d.o.d talked about them so much because
*  they're already out there in a sense and so you know they could they had a choice where they could
*  have just straight up lied and said it wasn't theirs or was fake but uh again i think our culture
*  now is too open and the information moves too freely to to do things like that and it kind of
*  left them in a pickle that they had to respond to so what was the role of pentagon's advanced
*  aerospace threat intelligence program atip from your perspective from what you know
*  baby your intuition is atip a real thing that existed i was in a position as an aviator that
*  never would have exposed me to anything like that but i was curious about what people knew and i
*  i think in my mind maybe hoped her you know hope someone was looking into this in some sense but
*  on the day that gimbal was recorded i heard that they caught something extra interesting on the
*  fleer and i went to the intel debrief space to go see the the film and you know everyone's gathered
*  around watching it very interesting and i heard the admiral's coming down and so i was like i'm
*  going to hang out back you know quietly mind my own business and see i just want to see his reaction
*  and try to read it to see if this is brand new or if it is something that they've been dealing with
*  you know and you know he came in and he watched a video for like five or six seconds and went
*  and like turned around and walked out and you know i was like he's definitely seen these before
*  there's no way that you only watch that for a few seconds and don't have more interest
*  it was you know too bizarre so kind of going back does the office exist well you know i've heard that
*  though the admiral essentially reported back to the pentagon about that that case real time
*  essentially after he left right so he basically went back and i was totally reported that to
*  either atip directly or to other you know somehow the information got there so from my perspective
*  and from what i've experienced it seems like yes it was a thing but you know as an aviator i wouldn't
*  know either way right that's just my experience from what happened but it seems like there's
*  somewhere to report to at the time it seemed like there was at least some place to complain to
*  yeah it's not report to yeah let me ask you about sort of people that are taking a serious look at
*  at the videos and just the different ufo citing reports uh so there's there's a person named
*  mcwest who is a skeptic and tries to take a skeptical view on every single piece of evidence
*  on these ufo sightings what do you think about his analysis he tries to analyze in a way that
*  debunks some of these videos and assign probabilities to their explanations sort of leaning towards
*  things that uh give a very low probability to um alien extraterrestrial type of explanations for
*  these ufo's what do you think about his approach to these uh analysis well two parts to his approach
*  one uh i commend him for all the good work and effort he put into it um he i've seen him build
*  some models and things of that nature um and so i think that's something that's absolutely needed
*  in this environment no one's asking anyone to believe anyone here right uh trust but verify
*  it should certainly be the mantra but where i have uh you know a disagreement with his approach is
*  that he's approaching from you know from a skept or from a debunker standpoint and you know from my
*  perspective not not speaking for everyone but um when i hear that that tells me that you're driving
*  towards a particular conclusion um which has been a very safe process for the past x years right
*  it's been a it's been like a very safe business to be in to tell people that they haven't seen
*  aliens but uh times have changed a little bit and the tactics i've seen to try to retain that
*  view on reality um has included things such as completely dismissing what the aircrew are saying
*  and i think that is a fallacy to think that we have to take the human outside of that analysis
*  so those are the two things i disagree with when you uh put the night vision on and you look at the
*  stars and you look out there and in the vast cosmos only a small fraction of which we can see
*  how many intelligent alien civilizations do you think are out there do you think about this kind
*  of stuff i do you know i'm of the theory that we are not the only people out there i think it's it's
*  it would be a statistically silly comment to assume we are although i get that we are the only data
*  point that we currently have although i'm willing to jump over that fence and say that yes there
*  most likely is intelligent life elsewhere although i'll concede that it is a possibility we are early
*  or it could be limited or it could be in a manner that we don't recognize or can really understand
*  i i spend so much time thinking about how we anthropomorphize things on this ufo topic and
*  we've done it to ourselves with media in a sense right we've trained ourselves what to think about
*  what we think is true or what this would be like and by doing so i think we're closing ourselves
*  off to a lot of what the possibilities could be and the things that we could miss you beautifully
*  put that the thing that drew you to fighter jets is the technology so if you were to think to imagine
*  from an alien perspective what kind of technologies would we first encounter as human beings
*  if we were to meet another alien civilization in the next few centuries what kind of thing would
*  we see so you're now at the cutting edge and you see the quick progress that's happening
*  that was happening throughout the 20th century that's happening now with greater degrees of
*  autonomy with robots and that kind of stuff what do you think we will encounter i think we're going
*  to see uh the ability to manipulate matter like we used to manipulate information like i think
*  that's what um whether that means being able to pop something on the table that didn't exist or to
*  influence a chemical reaction somewhere but being able to manipulate and treat matter as if it was
*  information and so being able to design specific materials being able to move past a lot of the
*  barriers that seem to limit our progress with things such as miniaturized fusion or even just
*  fusion in general is you know a lot of it is is matter based as material based and our ability to
*  not um manipulate we can only discover materials in a sense and so i think that a complete mastery
*  of the physical reality would be one of the key traits of a very intelligent species well you're
*  actually working on some maybe you can correct me but sort of quantum mechanical simulation to
*  understand materials so is that do you see sort of the the early steps that we're doing at quantum
*  computing side to start to simulate to deeper understand materials but maybe to engineer and
*  to mess with materials at the at the very low level that aliens will be able to do and hopefully
*  humans would be able to do soon yeah i think that's you know so if we think about how what
*  materials are made of it's just a collection of atoms but each one of those atoms has a lot of
*  data associated with it so if we want to kind of calculate how they interact with each other
*  it requires a massive amount of computational resources so much so that it can't be done in
*  a lot of cases with classical computers and that's where quantum computers come in although we don't
*  have a perfectly functioning quantum computer at this point one of the things that we're working
*  at at quantum general materials is to essentially bridge that gap between what a classical computer
*  can do as far as simulating materials and of course what a fully functioning quantum computer
*  would mean for being able to design materials and so you know having the ability to study matter
*  at a very fundamental level and unleashing artificial intelligence and machine learning
*  on that problem i think is you know in a sense you know alien in a way that we're able to advance
*  our science using you know a process that we may not fully understand with a perhaps a non-human
*  based intelligence in some sense and so we may find patterns in the the processes right how does
*  our machine learning output you know can we can we match behaviors with what we're observing with
*  what maybe a machine learning algorithm with output right can we try to classify the intelligence in
*  that manner perhaps and so you know at genmas we're looking at these materials we're considering
*  what these algorithms could have used for later on could we perhaps reverse the process and determine
*  what a unique or anomalous material what type of properties it potentially could have and you said
*  genmat right what's uh what is genmat genmat is a quantum generative material so
*  it's the company i work for um we essentially are working on a couple of verticals one of them
*  is our quantum chemistry work we're essentially we're bridging the gap between essentially physics
*  and chemistry we're working on those problems and and again implementing artificial intelligence
*  machine learning into that process so that we can design those materials from the ground up
*  additionally we are what we consider a vertically integrated material science company which means
*  we can generate our our own data and so within the next quarter coming up we we are launching a
*  satellite in the space they'll have a fairly advanced hyperspectral sensor in there which
*  is intended to be the first launch that will help us detect different types of materials
*  using our advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry right we're going to be leveraging
*  that experience in order to better analyze that data oh interesting so materials that are strange
*  or novel out there in space not necessarily but we'll be looking back at earth to be able to
*  detect deposits on earth got it got it getting the greater perspective from out in space to do
*  analysis of different materials right interesting yeah i was really impressed by the deep mind i got
*  to hang out deep mind recently and they really impressed me the the possibility of the application
*  as you're saying of machine learning in the context of quantum mechanical simulation for
*  materials so to understand materials it's uh it's really really really interesting
*  so manipulate matter huh i would say the next thing is horses right or maybe fields so
*  um you know manipulating or managing gravity can we you know maneuver within fields in some
*  manner that allows us to perhaps move propellantless or in other manners right and so i think essentially
*  having a deeper understanding of you know different fields and being able to interact with them
*  i think would be you know a potential avenue for you know travel or advanced travel right
*  propellantless travel can we can we quantum entangle gravity fields together and propel a
*  ship by a you know the gravity field of a planet the mass of a planet and a drive on a ship you
*  know there's all sorts of interesting things but um yeah people look back at people like you
*  and say wow they used to fly like with this kind of propellant it seems like to be a very antiquated
*  way of flying and they were very impressed with themselves these humans that they could fly like
*  birds uh it's like so much energy is used to fly such short distances from that perspective
*  we can only throw so many rocks at the back yeah there needs to be a better way exactly it just
*  seems dumb like these it's like flintstones or something like that get good at it but there's
*  a limit right like we need to be good i mean that that's an interesting sort of uh trade-off how
*  much do you invest in getting really good at it i tend to believe the reason why it would be very
*  important and very powerful to put a human on mars is not necessarily for the exploration facet
*  but in all the different technologies that come from that so the in putting our there's something
*  about putting humans in extreme conditions where we figure out how to make it less extreme more
*  comfortable and uh for that we invent things like uh the d.o.d sort of helping invent the internet
*  and all the different technologies we've invented it's almost like an indirect consequence of solving
*  difficult problems whether that problem means winning wars or colonizing other planets and so
*  i don't think mars will help us figure out proportional systems or to crack open physics
*  to where you can travel close to the speed of light or faster than the speed of light
*  but it will help us figure out how to build some cool technology here on earth i think
*  so it's i'm a big proponent of doing really difficult things really difficult engineering
*  things to uh to see what kind of technologies emerge from that but let me ask you this do you
*  think us government is hiding some technology like alien spacecraft technology
*  i have no information either way and if you did you probably wouldn't tell me but my assumptions
*  you know how like what did my heart tell me my heart tells me something's going on
*  but i have no evidence for that maybe that's me wanting something to go on maybe that's a human
*  feeling to want to know and my government's in control of what some strange unknown thing is
*  what's your sense if such a thing happened would uh
*  would this kind of information leak would this kind of information be released by the government
*  i mean that's the worry that you have is because when you don't understand the thing and it's novel
*  you you want to hide it so that uh some kind of enemy doesn't get access to it and use it against
*  you i wonder if that is the underlying assumption i it's a it's the one people always jump to that
*  it's for to you know to maintain secrecy of technology and i assume that's part of it
*  i wonder if there's any other reasons that we would want to not talk about it i imagine that
*  in such information would have a shock to the you know social economic system of any country if not
*  the world and so i wonder if perhaps that was part of the concern as well you know how society can
*  react to it maybe we're anti-fragile enough now with everything that's going on and with our
*  communication networks that um you know why not now i don't know but it's uh that's something i
*  think about as well yeah the effect on the the mass psyche of something like this that uh that
*  there's another intelligence out there we had trouble enough to deal with a pandemic
*  to have something of this scale um basically having just an inkling of a phenomena that we
*  have no understanding of and could lead to complete destruction of human civilization or
*  a flourishing of it and what do you do what does a bureaucracy of government do with that
*  yeah especially when they're the ones holding the range of power and such a communication would
*  relinquish that power essentially to some degree since you think there's aliens out there and
*  you're somebody that's thought about war quite a bit do you think alien civilizations
*  when we meet them would want war would would they be a danger to us would they be a friend to us
*  what's your intuition about intelligences out there my intuition tells me that when two people
*  like yourself and myself or anyone get together often the output is greater than individuals
*  individuals and when we work together we can typically do things that are more impressive
*  and better than if a single person works alone and now i know that war has driven technology
*  technological progress but perhaps there's other mechanisms that can do so but regardless i wonder
*  you know if we truly think about advanced society that has been perhaps thousands or millions of
*  years ahead of us i would imagine that same same truth to be there that people working together
*  creatures working together is a good thing for society or its society as a whole and if we
*  consider that as we imagine a society growing and expanding in a sense the ultimate output of a
*  planet could only be achieved in some senses if everyone was working towards the same goal and
*  there might be you know wonders and secrets and things that we can't imagine just simply because
*  of the time frames that we we live under and we think in but if a planet has a single unit and
*  it almost as an entity itself at a certain level right if everything's working towards the same
*  output you know i could almost imagine an intelligent species that approached us planet to
*  planet instead of person to person because that's how they've evolved and they've assumed any
*  intelligent species would understand that working together is better than not and so you know my
*  heart tells me that at a certain point you know love and caring and desire to work together is
*  much more powerful than you know the technological progress that war would bring i hope so as well
*  well let me jump to the ai topic that you've done so you've done research and development
*  efforts focused on multi-agent intelligence for collaborative autonomy machine learning ai stuff
*  that we've been talking about for combat for air to air combat manned on man teaming technologies
*  all that kind of stuff what's some interesting ideas in the space that fascinate you randomness
*  you know being able to to not predict what the enemy is doing almost no matter what because
*  there's a level of randomness that's within the tactical envelope even utility of randomness the
*  utility of randomness in an increasing something a book you should write
*  i think it'd be good titles name my band name your band yeah so yeah can you elaborate
*  that so like trying to deeper understand how you can integrate randomness through ai in the context
*  of combat in order to make yourself in order to take away the enemy's ability to try to predict
*  what you're going to do to disrupt their technological progress cycles so that they
*  don't have a clear target to aim at and if you don't clear our target to aim at it's hard to hit
*  it additionally more distribution of assets and capability so imagine being able to digitally
*  model your your weapon or your system or your entire tactical engagement or scenario
*  or allow machine learning to help you better understand the technology that you need to build
*  in order to defeat a particular scenario right and i'm talking hardware now not just the tactic
*  itself and you know being able to use large amounts of simulation and machine learning to build
*  individual assets that are small boutique using advanced manufacturing techniques for a mission
*  or for a particular battle right instead of just having these large things against an enemy you're
*  building systems and technology for individual cases what about manned and unmanned teaming
*  so man and machine working together is there interesting ideas there i approach it from the
*  position that the human should be commanding from the highest level possible right so mission
*  objective based targeting and so if just for example if there's a building here and i want
*  that building to go away that's the message i want to communicate i don't want to tell certain
*  vehicles to be in a certain spot i don't want to know how much fuel they have i don't even want
*  to know what capabilities they have necessarily i just want to know that i have the ability to
*  select from a cloud of capabilities and the right assets are going to arrive such that they deal
*  with the contingencies around the target such as protection systems or ew and then can prosecute
*  the target to the high enough probability of satisfaction that's needed by the mission and
*  that's the power of the the human mind is it's able to do some of these strategic calculations
*  but also ethical calculations all that kind of stuff exactly that's what humans are good at
*  does it worry you a future where we have increasingly higher autonomy in our weapon
*  systems in our war so you said building what about uh telling a set of fully autonomous drones to
*  get rid of all the terrorists in the city so you multiple buildings region that kind of
*  there's a greater and greater um autonomy so that that's a fear right um you're viewing it from a we
*  can cover more perspective which is um fair and a lot of we i i don't approach it from that topic
*  at least i don't think of it that way at least morally um i think that with the advancement of
*  warfare assuming we have a just and moral leadership if that's the case then i am an advocate
*  for increased autonomy and technology because i see it as an ability to be more precise and if we
*  trust the moral leadership of our government then we would want to be as precise as possible in order
*  to mitigate effects that we don't want so i know that's not a satisfying answer and it leaves us
*  well no bad feelings but no because having experienced sort of um
*  directly seen what it looks like when deliberately or carelessly
*  war leads to the death of a large number of civilians as it does in currently in ukraine
*  the the value of precision given ethical leadership becomes apparent so there's something
*  distinctly unethical about the the murder of civilians in a time of war
*  and i think technology helps less than that of course all death is terrible but there's
*  there's something about um schools hospitals being destroyed with everybody inside being killed
*  um it's particularly terrible it is and you know you approached it from the angle of more
*  autonomy enables a wider you know swath of destruction and that's where we get back into
*  you know who's making the decisions based off of this and you know my hope again would be that we
*  would have the leadership that would use these things when needed in the precise way as possible
*  to minimize that and i've seen that firsthand you know i've seen that in country i've seen
*  not not blue forces but you know i've seen truck bombs go off on school buses you know driving
*  around afghanistan uh while escorting convoys and you know it wasn't easy then and i'm sure
*  it's not any easier now especially after what you've just seen do you have thoughts about the
*  current war in ukraine maybe from a military perspective maybe from the air force perspective
*  so i can just mention a few things there's the bar ectar drones that are being used
*  they're unmanned i think they have capability to be autonomous but they're usually remotely
*  remotely controlled they're used for reconnaissance but they're also used by the ukraine side for
*  reconnaissance and i think um also to destroy different technologies tanks and so on different
*  targets like this uh so there's also on the on the russian side the the world and 10 there's the the
*  fighter jets uh mig-29 the ukraine side and uh su-25 and the russian side is there anything kind
*  of stands out to you about this particular aspects of what this war looks like that's
*  unique to what you've experienced maybe not unique but it's just been absolutely incredible to see
*  the footage you know i mean we're watching war on twitter you know essentially and to see you know
*  these aircraft flying down low spitting flares out getting shot down and you know it's incredible
*  to see this happening you know live for everyone to see um so that's just kind of a quick meta
*  comment but as far as the actual you know i think these small form factor uavs where they're just
*  like strapping weapon to it and flying over and trying to drop it at the right time or any of
*  this these type of commercial applications of technology into this ad hoc warfare area is
*  incredibly interesting because it shows you know how useful that technology can be outside of the
*  military right like these like especially like dji right like there's obviously a lot of technology
*  in there is being leveraged for other capabilities within you know plc military or at least we would
*  assume um what happens if that is more widespread right like what if we were creating our own drones
*  and they were being used against us would we want to have some type of kill switch or something like
*  that right so what i think governments are going to have to consider like all these tools that are
*  going to be easily available to just any person could be turned into a tool of war how do we stop
*  that from being turned against us you know especially as we look at you know 10 years
*  from now when we have a large number of autonomous uavs delivering packages and doing everything else
*  over our country and any one of those could be potentially a weapon if we don't have the proper
*  security well there's we're now in texas and texas values its guns and sees guns as among other
*  things a protector of individual freedom and you could see a future perhaps where and i've
*  certainly experienced this in the empowering nature of this in ukraine where you can
*  put the fight for independence into your own hands by literally strapping explosives to ggi
*  drones that you purchase on your own salary i mean that one of the interesting things about the
*  voluntary army in ukraine is that they're basically using their own salary to buy the
*  ammunition to fight for their independence there's a very kind of ideal that sort of
*  people speak about when they speak about the second amendment in this country that
*  it's interesting to see the advanced technology version of that especially in ukraine sort of
*  using computer vision technology for surveillance and reconnaissance to try to
*  integrate that information to to discover the targets and all that kind of stuff
*  to put that in the hands of civilians it's fascinating to see to sort of fight for their
*  independence you could say that to fight against authoritarian regime of your own government all
*  that kind of stuff it shows you how complicated the workspace in the future is going to be you
*  know invading a land like that where people have you know that many different types of resources
*  because it's absolutely changed warfare i mean hopefully that creates a disincentive to start
*  war to go to war with a yeah sort of it changes the nature of guerrilla warfare does yeah you know i
*  don't think putin was expecting to be in that engagement quite as long as he has of course
*  but it can show you how you can get caught up you know if if land wars turn into an inescapable
*  quagmire each time due to the complications around the the society's ability to access
*  interesting tools you know it could be you know it could be a huge demotivator for aggression
*  well let me ask you about this do you think there will always be war in the world
*  is this just a part of human nature
*  i think so i think i think it is until we until we move past resource limitation
*  there's always going to be at least that one particular cause of conflict and then we can
*  also consider all our psychological lizard brain emotions that cause us to act out although you
*  know we're hopefully we have enough things in place to stop that from rising to the level of
*  war but you know we have our own biology our own psychology and evolution to combat um and then
*  but there are pragmatic reasons to exert violence sometimes unfortunately and that one of those
*  cases could be resource limitations and so uh your question was do i think there'll always be war in
*  this world i my unfortunate answer is perhaps yes but once there's more than one world and we're
*  less resource constrained then perhaps it'll be a valve of sorts for that i talked to jaco on this
*  podcast i i told him about a song called brothers in arms by dire straits and uh the question i
*  asked him i'd like to ask you the same question is um like the song goes do you think we're
*  fools to wage war on our brothers in arms and jaco said our enemy is not our brothers in arms
*  they're the enemy and so this kind of notion that we're all human that's a notion that's a luxury
*  you can have but there is good and bad in this world according to jaco i hear that
*  anger and hate when i was in ukraine among some people where
*  there was a sense where you could be brothers and sisters you can have family you can have love
*  for from ukraine to russia but now that everything changed and generational hate
*  for some people have taken over so i guess the question is um when you think about the enemy
*  is there hate there you acknowledge that they're human i had never had any hate or discontent
*  you know when i was doing my job i'll say but i was also never in a true life for death
*  situation where they were gonna kill me if i didn't kill them um but you know i think that
*  environment isn't one born out of hate you know being in that type of scenario and you know in
*  sense it's how to be alive right i mean that's the our natural state is be fighting for survival in a
*  sense and so i think there's there's great power and strength and clarity perhaps in that and it's
*  not always born out of of hate but out of necessity and we can't always control that
*  and i think as we focus on ourselves so much we only dance on that pinhead when we find ourselves
*  fighting for things that we need and we're always taking from someone else at this point and so
*  as someone that's been in combat and very high above of it i'll say right where i didn't feel
*  like i was in particular danger um i i i rationalized it and i made my wife do it knowing
*  that there were people on the other side that were going to die that were on our side than not so it
*  was always a very human thing it was never um a reaction emotional reaction of any sense so you
*  do you were able to see the basic uh it's human versus human there's some aspect of war that is
*  basically um one people fighting each other yes at the end of the day you know especially i would
*  say in aviation tactical aviation there's almost a kinship with your your enemies in a sense because
*  you know that you know them in a sense right you know what they've been through you know what
*  training they've been through you know where they failed um and you know what type of person they
*  are because it's a very unique person that does that job and usually can spot them i guess it's
*  the kind of respect you have for the craftsmanship of the job that's taken on certainly and that
*  person didn't come out in his hundred million dollar jet because i pissed him off you know it's
*  it's not an emotional response we're both there maybe because we chose to be in some sense but
*  at the behest of of someone else and outside of our control and power and so in a sense for me
*  it's almost a challenge that we've engaged upon agreeably but that's such a romantic version that
*  i have the luxury to have being high in my castle in the jet up there not on the ground so i
*  understand that it's a bit more romantic than perhaps you know someone on the ground experiencing
*  all the horrors down there because everything looks very small from above and that's another
*  aspect of war with greater autonomy when you're controlling the mission versus uh you know
*  have a jengis khan type of intimacy in terms of the actual experience of war where you directly have
*  you murder with a sword versus a gun versus a remotely controlled drone versus a strategic
*  mission assignment to an autonomous drone that executes abstracted away until it's just a small
*  decision and my worry is the people without a voice are are completely forgotten and silenced
*  in all these calculations i spoke to a lot of people poor people that feel like they've never
*  really had a voice and uh and they're too easily forgotten even within the country of ukraine
*  it's the uh the um big city versus the world divide you know it's easy to forget the people that
*  don't have a twitter account and don't um that their basic existence is just trying to survive
*  trying to put food on table they don't have anything else um anything else in the day are
*  the ones that truly feel the pain of war of the supply chain going down of the food supplies going
*  down of of a cold winter without power um you're still young but you've seen some things so uh let
*  me ask you to put on your wise sage hat and uh give advice to young people whether they're
*  fascinated by technology or fascinated by fighter jets whether they're fascinated by sort of
*  engineering or the way the stars look at night what advice would you give them how to have a
*  career they can be proud of or how to have a life they can be proud of i'd suggest that they don't
*  fear looking foolish i spent a large portion of my life considering the laughter or the the comments
*  at my statements as uh indication that i shouldn't pursue that and so you know i didn't i kind of
*  woke up to that fact a bit later but i would encourage you know i would advise that that
*  people you know trust in themselves and trust in the things that they care about it doesn't matter
*  if they're good at it all that matters is that they find something that they can apply love and
*  care to and they will grow better at it and they'll most likely make the world better because of it
*  and don't be afraid to look stupid don't be afraid to look stupid uh yeah that's one of the things
*  that i think as you get older you're expected to be to have it all figured out and so you are afraid
*  to take on new things but i think as long as you're always okay looking stupid and having a beginner's
*  mind you can you can get really really far even later on in life so this isn't just advice for
*  young people this is really advice for uh for everybody maybe a dark question but um has there
*  been a difficult time in your life a really dark place you've gone in your mind um that stands out
*  they had to really overcome i would suggest that i've been a pretty firm ground for most of my life
*  i haven't had too many personal tragedies i'll say that have really defined me um certainly none
*  that i would think are outside the norm so there is no truly low point actually i have one and it's
*  tough for me because i you know i've spent most of my life beating motions and you know uh high
*  high emotional responses out of my system right because that's what flying is right it's keeping
*  a steady line and and doing what you need to do um in fact there's been studies that show reduced
*  uh adrenaline production fighter pilots for a number of years after they get out but
*  getting out of the navy was difficult for me you know and i wasn't expecting it to be a lot of
*  bravado and machoism of course in the military uh especially in fighter community and we all have
*  our plans made up to get out and none of it really um accounts for any type of mental health or
*  anything like that it's all very much where am i going to get my paycheck from where am i going
*  to move to and you know whether it's the navy or just individuals truly understanding the difference
*  that makes and when i got out it was it was difficult for me i you know i think a lot of
*  guys in that job when they get out they almost at least i i had anxiety when i got out because it
*  was i was so used to being highly involved in something that um that you know just was i was
*  always involved with that when i got out i didn't know how to fill that space essentially you know
*  um and while i wouldn't say it was an overly traumatic experience i think it's one that's not
*  accounted for enough that people that are getting out you know so i would encourage them to take it
*  serious and actually think about it and respect the change because it is a big one well if i may
*  say you found a place in nature currently a home is there uh can you speak to that being a source
*  of happiness for you absolutely an escape from the world certainly it very much is was it deliberate
*  that you found it there that's home for me so you know i moved back up to the the boston area and
*  my wife and i had an idea after moving about eight or nine times in the navy of kind of what we what
*  we wanted just generally and it was all really about the land and not about the house you know
*  we just wanted privacy and to be nearby and so we ended up finding a lot of land you know a parcel
*  of land we put a house on it and it provides me with a sense of peace that i think i can only get
*  when i'm in nature a sense of clarity that helps me think helps me relax maybe so relaxing that
*  helps me think i don't know but being surrounded by nature and birds and animals for me has always
*  allowed me to i don't know feel most in touch with with my own thoughts in a sense it just
*  provides clarity and so this little sanctuary you could say i've built allows me to to you know
*  interface via a fiber line at my house but also feel like i'm a million miles away sometimes
*  which is the best of both worlds hey you can just walk outside to escape it all yes to experience
*  life as as uh hundreds of generations of human species have experienced it maybe it's a dichotomy
*  my desire for the vastness of technology and experience compared with the most basic baseline
*  that we have isn't that strange how do you how do you square that i don't know your draw how
*  drawn you are to the cutting edge and still the calm you find in nature i think it makes sense
*  nature is vastly superior to almost all of our technology from a technology perspective yeah it
*  is and so away it's being surrounded by perfection in a lot of senses in the military and in general
*  have you contemplated immortality have you been afraid of death what was what's your relationship
*  like with death i was willing to accept an oversized amount of risk i'll say when i was
*  younger as an aviator yeah not not in the jet but just that was my life you know i felt like i was
*  going to live forever um and going out in the war you know strangely didn't really change that
*  because you know as an aviator again we're riding up high on our horse up there so
*  there were times when i was in situations that could have resulted in death from
*  from flying or from emergency in the aircraft but i'll be honest i never really kind of sat down
*  to think about the morale the mortality of it afterwards i feel like i kind of signed a check
*  at the beginning and it was my job to perform as well as i could and if something happened in that
*  then i better damn well be sure i would do my best at the time then so you know i i maybe didn't
*  personally reflect on it as much as of it i one would think you know because once you get in that
*  machine it doesn't give you a lot of time to sit back and philosophize on on your current situation
*  and that same just like we weren't seeing these or when we seen these objects off the coast we
*  weren't necessarily you know examining them every day right we'd put them into that bucket because
*  it wasn't something that was going to kill us right away and thinking about death when you're
*  so close to it all the time would be debilitating it would probably make you worse at your job
*  to win well maybe you can think about death when you look out when you go out into nature and think
*  like the the the fact that this whole ride ends it's such a weird thing and the the old makes way
*  to new and that's all throughout nature and if you just look at the the cruelty of nature or the
*  beauty of nature however you think about it the the fact that the the big thing eats the little thing
*  and over and over and that's just how it progresses and that's how adaptation happens
*  death is a requirement for evolution and you know whether evolution allows us to see objective
*  reality or not it still gives you some interesting thoughts about perspectives of death and especially
*  concerning it's a biological necessity as far as evolution is concerned yeah it's weird it's weird
*  that there's been like a hundred billion people that lived before us and that you and I will be
*  forgotten this whole thing we're doing now is meaningless in that sense but at the same time
*  it feels deeply meaningful somehow I guess that that's the question I want to ask when you go out
*  to nature with family what do you think is the meaning of it all what's the meaning of life
*  or maybe when you put on the night goggles the the night vision goggles and look up at the stars
*  why we're here I can't speak for everyone but at least the way I interpret it you know or at least
*  I I feel like I interpret my way here my job is I feel like my role is just to be curious about
*  the environment in a manner that allows us to understand as much as possible I think that the
*  I think that the human mind whether it's just the mass inside our skull or you know whether there's
*  some type of quantum interactions going on our mind is an incredible has incredible ability to
*  output new information in in a universe that you know somewhat stale of information right our minds
*  are in some somewhat unique in that we can imagine and perceive things that could never ever have
*  naturally occurred and yet we can make it happen we can instantiate that with enough belief that
*  it's true and it can happen and so for me I feel like I just need to encourage that to encourage
*  you know interaction with reality such that it leaves us a newer and grander you know interactions
*  with this universe and all that starts with a little bit of curiosity exactly right you're an
*  incredible person you've done so many things and there's so much still still ahead of you thank
*  you for being brave enough to talk about UFOs and doing it so seriously and thank you for pushing
*  forward on all these fronts in terms of technology so from just the fighter jets the the engineering
*  of that to the AI ML applications in the combat setting that's super interesting and then now
*  quantum I can't wait to see to see what you do next thank you so much for sitting down
*  talking today it was an honor it was my pleasure thank you lex thanks for listening to this
*  conversation with lieutenant ryan graves to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the
*  description and now let me leave you with some words from buzz aldrin bravery comes along as a
*  gradual accumulation of discipline thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
*  you
