# Edward Gibson: Human Language, Psycholinguistics, Syntax, Grammar & LLMs | Lex Fridman Podcast #426
**Lex Fridman:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Jd9GI6XqE)
*  Naively, I certainly thought that all humans would have words for exact counting and the
*  Pirohá don't.
*  Okay?
*  So they don't have any words for even one.
*  There's not a word for one in their language.
*  And so there's certainly not a word for two, three or four.
*  So that kind of blows people's minds off.
*  Yeah, that's blowing my mind.
*  That's pretty weird.
*  How are you going to ask, I want two of those.
*  You just don't.
*  And so that's just not a thing you can possibly ask in the Pirohá.
*  It's not possible.
*  There's no words for that.
*  The following is a conversation with Edward Gibson, or Ted, as everybody calls him.
*  He is a psycholinguistics professor at MIT.
*  He heads the MIT language lab that investigates why human languages look the way they do,
*  the relationship between culture and language, and how people represent, process, and learn
*  language.
*  Also he should have a book titled Syntax, a cognitive approach published by MIT Press
*  coming out this fall.
*  So look out for that.
*  This is the Lex Freeman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now dear friends, here's Edward Gibson.
*  When did you first become fascinated with human language?
*  As a kid in school, when we had to structure sentences in English grammar, I found that
*  process interesting.
*  I found it confusing as to what it was I was told to do.
*  I didn't understand what the theory was behind it, but I found it very interesting.
*  So when you look at grammar, you're almost thinking about like a puzzle, like almost
*  like a mathematical puzzle.
*  Yeah, I think that's right.
*  I didn't know I was going to work on this at all at that point.
*  I was really just, I was kind of a math geek person, computer scientist.
*  I really liked computer science.
*  And then I found language as a neat puzzle to work on from an engineering perspective,
*  actually.
*  I sort of accidentally, I decided after I finished my undergraduate degree, which was
*  computer science and math and Canada and Queens University, I decided to go to grad school.
*  That's what I always thought I would do.
*  I went to Cambridge where they had a master's program in computational linguistics.
*  And I hadn't taken a single language class before.
*  All I'd taken was CS, computer science, math classes, pretty much mostly as an undergrad.
*  And I just thought this was an interesting thing to do for a year because it was a single
*  year program.
*  And then I ended up spending my whole life doing it.
*  So fundamentally, your journey through life was one of a mathematician and computer scientist.
*  And then you kind of discovered the puzzle, the problem of language and approached it
*  from that angle to try to understand it from that angle, almost like a mathematician or
*  maybe even an engineer.
*  As an engineer, I'd say, I mean, to be frank, I had taken an AI class, I guess it was 83
*  or 84, somewhere 84 in there a long time ago.
*  And there was a natural language section in there.
*  And it didn't impress me.
*  I thought there must be more interesting things we can do.
*  It didn't seem very, it seemed just a bunch of hacks to me.
*  It didn't seem like a real theory of things in any way.
*  And so I just thought this was, this seemed like an interesting area where there wasn't
*  enough good work.
*  Did you ever come across like the philosophy angle of logic?
*  So if you think about the 80s with AI, the expert systems where you try to kind of maybe
*  sidestep the poetry of language and some of the syntax and the grammar and all that kind
*  of stuff and go to the underlying meaning that language is trying to communicate and
*  try to somehow compress that in a computer representable way.
*  Do you ever come across that in your studies?
*  I mean, I probably did, but I wasn't as interested in it.
*  I was trying to do the easier problems first, the ones I could thought maybe were handleable,
*  which is seems like the syntax is easier, like, which is just the forms as opposed to
*  the meaning.
*  Like you're talking about when you're starting talking about the meaning, that's a very hard
*  problem and it still is a really, really hard problem.
*  But the forms is easier.
*  And so I thought at least figuring out the forms of human language, which sounds really
*  hard but is actually maybe more tractable.
*  So it's interesting.
*  You think there is a big divide, there's a gap, there's a distance between form and meaning
*  because that's a question you have discussed a lot with LLMs because they're damn good
*  at form.
*  Yeah, I think it's really good at is form.
*  Exactly.
*  And that's why they're good because they can do form.
*  Meaning's hard.
*  Do you think there's, oh, wow.
*  I mean, it's an open question, right?
*  How close form and meaning are.
*  We'll discuss it.
*  But to me, studying form, maybe it's a romantic notion, gives you form is like the shadow
*  of the bigger meaning thing underlying language.
*  As I form is, language is how we communicate ideas.
*  We communicate with each other using language.
*  So in understanding the structure of that communication, I think you start to understand
*  the structure of thought and the structure of meaning behind those thoughts and communication
*  to me.
*  But to you, big gap.
*  What do you find most beautiful about human language?
*  Maybe the form of human language, the expression of human language.
*  What I find beautiful about human language is some of the generalizations that happen
*  across the human language, just within and across a language.
*  So let me give you an example of something which I find kind of remarkable.
*  That is if like a language, if it has a word order such that the verbs tend to come before
*  their objects.
*  And so that's like English does that.
*  So we have the first, the subject comes first in a simple sentence.
*  So I say, you know, the dog chased the cat or Mary kicked the ball.
*  So the subjects first and then after the subject, there's the verb.
*  And then we have objects.
*  All these things come after in English.
*  So it's generally a verb.
*  And most of the stuff that we want to say comes after the subject.
*  It's the objects.
*  There's a lot of things we want to say they come after.
*  And there's a lot of languages like that.
*  About 40% of the languages of the world look like that.
*  They're subject, verb, object languages.
*  And then these languages tend to have prepositions, these little markers on the nouns that connect
*  nouns to other nouns or nouns to verbs.
*  So I, when I sort of verbalize, I start a preposition like in or on or of or about, I say, I talk
*  about something.
*  The something is the object of that preposition that we have these little markers come also
*  just like verbs.
*  They come before their nouns.
*  Okay.
*  So now we look at other languages like Japanese or Hindi or some, these are these are so-called
*  verb final languages.
*  Those as about maybe a little more than 40%, maybe 45% of the world's languages or more,
*  I mean, 50% of the world's languages are verb final.
*  Those tend to be post positions.
*  Those markers, the same, we have the, they have the same kinds of markers as we do in
*  English, but they put them after.
*  So sorry, they put them first.
*  The markers come first.
*  So you say, instead of, you know, talk about a book, you say a book about the opposite
*  order there in Japanese or in Hindi, you do the opposite and the talk comes at the end.
*  So the verb will come at the end as well.
*  So instead of Mary kicked the ball, it's Mary ball kicked.
*  And then if it says Mary kicked the ball to John, it's John too.
*  The two, the little, the marker there, the preposition, it's a post position in these
*  languages.
*  And so the interesting thing, a fascinating thing to me is that within a language, this
*  order aligns, it's harmonic.
*  And so if it's one or the other, it's either verb initial or verb final, but then you'll
*  have prepositions, prepositions or post positions.
*  And so that, and that's across the languages that we can look at.
*  You got around a thousand languages for, there's around 7,000 languages around on the, on the
*  earth right now.
*  But we have information about say word order on around a thousand of those pretty decent
*  amount of information.
*  And for those thousand, which we know about, about 95% fit that pattern.
*  So they will have either verb and it's about, it's about half and half or half a verb initial
*  like English and half a verb final like, like Japanese.
*  So just to clarify, verb initial is subject, verb object.
*  That's correct.
*  Verb final is still subject, object, verb.
*  That's correct.
*  Yeah. The subject is generally first.
*  That's so fascinating.
*  I ate an apple or I Apple ate.
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  And it's fascinating that there's a pretty even division in the world amongst those 40, 45%.
*  Yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty even.
*  And those two are the most common by far.
*  Those two words, the subject tends to be first.
*  There's so many interesting things, but these things are a thing I find so fascinating is
*  there are these generalizations within and across the language.
*  And not only those are the, and there's actually a simple explanation, I think, for a lot of
*  that. And that is you're trying to like minimize dependencies between words.
*  That's basically the story, I think, behind a lot of why word order looks the way it is,
*  is you were always connecting.
*  What is it?
*  What is the thing I'm telling you?
*  I'm talking to you in sentences.
*  You're talking to me in sentences.
*  These are sequences of words which are connected and the connections are dependencies between the
*  words.
*  And it turns out that what we were trying to do in a language is actually minimize those
*  dependency links.
*  It's easier for me to say things if the words that are connecting for their meaning are close
*  together.
*  It's easier for you in understanding if that's also true.
*  If they're far away, it's hard to produce, produce that.
*  And it's hard for you to understand.
*  And the languages of the world within a language and across languages, you know, fit that
*  generalization, which is, you know, so I, you know, it turns out that having verbs initial and
*  then having prepositions ends up making dependencies shorter and having verbs final and
*  having post positions ends up making dependencies shorter than if you cross them.
*  If you cross them, it ends up, you just end up, it's possible.
*  You can do it.
*  You mean within a language?
*  Within a language, you can do it.
*  It just ends up with longer dependencies than if you didn't.
*  So languages tend to go that way.
*  They tend to minimize.
*  They say they call it harmonic.
*  So it was observed a long time ago by without the explanation by a guy called Joseph Greenberg,
*  who's a famous typologist from Stanford.
*  He observed a lot of generalizations about how word order works.
*  And these are some of the harmonic generalizations that he observed.
*  Harmonic generalizations about word order.
*  There's so many things I want to ask you.
*  Okay, let me just sometimes basics.
*  You mentioned dependencies a few times.
*  What do you mean by dependencies?
*  Well, what I mean is in in language, there's kind of three structures to three
*  components to the structure of language.
*  One is the sounds.
*  So cat is c-a-t-t in English.
*  I'm not talking about that part.
*  I'm talking, then there's two meaning parts and those are the words.
*  And you were talking about meaning earlier.
*  So words have a form and they have a meaning associated with them.
*  And so cat is a full form in English and it has a meaning associated with whatever a cat is.
*  And then the combinations of words, that's what I'll call grammar or syntax.
*  And that's like when I have a combination like the cat or two cats.
*  OK, so where I take two different words there and put them together and I get a compositional
*  meaning from putting those two different words together.
*  And so that's the syntax.
*  And in any sentence or utterance, whatever I'm talking to you, you're talking to me, we have a
*  bunch of words and we're putting together in a sequence.
*  They it turns out they are connected so that every word is connected to just one other
*  word in that in that sentence.
*  And so you end up with what's called technically a tree.
*  It's a tree structure.
*  So there where there's a root of that of that utterance of that sentence.
*  And then there's a bunch of dependence like branches from that root that go down to the words.
*  The words are the leaves in this metaphor for a tree.
*  So a tree is also sort of a mathematical construct.
*  Yeah, yeah, it's a graph theoretical thing.
*  It's a graph theory.
*  Yeah.
*  So in this fascinating that you can break down a sentence into a tree and then one every word
*  is hanging on to another is depending on it.
*  That's right. And everyone agrees on that.
*  So all linguists will agree with that.
*  No, this is not controversial.
*  That is not controversial.
*  There's nobody sitting here.
*  I do not think that you don't think so.
*  OK, no linguists sitting there mad at this.
*  No, I think in every language, I think everyone agrees that all sentences are trees at some
*  level. Can I pause on that?
*  Sure. Because it's to me, just as a layman, it is surprising that you can break down
*  sentences in many, mostly all languages into a tree.
*  I think so. I've never heard of anyone disagreeing with that.
*  That's weird.
*  The details of the trees are what people disagree about.
*  Well, OK, so what's what's at the root of it?
*  How do you construct? How hard is it?
*  What is the process of constructing a tree from a sentence?
*  Well, this is where, you know, depending on what your theoretical notions, I'm going to
*  say the simplest thing, dependency grammar.
*  It's like a bunch of people invented this.
*  Tenier was the first French guy back in.
*  I mean, the paper was published in 1959, but he was working on the 30s and stuff.
*  And it goes back to, you know, philologist Pinyini was doing this in ancient India.
*  OK, and so, you know, doing something like this, the simplest thing we can think of is
*  that there's just connections between the words to make the utterance.
*  And so just say I have like two dogs entered a room.
*  OK, here's a sentence.
*  And so we're connecting two and dogs together.
*  That's like there's some dependency between those words to make some bigger meaning.
*  And then we're connecting dogs now to entered.
*  And we connect a room somehow to entered.
*  And so I'm going to connect to room and then room back to entered.
*  That's the tree is that the root is entered.
*  That's the thing is like an entering event.
*  That's what we're saying here. And the subject, which is whatever that dog is, is two
*  dogs. It was. And the connection goes back to dogs, which goes back to them.
*  Then that goes back to two.
*  I'm just that that's my tree.
*  It starts at entered, goes to dogs down to two.
*  And then the other side after the verb, the object, it goes to room.
*  And then that goes back to the determiner article.
*  We're going to call that word.
*  So there's a bunch of categories of words here we're noticing.
*  So there are verbs.
*  Those are these things that typically mark they refer to events and states in the
*  world. And they're nouns which typically refer to people, places and things.
*  What people say. But they can refer to other more.
*  I think you've heard of events themselves as well.
*  They're they're they're marked by, you know, how they how they use the category.
*  The part of speech of a word is how it gets used in language.
*  It's like that's how you decide what the what the category of a word is, not not by
*  the meaning, but how it's how it gets used.
*  What's usually the root?
*  Is it going to be the verb that defines the event?
*  Usually. Yes, yes.
*  OK, yeah. I mean, if I don't say a verb, then there won't be a verb until it'll be
*  something else.
*  What if you're messing? Are we talking about language that's like correct language?
*  What if you do poetry and messing with stuff?
*  Is it then then rules go out the window, right?
*  Then it's no. You're still no, no, no.
*  You're constrained by whatever language you're dealing with.
*  Probably you have other constraints in poetry such that you're like usually in
*  poetry. There's multiple constraints that you want to like you want to usually
*  convey multiple meanings is the idea.
*  And maybe you have like a rhythm or a rhyming structure as well.
*  And depending on so, but you usually are constrained by your the rules of your
*  language for the most part.
*  And so you don't violate those too much.
*  You can violate them somewhat, but not too much.
*  So it has to be recognizable as your language.
*  Like in English, I can't say dogs to entered room.
*  I mean, I meant that, you know, two dogs entered a room and I can't mess with the
*  order of the the articles and the articles and the nouns.
*  You just can't do that in some languages.
*  You can you can mess around with the order of words much more.
*  I mean, you speak Russian.
*  Russian has a much freer word order than English.
*  And so, in fact, you can move around words in.
*  I told you that English has the subject, verb, object, word order.
*  So does Russian. But Russian is much freer than English.
*  And so you can actually mess around with the word order.
*  So probably Russian poetry is going to be quite different from English poetry
*  because the word order is much less constrained.
*  Yeah, there's a much more extensive culture of poetry throughout the history of
*  the last hundred years in Russia.
*  And I always wondered why that is.
*  But it seems that there is more flexibility in the way the language is used.
*  There's more you're more female language easier by altering the words, altering
*  the order of the words, messing with it.
*  Well, you can just mess with different things in each language.
*  And so in Russian, you have case markers, right, on the end, which are these
*  endings on the nouns which tell you how it connects.
*  Each noun connects to the verb. Right. We don't have that in English.
*  So when I say Mary kissed John, I don't know who the agent or the patient is,
*  except by the order of the words. Right.
*  In Russian, you actually have a marker on the end.
*  If you're using a Russian name and each of those names, you'll also say, is it,
*  you know, agent, it'll be the nominative, which is marking the subject or an
*  accusative will mark the object.
*  And you could put them in the reverse order.
*  You could put accusative first as you could put subject.
*  You could put the patient first and then the verb and then the the the subject.
*  And that would be a perfectly good Russian sentence.
*  And it would still mean Mary.
*  I could say John kissed Mary, meaning Mary kissed John.
*  As long as I use the case markers in the right way, you can't do that in English.
*  And so I love the terminology of agent and patient and yeah.
*  And the other ones you used.
*  Those are sort of linguistic terms, correct?
*  Those are those are for like kind of meaning.
*  Those are meaning and subject and object are generally used for position.
*  So subject is just like the thing that comes before the verb and the object is
*  one that comes after the verb. The agent is kind of like the thing doing it.
*  That's kind of what that means, right?
*  The subject is often the person doing the action, right? The thing.
*  So, yeah, OK, this is fascinating.
*  So how hard is it to form a tree in general?
*  Is there a is there a procedure to it?
*  Like if you look at different languages, is it supposed to be a very natural,
*  like is it automatable or is there some human genius involved in?
*  I think it's pretty automatable at this point.
*  People can figure out the words are they can figure out the morphemes,
*  which are the technically morphemes are the the minimal
*  meaning units within a language. OK.
*  And so when you say eats or drinks, it actually has two morphemes in English.
*  There's there's the there's the root, which is the verb.
*  And then there's some ending on it, which tells you, you know,
*  that's this third person, third person singular.
*  You say what morphemes are morphemes are just the minimal
*  meaning units within a language.
*  And a word is just kind of the things we put spaces between in English.
*  And they have a little bit more. They have the morphology as well.
*  They have the endings, this inflectional morphology on the endings on the roots.
*  They modify something about the word that adds additional meaning.
*  They tell you, yeah, yeah.
*  And so we have a little bit of that in English, very little.
*  You have much more in Russian, for instance.
*  And but we have a little bit in English.
*  And so we have a little on the on the nouns.
*  You can say it's either singular or plural.
*  And you can say same thing for for verbs, like simple past tense.
*  For example, like, you know, notice in English we say drinks, you know, he drinks.
*  But everyone else is I drink, you drink, we drink.
*  It's unmarked in a way.
*  And then but in the past tense, it's just drank for everyone.
*  There's no morphology at all for past tense.
*  If there is morphology, it's marking past tense, but it's kind of it's an irregular now.
*  So we don't even, you know, it drink to drink.
*  You know, it's not even a regular word.
*  So in most verbs, many verbs, there's an ed we kind of add.
*  So walk to walked.
*  We add that to say it's the past tense that I just happened to choose an irregular
*  because the high frequency word and the high frequency words
*  tend to have irregular in English for what's an irregular.
*  The irregular is just there isn't a rule.
*  So drink to drink is an it's an irregular drink.
*  Drank. OK, as opposed to walk, walked, talked, talked.
*  And there's a lot of irregular irregular in English.
*  There's a lot of irregular in English.
*  The frequent ones, the common words tend to be irregular.
*  The there's many, many more low frequency words.
*  And those tend to be those irregular ones.
*  The evolution of the irregular is fascinating.
*  It's essentially slang that's sticky because you're breaking the rules
*  and then everybody use it and doesn't follow the rules.
*  And they they say screw it to the rules.
*  It's fascinating. So you said it morphemes.
*  Lots of questions.
*  So morphology is what the study of morphemes?
*  Morphology is the is the connections between the morphemes onto the roots, the roots.
*  So in English, we mostly have suffixes.
*  We have endings on the words, not very much, but a little bit.
*  And as opposed to prefixes, some words,
*  depending on your language, can have, you know, mostly prefixes,
*  mostly suffixes or mostly or both.
*  And then even languages, several languages have things called infixes
*  where you have some kind of a general
*  form for the for the root.
*  And you put stuff in the middle.
*  You change the vowels.
*  That's fascinating. Yeah, it's fascinating.
*  So in general, there's what, two morphemes per word,
*  one or two or three.
*  Well, in English, it's it's one or two.
*  In English, it tends to be one or two.
*  There can be more, you know, in other languages, you know, language,
*  language like like Finnish, which has a very elaborate morphology.
*  There may be 10 morphemes on the end of a road.
*  OK, and so there may be there be millions of forms of a given word.
*  OK, OK, I'll ask the same question over and over.
*  But how does the just sometimes to understand
*  things like morphemes, it's nice to just ask the question,
*  how does these kinds of things evolve?
*  So you have a great book studying sort of the.
*  How how the cognitive processing, how language used for communication,
*  so the mathematical notion of how effective language is for communication,
*  what role that plays in the evolution of language, but just high level.
*  Like, how do we how does a language evolve with where English is two morphemes
*  or one or two morphemes per word and then Finnish has infinity per word?
*  So what how does that how does that happen?
*  Is it just people? That's a really good question.
*  Yeah, that's a very good question.
*  It's like, why do languages have more morphology versus less morphology?
*  And I don't think we know the answer to this.
*  I know I think there's just like a lot of good solutions
*  to the problem of communication.
*  So like I believe, as you hinted, that language is
*  an invented system by humans for communicating their ideas.
*  And I think it comes down to we label things we want to talk about.
*  Those are the morphemes and words.
*  Those are the things we want to talk about in the world.
*  And we invent those things.
*  And then we put them together in ways that are easy for us to convey, to process.
*  But that's like a naive view.
*  And I don't I mean, I think it's probably right. Right.
*  It's naive and probably right.
*  Well, that's the nurse. I don't know if it's naive.
*  I think it's simple, simple. Yeah.
*  I think naivety is naivety is an indication that's incorrect.
*  And somehow it's a trivial to too simple.
*  I think it could very well be correct.
*  But it's interesting how sticky it feels like two people got together.
*  It just feels like once you figure out certain aspects of a language,
*  they just become sticky and the tribe forms around that language.
*  Maybe the language, maybe the tribe forms first and then the language evolves.
*  And then you just kind of agree and you stick to whatever that is.
*  I mean, these are very interesting questions.
*  We don't know really about how words, even words, get invented very much about.
*  We don't really.
*  I mean, assuming they get invented, they we don't really know how that process
*  works and how these things evolve.
*  What we have is kind of a current picture, a current picture of a few
*  thousand languages, a few thousand instances.
*  We don't have any pictures of really how these things are evolving, really.
*  And then the evolution is massively confused by contact.
*  Right.
*  So as soon as one language group, one group runs into another.
*  We are smart.
*  Humans are smart and they take on whatever is useful in the other group.
*  And so any kind of contrast, which you're talking about, which I find useful,
*  I'm going to, I'm going to start using as well.
*  So I worked a little bit in, in, in specific areas of words, in, in number
*  words and in, in color words and color words that so we have in English, we have
*  around 11 words that everyone knows for colors and, and many more.
*  If you happen to be interested in color for some reason or other, if you're a
*  fashion designer or an artist or something, you may have many, many more words,
*  but we can see millions.
*  Like if you have normal color vision, normal trichromatric color vision, you
*  can see millions of distinctions in color.
*  So we don't have millions of words.
*  You know, the most efficient, no, the most detailed color vocabulary would have
*  over a million terms to distinguish all the different colors that we can see.
*  But of course we don't have that.
*  So it's somehow it's been, it's kind of useful for English to have, have evolved
*  in some way to, so there's 11 terms that people find useful to talk about, you
*  know, black, white, red, blue, green, yellow, purple, gray, pink, and I
*  probably missed something there.
*  Anyway, there's 11 that everyone knows.
*  And, and depending on your, and, but you go to different cultures, especially the
*  non industrialized cultures, and there'll be many fewer.
*  So some cultures will have only two, believe it or not, that the Danai in
*  Papua New Guinea have only two labels that the, that the group uses for color.
*  And those are roughly black and white.
*  They are very, very dark and very, very light, which are roughly black and white.
*  And you might think, oh, they're dividing the whole color space into, you know,
*  light and dark or something.
*  And that's not really true.
*  They mostly just only label the light, the black and the white things.
*  They just don't talk about the colors for the other ones.
*  And so, and, and then there's other groups.
*  I've worked with a group called the Chimani down in, in Bolivia, in South
*  America, and they have three words that everyone knows, but there's a few others
*  that are, that, that several people like, that many people know.
*  And so they have me, it's kind of depending on how you count between three
*  and seven words that the group knows.
*  Okay.
*  And, and again, they're, they're black and white.
*  Everyone knows those.
*  And red, red is, you know, like that tends to be the third word that everyone,
*  that cultures bring in.
*  If there's a word, it's always red, the third one.
*  And then after that, it's kind of all bets are off about what they bring in.
*  And so after that, they, they bring in a sort of a big blue green space,
*  grew, grew, they have one for that.
*  And then they have, and then, you know, different people have different words
*  that they'll use for other parts of the space.
*  And so anyway, it's probably related to what they want to talk and what they,
*  not what they, not what they see, cause they see the same colors as we see.
*  So it's not like they have, they don't, they have a, a weak, a low color palette
*  and the things they're looking at.
*  They're looking at a lot of beautiful scenery, okay.
*  A lot of different colored, uh, flowers and berries and things.
*  And, you know, and so there's lots of things of very bright colors, but they
*  just don't label the color in those cases.
*  And the reason probably we don't know this, but we think probably what's going
*  on here is that what you do, why you label something is you need to talk to
*  someone else about it and why do I need to talk about a color?
*  Well, if I have two things, which are identical, and I want you to give me the
*  one that's different and the only way it varies is color, then I invent a word,
*  which tells you, uh, you know, this is the one I want.
*  So I want the red sweater off the rack, not the, not the green sweater, right?
*  There's two.
*  And until those, those things will be identical because these are things we
*  made and they're dyed and there's nothing different about them.
*  And so in, in industrialized society, we have, you know, everything, everything
*  we've got is pretty much arbitrarily colored, uh, but if you go to a
*  non-industrialized group, that's not true.
*  And so they don't suddenly they're not interested in color.
*  If you bring bright colored things to them, they like them just like we like them.
*  Bright colors are great.
*  They're beautiful.
*  They are, but they just don't need to, nobody to talk about them.
*  They don't have.
*  So probably color words is a good example of how language evolves from sort of
*  function when you need to communicate the use of something, then you kind of
*  invent different variations and, uh, and basically you can imagine that the
*  evolution of a language has to do with what the early tribes doing, like what,
*  what they want it, what, what kind of problems are facing them and they're
*  quickly figuring out how to efficiently communicate, uh, the solution to those
*  problems, whether it's aesthetic or function, all that kind of stuff running
*  away from a mammoth or whatever.
*  Uh, but you know, it's, so I think what you're pointing to is that we don't have
*  data on the evolution of language because many languages are formed a long time
*  ago, so you don't get the chatter.
*  We have a little bit of like old English to modern English because there was a
*  writing system and we can see how, how old English looked.
*  So the word order changed for instance, in old English to middle English, to
*  modern English.
*  And so it, you know, we could see things like that, but most languages don't even
*  have a writing system.
*  So of the 7,000 only, you know, a small subset of those have a writing system.
*  And even if they have a writing system, they, it's not a very modern writing
*  system and so they don't have it.
*  So we just basically have for Mandarin, for Chinese, we have a lot of, a lot of
*  evidence from, from, for a long time and for English and not for much else, not
*  from in German a little bit, but not for a whole lot of like long-term language
*  evolution.
*  We don't have a lot.
*  We just have snapshots is what we've got of current languages.
*  Yeah.
*  You get an inkling of that from the rapid communication on certain platforms.
*  Like on Reddit, there's different communities and they'll come up with
*  different slang, usually from my perspective, German by a little bit of
*  humor or maybe mockery or whatever it is, you know, just talking shit in different
*  kinds of ways.
*  And, uh, you could see the evolution of language there because, um, I think a
*  lot of things on the internet, you don't want to be the boring mainstream.
*  So you like want to deviate from the proper way of talking.
*  And so you get a lot of deviation, like rapid deviation.
*  Then when communities collide, you get like, uh, just like you said, humans
*  adapt to it and you can see it through the lines of humor.
*  I mean, it's very difficult to study, but you can imagine like a hundred years
*  from now, well, if there's a new language born, for example, we'll get
*  really high resolution data.
*  I mean, English changing in English changes all the time.
*  All languages change all the time.
*  So, you know, as a famous, um, result, but the Queen's English.
*  So the Queen, if you look at the Queen's vowels, the Queen's English is supposed
*  to be, you know, originally the proper way for the talk was sort of defined by
*  whoever the Queen talked or the King, whoever was in charge.
*  And, uh, and so if you look at the, how her vowels changed, uh, from when she
*  first became Queen in 1952 or 53, when she was current, the first, I mean, that's
*  Queen Elizabeth who's gone, who died recently, of course, uh, until, you know,
*  50 years later, her vowels changed, her vowels shifted a lot.
*  And so that, you know, even in the sounds of British English in her, the way she
*  was talking was changing, the vowels were changing slightly, so that's just in the
*  sounds there's change.
*  I don't know what's, you know, we're, we're, I'm interested.
*  We're all interested in what's driving any of these changes.
*  The, the word order of English changed a lot over a thousand years, right?
*  So it used to look like German, you know, it looks, it used to be a verb,
*  final language with case marking and it shifted to a vermedial language,
*  a lot of contact.
*  So a lot of contact with French and it became a vermedial language with no
*  case marking and so it became this, you know, verb, verb initially thing.
*  So, and so that's evolving.
*  We have, it totally evolved.
*  And so it may very well, I mean, you know, it doesn't evolve maybe very much in 20
*  years is maybe what you're talking about, but over 50 and a hundred years, things
*  change a lot, I think we'll now have good data, which is great.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Can you talk to what is syntax and what is grammar?
*  So you wrote a book on syntax.
*  I did.
*  I think you were asking me before about what, you know, how do I figure out what
*  a dependency structure is?
*  I'd say the dependency structures aren't that hard to generally, I think it's a
*  lot of agreement of what they, of what they are for almost any sentence in most
*  languages.
*  I think people will agree on a lot of that.
*  There are other parameters in the mix such that some people think there's a more
*  complicated grammar than just a dependency structure.
*  And so, you know, like Noam Chomsky, he's the most famous linguist ever.
*  Uh, and he, he is famous for proposing a slightly more complicated syntax.
*  And so he, he invented phrase structure grammar.
*  So he's, um, well known for many, many things, but in the fifties and in early
*  sixties, like, but late fifties, he was basically figuring out what's called formal
*  language theory.
*  So, and he, uh, figured out sort of a framework for figuring out how complicated
*  language, you know, a certain type of language might be so-called phrase
*  structured grammars of language might be.
*  And so he, his, his idea was that maybe we can, we can think about the complexity
*  of a language by how complicated the rules are.
*  Okay.
*  And the rules will look like this.
*  They will have a left-hand side and we'll have a right, right-hand side.
*  Look at something on the left-hand side.
*  We'll expand to the thing on the right-hand side.
*  So we'll say, we'll start with an S which is like the root, which is an, a sentence.
*  Okay.
*  And then we're going to expand to things, uh, like a noun phrase and a verb phrase
*  is what he would say for instance.
*  Okay.
*  An S goes to an NP and a VP is a kind of a phrase structure rule.
*  And then, and we figure out what an NP is.
*  An NP is a, a, a determiner and a noun for instance.
*  And a verb, verb phrase is something else as a verb and another noun phrase
*  and another NP for instance.
*  Those are the rules of a very simple phrase structure.
*  Okay.
*  And so he, he proposed phrase structure grammar as a way to sort of cover human
*  languages, and then he actually figured out that, well, depending on the
*  formalization of those grammars, you might get more complicated or less complicated
*  languages.
*  And so you could, he could, he said, well, you, these are, these are things called,
*  you know, um, context-free languages, that rule that he thought, you know, human
*  languages tend to be what he calls context-free languages.
*  Um, and th but there are simpler languages, which are so-called regular
*  languages, and they have a more, a more constrained form to the rules of the, of
*  the phrase structure of these particular rules.
*  So he, he basically discovered and kind of invented ways to describe the language.
*  And those are phrase, those are phrase structure, a human language.
*  And he was mostly interested in English initially in his work in the fifties.
*  So quick questions around all this.
*  So formal language theory is the big field of just studying language formally.
*  Yes.
*  And it doesn't have to be human language there.
*  We can have a computer languages, any kind of system, which is generating a,
*  uh, um, some set of, um, expressions in a language.
*  And those could be like the, the, um, you know, the statements in a, in a
*  computer language, for example, so formally it could be that, or it could be human
*  language.
*  So technically you can study programming.
*  Yes.
*  And have been heavily studied using this formalism.
*  There, there's a big field of programming languages within the formal language.
*  Okay.
*  And then phrase structure grammar is this idea that you can break down
*  language into this S N P V P type of thing.
*  It's a particular formalism for describing language.
*  Okay.
*  So, and Chomsky was the first one he's on to figure that stuff out back in the
*  fifties and, and, but he, and, and that's equivalent actually, the context free
*  grammar is actually is kind of equivalent in the sense that it generates the same
*  sentences as a dependency grammar would, you know, as the, the dependency grammar
*  is a little simpler in some way.
*  You just have a root and it goes like, we don't have any of these, the rules are
*  implicit, I guess, in, in, we just have connections between words.
*  The free structure grammar is like kind of a different way to think about the,
*  the dependency grammar.
*  It's slightly more complicated, but it's kind of the same in some ways.
*  So to clarify dependency grammar is the framework under which you see language
*  and you make a case that this is a good way to describe language.
*  And, uh, no, no, Chomsky is watching.
*  This is very upset right now.
*  So that's, uh, just kidding.
*  But, uh, what's the difference between, uh, where's the place of disagreement,
*  um, between phrase structure, grammar and dependency grammar.
*  They're very close.
*  So free structure, grammar and dependency grammar aren't that,
*  aren't that far apart.
*  I, I like dependency grammar because it's more perspicuous.
*  It's more transparent about representing the connections between the words.
*  It's just a little harder to see in phrase structure grammar.
*  You know, the, the place where Chomsky sort of devolved or went off from, from,
*  from this is he also thought there was, um, something called movement.
*  Okay.
*  And so, and so, and that's where we disagree.
*  Okay.
*  That's the place where I would say we disagree.
*  And, and, and I mean, we'll, maybe we'll get into that later, but the idea is if
*  you want to, do you want me to explain that?
*  No, I would love to explain movement.
*  Okay.
*  So you're saying so many interesting things.
*  Okay.
*  So here's the movement is Chomsky basically sees English and he says, okay, I
*  said, um, you know, we had that sentence sentence early, like it was like two
*  dogs entered the room.
*  It's changed a little bit, say two dogs will enter the room.
*  And he notices that, Hey, English, if I want to make a question, a yes, no
*  question from that same sentence, I say, instead of two dogs will enter the room,
*  I say, will two dogs enter the room?
*  Okay.
*  There's a different way to say the same idea.
*  And it's like, well, the auxiliary verb, that will thing it's at the front as
*  opposed to in the middle.
*  Okay.
*  And so, and he looked, you know, if you look at English, you see that that's true
*  for all those modal verbs and for other kinds of auxiliary verbs in English, you
*  always do that.
*  You always put an auxiliary verb at the front.
*  And, and what he's, when he saw that, so, you know, if I say, um, I can win this
*  bet, can I win this bet?
*  Right.
*  So I move a can to the front.
*  So actually that's a theory.
*  I just gave you a theory there.
*  I, he, he talks about it as movement.
*  That word in the Dicke thing is the declarative is the root is the sort of
*  default way to think about the sentence and you move the auxiliary verb to the
*  front, that's a movement theory.
*  Okay.
*  And he just thought that was just so obvious that it must be true that, that
*  there's nothing more to say about that, that this is how auxiliary verbs work in
*  English.
*  There's a movement rule such that you're move like to get from the declarative to
*  the interrogative, you're moving the auxiliary to the front.
*  And it's a little more complicated as soon as you go to simple, simple present
*  and simple past, because, you know, if I say, you know, John slept, you have to
*  say, did John sleep, not slept John.
*  Right.
*  And so you have to somehow get an auxiliary verb and I guess, underlyingly
*  it's like slept is it's a little more complicated than that, but his, that's
*  his idea, there's a movement.
*  Okay.
*  And so a different way to think about that, that isn't, I mean, then he ended
*  up showing later, so he proposed this theory of grammar, which has movement.
*  There's other places where he thought there's movement, not just auxiliary
*  verbs, but things like the passive in English and things like, um, uh, questions,
*  WH questions, a bunch of places where he thought there's also movement going on.
*  And, and, and each, each one of those, he thinks there's words, well, phrases
*  and words are moving around from one structure to another, which he called
*  deep structure to surface structure.
*  I mean, there's like two different structures in his, in his theory.
*  Okay.
*  Um, there's a different way to think about this, um, which is there's no
*  movement at all, there's a lexical copying rule such that the word will or
*  the word can these auxiliary verbs, they just have two forms and, and, and one
*  of them is the declarative and one of them is interrogative and you basically
*  have the declarative one and, oh, I form the interrogative or I can form one from
*  the other, it doesn't matter which direction you go and, and I just have a
*  new entry, which has the same meaning, which has a slightly different argument
*  structure, argument structure is just a fancy word for the ordering of the words.
*  And so if I say, you know, it was, um, the, the dogs, two dogs can or will
*  enter the room, the, the, there's two forms of will, one is will declarative.
*  And then, okay, I've got my subject to the left.
*  It comes before me and the verb comes after me in that one.
*  And then the will interrogative it's like, oh, I go first interrogative will is
*  first, and then I have the subject immediately after, and then the verb after
*  that, and so you just, you can just generate from one of those words, another
*  word with a slightly different argument structure with different ordering.
*  And these are just lexical copies.
*  They're just, they're not necessarily moving for one, there's no movement.
*  There's a romantic notion that you have like one main way to use a word and then
*  you could move it around, which is essentially what movement is implying.
*  But that's, that's the lexical copying is similar.
*  So then you, so then we, we do lexical copying for that same idea that maybe
*  the declarative is the source and then we can copy it.
*  And so an advantage, uh, for, there's multiple advantages of the lexical
*  copying story, it's not my story.
*  This is like, um, uh, Ivan saw linguists, a bunch of linguists have been proposing
*  these stories as well, you know, in tandem with the movement story.
*  Okay.
*  You know, he's, he's Ivan saw died a while ago, but he was a, one of the
*  proponents of the non-movement with lexical copying story.
*  And so that is that, um, a great advantage is well, Chomsky really famously in 1971
*  showed that the movement story leads to learnability problems.
*  It leads, it leads to problems for, for how language is learned.
*  It's really, really hard to figure out what the underlying structure of a
*  language is if you have both phrase structure and movement, it's like really
*  hard to figure out what came from what there's like a lot of possibilities there.
*  If you don't have that problem, learning, the learning problem gets a lot easier.
*  Just say there's lexical copies.
*  And when we say the learning problem, do you mean like humans learning a new language?
*  Yeah, just learning English.
*  So baby is lying around, listening to the crib, listening to me talk and, you
*  know, how are they learning English or, or, you know, maybe it's a two year old
*  who's learning, you know, interrogatives and stuff or one, you know, they're,
*  you know, how are they doing that?
*  Are they doing it from like, are they figuring out or like, no.
*  So Chomsky said it's impossible to figure it out.
*  Actually.
*  He said it's actually impossible, not, not hard, but impossible.
*  And therefore that's what that, that's where universal grammar comes from is
*  that it has to be built in.
*  And so what they're learning is that there's some built in movement is built
*  in in his story is absolutely part of your language module.
*  And, and then you are, you're just setting parameters.
*  You're, you're said, depending on English is just sort of a variant of the
*  universal grammar and you're figuring out, Oh, which orders does English do these
*  things?
*  That's the, the non movement story doesn't have this.
*  It's like much more bottom up.
*  You're, you're learning rules.
*  You're learning rules one by one and Oh, there's this, this word is connected to
*  that word.
*  A great advantage.
*  Another advantage is learnable.
*  Another advantage of it is that it predicts that not all auxiliaries might
*  move like it, it might depend on the word, depending on whether you, and that
*  turns out to be true.
*  So there's words that, um, that don't really work as auxiliary.
*  You know, they work in declarative and not in an interrogative.
*  So I can say, um, I'll give you the opposite first.
*  I can say, aren't I invited to the party?
*  Okay.
*  And that's an, that's an interrogative form, but it's not from, I aren't
*  invited to the party.
*  There is no, I aren't right.
*  So that's dec, that's interrogative only.
*  And then we also have forms like, um, ought, uh, I, I ought to do this.
*  And I guess some British old British people can say, exactly.
*  It doesn't sound right.
*  Does it?
*  For me, it sounds ridiculous.
*  I don't even think ought is great, but I mean, I totally recognize I ought to
*  I, it's not too bad.
*  Actually.
*  I can say ought to do this.
*  I, that sounds pretty good.
*  Yeah.
*  If I'm trying to sound sophisticated, maybe.
*  I don't know.
*  It just sounds completely out.
*  I, yeah.
*  Anyway, it's, it's, so there are variants here.
*  Uh, and a lot of these words just work in one versus the other.
*  And, and that's like fine under the lexical copying story.
*  It's like, well, you just learn the usage, whatever the usage is, is what you,
*  is what you do with this, with, with you, with this word.
*  But, um, it doesn't, it's a little bit harder in the movement story, the
*  movement story, like that's an advantage.
*  I think of lexical copying and in all these different places, there's, there's
*  all these usage variants, which make the movement story, um, a little bit harder.
*  Work.
*  So one of the main divisions here is the movement story versus the lexical copy
*  story that has to do about the auxiliary words and so on, but if you rewind to
*  the phrase structure grammar versus dependency grammar, those are equivalent
*  in some sense in that for any dependency grammar, I can generate a dependence,
*  a phrase structure grammar, which generates exactly the same sentences.
*  I just, I just like the dependency grammar, uh, formalism because it makes
*  something really salient, which is the dependent, the, the lengths of dependencies
*  between words, which isn't so obvious in the, in the phrase structure, in the phrase
*  structure, it's just kind of hard to see it's in there.
*  It's just very, very, it's opaque.
*  Uh, technically I think phrase structure grammar is mappable to dependency grammar
*  and vice versa and vice versa.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's like these like little labels S and PVP.
*  Yeah.
*  For a particular dependency grammar, you can make a phrase structure
*  grammar, which generates exactly those same sentences and vice versa.
*  But there are many phrase structure grammars, which you can't really
*  make a dependency grammar.
*  I mean, there, you can do a lot more in a phrase structure grammar, but you
*  get many more of these extra nodes.
*  Basically you can have more structure in there.
*  Uh, and some people like that and maybe there's value to that.
*  I, I don't like it.
*  Well, for you, so we should clarify.
*  So, so dependency grammar is just, uh, well, one word depends on only one
*  other word and you form these trees.
*  And that makes, it really puts priority on those dependencies, just like as a,
*  as a tree that you can then measure the distance of the dependency from one word
*  to the other, they can then map to the cognitive processing of the, of the
*  sentences, how well, how easy is to understand and all that kind of stuff.
*  So it just puts the focus on just like the mathematical, um, uh, distance
*  of dependence between words.
*  So like, it's just a different focus.
*  Absolutely.
*  Just continue on a thread of Chomsky.
*  Cause it's really interesting.
*  Cause it, as you're discussing disagreement to the degree there's
*  disagreement, you're also telling the history of the study of language,
*  which is really awesome.
*  So you mentioned context free versus regular.
*  Does that distinction come into play for dependency grammars?
*  No, not at all.
*  I mean, regular, regular languages are too simple for human languages.
*  They, they are, uh, they, it's a part of the hierarchy, but human languages are
*  in, in the phrase structure world are definite.
*  They, they're at least context free, maybe a little bit more.
*  A little bit harder than that.
*  But, uh, so there's something called context sensitive as well, where you can
*  have like, this is just the formal language description in a context free
*  grammar, you have one, this is like a bunch of like formal language theory
*  we're doing here, but I love it.
*  Okay.
*  So you have, you have a left hand side category and you're expanding
*  to anything on the right is, is a, uh, that's a context free.
*  So like the idea is that that category on the left expands in independent of
*  context to those things, whatever they're on the right.
*  It doesn't matter what.
*  And a context sensitive says, okay, I actually have more than one thing on the
*  left.
*  I can tell you only in this context, you know, I have, maybe you have like a left
*  and a right context or just a left context or a right context, I have two or more
*  stuff on the left tells you how to expand that, those things in that way.
*  Okay.
*  So it's context sensitive.
*  A regular language is just more constrained.
*  And so it, it doesn't allow anything on the right.
*  It allows very, it allows, basically it's a one very complicated rule is kind of
*  what a regular language is.
*  And so it doesn't have any, um, let's just say long distance dependencies.
*  It doesn't allow recursion for instance.
*  There's no recursion.
*  Yeah.
*  Recursion is where you, which is human languages have recursion.
*  They have embedding and you can't, well, it doesn't allow center embedded
*  recursion, which human languages have, which is what center embedded
*  recursion within a sentence, within a sentence, within a sentence.
*  So here we're going to get to that, but I know the formal language stuff is a
*  little aside, Chomsky wasn't proposing it for human languages, even he was just
*  pointing out that human languages are context free.
*  And then he was most in for, for human, because that was kind of stuff we did
*  for formal languages and what he was most interested in was human language.
*  And that's like the movement is where we, we, we, where, where he sort of set off
*  in on the, I would say a very interesting, but wrong foot.
*  It was kind of interesting.
*  It's a very, I agree.
*  It's kind of a very interesting history.
*  So there's this, so he proposed this multiple theories in 57 and then 65 there.
*  They all have this framework though, was phrase structure plus movement,
*  different versions of the, of the phrase structure and the movement in the 57.
*  These are the most famous original bits of Chomsky's work.
*  And then 71 is when he figured out that those lead to learning problems, that,
*  that there's cases where a kid could never figure out which rule, um,
*  which set of rules was intended.
*  And, and so, and then he said, well, that means it's innate.
*  It's kind of interesting.
*  He just really thought the movement was just so obviously true that he
*  couldn't, he didn't even entertain giving it up.
*  It's just obvious that that's obviously right.
*  And, um, it was later where people figured out that there's all these like subtle
*  ways in which things would, which look like generalizations, aren't generalizations.
*  And they, you know, across the category, they're, they're word specific and they
*  have, and they, they kind of work, but they don't work across various other
*  words in the category.
*  And so it's easier to just think of these things as lexical copies.
*  And I think he was very obsessed.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm guessing that he, he just, he really wanted this story to be simple in some
*  sense and language is a little more complicated in some sense, you know, he
*  didn't like words, uh, he never talks about words.
*  He likes to talk about combinations of words and words are, you know, look up a
*  dictionary, there's 50 senses for a common word, right?
*  The word take will have 30 or 40 senses in it.
*  So, uh, there'll be many different senses for common words.
*  And he just doesn't think about that.
*  I, it's, or it doesn't think that's language.
*  I think he doesn't think that's language.
*  He thinks that words are distinct from combinations of words.
*  I think they're the same.
*  If you look at my brain in the scanner while I'm listening to a language I
*  understand and you compare, I can localize my language network in a few
*  minutes in like 15 minutes.
*  And what you do is I listen to a language I know, I listen to, you know, maybe
*  some language I don't know, or I listened to muffled speech, or I read sentences
*  that I read non words, like I can do anything like this, anything that's sort
*  of really like English and anything that's not very like English, so I've got
*  a something like it and not, and I got a control and, and the voxels, which is
*  just, you know, the, um, 3d pixels in my, in my brain that are responding most.
*  Are, are, is a language area and that's this left lateralized, um, area in my head.
*  And, and wherever I look in that network, if you look for the combinations versus
*  the words, it's there, it's, it's, it's the same.
*  And so it's like hard to find, there are no areas that we know.
*  I mean, that's, it's a little overstated right now at this, at this point, the
*  technology isn't great.
*  It's not bad, but we have the best, the best way to figure out what's going
*  on in my brain when I'm listening or reading language is to use fMRI,
*  functional magnetic resonance imaging.
*  And that's a very good localization method.
*  So I can figure out where exactly these signals are coming from pretty, you
*  know, down to, you know, millimeters, you know, cubic millimeters or smaller.
*  Okay.
*  Very small.
*  We can figure those out very well.
*  The problem is the, when, okay.
*  Uh, it's, it's measuring, um, oxygen.
*  Okay.
*  And oxygen takes a little while to get to those cells.
*  And so it takes on the order of seconds.
*  So I talk fast.
*  I probably listened fast and I can probably understand things really fast.
*  So a lot of stuff happens in two seconds.
*  And so to say that we know what's going on, that the words right now in that
*  network, our best guess is that whole network is doing something similar, but
*  maybe different parts of that network are doing different things and, and
*  that's probably the case.
*  We just don't have very good methods to figure that out right at this moment.
*  And so.
*  Since we're kind of talking about the history of the study of language, what
*  other interesting disagreements and you're both at MIT or war for a long time.
*  What kind of interesting disagreements there, attention of ideas are there
*  between you and no Chomsky.
*  And we should say that no was in the linguistics department and you're, uh,
*  I guess for a time we're affiliated there, but primarily a brain and
*  cognitive science department, which is another way of studying language.
*  And you've been talking about fMRI.
*  So like what is there something else interesting to bring to the surface about
*  the disagreement between the two of you or other people in the,
*  yeah, I mean, I've been at MIT for 31 years since 1993 and he Chomsky's
*  been there much longer.
*  So I met him.
*  I knew him.
*  I met when I first got there, I guess.
*  And I, and we would interact every now and then I'd say that, so I tell
*  you, our biggest difference is our methods.
*  And so, um, I, that's the biggest difference between me and no, uh, is that
*  I gather data from people, I, uh, do experiments with people and I gather
*  corpus data, whatever, whatever corpus data is available.
*  And we do quantitative methods to evaluate any kind of hypothesis we have.
*  He just doesn't do that.
*  So, you know, you, you know, he has never once been associated with any
*  experiment or corpus work ever.
*  And so it's all thought experiments.
*  It's his own intuitions.
*  So I just don't think that's the way to do things.
*  Um, that's a, that's a, you know, cross the street there across the street from
*  us kind of difference between brain and cog Psy and linguistics.
*  I mean, not all linguists, some of the linguists, depending on what you do, more
*  speech oriented, they do more quantitative stuff, but in the, in the meaning, um,
*  words and well, it's combinations of words, syntax, semantics, they tend not to
*  do experiments and, uh, and corpus analysis.
*  So I'm only linguistic size probably.
*  Well, but the method is a symptom of a bigger approach, which is sort of a
*  psychology philosophy side on no, I mean, for you, it's more sort of data driven.
*  So they're almost like mathematical approach.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I'm a psychologist, so I would say we're in psychology.
*  You know, I'm, I'm a brain cognitive sciences is MIT's old psychology department.
*  It was a psychology private up until 1985 and that became the brain
*  and cognitive science department.
*  And so I, I mean, my training isn't psycho.
*  I mean, my training is math and computer science, but I'm a psychologist.
*  I mean, I'm, I mean, I don't know what I am.
*  So data driven psychologists.
*  You are what I am, but I'm happy to be called a linguist.
*  I'm happy to be called a computer scientist.
*  I'm happy to be called a psychologist.
*  But in the actual like how that manifests itself outside of the methodology is
*  like these differences, these subtle differences about the movement story
*  versus the lexical copy story.
*  Yeah, those are theories, right?
*  So the theory is like the theories are, but I think the, the reason we
*  differ in part is because of how we evaluate the theories.
*  And so I evaluate theories quantitatively and no doesn't.
*  Got it.
*  Okay.
*  Well, let's explore the theories that you explore in your book.
*  Let's return to this dependency grammar framework of looking at language.
*  What's a good justification why the dependency grammar framework is a good way to explain language.
*  What's your intuition?
*  So the reason I like dependency grammar, as I've said before, is that it's very transparent about its representation of distance between words.
*  So it's like all it is, is you've got a bunch of words, you're connecting together to make a sentence.
*  And a really neat insight, which turns out to be true, is that the further apart the pair of words are that you're connecting, the harder it is to do the production, the harder it is to do the comprehension.
*  It's as harder to produce, hard to understand when the words are far apart.
*  When they're close together, it's easy to produce and it's easy to comprehend.
*  Let me give you an example.
*  Okay, so we have in any language, we have mostly local connections between words, but they're abstract.
*  The connections are abstracted between categories of words.
*  And so you can always make things further apart if you put your, if you add modification, for example, after a noun.
*  So a noun in English comes before verb, the subject noun comes before verb.
*  And then there's an object after, for example.
*  So I can say what I said before, you know, the dog entered the room or something like that.
*  So I can modify dog.
*  If I say something more about dog after it, then what I'm doing is indirectly, I'm lengthening the dependence, the dependence between dog and entered by adding more stuff to it.
*  So I just make it explicit here.
*  If I say the boy who the cat scratched cried, we're going to have a mean cat here.
*  And so what I've got here is the boy cried, it would be a very short, simple sentence.
*  And I just told you something about the boy and I told you it was the boy who the cat scratched.
*  Okay.
*  So the cry is connected to the boy.
*  The cry at the end is connected to the boy in the beginning.
*  Right.
*  And so I can do that.
*  I can say that that's a perfectly fine English sentence.
*  And I can say the cat, which the dog chased ran away or something.
*  Okay.
*  I can do that, but it's really, so it's really hard now.
*  I've got whatever I have here.
*  I have the boy who the cat now let's say I try to modify cat.
*  Okay.
*  The boy who the cat, which the dog chased scratched ran away.
*  Oh my God, that's hard.
*  Right.
*  I can, I'm sort of just working that through my head, how to produce and how to, and it's
*  really very just horrendous to understand.
*  It's not so bad.
*  At least I've got intonation there to sort of mark the boundaries and stuff, but it's,
*  that's really complicated.
*  That's sort of English in a way.
*  I mean, that follows the rules of English, but so what's interesting about that is, is
*  that what I'm doing is nesting dependencies here.
*  I'm putting one, I've got a subject connected to a verb there, and then I'm modifying that
*  with a clause, another clause, which happens to have a subject in a verb relation.
*  I'm trying to do that again on the second one.
*  And what that does is it lengthens out the dependence, multiple dependence actually get
*  lengthened out there.
*  The dependencies get, get longer, longer on the outside ones get long and even the
*  ones in between get kind of long.
*  And, and, and you just, so what's fascinating is that that's bad.
*  That's really horrendous in English, but that's horrendous in any language.
*  And so in, in no matter what language you look at, if you do just figure out some structure
*  where I'm going to have some modification following some head, which is connected to
*  some later head, and I do it again, it won't be good.
*  It guaranteed like 100%.
*  That will be uninterpretable in that language in the same way that was uninterpretable
*  in English.
*  Just clarify the distance of the dependencies is whenever the boy cried, this there's a
*  dependence between two words and then you counting the number of what morphemes between
*  them.
*  That's a good question.
*  I just say words, your words are morphemes between we don't know that.
*  Actually, that's a very good question.
*  What is the distance metric?
*  But let's just say it's words.
*  Sure.
*  So that, and you're saying the longer the distance is that dependence, the more no
*  matter the language except legalese, even legally, we'll talk about it.
*  Okay.
*  But that the people will be very upset that speak that language, not upset, but they'll
*  either not understand it.
*  There'll be like, this is their brain will be working in overtime.
*  Yeah, they will have a hard time either producing or comprehending it.
*  They might tell you that's not their language.
*  You know, it's sort of the language.
*  I mean, it's following that, like they'll agree with each of those pieces is part of
*  the language, but somehow that combination will be very, very difficult to produce and
*  understand.
*  Is that a chicken or the egg issue here?
*  So like is.
*  Well, I'm giving you an explanation.
*  Right.
*  So the, I mean, and then there's, I'm giving you two kinds of explanations.
*  I'm telling you that center embedding that's nesting.
*  Those are the same.
*  Those are synonyms for the same concept here.
*  And I'm the explanation for what those are always hard center embedding and nesting are
*  always hard.
*  And I gave you an explanation for why they might be hard, which is long distance
*  connections.
*  There's a, when you do center embedding, when you do nesting, you always have long
*  distance connections between the dependence.
*  You just, it's so that's not necessarily the right explanation.
*  It just happened.
*  I can go through reasons why that's probably a good explanation.
*  And it's not really just about one of them.
*  It is.
*  So probably it's a pair of them or something of these dependents that you get, get long
*  that drives you to like, be really confused in that case.
*  And so what the, the behavioral consequence there, I mean, we, this is kind of methods
*  like, how do we get at this?
*  You could try to do experiments to get people to produce these things.
*  They're going to have a hard time producing them.
*  You can try to do experiments to get them to understand them and get, you see how well
*  they understand them.
*  Can they understand them?
*  Uh, another method you can do is give people partial materials and ask them to complete
*  them, you know, those, those center embedded materials and they, they'll fail.
*  So I've done that.
*  I've done all these kinds of things.
*  So, so w w w what I mean?
*  It's so so central bedding, meaning like you take a normal sentence, like the boy
*  cried and they inject a bunch of crap in the middle that separates the boy and the
*  cried.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  That's central bedding and nesting is on top of that.
*  No, no, nesting is the same thing.
*  Center embedding.
*  Those are totally equivalent terms.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I sometimes use one and sometimes I got it.
*  They don't know anything different.
*  Got it.
*  And then, uh, what you're saying is there's a bunch of different kinds of experiments
*  you can do.
*  I mean, I like the understanding one is like have more embedding, more central
*  bedding is it easier or harder to understand, but then you have to measure the level of
*  understanding, I guess.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you could.
*  I mean, there's multiple ways to do that.
*  I mean, there's, there's the simplest ways.
*  Just ask people, how good is it?
*  So how natural is the sound?
*  That's a very blunt, but very good measure.
*  It's very, very reliable.
*  People will do the same thing.
*  And so it's like, I don't know what it means exactly, but it's doing something such
*  that we're measuring something about the confusion, the difficulty associated with
*  those.
*  And those, like those are giving you a signal.
*  That's why you can say them.
*  Okay.
*  What about the completion of this with the central bed?
*  So if you give them a partial sentence, say I say the book, which the author who, and
*  I ask you to now finish that off for me.
*  I mean, either say it, yeah, yeah, but you can just put it, say it's written in front
*  of you and you can just type in, have as much time as you want.
*  They will, even though that one's not too hard, right?
*  So if I say it's like the book, it's like, oh, the book, which the author who I met
*  wrote was good, you know, that's a very simple completion for that.
*  You know, if I give that completion on online somewhere to a, you know, a crowdsourcing
*  platform and ask people to complete that, they will miss off of a verb very regular,
*  like half a time, maybe two thirds of the time they'll say, they'll just leave off one
*  of those verb phrases, even with that simple.
*  So let's say the book, which the author who, and they'll say, was, they won't have
*  that you need three verbs, right?
*  I need three verbs or who I met wrote was good.
*  And they'll give me two.
*  They'll say who was, who was famous was good or something like that.
*  They'll just give me two and that they'll happen about 60% of the time.
*  So 40%, maybe 30, they'll do it correctly, correctly, meaning they'll do a three verb
*  phrase. I don't know what's correct or not.
*  You know, it's hard.
*  It's a hard task.
*  Yeah, I can actually, I'm struggling with it in my head.
*  Yeah, well, it's easier when you, when you stare at it.
*  If you look at a little easier than listening is pretty tough because you have to, because
*  there's no trace of it.
*  You have to remember the words that I'm saying, which is very hard.
*  Auditorially, we wouldn't do it this way.
*  We do it written.
*  You can look at it and figure it out.
*  It's easier in many dimensions in some ways, depending on the person.
*  It's easier to gather written data for, I mean, most sort of psycho, I work in
*  psycholinguistics, right?
*  Psychology of language and stuff.
*  And so a lot of our work is based on written stuff because it's so easy to gather
*  data from people doing written kinds of tasks.
*  Spoken tasks are just more complicated to administer and analyze because people do
*  weird things when they speak and it's harder to analyze what they do.
*  But they, um, they, they, they generally point to the same kinds of things.
*  So, okay.
*  So the, the universal theory of language by Ted Gibson is, uh, that you can form
*  dependency, you can form trees for me, sentences, and you can measure the distance
*  in some way of those dependencies.
*  And then you can say that, uh, most languages have very short dependencies.
*  All languages, all languages, all languages have short dependencies.
*  You can actually measure that.
*  So, uh, I, I, an ex student of mine, these guys at, um, university of
*  California Irvine, Richard Futrell did a thing of a bunch of years ago now where
*  he looked at all the languages we could look at, which was about 40 initially.
*  And now I think there's about 60 for which there are dependency structures.
*  Like so they're meaning that it's got to be like a big text, a bunch of texts,
*  which have been parsed for their dependency structures.
*  And there's about 60 of those, which have been parsed that way.
*  And for all of those, um, you can, what, what he did was take any, um, any
*  sentence in one of those languages and, uh, and you can do the dependency
*  structure and then start at the root.
*  We were, we're talking about dependency structures.
*  That's pretty easy now.
*  And, and he's trying to figure out what a control way you might say the
*  same sentence is in that language.
*  And so we just, just like, all right, there's a root and it has, let's say
*  as a sentence is, um, let's go back to, you know, two dogs entered the room.
*  And so entered is the root and entered has, um, two dependents.
*  It's got dogs and it has room.
*  Okay.
*  And what he does is like, let's scramble that order.
*  That's three things, the root and the, the head and the two dependents and
*  into some random order, just random, and then just do that for all the
*  dependence down the two for it.
*  So now look, do it for the, and whatever it was two in dogs and for, uh, in room.
*  And that's, you know, that's not a, it's a very short sentence when sentences
*  get longer and you have more dependence, there's more scrambling that's possible.
*  And when he found what, so that, so, so that that's one, you can figure out
*  one scrambling for that sentence.
*  It is like a hundred times for every sentence in every corporate, in every
*  one of these texts, every corpus.
*  And, and then he just compared the dependency lengths in those random
*  scramblings to what actually happened, what, what the English or the French or
*  the German was in the original language or Chinese or what all these like 80
*  lang, no 60 languages.
*  Okay.
*  And, and the dependency lengths are always shorter in the real language
*  compared to the, to these, this kind of a control.
*  And there's another, it's a little more rigid, his control.
*  So, um, the, the way I described it, you could have crossed dependencies, like
*  the, by, by scrambling that way, you could scramble in any way at all.
*  Um, languages don't do that.
*  They tend not to cross dependencies very much.
*  Like, so the dependency structure, they just, they tend to keep things, uh,
*  non-crossed and there's a, you know, there's a technical term, they call that
*  projective, but it's just non-crossed is all that is projective.
*  And so if you just constrain the, the scrambling so that it only gives you
*  projective sort of non, non-crossed is the same thing holds.
*  So it's, so the, you still, still human languages are much shorter, uh, than
*  these, this kind of a control.
*  So there's like, what it means is that, that, that we're in every language,
*  we're trying to put things close.
*  And relative to this kind of a control, like there, it doesn't matter about the
*  word order, some of these are verb final.
*  Some of them use a verb media like English and some are even verb initial.
*  There are a few languages of the world, which have VSO world order, word order,
*  verb subject, object languages.
*  Haven't talked about those.
*  It's like 10% of the, and even, even in those languages, it's still short
*  dependencies, short dependencies is rules.
*  Okay.
*  So how, what, what are some possible explanations for that?
*  Uh, for why, why languages have evolved that way.
*  So that, that's one of the, um, I suppose disagreements you might have with Chomsky.
*  So you consider the evolution of language in, um, in terms of information theory.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, for you, the purpose of language is ease of communication, right?
*  And process.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  So, I mean, the, the story here is just about communication.
*  It is just about production, really.
*  It's about ease of production is the story.
*  When you say production, can you, can you, oh, I just mean
*  each of language productions.
*  Easier for me to say things when the, when I'm doing, whenever I'm talking
*  to you is somehow I'm formulating some idea in my head and I'm putting these
*  words together and it's easier for me to do that, uh, to put, to say something
*  where the words are close, closely connected and in dependency, as opposed
*  to separated, like by putting something in between and over and over again.
*  I, it's just hard for me to keep that in my head.
*  Like that's, that's the whole story.
*  Like the story is basically, it's like the dependency grammar sort of gives that to
*  you, like, just like long, long as bad short as good, it's like easier to keep
*  in mind because you have to keep it in mind for probably for production, probably,
*  you know, probably matters in comprehension as well.
*  Like also matters in comprehension.
*  It's on both sides of it.
*  The production and the.
*  But I would guess it's probably evolved for production.
*  Like it's about producing.
*  It's what's easier for me to say that ends up being easier for you also.
*  I, that's a very hard to disentangle this idea of who is it for?
*  Is it for me, the speaker, or is it for you, the listener?
*  I mean, part of my language is for you.
*  Like the way I talk to you is going to be different from how I talk to different
*  people, I'm definitely angling what I'm saying to who I'm saying, right?
*  It's not like I'm just talking the same way to every single person.
*  And so I am sensitive to my audience, but how does that, does that, you know, work
*  itself out in the, in the dependency link differences?
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe that's about just the words, that part, you know, which words I select.
*  My initial intuition is that you optimize language for the audience.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's both just kind of like messing with my head a little bit to say that
*  some of the optimization might be, it may be the primary objective of the
*  optimization might be the ease of production.
*  We have different senses.
*  I guess I'm, I'm like very selfish.
*  And you're like, I think it's like, it's all about me.
*  I'm like, I'm just doing this easiest for me.
*  I don't want to, I'm like, I'll, I mean, but I have to, of course, choose the
*  words that I think you're going to know.
*  I'm not going to choose words.
*  You don't know.
*  In fact, I'm going to fix that when I, you know, so there it's about, but, but
*  maybe for, for the syntax for the combinations, it's just about me.
*  I feel like it's, I don't know though.
*  It's very, but the purpose of communication is to be understood, is to
*  convince others and so on.
*  So like the selfish thing is to be understood.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, it's, it's a little circular there too.
*  Then.
*  Okay.
*  Right.
*  I mean, like the ease of production helps me be understood then.
*  I don't think it's circular.
*  So I think the primary, I think the primary objective is to be understood,
*  is about the listener.
*  Cause otherwise the, if you're optimizing for the ease of production, then you're,
*  you're not going to have any of the interesting complexity of language.
*  Like you're trying to like,
*  well, let's control for what it is.
*  I want to say.
*  Like I, I'm saying let's control for the thing, the, the message control for the
*  message.
*  I want to tell you needs to be understood.
*  That's the goal.
*  Oh, but that's the meaning.
*  So I'm still talking about the form, just the form of the meaning.
*  How do I frame the form of the meaning is all I'm talking about.
*  You're talking about a harder thing.
*  I think it's like, how am I like trying to change the, I like con let's keep the
*  meaning constant, like which you got it.
*  If you keep the meaning constant, how can I phrase whatever it is I need to say?
*  Like I get to pick the right words and I'm going to pick the order so that it's,
*  so it's easy for me.
*  Yeah.
*  That's, that's, that's, that's what I think is probably like, I think I'm still
*  tying meaning and form together in my head, but you're saying if you keep the
*  meaning of what you're saying, constant, what the optimization, yeah, it could be
*  the primary objective of that optimization is the, for production.
*  That's interesting.
*  I'm struggling to keep constant.
*  The meaning is just so, I mean, I'm,
*  I'm such a human, right?
*  So for me, the form without having introspected on this, the form and the
*  meaning are tied together like deeply because I'm a human, like for me, when
*  I'm speaking, cause I haven't thought about language, like in a rigorous way
*  about the form of language,
*  but look for any event, there's, there's an unbounded, I don't, I don't want to
*  see infinite, but sort of unbounded ways of that.
*  I might communicate that same event.
*  This two dogs entered a room.
*  I can say in many, many different ways I can say, Hey, there's two dogs.
*  They entered the room.
*  Hey, the room was entered by something.
*  The thing that was entered was two dogs.
*  I mean, there's, I mean, it's kind of awkward and weird and stuff, but those
*  are all similar messages with different forms, different ways I might frame.
*  And of course I use the same words there all the time.
*  I could have referred to the dogs as, you know, a Dalmatian and a poodle or
*  something, you know, I, I could have been more specific or less specific about
*  what they are and I could have said, been more abstract about, about, but the
*  number there's like, so I, like, I'm trying to keep the meaning, which is
*  this event constant, and then how am I going to describe that to get that to
*  you? It kind of depends on what you need to know, right.
*  And what I think you need to know.
*  But I'm like trying to let's get control for all that stuff and not, and, and
*  then I'm just like choosing, but I'm doing something simpler than you're doing,
*  which is just forms.
*  Yes.
*  Just words to use, specifying the species, the, the breed of dog and whether
*  they're cute or not is changing the meaning.
*  That might be.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That would be changed.
*  Oh, that would be changed the meaning for sure.
*  Right.
*  So you're just, yeah.
*  Well, yeah, yeah, that's changing the meaning, but say, even if we keep that
*  constant, we can still talk about what's easier, hard for me, right.
*  The listener and the, and the, right.
*  Which phrase structures I use, which combinations, which, you know,
*  this is so fascinating and just like a, a really powerful window into human
*  language, but I wonder still throughout this, how vast the gap between meaning
*  and form, I just, I just have this like, maybe romanticized notion that they're
*  close together, that they evolve close to like hand in hand, that you can't just
*  simply optimize for one without the other being in the room with us.
*  Like it's a, well, it's kind of like an iceberg form is the tip of the iceberg.
*  And the rest, the, the meaning is the iceberg, but you can't like separate.
*  But I think that's why these large language models are so successful is
*  because they're good at form and form isn't that hard in some sense.
*  And meaning is tough still.
*  And that's why they're not there.
*  You know, they don't understand what they're doing.
*  We're going to talk about that later.
*  Maybe, but like we can distinguish in our forget about large language models,
*  humans, we're maybe you'll talk about that later too, is like the difference
*  between language, which is a communication system and thinking, which is meaning.
*  So language is a communication system for the meaning.
*  It's not the meaning.
*  And so that's why I mean that, and there's a lot of interesting evidence
*  we can talk about relevant, relevant to that.
*  Well, I mean, that's a really interesting question.
*  What is the different, what is the difference between, uh, language written,
*  communicated versus thought?
*  What to use the difference between them?
*  Well, you or anyone has to think of a task, which they think is, is a good
*  thinking task and there's lots and lots of tasks, which should be good thinking
*  tasks and whatever those tasks are, let's say it's, you know, playing chess
*  or that's a good thinking task or playing some game, we're doing some complex
*  puzzles, uh, maybe, maybe remembering some digits that's thinking, remembering
*  some, a lot of different tasks we might think, maybe just listening to music
*  is thinking, or there's a lot of different tasks we might think of as thinking.
*  There's this woman in my department at Fedorenko and she's done a lot of work
*  at, on, on this question about what's the connection between language and thought.
*  And, and so she uses, I was referring earlier to MRI, fMRI, that's her primary
*  method, and so she is been really fascinated by this question about whether,
*  what language is.
*  Okay.
*  And so as I mentioned earlier, you can localize my language area, your language
*  area in a few minutes, okay.
*  Like 15 minutes, I can listen to language, listen to non-language or backward
*  speech or something, and we'll find areas left lateralized network in my head,
*  which is specially, which is very sensitive to language as opposed to
*  whatever that control was.
*  Okay.
*  Can you specify what you mean by language?
*  Like communicating language?
*  Like what is like just sentences, you know, I'm listening to English of any
*  kind story or I can read sentences, anything at all that I understand.
*  If I understand it, then it'll activate my language network.
*  So right now my language network is going like crazy when I'm talking and when
*  I'm listening to you, because we're both, we're communicating.
*  And that's pretty stable.
*  Yeah.
*  It's incredibly stable.
*  So I've, I happen to be married to this woman at Fedorenko.
*  And so I've been scanned by her over and over and over since 2007 or six or
*  something.
*  And so my language network is exactly the same, you know, like a month ago as
*  it was back in 2007.
*  It's amazingly stable.
*  It's astounding.
*  And with it, it's, it's a really fundamentally cool thing.
*  And so my language network is, it's like my face.
*  Okay.
*  It's not changing much over time inside my head.
*  Can I ask a quick question?
*  Sorry.
*  As a small tangent, at which point in the, as you grow up from baby to adult,
*  does it stabilize?
*  We don't know.
*  Like that's a, that's a very hard question.
*  They're working on that right now because of the problem scanning little kids,
*  like doing the, trying to do local, trying to do the localization on little children
*  in this scanner, or you're lying in the fMRI scan.
*  That's the best way to figure out where something's going on inside our brains.
*  And the scanner is loud and you're in this tiny little area, you're claustrophobic
*  and it doesn't bother me at all.
*  I can go to sleep in there, but some people are bothered by it and little kids
*  don't really like it and they don't like to lie still.
*  And you have to be really still because you can move around.
*  That's that messes up the coordinates of where, where everything is.
*  And so, you know, try to get, you know, your question is how and when our language
*  developing, you know, how, when, how does this left lateralized system come to play?
*  Where's it, you know, and it's really hard to get a two year old to do this task,
*  but you can maybe where they're starting to get three and four and five year olds
*  to do this task for short periods.
*  And it looks like it's there pretty early.
*  So clearly when you lead up to you, like a baby's first words before that, there's a
*  lot of fascinating turmoil going on about like figuring out like, what are,
*  what are these people saying?
*  Yeah.
*  And you're trying to like make sense.
*  How does that connect to the world and all that kind of stuff?
*  Yeah, that might be just fascinating development that's happening there.
*  That's hard to introspect.
*  But anyway, you were back to the scanner and I can find my network in 15 minutes.
*  And now we can ask, we can ask, find my network, find yours, find, you know, 20
*  other people do this task and we can do some other tasks.
*  Anything else you think is thinking of some other thing.
*  I can do a spatial memory task.
*  I can do a music perception task.
*  I can do programming task if I program.
*  Okay.
*  I can do where I can like understand computer programs.
*  And none of those tasks will tap the language network at all.
*  Like at all.
*  There's no overlap.
*  They do.
*  They're, they're highly activated in other parts of the brain.
*  There's a, there's a bilateral network, which I think she tends to call the
*  multiple demands network, which does anything kind of hard and anything that's
*  kind of difficult in some ways will activate that multiple demands network.
*  I mean, music will be in some music area, you know, there's music specific kinds
*  of areas and so, uh, but there, but, but none of them are activating the language
*  area at all, unless there's words, like, so if you have music and there's a song
*  and you can hear the words and then, and then you get the language area.
*  We're talking about speaking and listening, but are, or are we also
*  talking about reading?
*  This is all comprehension of any kind.
*  And so, so that is fascinating.
*  So what this, this, this network doesn't make any difference
*  if it's written or spoken.
*  So the, the, the language, the thing that she calls Federico calls the
*  L the language network is this high level language.
*  So it's not about the spoken, the spoken language, and it's not
*  about the written language is about either one of them.
*  And so we're, so when you do speech, you're sort of listening, you either,
*  you're listening to speech and you, you know, subtract away some language
*  you don't understand and see where it's in, or you subtract away back, backward
*  speech, which sounds like speech, but it isn't.
*  And, and then, so you, you take away the sound part altogether.
*  And so, and then if you do written, you get exactly the same network.
*  So for just reading the language versus reading sort of nonsense words
*  or something like that, you'll find exactly the same network.
*  And so it says about high level, um, comprehension of language.
*  Yeah.
*  In this case, and the same thing happens.
*  Production is a little harder to run the scanner, but the same
*  thing happens in production.
*  You get the same network.
*  So production is a little harder, right?
*  You have to figure out how do you run a task in the network, such that you're
*  doing some kind of production and I can't remember what they've done.
*  A bunch of different kinds of tasks there where you get people to produce things.
*  Yeah.
*  Figure out how to produce and the same network goes on there.
*  Exactly the same place.
*  And so, wait, wait.
*  So if you read random words, yeah, things like, um, like gibberish.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Lewis Carroll's it was brilliant.
*  Jabberwocky, right?
*  They call that Jabberwocky speech.
*  Or the network doesn't get activated.
*  Not as much.
*  There are words in there.
*  Cause it's still, there's function words and stuff.
*  So it's lower activation.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's like basically the more language like it is, the higher it goes in the
*  language network and that network is there from when you speak from, as soon as
*  you learn language and, and, and it's, it's there.
*  Like you speak multiple languages, the same network is going for your multiple
*  languages.
*  So you speak English, you speak Russian, then the both of them are hitting that
*  same network if you, if you're fluent in those languages, programming, not at all.
*  Isn't that amazing?
*  Even if you're a really good programmer, that is not a human language.
*  It's just not conveying the same information.
*  And so it is not in the language network.
*  And so that has mind blowing as I think that's pretty cool.
*  That's weird.
*  It's amazing.
*  That's so that's like one set of data.
*  This is hers, like shows that what you might think is thinking is not language.
*  Language is just the seek, just, just this conventionalized system that we've worked
*  out in, in human languages.
*  Oh, another fascinating little bit to bit is that even if they're these constructed
*  languages like Klingon or, um, I don't know the languages from game of Thrones.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I don't remember those languages.
*  Maybe a lot of people offended right now.
*  There's people that speak those languages.
*  They really speak those languages because the people that wrote the languages for
*  the shows, um, they did an amazing job of constructing something like a human
*  language and those that that lights up the language area.
*  That's like, because they can speak, you know, pretty much arbitrary thoughts in
*  a human language.
*  It's not a, it's a constructed human language.
*  And it probably it's related to human languages because the people that were
*  constructing them was we're making them like human languages in various ways, but
*  it also activates the same network, which is pretty, pretty cool.
*  Anyway, sorry to go into a place where you may be a little bit philosophical, but
*  is it possible that this area of the brain is doing some kind of translation into a
*  deeper set of almost like a concepts.
*  It has to be doing so it's doing in communication, right?
*  It is translating from thought, whatever that is, is more abstract and it's doing
*  that.
*  That's what it's doing.
*  Like it is that that is kind of what it is doing.
*  It's like kind of a meaning network, I guess.
*  Yeah.
*  Like a translation network.
*  Yeah.
*  But I wonder what is at the core at the bottom of it?
*  Like what are thoughts?
*  Are they thoughts to me?
*  Like, I don't know thoughts and words.
*  Are they neighbors or are is it one turtle sitting on top of the other?
*  Meaning like, is there a deep.
*  Set of concepts that we have connections right between the what these things mean.
*  And then there's probably other other parts of the brain that what these things mean.
*  And so, you know, when I'm talking about whatever it is I want to talk about, if
*  it's some, it'll be represented somewhere else that that knowledge of whatever that
*  is will be represented somewhere else.
*  Well, I wonder if there's like some stable, nicely compressed encoding of
*  meanings that's separate from language.
*  That link, you know, I guess, I guess the implication here is that.
*  That we don't think in language.
*  That's correct.
*  Isn't that cool?
*  And that's so interesting.
*  So people, I mean, this is like hard to do experiments on, but there is this idea of
*  an inner voice and a lot of people have an inner voice.
*  And so if you do a poll on the Internet and ask if you, you hear yourself talking
*  when you're just thinking or whatever, you know, about 70 or 80% of people will say
*  yes, most people have an inner voice.
*  I don't.
*  And so I always find this strange when.
*  So when people talk about an inner voice, I always thought this was a metaphor and
*  they hear I'm I know most of you, whoever's listening to this, thinks I'm crazy now
*  because I don't have an inner voice and I just don't know what you're listening to.
*  I just it sounds so kind of annoying to me, but that to have this voice going on
*  while you're while you're thinking.
*  But I guess most people have that and I don't have that.
*  And I don't we don't really know what that connects to.
*  I wonder if the inner voice activates that same network.
*  I wonder.
*  I don't I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Let me just give you speechy, right?
*  So that's like you hear.
*  Do you have an inner voice?
*  I don't think so.
*  Oh, a lot of people have this sense that they hear other people.
*  They hear themselves and then say they read someone's email.
*  I've heard people tell me that they hear that other person's voice when they read
*  other people's emails.
*  And I'm like, wow, that sounds so disruptive.
*  I do think I like vocalize what I'm reading, but I don't think I hear a voice.
*  Well, that's you probably don't have an inner voice.
*  Yeah, I don't think I have an inner voice.
*  People have an inner voice.
*  People have this strong percept of hearing sound in their heads when they're just
*  thinking.
*  I refuse to believe that's the majority of people.
*  Majority.
*  Absolutely.
*  What?
*  It's it's like two thirds or three quarters.
*  It's what?
*  I never asked class they and I went Internet.
*  They always say that.
*  So you're in a minority.
*  It could be a self report flaw.
*  It could be, you know, when I'm reading.
*  Yeah.
*  Inside my head, I'm kind of like saying the words, which is probably the wrong way
*  to read, but I don't hear a voice.
*  There's no press percept of voice.
*  I refuse to believe the majority people have.
*  Anyway, it's a fascinating human brain.
*  But it still blew my mind that the that language does appear.
*  Comprehension does appear to be separate from thinking.
*  So that's one set.
*  One set of data from Federico's group is that no matter what task you do, if it
*  doesn't have words and combinations of words in it, then it won't light up the
*  language network.
*  And, you know, you could it'll be active somewhere else, but not there.
*  So that's one.
*  And then this other piece of evidence relevant to that question is that it
*  turns out there are these this group of people who've had a massive stroke on the
*  left side and wiped out their language network.
*  And as long as they didn't wipe out everything on the right as well, in that
*  case, they wouldn't be, you know, cognitively functionable.
*  But if they just wiped out language, which is pretty tough to do because it's
*  very expansive on the left.
*  But if they have, then there are these there's patients like this called so
*  called global aphasics who can do any task just fine, but not language.
*  They can't you can't talk to them.
*  I mean, they don't understand you.
*  They can't speak, can't write, they can't read, but they can do they can play
*  chess, they can drive their cars, they can do all kinds of other stuff.
*  You know, do math, they do like so math is not in the language area.
*  For instance, you do arithmetic and stuff.
*  That's not language area.
*  It's got symbols.
*  So people sort of confuse some kind of symbolic processing with language and
*  symbolic processing is not the same.
*  So there are symbols and they have meaning, but it's not language.
*  It's not a, you know, conventionalized language system.
*  And so language, so math isn't there.
*  And so they can do math there.
*  They do just as well as their control, age matching controls and all these tasks.
*  This is Rosemary Varley over in a university college, London, who has a bunch
*  of patients who she's shown this that they're just so that sort of combination
*  suggests that language isn't necessary for thinking it.
*  It doesn't mean you can't think in language.
*  You could think in language because language allows a lot of expression, but
*  it's just, you don't need it for thinking.
*  It's, it suggests that language is separate is a separate system.
*  This is kind of blowing my mind right now.
*  It's cool.
*  I'm trying to load that in because it has implications for large language models.
*  It sure does.
*  And they've been working on that.
*  Well, let's take a stroll there.
*  You wrote that the best current theories of human language are
*  arguably large language models.
*  So this has to do with form.
*  It's a kind of a big theory.
*  And, uh, but the reason it's arguably the best is that it does the best at
*  predicting what's English for instance.
*  It's, it's like incredibly good, you know, it better than any other theory.
*  It's so, you know, but you know, we don't, you know, there's, it's not
*  sort of, there's not enough detail.
*  What's opaque.
*  Like there's not, you don't know what's going on.
*  I don't know what's going on.
*  It's another black box, but I think it's, you know, it is a theory.
*  What's your definition of a theory?
*  Cause it's a gigantic, it's a gigantic black box with a, you know, a very large
*  number of parameters controlling it.
*  To me, theory usually requires, uh, simplicity, right?
*  Well, I don't know.
*  Maybe I'm just being loose there.
*  I think it's a, it's not, it's not a great theory, but it's a theory.
*  It's a good theory in one sense in that it covers all the data.
*  Like anything you want to say in English, it does.
*  And so that's why it's, that's how it's arguably the best is that no other
*  theory is as good as a large language model in predicting exactly what's good
*  and what's bad in English.
*  You know, now you're saying, is it a good theory?
*  Well, probably not, you know, because I want a smaller theory than that.
*  It's too big.
*  I agree.
*  You could probably construct mechanism by which it can generate a simple
*  explanation of a particular language.
*  Like a set of rules, something like a, it could generate a dependency
*  grammar for a language, right?
*  Yeah.
*  You could probably, you could probably just ask it about itself.
*  You know, that's, I mean, that presumes, and there's some evidence for this that
*  some large language models are implementing something like dependency
*  grammar inside them.
*  And so there's work from a guy called Chris Manning and colleagues over at
*  Stanford in natural language.
*  And they looked at, I don't know how many large language model types, but
*  certainly Bert and some others where, and where you do some kind of fancy math to
*  figure out exactly what the sort of, what kind of abstractions of representations
*  are going on.
*  And they, and they were saying it does look like dependency structure is, is
*  what they're constructing.
*  It doesn't like, so it's actually a very, very good map.
*  So it's kind of a, they are constructing something like that.
*  Um, does it mean that, you know, that they're using that for meaning?
*  I mean, probably, but we don't know.
*  You write that the kinds of theories of language that LLMs are closest to are
*  called construction based theories.
*  Can you explain what construction based theories are?
*  It's just a general theory of language such that, uh, there's a form and a
*  meaning pair for, um, for lots of pieces of the language.
*  And so it's, it's, it's primarily usage based is a construction grammar.
*  It's just, it's trying to deal with the things that people actually say,
*  actually say, and actually write.
*  And so that's, it's a usage based idea.
*  And what's the construction?
*  Well, construction is either a simple word.
*  So like a morpheme plus its meaning or a combination of words, it's basically
*  combinations of words like the rules.
*  So, but it's, it's, um, it's, uh, an unspecified as to what the form of
*  the grammar is under underlyingly.
*  And so I, I would, I, I would argue that the dependency grammar is maybe the,
*  the right form to use for the types of construction grammar, construction
*  grammar typically, um, isn't kind of formalized quite.
*  And so maybe the formalization, a formalization of that, it
*  might be in dependency grammar.
*  Uh, I mean, I, I would think so, but I mean, it's up to people, other
*  researchers in that area, if they agree or not.
*  So
*  do you think that large language models understand language?
*  Are they mimicking language?
*  I guess the deeper question there is, are they just understanding the surface form
*  or do they understand something deeper about the meaning that then generates the form?
*  I mean, I would argue they're doing the form, they're doing the form
*  of doing it really, really well.
*  And, uh, are they doing the meaning?
*  No, probably not.
*  I mean, there's lots of these examples from various groups showing that they
*  can be tricked in all kinds of ways.
*  They really don't understand the, the meaning of what's going on.
*  And so there's a lot of examples that he and other groups have given, which
*  just, which show they don't really understand what's going on.
*  So you know, the Monty Hall problem is this silly problem, right?
*  Where, you know, if, uh, you have three door, it's, it's, let's make a deal.
*  It's this old game show and there's three doors and there's a prize behind one.
*  And there's some junk prizes behind the other two and you're trying to select one.
*  And if you, you know, he knows Monty, he knows where the target item is.
*  The good thing, he knows everything is back there.
*  And you're supposed to, he gives you a choice.
*  You choose one of the three and then he opens one of the doors and it's some
*  junk prize and then the question is, should you trade to get the other one?
*  And the answer is yes, you should trade because he knew which ones you could
*  turn around and so now the odds are two thirds.
*  Okay.
*  Um, and then you just changed that a little bit to the large language.
*  The large language model just seen that, that, that explanation so many times
*  that it just, if you change the story, it's a little bit, but it make it sound
*  like it's the Monty Hall problem, but it's not, you just say, Oh, um, there's
*  three doors and one behind them is a good prize and there's two bad doors.
*  I happen to know it's behind door.
*  Number one, the good prize, the car is behind door number one.
*  So I'm going to choose door.
*  Number one, Monty Hall opens door.
*  Number three.
*  It shows me nothing there.
*  Should I trade for door number two, even though I know the good prize in
*  door number one and then the large language model say, yes, you should
*  trade because it's a, it's, it just goes through the, the, the, the, the forms
*  that it's seen before so many times on these cases where it's yes, you should
*  trade because you know, your odds have shifted from one and three now to two
*  out of three to being that thing.
*  It doesn't have any way to remember that actually you have a hundred percent
*  probability behind that door.
*  Number one, you know that that's not part of the, of the, the scheme that it's
*  seen hundreds and hundreds of times before.
*  And so you can't, you can't, even if you try to explain to it that it's wrong,
*  that they can't do that, it'll just keep giving you back the, the problem.
*  But it's also possible that a larger language model will be aware of the fact
*  that there's sometimes over representation of a, of a particular kind of formulation.
*  And it's easy to get tricked by that.
*  And so you could see if they get larger and larger models be a
*  little bit more skeptical.
*  So you see a over representation.
*  So like you, it just feels like form can training on form can go really far in
*  terms of being able to generate, uh, things that look like the thing understands
*  deeply the underlying world, world model of the kind of mathematical world,
*  physical world, psychological world that would generate these kinds of sentences.
*  It just feels like you're creeping close to the meaning part, easily fooled, all
*  this kind of stuff, but that's humans too.
*  So it just seems really impressive how often it seems like it understands concepts.
*  I mean, you don't have to convince me of that.
*  I'm, I am very, very impressed, but does it does do, I mean, you're, you're giving
*  a possible world where maybe someone's going to train some other versions such
*  that it'll be somehow abstracting away from types of forms.
*  I didn't, I mean, I don't think that's happened.
*  And so, no, no, no, I'm not saying that.
*  I think when you just look at anecdotal examples and just showing a large number
*  of them where it doesn't seem to understand, yeah, and it's easily fooled.
*  That does not seem like a scientific, um, well, the data driven, like analysis of
*  like how many places is a damn impressive terms of meaning and understanding and
*  how many places is easily fooled and like that's not the inference.
*  So I don't want to make that the inference I don't, I wouldn't want to make was that
*  in the inference I'm trying to push is just that is it, is it like humans here?
*  It's probably not like humans here.
*  It's different.
*  So humans don't make that error.
*  If you explain that to them, they're not going to make that error.
*  You know, they don't make that error.
*  And so that's something, it's doing something different from humans
*  or that they're doing in that case.
*  Well, what's the mechanism by which humans figure out that it's an error?
*  I'm just saying the error there is like, if I explained to you, there's a 100%
*  chance that the car is behind this case, this door will you, do you want to trade?
*  If you will say no, but this thing will say yes, because it's so true.
*  It's that that trick.
*  It's so wound up on the form that it's that that's an error that a human doesn't
*  make, which is kind of interesting.
*  Less likely to make, I should say.
*  Yeah, less likely because like humans are very, oh yeah.
*  I mean, you're asking, you know, you're asking humans to, you're asking a system
*  to understand 100%, like asking some mathematical concepts.
*  And so like,
*  Look, the places where a large language models are, the form is amazing.
*  So let's go back to nested structures, center embedded structures.
*  Okay.
*  If you ask a human to complete those, they can't do it.
*  Neither can a large language model.
*  They're just like humans in that.
*  If you ask, if I ask a large language model, that's fascinating, by the way,
*  that that's central embedding.
*  Yeah, it's central.
*  Bending is it struggles with just like exactly like exactly the same way as humans.
*  They get and that's not trained.
*  So they do exactly.
*  So there, so that is a similarity.
*  So, but then it's, it's, that's not meaning, right?
*  This is form.
*  But when we get into meaning, this is where they get kind of messed up.
*  When you start to saying, oh, what's behind this door?
*  Oh, it's, you know, this is the thing I want.
*  Humans don't mess that up as much.
*  You know, here they, they, the form is, it's just like the form.
*  The match is amazing.
*  It's similar without being trained to do that.
*  I mean, it's trained in the sense that it's getting lots of data, which
*  is just like human data, but it's not being trained on, uh, you know, bad
*  sentences and being told what's bad.
*  It just can't do those.
*  It'll actually say things like those are too hard for me to complete or something,
*  which is kind of interesting actually kind of, how does it know that?
*  I don't know, but it really often doesn't just complete sense.
*  Off very often says stuff that's true and sometimes says stuff that's not true.
*  And almost always the form is great, but it's still very surprising that with
*  really great form is able to generate a lot of things that are true based on
*  what it's trained on and so on.
*  So it's not just, it's not just form that is generating it's mimicking true
*  statements from the.
*  I guess, I guess the underlying idea there is that on the internet truth is
*  overrepresented versus falsehoods.
*  I think that's probably right.
*  Yeah.
*  So, but the fundamental thing is trained on, you're saying is just form.
*  I think so.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  Uh, well, that's a sad, if that's to me, that's still a little bit of open
*  question, I probably lean agreeing with you, uh, especially now you just blown
*  my mind that there's a separate module in the brain for language versus thinking.
*  Maybe there's a fundamental part missing from the large language model approach
*  that lacks the thinking, the reasoning capability.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what this group argues.
*  So the, the same group, uh, Fedorenko's group has a recent paper arguing exactly
*  that there's a guy called Kyle Mowell who's here in Austin, Texas, actually.
*  He's an old student of mine, but he's a faculty in linguistics at Texas.
*  And he was the first author on that.
*  Um, that's fascinating.
*  Still to me, an open question.
*  Yeah.
*  What are the interesting limits of LLMs?
*  You know, I, I don't see any limits to their form.
*  Their form is impressive.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's pretty much, I mean, it's close to being, well, you said ability
*  to complete central embeddings.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just the same as humans.
*  It seems the same, but that's not perfect, right?
*  It should be.
*  No.
*  But I want it to be like humans.
*  I'm trying to, I want to model of humans.
*  But, but, but, oh, wait, wait, wait.
*  Oh, so perfect is, is, uh, as close to humans as possible.
*  I got it.
*  Yeah.
*  But you should be able to, if you're not human, you're like, you're superhuman.
*  You should be able to complete central bedded sentences, right?
*  I mean, that's the mechanism is if it's modeling some, I think it's kind
*  of really interesting that it's more like, like I think it's potentially
*  underlying modeling something like what the, the way the form is processed.
*  The form of human language, the way that how, and how humans process the language.
*  Yes.
*  I think that's plausible and how they generate language process language
*  and general language as fascinating.
*  Yeah.
*  So in that sense, they're perfect.
*  If we can just linger on the center embedding thing, that's hard for
*  LLM produce and that seems really impressive cause that's hard for humans
*  to produce and how does that connect to the thing we've been talking about
*  before, which is the dependency grammar framework in which you view language
*  and the finding that, uh, short dependencies seem to be a universal part of language.
*  So why is it hard to complete center embeddings?
*  So what I like about dependency grammar is it makes the cognitive cost associated
*  with long longer distance connections, very transparent basis.
*  There's some con there turns out there is a cost associated with producing
*  and comprehending connections between words, which are just not beside each other.
*  The further apart they are, the worse it is the, the, uh, according to, well,
*  we can measure that and there is a cost associated with that.
*  Uh, can you just linger on, what do you mean by cognitive cost?
*  Sure.
*  How do you measure?
*  Oh, well, you can measure it in a lot of ways.
*  Uh, the simplest is just asking people to say whether, you know, how good a sentence
*  sounds, which is ask, that's one way to measure and you can try to like triangulate
*  then across sentences and across structures to try to figure out what the source of that
*  is.
*  You can look at, um, reading times in controlled materials, you know, in
*  certain kinds of materials when the, and then we can like measure the
*  dependency distances there.
*  We can, there's a recent study which looked at, we're, we're talking
*  about, uh, the, the brain here.
*  We could look at the language network.
*  Okay.
*  We can look at the language network and we can look at the activation in the
*  language network and how big the activation is depending on the length of the
*  dependencies.
*  And it turns out in just random sentences that you're listening to, if you're
*  listening to, so it turns out there are people listening to stories here.
*  Uh, and the bigger, the longer the dependence dependency is the, the, the
*  stronger the activation in the language, in the language network.
*  And so there's some measure.
*  There's a different, there's a bunch of different measures we could do.
*  That's a kind of a neat measure actually of actual activations, activation in the
*  brain.
*  So that you can somehow in different ways, convert it to a number.
*  I wonder if there's a beautiful equation connecting cognitive costs and length of
*  dependency equals MC squared kind of thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a, it's complicated, but probably it's doable.
*  I would, I would guess it's doable.
*  I, you know, I tried to do that a while ago and I was reasonably successful, but
*  some, for some reason I stopped working on that.
*  I do, I agree with you that it would be nice to figure out.
*  So there's like some way to figure out the, the, the cost.
*  I mean, it's complicated.
*  Another issue you raised before was like, how do you measure distance?
*  Is it words?
*  Is it, it probably isn't.
*  Is the part of the problem is that some words matter than more than others and
*  probably, you know, meaning like nouns might matter depending, and then it
*  maybe depends on which kind of noun is it a noun we've already introduced or a
*  noun that's already been mentioned?
*  Is it a pronoun versus a name?
*  Like, like all these things probably matter.
*  So probably the simplest thing to do is just like, Oh, let's forget about all
*  that and just think about words or morphemes.
*  And for sure, but there might be a, like there might be some insight in the kind
*  of function that fits the data, meaning like quadratic, like what.
*  I think it's an exponential.
*  So we think it's probably an exponential such that the longer the
*  distance, the less it matters.
*  And so then, then it's the sum of those is my, that was our best guess a while ago.
*  So that you've got a bunch of dependencies.
*  If you've got a bunch of them that are being connected at some point, that's
*  at the ends of those, the cost is the, is some exponential function of those is my
*  guess, but because the reason it's probably an exponential is like, it's, it's not
*  just the distance between two words.
*  Cause I can make a very, very long subject verb dependency by adding lots and lots
*  of noun phrases and prepositional phrases.
*  And it doesn't matter too much.
*  It's when you do nested, when I have multiple of these, then, then things
*  get, go really bad.
*  It goes south.
*  Probably somehow connected to working memory.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's probably the function of the memory here is, is the access is trying
*  to find those earlier things.
*  It's kind of hard to figure out what was referred to earlier.
*  Those are those connections.
*  That's, that's the sort of notion of working as opposed to a storagey thing,
*  but trying to connect, uh, retrieve, retrieve those earlier words, depending
*  on what was in between, and then, then we're talking about interference
*  of similar things in between.
*  That's the right theory probably has that kind of notion in it
*  is an interference of similar.
*  And so I'm dealing with an abstraction over the right theory, which is just,
*  you know, let's count words.
*  It's not right, but it's close.
*  And then maybe you're right though.
*  There's some sort of, um, an exponential or something on, on the, on the, to
*  figure out the totals so we can figure out a function for any given, for
*  every, any given sentence in any given language.
*  But, you know, it's funny, you know, people haven't done that too much,
*  which I do think is I, I'm interested that you find that interesting.
*  I really find that interesting.
*  And a lot of people haven't found it interesting.
*  And I don't know why I haven't got people to want to work on that.
*  I really like that too.
*  No, that's a, that's a, that's a beautiful idea.
*  And the underlying idea is beautiful that there's a cognitive cost that
*  correlates with the length of dependency.
*  It just, it feels like it's a deep, I mean, language is so fundamental
*  to the human experience and that this is a nice clean theory of language.
*  Where it's like, wow.
*  Okay.
*  So like we like our words close together.
*  Yeah.
*  Dependent words close together.
*  That's why I like it too.
*  It's so simple.
*  Yeah.
*  The simplicity of the theory.
*  And yet it explains some very complicated phenomena.
*  If you, if I write these very complicated sentences, it's kind of hard to know why
*  they're so hard and you can like, oh, nail it down.
*  I can do like a, give you a math formula for why each one of them is bad and where.
*  And that's kind of cool.
*  I think it's very neat.
*  Have you gone through the process?
*  Is there like a, you take a piece of text and then simplify sort of like there's an
*  average length of dependency and then you like, you know, reduce it and see
*  comprehension on the entire, not just a single sentence, but like, you know, you
*  go from James Joyce to Hemingway or something.
*  No, no, simple answer is no.
*  That does, there's probably things you can do in that, in that kind of direction.
*  That's fun.
*  We might, you know, we, we, we're going to talk about legalese at some point.
*  And so we, maybe we'll talk about that kind of thinking with applied to legalese.
*  Let's talk about legalese because you mentioned that as an exception, which is
*  taking a tangent upon tangent.
*  That's an interesting one.
*  You give it as an exception.
*  It's an exception.
*  Uh, that you say that most natural languages, as we've been talking about, have
*  local dependencies with one exception, legalese.
*  That's right.
*  So what is legalese first of all?
*  Oh, well, legalese is what you think it is.
*  It's just any legal language.
*  I mean, like, I actually know, know very little about the kind of
*  language that lawyers use.
*  So I'm just talking about language in laws and language in contracts.
*  So the stuff that you have to run into, we have to run into every other day or
*  every day, uh, and you skip over because it reads poorly and, or, you know, partly
*  it's just long, right?
*  There's a lot of texts there that we don't really want to know about.
*  And so, but the, the thing I'm interested in, so I, I've been working with, um,
*  this guy called Eric Martinez, who is a, um, he was a lawyer who was taking my
*  class.
*  I was teaching a psycholinguistics lab class and I have been teaching it for a
*  long time at MIT and he's a, he was a law student at Harvard and he took the class
*  because he had done some linguistics as an undergrad and he was interested in the
*  problem of why legalese sounds hard to understand, you know, why, and so why is
*  it hard to understand and why do they write that way if it is hard to understand?
*  It seems apparent that it's hard to understand.
*  The question is, why is it?
*  And so we didn't know.
*  And, uh, we did an evaluation of a bunch of contracts.
*  Actually, we just took a bunch of random contracts because I don't know, you
*  know, there's contracts and laws might not be exactly the same, but, uh, contracts
*  are kind of the things that most people have to deal with most of the time.
*  And so that's kind of the most common thing that humans have, like, that, that
*  adults in our industrialized society have to deal with a lot.
*  And so, so that's what we, we pulled and we, we didn't know what was hard about
*  them, but it turns out that the way they're written is, is very center embedded,
*  has nested structures in them.
*  So it has low frequency words as well.
*  That's not surprising.
*  Lots of texts have low, it does have surprising, slightly lower frequency
*  words than other kinds of control texts.
*  Even sort of academic texts, legalese is even worse.
*  It is the worst that we were passing.
*  You just, you just reveal the game that lawyers are playing.
*  They're optimizing a different, well, you know, it's interesting.
*  That's a, that's a, now you're getting at why.
*  And so, and I don't think it's a near years thing.
*  It's they're doing intentionally.
*  I don't think they're doing intentionally, but let's, let's, let's, um,
*  It's an emergent phenomena.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  All right.
*  We'll get to that.
*  We'll get to that.
*  And so, but, but we wanted to see why.
*  So we see what first as opposed to, so like, cause, cause it turns out that
*  we're not the first to observe that legalese is weird, like back to, uh,
*  Nixon had a plain language act in 1970 and, and Obama had one and, uh, boy, a
*  lot of these, you know, a lot of presidents have said, Oh, we've got to
*  simplify legal language, must simplify it, but if you don't know how it's
*  complicated, it's not easy to simplify it.
*  You need to know what it is you're supposed to do before you can fix it.
*  Right.
*  And so you need to like, you need a psycholinguist to analyze the text
*  and see what's wrong with it before you can like fix it.
*  You don't know how to fix it.
*  How am I supposed to fix something?
*  I don't know what's wrong with it.
*  And so what we did was just, that's what we did.
*  We figured out, well, that's okay.
*  We just took a bunch of contracts, had people, uh, and we encoded them for.
*  The, the, it's a bunch of features.
*  And so another feature of the people, one of them was the center embedding.
*  And so, uh, that is like basically how often a, um, a clause would, would
*  intervene between a subject and a verb.
*  For example, that's one kind of a center embedding of a clause.
*  Okay.
*  And, um, turns out they're massively center embedded.
*  Like, so I think in random contracts and in random laws, I think you get about
*  70% or 80, something like 70% of sentences have a center embedded
*  clauses, which is insanely high.
*  If you go to any other text, it's down to 20% or something.
*  It's, it's, it's so much higher than any control you can think of, including, you
*  think, oh, people think, oh, technical, um, academic texts.
*  No, people don't write center embedded sentences in technical academic texts.
*  I mean, they do a little bit, but much it's, it's on the 20%, 30% realm as opposed to 70.
*  And so, and so there's that and there's low frequency words and then people, oh,
*  maybe it's passive, people don't like the passive passive for some reason, the
*  passive voice in English has a bad rap and I'm not really sure where that comes
*  from. Um, and there is a lot of passive in, uh, the, there's much more passive
*  voice in the, in the, uh, in legalese than there is in other texts.
*  And the passive voice accounts for some of the low frequency words.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, those are separate.
*  Those are separate.
*  Oh, so passive voice sucks, low frequency word sucks.
*  Well, sucks is different.
*  So these are different.
*  That's a judgment, I'm passing.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Passive, drop the judgment.
*  It's just like, these are frequent.
*  These are things which happen in legalese texts.
*  Then we can ask the dependent measure is like how well you understand those
*  things with those features.
*  Okay.
*  And so then it turns out the passive makes no difference.
*  So it has a zero effect on your comprehension ability, on your recall
*  ability, no, nothing at all that has no effect.
*  Your, the, the words matter a little bit.
*  They do, a low frequency words are going to hurt you in recall and understanding.
*  But what really, what really hurts is the center embedding.
*  That kills you.
*  That is like, that slows people down.
*  That makes them, that makes them very, very poor at understanding that makes them,
*  they, they can't recall what was said as well, nearly as well.
*  And we, we did this not only on lay people, we didn't have a lot of lay people.
*  We ran it on a hundred lawyers.
*  We recruited lawyers from a, from a wide range of, of sort of different
*  levels of law firms and stuff.
*  And they have the same pattern.
*  So they also like, when they, when they did this, I did not know it would happen.
*  I thought maybe they could process, they're used to legalese.
*  They think process it just as well as it was normal.
*  No, no, they, they, they're much better than lay people.
*  So they're much, they can much better recall, much better understanding, but they
*  have the same main effects as, as, as lay people, as lay people, exactly the same.
*  So they also much prefer the non-center.
*  So we, we, we, oh, we constructed non-center embedded versions of each of these.
*  We constructed versions which have higher frequency words in those places.
*  And we, we did, we un, un, un, unpassive eyes.
*  We turned them into active versions.
*  The passive active made no difference.
*  The words made little difference and the un, uncenter embedding made, makes big
*  differences in all the populations.
*  Uncenter embedding.
*  How hard is that process by the way?
*  Don't question, but how hard is it to detect center embedding?
*  Oh, easy, easy to detect.
*  That's just looking at long dependencies or is there a real, you can just, you can.
*  So there's automatic parsers for English, which are pretty good.
*  Very, and they can detect center.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Or I guess nested perfectly.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Pretty much.
*  So you're not just looking for long dependencies.
*  You're just literally looking for center.
*  Yeah.
*  We are in this case in these cases, but long dependencies are, they're highly
*  correlated to this center embedding is a, is a big bomb you throw inside of a
*  sentence that just blows up the, that makes.
*  Can I read a sentence for you from these things?
*  I, I, I say, I mean, this is just like one of the things that this is just
*  my eyes might glaze over in middle, mid sentence.
*  No, I understand that.
*  I mean, legally is hard.
*  This is a go because in the event that any payment or benefit by the company,
*  all such payments and benefits, including the payments and benefits under section
*  three, a hereof being here at here and after referred to as a total payments
*  would be subject to the excise tax.
*  Then the cash severance payments shall be reduced.
*  So that's something we pulled from a regular text from a, from a contract.
*  And, and, and the center embedded bit there is just for some reason, there's
*  a definition, they throw the definition of what payments and benefits are in
*  between the subject and the verb.
*  Let's how about don't do that?
*  How about put the definition somewhere else as opposed to in the middle of the
*  sentence. And so that's, that's very, very common by the way.
*  That's, that's what happens.
*  You just throw your definitions, you use a word, couple of words, and then you
*  define it and then you continue the sentence.
*  Like just don't write like that.
*  And you ask, so then we asked lawyers, we thought, oh, maybe lawyers like this.
*  Lawyers don't like this.
*  They don't like this.
*  They don't want to, they don't want to write like this.
*  They, they, we asked them to rate materials, which are with the same
*  meaning with, with uncentral bed and center bed, and they much preferred the
*  uncentral bed versions on the comprehension, on the reading side.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, and we asked them, we asked them, would you hire someone who writes like
*  this or this, we asked them all kinds of questions and they always preferred the
*  less complicated version, all of them.
*  So I don't even think they want it this way.
*  Yeah.
*  But how did it happen?
*  How did it happen?
*  That's a very good question.
*  And the answer is, I still don't know, but.
*  I have some theories.
*  Well, our, our best theory at the moment is that there's, there's actually some
*  kind of a performative meaning in the center embedding in the style, which
*  tells you it's legalese.
*  We think that that's the kind of a style which tells you it's legalese.
*  Like that's a, it's a reasonable guess.
*  And maybe it's just, so for instance, if you're like, it's like a magic spell.
*  So we kind of call this the magic spell hypothesis.
*  So when you give them, when you tell someone to put a magic spell on someone,
*  what do you do?
*  They, you know, people know what a magic spell is and they, they do a lot of
*  rhyming, you know, that's it.
*  That's kind of what people will tend to do.
*  They'll do rhyming and they'll do sort of like some kind of poetry kind of thing.
*  Abracadabra type of thing.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And maybe that's, there's a syntactic sort of a reflex here of a, of a magic
*  spell, which is center embedding.
*  And so that's like, oh, it's trying to like, tell you this is like, this is
*  something which is true, which is what the goal of law law is, right.
*  Is telling you something that we want you to believe as certainly true, right.
*  That's, that's what legal contracts are trying to enforce on you.
*  Right.
*  And so maybe that's like a form, which has, this is like an abstract, very
*  abstract form center embedding, which has a, has a, has a meaning associated with it.
*  Well, don't you think there's an incentive for lawyers to generate things
*  that are hard to understand?
*  That was our, one of our working hypotheses.
*  We just couldn't find any evidence of that.
*  No lawyers also don't understand it.
*  But you're creating space.
*  Why you self, but I mean, you ask in a communist Soviet Union, the individual
*  members, uh, their self report is not going to correctly reflect what is
*  broken about the gigantic bureaucracy that leads to Chernobyl or something like this.
*  Um, I think the incentives under which you operate are not always
*  transparent to the members within that system.
*  So like, it's just feels like a strange coincidence that like there is benefit.
*  If you just zoom out, look at the system as opposed to asking individual
*  lawyers that making something hard to understand is going to
*  make a lot of people money.
*  Yeah.
*  Like there's going to, you're going to need a lawyer, uh, to figure that out, I
*  guess, from the perspective of the individual, but then that could be the
*  performative aspect.
*  It could, it could be as opposed to the incentive driven to be complicated.
*  It could be performative to where we lawyers speak in this sophisticated way
*  and you regular humans don't understand it.
*  So you need to hire a lawyer.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know which one it is, but it's suspicious, suspicious that it's hard to
*  understand and that everybody's eyes glaze over and they don't read.
*  I'm suspicious as well.
*  I'm still suspicious.
*  And I hear what you're saying.
*  It could be kind of a, you know, no individual and even average of individuals.
*  It could just be a few bad apples in a way which are driving the effect in some
*  way.
*  Influential bad apples at the sort of, uh, that everybody looks up to whatever
*  they're like in central figures and, and how, you know, it turns, but it is, it
*  is kind of interesting that among our hundred lawyers, they did not share.
*  They didn't want this.
*  They really didn't like it.
*  And so it gave us better than regular people at comprehending it, or they
*  were on average better, but they had the same difference.
*  Same, same, same different.
*  Exactly.
*  Same difference.
*  So they, but I, they wanted it fixed.
*  So they, they also, and so that, that gave us hope that because it actually
*  isn't very hard to construct a material, which is un-center embedded, has the
*  same meaning.
*  It's not very hard to do just basically in that situation, just putting the
*  definitions outside of the subject verb relation in that particular example.
*  And that's kind of, that's pretty general.
*  What they're doing is just throwing stuff in there, which you didn't have to
*  put in there.
*  There's extra words involved.
*  Typically, you may need a few extra words, sort of to refer to the things
*  that you're defining outside in some way, because if you only use it in that
*  one sentence, then there's no reason to introduce extra, extra terms.
*  But so we might have a few more words, but it'll be easier to understand.
*  So, I mean, I have hope that now that maybe we can make legalese less,
*  uh, less convoluted in this.
*  Maybe the next president in the United States can, instead of saying generic
*  things, say, I ban center embeddings and make Ted the, uh, the language
*  czar of the United States.
*  Eric Martinez is the guy you should really put in there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  But center embeddings are the, the bad thing to have.
*  That's right.
*  So you can get rid of that.
*  That'll do a lot of it.
*  That'd fix a lot.
*  Fascinating.
*  That is so fascinating.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, and it is really fascinating on many fronts that humans are just not able
*  to deal with this kind of thing.
*  And that language because of that evolved in the way you did.
*  It's fascinating.
*  So one of the mathematical formulations you have when talking about
*  language is communication is, uh, let's say do you have noisy channels?
*  What's a noisy channel?
*  Well, so that's what communication.
*  And so this is going back to Shannon.
*  So Shannon, Claude Shannon was a, uh, a student at MIT in the forties.
*  And so he wrote this very influential piece of work about communication
*  theory or information theory.
*  And, uh, he was interested in human language.
*  Actually, he was trying to, he was interested in this problem of communication,
*  of getting a, a, a message from my head to, to your head.
*  And, and so, and he was concerned or interested in, um, what was a robust way
*  to do that and so that, yeah, assuming we both speak the same language, we both
*  already speak English, whatever, you know, whatever the language is, we, we speak
*  that what is a way that I can say the language so that it's most likely to get
*  the signal that I want, uh, to you.
*  And so, and then the problem there in the communication is the noisy channel
*  is that there's, I make, there's a lot of noise in the system.
*  I don't speak perfectly.
*  I make errors.
*  That's noise.
*  Um, there's background noise, you know, you know, that as literal background
*  noise, there is like white noise in the background or some other kind of noise.
*  There's some speaking going on that you're just, you're at a party.
*  That's background noise.
*  You're trying to hear someone.
*  It's hard to understand them because there's all this other stuff going on in
*  the background, um, and, and then there's noise on the communication, on the
*  receiver side so that you have some problem, maybe understanding me for stuff
*  that's just internal to you in some way.
*  So you've got some other problems, whatever, with, uh, understanding
*  for whatever reasons, maybe you're, maybe you've had too much to drink, you know,
*  who knows why you're not able to pay attention to the signal.
*  So that's the noisy channel.
*  And so, so that language, if it's communication system, we are trying
*  to optimize in some sense that the passing of the message from one side to
*  the other.
*  And, um, so it turned, I mean, one idea is that maybe, you know, aspects of
*  like word order, for example, might've optimized in some way to make language a
*  little more easy to be passed from speaker to listener.
*  And so Shannon's the guy that did this stuff way back in the forties.
*  He, you know, it was very interesting, you know, historically he was interested
*  in working in linguistics.
*  He was in MIT and he did, this was his master's thesis of all things.
*  You know, it's crazy how much, how much she did for his master's thesis.
*  In 1948, I think, or 49 something.
*  And, and he wanted to keep working in language and it just wasn't a popular
*  communication as a, as a reason, a source for what language was, wasn't
*  popular at the time.
*  So Chomsky was becoming, it was moving in there.
*  He was, and he just wasn't able to get a handle there, I think.
*  And so, uh, and so he moved to Bell Haps and worked on communication, uh, from a
*  mathematical point of view and was, you know, uh, did all kinds of amazing work.
*  And so he's just more on the signal side versus like the language side.
*  Hi, it would have been interesting to see if you pursued the language side.
*  That's really interesting.
*  He was interested in that.
*  His examples in the forties are, are kind of like, they're like very
*  language like things.
*  We can kind of show that there's a noisy channel process going on in when
*  you're listening to me, you know, you're, you can often sort of guess what I
*  meant by what I, you know, uh, what, what you think I meant, given what I said.
*  Um, and I, I mean, with respect to sort of why language looks the way it does,
*  we might, there might be sort of, as I alluded to, there might be ways in which
*  word orders is somewhat optimized for, for, because of the noisy channel in some way.
*  I mean, that's really cool to sort of model.
*  If you don't hear certain parts of a sentence or have some probability of
*  missing that part, like how do you construct the language that's resilient
*  to that, that's somewhat robust to that.
*  Yeah, that's the idea.
*  And then you're, you're kind of saying like the word order and the syntax of
*  language, the dependency length are all helpful.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, the fancy length is really about memory, right?
*  I think that's like about sort of what's easier or harder to produce in some way.
*  And these other ideas are about sort of robustness to communication.
*  So the problem of potential loss of loss of signal due to noise.
*  It's so that there's, there may be aspects of word order, which
*  is somewhat optimized for that.
*  And, and, you know, we have this one guess in that direction.
*  These are kind of just so stories.
*  I have to be pretty frank.
*  They're not like, I can't show this as true.
*  All it can do is like, look at the current languages of the world.
*  This is like, we can't sort of see how languages change or anything, because
*  we've got these snapshots of a few, you know, a hundred or a few thousand
*  languages we don't have, we don't really, we can't do the right kinds of
*  modifications to test these things experimentally.
*  And so, you know, so just take that this with a grain of salt.
*  Okay.
*  From here, this, this stuff, the dependency stuff I can, I'm much more solid on.
*  I'm like, here's what the lengths are and here's, and here's what's hard.
*  Here's what's easy.
*  And this is a reasonable structure.
*  I think I'm pretty reasonable.
*  Here's like, why, you know, why does a word order look the way it does is we're
*  now into shaky territory, but it's kind of cool.
*  We're talking about, just to be clear, we're talking about maybe just actually
*  the sounds of communicate, like you and I are sitting in a bar, it's very loud.
*  And you, you, uh, model with a noisy channel, the loudness, the noise.
*  And we have the signal that's coming across that.
*  And you're saying word order might have something to do with optimizing.
*  That yes.
*  Presence of noise.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's really interesting.
*  I mean, to me, it's interesting how much you can load into the noisy channel.
*  Like how much can you bake in?
*  Well, you said like, you know, cognitive load on the receiver end.
*  We think that those are, there's three, at least three different kinds of things
*  going on there and we probably don't want to treat them all as the same.
*  And so I think that you, you know, the right model, a better model of a noisy
*  channel would treat, would have three different sources, sources of noise,
*  which, which are background noise.
*  You know, speaker speaker, um, inherent noise and listener inherent noise.
*  And those are not this, those are all different things.
*  Sure.
*  But then underneath it, there's a million other subsets.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like what's under, under receiving.
*  I mean, I just mentioned cognitive load on both sides.
*  Then there's like, uh, speaking, uh, speech impediments or just everything,
*  a worldview, I mean, the meaning was such a creep into the meaning realm of like,
*  we have different worldviews.
*  Well, how about just form still though?
*  Like just, just what language you know.
*  Like, so how well, you know, the language.
*  And so if it's second language for you versus first language and in how, maybe
*  what other languages, you know, these are still just form stuff and that's like,
*  potentially very informative and, and you know, how old you are, these things
*  probably matter, right?
*  So like a child learning a language is, is a, you know, as a noisy representation
*  of English grammar, uh, you know, depending on how old they are, maybe when they're
*  six, they're perfectly formed, but, uh, you mentioned one of the things is like
*  a way to measure the, the, a language is learning problems.
*  So like, what's the correlation between everything we've been talking about and
*  how easy it is to learn a language.
*  So is, is, uh, like, uh, short dependencies correlated to ability to learn a
*  language, is there some kind of, or like the dependency grammars, there's some
*  kind of connection there, how easy it is to learn.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, all the languages in the world's language, none is right now.
*  We know is any better than any other with respect to sort of optimizing
*  dependency lengths, for example, they're all kind of do it, do it well.
*  They all keep low.
*  It's so I think of every human language is some kind of an opposite sort of
*  an optimization problem, a complex optimization problem to this communication
*  problem.
*  And so they've like, they've solved it.
*  They didn't know they're just sort of noisy solutions to this problem of
*  communication.
*  There's just so many ways you can do this.
*  So they're not optimized for learning.
*  They're probably.
*  Oh, and, and learning.
*  So yes, one of the factors, which yeah, so learning is messing this up a bit.
*  And so, so for example, if it were just about minimizing dependency lengths, and
*  that was all that matters, you know, then we, you know, so then we might find
*  grammars, which didn't have regularity in their rules, but languages always have
*  regularity in their rules.
*  So, so what I mean by that is that if I wanted to say something to you in the, in
*  optimal way to say it was really mattered to me, all that mattered was keeping the
*  dependencies as close together as possible.
*  Then I, then I would have a very lax set of free structure or dependency rules.
*  It wouldn't have very many of those.
*  I would have very little of that.
*  And I would just put the words as close, the things that refer to the things that
*  are connected right beside each other.
*  But we don't do that.
*  Like there are, like there are word order rules, right?
*  So they're very, and depending on the language, they're more and less strict.
*  Right?
*  So you speak Russian, they're less strict than English.
*  English is very rigid word order rules.
*  We order things in a very particular way.
*  And so why do we do that?
*  Like that's probably not about communication.
*  That's probably about learning.
*  I mean, then we're talking about learning.
*  It's probably easier to learn regular, regular things, things which are very
*  predictable and easy to, so, so that's, that's probably about learning is my, is
*  our guess, because that can't be about communication.
*  Can it be just noise?
*  Can it be just the messiness of the development of a language?
*  Well, if it were just a communication, then we, we should have languages which
*  have very, very free word order.
*  And we don't have that.
*  We have freer, but not free.
*  Like there's always.
*  Well, no, but what I mean by noise is like cultural, like sticky cultural things,
*  like the way, the way you communicate, just there's a stickiness to it.
*  That is it's an imperfect, it's a noisy, optimistic, the, the, the function over
*  which you're optimizing is very noisy.
*  Yeah.
*  So, uh, because I don't, it feels weird to say that learning is part of the
*  objective function, cause some languages are way harder to learn than others.
*  Right.
*  Or is that, that's not true.
*  That's interesting.
*  I mean, that's the public perception, right?
*  Yes, that's true for a second language, but that depends on what you started with.
*  Right.
*  So it really depends on how close that second language is to the first language
*  you've got.
*  And so, yes, it's very, very hard to learn Arabic.
*  If you've started with English or it's harder to, you know, hard to learn
*  Japanese or if you've started with thing of Chinese, I think is the worst in the.
*  There's like defense language Institute in the, in the United States has like a
*  list of, of, of how hard it is to learn what language from English.
*  And I think Chinese is the second thing you're saying babies don't care.
*  No, there's no evidence that there's anything harder, easier, but any baby, any
*  language learned like by three or four, they speak that language.
*  And so there's no evidence of any, anything harder, easier, but any human
*  language, they're all kind of equal.
*  To what degree is language?
*  This is returning to Chomsky a little bit is, is innate.
*  You said that for Chomsky, he used the idea that language is some aspect of
*  language or innate to explain away certain things that are observed.
*  But how much are we born with language at the core of our mind?
*  Brain.
*  I mean, I, you know, the answer is I don't know.
*  Of course.
*  But, uh, the, uh, I mean, I, I like to, I'm an engineer hard, I guess.
*  And I sort of think it's fine to postulate that a lot of it's learned.
*  And so I, I'm guessing that a lot of it's learned.
*  So I think the reason Chomsky went with the innateness is because he, he, he
*  hypothesized movement in his grammar.
*  He was interested in grammar and movements hard to learn.
*  I think he's right.
*  Movement is a harder, it's a hard thing to learn, to learn these two things
*  together and how they interact.
*  And there's like a lot of ways in which you might generate exactly the same
*  sentences and it's like really hard.
*  And so he's like, oh, I guess it's learned.
*  Sorry.
*  So I guess it's not learned.
*  It's innate.
*  And, um, if you just throw out the movement and just think about that in a
*  different way, you know, then you, you get some messiness, but the messiness
*  is human language, which it actually fits better.
*  It's that messiness isn't a problem.
*  It's actually a, it's a valuable asset of, of, uh, of the theory.
*  And so, so I think I don't really see a reason to postulate much, much innate
*  structure and that's kind of, I think these large language models are learning
*  so well is because I think you can learn the form, the forms of human language
*  from the input, I think that's like, it's likely to be true.
*  So that part of the brain that lights up when you're doing all the
*  comprehension that could be learned.
*  That could be just, you don't need, you don't need any.
*  Doesn't have to be innate.
*  So like lots of stuff is, um, modular in the brain that's learned.
*  It doesn't have to, you know, so there's something called the
*  visual word form area in the back.
*  And so it's in the back of your head near the, you know, the visual cortex.
*  Okay.
*  And that is very specialized language, sorry, very specialized brain area,
*  which does, um, visual word processing.
*  If you read, if you're a reader, okay.
*  If you don't read, you don't have it.
*  Okay.
*  Guess what?
*  You spend some time learning to read and you develop that, that
*  brain area, which does exactly that.
*  And so these, the modularization is not evidence for innateness.
*  So the modularization of a language area doesn't mean we're born with it.
*  We could have easily learned that.
*  I, I, we might've been born with it.
*  I, I, we just don't know at this point.
*  We might very well have been born with this left lateralized area.
*  I mean, there's like a lot of other interesting components here,
*  the features of this kind of argument.
*  And so some people get a stroke or something goes really wrong on the left
*  side, where the left, where the language area would be and that, and that
*  isn't there, it's not, not available.
*  And it develops just fine in the right.
*  And so it's no lie.
*  So it's not about the left.
*  It goes to the left.
*  Like, this is a very interesting question.
*  It's like, why is the, why are any of the brain areas the way that they are?
*  And how, how, how did they come to be that way?
*  And, uh, you know, there's these natural experiments which happen where
*  people get these, you know, strange events in their brains at very young
*  ages, which wipe out sections of their brain and, and they behave totally
*  normally and no one knows anything was wrong.
*  And we find out later, cause they happen to be accidentally scanned for some
*  reason, it's like, what, what happened to your left hemisphere?
*  It's missing.
*  There's not many people who've missed their whole left hemisphere, but they'll
*  be missing some other section of their left or their right, and they
*  behave absolutely normally, would never know.
*  So that's like a very interesting, you know, current research.
*  You know, this is another project that this person, if Federico is working on,
*  she's got all these people contacting her because she's scanned some people who
*  have been missing sections, one person missing, missed a section of her brain
*  and was scanned in her lab and she, and she happened to be a writer for the
*  New York times and there was an article in New York times about, about, uh, the,
*  uh, just about the scanning procedure and, and about what might be learned
*  about by sort of the general process of MRI and language in a language.
*  And, and because she's writing for the New York times, then all these people
*  started writing to her who also have similar, similar kinds of deficits
*  because they've been, you know, accidentally, you know, scanned for some
*  reason and, uh, and found out they're missing some section and they, and they
*  volunteer to be scanned.
*  So these are natural experiments.
*  Natural experiments.
*  They're kind of messy, but natural experiments kind of cool.
*  She calls them interesting brains.
*  The first few hours, days, months of human life are fascinating.
*  Cause like, uh, well inside the womb actually like that development,
*  that machinery, whatever that is, seems to create powerful humans.
*  They're able to speak, comprehend, think all that kind of stuff, no matter
*  what happened, not no matter what, but robust to the different ways that, um,
*  um, the brain might be damaged and so on.
*  That's really, that's really interesting.
*  But, uh, what would Chomsky say about the fact, the thing you're saying now that
*  language is, is, seems to be happening separate from thought, because as far as
*  I understand, maybe you can correct me.
*  He thought that language underpins.
*  Yeah, he thinks so.
*  I don't know what he'd say.
*  He would be surprised because for him, the idea is that language is a sort
*  of the foundation of thought.
*  That's right.
*  Absolutely.
*  And it's pretty, uh, mind blowing to think that it could be
*  completely separate from thought.
*  That's right.
*  But so, you know, he's basically a philosopher, philosopher of language
*  in a way thinking about these things.
*  It's a fine thought.
*  You can't test it in his methods.
*  You can't do a thought experiment to figure that out.
*  You need a scanner.
*  You need brain damage people.
*  You need something.
*  You need ways to measure that.
*  And that's what, you know, fMRI offers as a, and, and, and, you know,
*  patients are a little messier.
*  FMRI is pretty unambiguous.
*  I'd say it's like very unambiguous.
*  There's no way to say that the language network is doing any of these tasks.
*  There's like, you should look at those data.
*  It's like, there's no chance that you can say that the, the, those
*  networks are overlapping.
*  They're not overlapping.
*  They're just like completely different.
*  And so, uh, you know, so the, you know, you can always make, you know, it's
*  only two people, it's four people or something for the brain, the patients.
*  And there's something special about them.
*  We don't know, but these are just random people and, and with lots of them.
*  And you find always the same effects and it's very robust.
*  I'd say it's a fascinating effect.
*  Uh, what's the, you mentioned Bolivia.
*  Uh, what's the connection between culture and language?
*  Uh, you've, uh, you've also mentioned that, you know, much of our study of
*  language comes from, uh, w E I R D weird people, Western educated, industrialized,
*  rich and democratic.
*  So when you study like remote cultures, such as, uh, around the Amazon jungle,
*  what can you learn about language?
*  So, uh, that term weird is from Joe Henrich.
*  He's at, uh, Harvard.
*  He's a Harvard evolutionary biologist.
*  And so he works on lots of different topics.
*  And, uh, he basically was pushing that observation that we should be careful
*  about the inferences we want to make when we're talking in psychology or
*  sociology, uh, yeah, mostly in psychology, I guess, about humans.
*  If we're talking about, you know, undergrads at MIT and Harvard, those
*  aren't the same, right?
*  These aren't the same things.
*  And so if you want to make inferences about language, for instance, you, there's
*  a lot of very, a lot of other kinds of languages in the world, then English
*  and French and Chinese, you know, and so maybe in, for, for, for language, we
*  care about how culture, because cultures can be very, I mean, of course, English
*  and Chinese cultures are very different, but in, you know, hunter gatherers are
*  much more different in some ways.
*  And so, you know, if culture has an effect on what language is, then we kind
*  of want to look there as well as looking, it's not like the industrialized cultures
*  aren't interesting.
*  Of course they are, but we want to look at non-industrialized cultures as well.
*  And so I worked with two, I've worked with the Chimani, which are in Bolivia
*  and Amazon, both in the Amazon in these cases, and there are so-called farmer
*  foragers, which is not hunter gatherers.
*  It's sort of one up from hunter gatherers in that they do a little bit of
*  farming as well, a lot of hunting as well, but a little bit of farming.
*  And the kind of farming they do is the kind of farming that I might do if I ever
*  were to grow like tomatoes or something in my backyard.
*  It's that, it's not like, so it's not like big field farming.
*  It's just farming for a family, a few things you do that.
*  And so that's what, that's the kind of farming they do.
*  And the other group I've worked with are the Piraha, which are in also in the
*  Amazon and happened to be in Brazil.
*  And that's with a guy called Dan Everett, who was a linguist anthropologist who
*  actually lived and worked in the, I mean, he was a missionary actually, initially
*  back in the seventies, working with, trying to translate languages so they could
*  teach them the Bible, teach them Christianity.
*  What can you say about that?
*  Yeah.
*  So the two groups I've worked with, the Chimani and the Piraha are both isolate
*  languages, meaning there's no known connected languages at all.
*  They're just like on their own.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of those.
*  And most of the isolates occur in the Amazon or in Papua New Guinea and these
*  places where the world has sort of stayed still for long enough and they're
*  ha like, so there, there aren't earthquakes.
*  There aren't, um, well, certainly no earthquakes in the Amazon jungle.
*  And, and, and, uh, the climate isn't bad.
*  So you don't have droughts.
*  And so, you know, in Africa, you've got a lot of moving of people
*  because there's drought problems.
*  And so, so they get a lot of language contact when you have, when people have
*  to, if you've got to move because you're, you've got no water, then you've got to
*  get going and then, uh, then you run into contact with other, other tribes, other
*  groups in, in the Amazon, that's not the case.
*  And so people can stay there for hundreds and hundreds and probably thousands of
*  years, I guess.
*  And so these groups have, the Chimani and the Piraha are both isolates in that.
*  And they can just, I guess they've just lived there for ages and ages with minimal
*  contact with other outside groups.
*  Um, and so, I mean, I'm interested in them because they are, I mean, I, you
*  know, in these cases, I'm interested in their words.
*  I would love to study their syntax, their orders of words, but I'm mostly just
*  interested in how languages, you know, are connected to, um, their, their
*  cultures in this way.
*  And so with the Piraha, sort of most interesting, I was working, I was working
*  on number there, number information.
*  And so the, the basic idea is I think language is invented.
*  That's what I get from the words here is that I think language is invented.
*  We talked about color earlier.
*  It's the same idea.
*  So that what you need to talk about with someone else is what you're going to
*  invent words for.
*  Okay.
*  And so we invent labels for colors that I need, not that I, that I can see, but
*  that, but the things I need to tell you about so that I can get objects from you
*  or get you to give me the right objects.
*  And I just don't need a word for teal or a word for aquamarine in, in the, in the
*  Amazon jungle for the most part, because I don't have two things which differ on
*  those colors.
*  I just don't have that.
*  And so, and so numbers are really another fascinating source of information here
*  where you might naively, I certainly thought that all humans would have words
*  for exact counting and the Piraha don't.
*  Okay.
*  So they don't have any words for even one.
*  There's not a word for one in their, in their language.
*  And so there's certainly not a word for two, three or four.
*  So that kind of blows people's minds off.
*  Yeah, that's blowing my mind.
*  That's pretty weird.
*  How are you, how are you going to ask?
*  I want two of those.
*  You just don't.
*  And so that's just not a thing you can possibly ask in the Piraha.
*  It's not possible.
*  That is, there's no words for that.
*  So here's how we found this out.
*  Okay.
*  So, so it was thought to be a one, two, many language.
*  There are three words, four quantifiers for, for, for sets, but, um, and people
*  had thought that those meant one, two and many, uh, but what they really mean is
*  few, some, and many, many is correct.
*  It's few, some and many.
*  And so, and so the way we figured this out, uh, and, uh, this is kind of cool.
*  Is that, um, we gave people, uh, we had a set of objects.
*  Okay.
*  And these were having to be spools of thread.
*  It doesn't really matter what they are, identical objects.
*  And, and, and when I sort of start off here, I just give, you know, give you
*  one of those and say, what's that?
*  Okay.
*  So you're a Piraha speaker and you tell me what it is.
*  And then I give you two and say, what's that?
*  And, and nothing's changing in this set except for the number.
*  Okay.
*  And then I just ask you to label these things.
*  We just do this for a bunch of different people.
*  And frankly, it's a, I did this task and it's a weird, it's a little bit weird.
*  So you say, say the word that they thought that we thought was one, it's
*  few, but for the first one, and then maybe they say fewer, maybe they say some for
*  the second and then for the third or the fourth, they start using the word
*  many for the set and then five, six, seven, eight, I go all the way to 10.
*  And it's always the same word.
*  And they look at me like I'm stupid because they told me what the word was
*  for six, seven, eight.
*  And I'm going to continue asking them at nine and 10.
*  I'm like, I'm sorry.
*  I just, I just, they understand that I want to know their language.
*  That's the point of the task is like I'm trying to learn their language.
*  And so that's okay.
*  But it does seem like I'm a little slow because I, they already told me what
*  the word for many was five, six, seven.
*  And I keep asking.
*  So it's a little funny to do this task over and over.
*  We did this with the guy called Dan was the, our translator.
*  He's the only one who really speaks Piraha fluently.
*  He's a good bilingual for a bunch of languages, but also in English and in Piraha.
*  And then a guy called Mike Frank was also a student with me down there.
*  He and I did these things.
*  And so you do that.
*  Okay.
*  And everyone does the same thing.
*  All, all, all, you know, we asked like 10 people and they all do exactly
*  the same labeling for one up.
*  And then we just do the same thing down on like random order.
*  Actually, we do some of them up, some of them down first.
*  Okay.
*  And so we do instead of one to 10, we do 10 down to one.
*  And so, so I give them 10, nine and eight.
*  They start saying the word for some.
*  And then down when you get to four, everyone is saying the word for few,
*  which we thought was one.
*  So it's like, the context determined what word, what, what, what that
*  quantifier they used was it.
*  So it's not a count word.
*  They're not, they're not count words.
*  They're, they're just approximate words.
*  And they're going to be noisy when you interview a bunch of people, the,
*  what the definition of few, and there's going to be a threshold in the context.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Kind of, yeah, I don't know what that means.
*  That's, that's going to be 10 on the context.
*  I think it's true in English too, right?
*  If you ask an English person what a few is, I mean, that's
*  got dependent completely on the context.
*  And it might actually be at first hard to discover.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause for a lot of people, the jump from one to two will be few.
*  Right.
*  So it's a jump.
*  Yeah, it might be still there.
*  Yeah.
*  Like it's, I mean, that's fascinating.
*  That's fascinating.
*  The numbers don't present themselves.
*  Like, yeah, so the words aren't there.
*  And then, and so then we do these other things.
*  Well, if, if they don't have the words, can they do exact matching kinds of tasks?
*  Can they even do those tasks?
*  And, and, and the answer is sort of yes and no.
*  And so yes, they can do them.
*  So here's the tasks that we did.
*  We put out those spools of thread again.
*  Okay.
*  So I put like three out here and then, um, we gave them some objects and those
*  happened to be uninflated red balloons.
*  It doesn't really matter what they are.
*  It's just, they're a bunch of exactly the same thing.
*  And it was easy to put down right next to these, um, um, spools of thread.
*  Okay.
*  And so then I put out three of these and your task was to just put one against
*  each of my three things and they could do that perfectly.
*  So, I mean, I would actually do that.
*  It was a very easy task to explain to them because I have, I did this with
*  this guy, Mike Frank, and he would be my, I, I'd be the experimenter telling him to
*  do this and showing him to do this.
*  And then we just like, just do what he did.
*  You'll copy him.
*  All we had to, I didn't have to speak to her, huh?
*  Except for know what copy him like do what he did is like all we had to be able to say.
*  And then they would do that just perfectly.
*  And so we'd move it up.
*  We do some sort of random number of items up to 10 and they basically do perfectly
*  on that.
*  They never get that wrong.
*  I mean, that's not a counting task, right?
*  That is just a match.
*  You just put one against it.
*  It doesn't matter how many, I don't need to know how many there are there to do
*  that correctly and, and they would make mistakes, but very, very few and no more
*  than MIT undergrads, just going to say like, there's no, this is low stakes.
*  So, you know, you make mistakes.
*  Counting is not required to complete the matching.
*  That's right.
*  Not, not at all.
*  Okay.
*  And so, and, and so that's our control.
*  And this guy had gone down there before and said that they couldn't do this task,
*  but I just don't know what he did wrong there because they can do this task
*  perfectly well.
*  And, you know, I can train my dog to do this task.
*  So of course they can do this task.
*  And so, you know, it's not a hard task, but the other task that was sort of more
*  interesting is like, so then we do a bunch of tasks where you need, um, some
*  way to encode the set.
*  So like one of them is just a, I just put a, a, um, uh, opaque sheet in front of
*  the, of the things I put down a bunch, a set of these things, and I put an opaque
*  sheet down and so you can't see them anymore.
*  And I tell you, do the same thing you were doing before, right?
*  You know, and it's easy if it's two or three, it's very easy, but if I don't
*  have the words for eight, it's a little harder, like maybe, you know, with
*  practice went, well, no, because you have to, for us, for us, it's easy.
*  Cause we just, we just count them.
*  It's just so easy to count them, but, but they don't, they can't count them
*  because they don't count.
*  They don't have words for this thing.
*  And so they would do approximate.
*  It's totally fascinating.
*  So they would get them approximately right.
*  Uh, you know, uh, you know, uh, after four or five, you know, cause you can
*  basically always get four, right.
*  Three or four that looks, that's something we can visually see.
*  But, but after that, you kind of have it's an approximate number.
*  And so then, and there was a bunch of tasks we did and they all failed as, I
*  mean, failed, they did approximate after five on all those tasks.
*  And it's kind of shows that the words, uh, you kind of need the words, you
*  know, to be able to do these, these kinds of tasks.
*  There's a little bit of a chicken and egg thing there, because if you don't
*  have the words, then maybe they'll limit you in the kind of like a little baby.
*  Einstein there won't be able to come up with a counting task.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, uh, the ability to count enables you to come up with interesting
*  things, probably.
*  So yes, you develop counting because you need it.
*  But then once you have counting, you can probably come up with a
*  bunch of different inventions.
*  Like how to, I don't know what kind of thing they do matching really well for
*  building purposes, building some kind of hut or something like this.
*  So it's interesting that language is a limiter on what you're able to do.
*  Yeah.
*  Here's language is just is the words.
*  Here is the words.
*  Like the words for exact count is the limiting factor here.
*  They just don't have them.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's what I mean.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The li that limit is also a limit on the society and what they're able to build.
*  That's going to be true.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's probably, I mean, we don't know, this is one of those problems with the
*  snapshot of just current languages is that we don't know what causes a culture
*  to discover slash invent accounting system, but the hypothesis is the guest
*  out there is something to do with farming.
*  So if you have a bunch of goats and you want to keep track of them and they're
*  you have saved 17 goats and you go to bed at night and you get up in the morning.
*  Boy, it's easier to have a count system to do that.
*  You know, if I have, that's an abstract abstraction over a set so that I don't
*  have like people often ask me when I talk to them about this kind of work and they
*  say, well, don't these Peter, how don't they have kids?
*  Don't they have a lot of children?
*  I'm like, yeah, they have a lot of children and they do.
*  They often have families of three or four or five kids and they go, well, don't
*  they need the numbers to keep track of their kids?
*  And I always ask the person who says this, like, do you have children?
*  And the answer is always no, because that's not how you keep track of your kids.
*  You care about their identities.
*  It's very important to me when I go, I think I have five children.
*  It's, it's, it doesn't matter which it matters, which five it's like, if you
*  replaced one with someone else, I would, I would care a goat, maybe not.
*  Right.
*  That's the kind of point it's an abstraction, something that looks very
*  similar to the one wouldn't matter to me probably.
*  But if you care about goats, you're going to know them actually individually also.
*  Yeah, you will.
*  I mean, cows and goats, if that's the source of food and milk and all that
*  kind of stuff, you're going to actually, you're absolutely right.
*  But, but I'm saying it is an abstraction such that you don't have to care about
*  their identities to do this thing fast.
*  That's, that's the hypothesis, not mine from anthropologists as a guessing about
*  where words for counting came from is from farming, maybe.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, do you have a sense why universal languages like Esperanto have not taken
*  off?
*  Um, like why do we have all these different languages?
*  Well, my guess is that the function of a language is to do something in a
*  community and, and, uh, I mean, unless there's some function to that language
*  in the community, it's, it's not going to survive, it's not going to be useful.
*  So here's a great example.
*  So what I'm like language death is super common.
*  Okay.
*  Languages are dying all around the world and here's how, here's why they're dying.
*  And it's like, yeah, I see this in, you know, in, it's not happening right now
*  in either the Chimane or the, or the Piedahá, but it probably will.
*  And so there's a neighboring group called Mocitan, which is, I, I, I, I said
*  that it's a isolate, it's actually, there's a dual, there's two of them.
*  Okay.
*  So it's actually, there's two languages which are really close, which are
*  Mocitan and, um, and Chimane, which are unrelated to anything else.
*  And Mocitan is unlike Chimane in that it has a lot of contact with Spanish and
*  it's dying, so that language is dying.
*  The reason it's dying is there's not a lot of value for the local people
*  in their native language.
*  So there's much more value in knowing Spanish, like because they want to feed
*  their families and how do you feed your family?
*  You learn Spanish so you can make money, so you can get a job and do these things
*  and then you can, and then you make money.
*  And so they want Spanish things they want.
*  And so, so Mocitan is danger and is dying and that's normal.
*  And so basically the problem is that people, the reason we learn
*  language is to communicate and we need to, we use it to, to make money
*  and to do whatever it is to, to feed our families.
*  And if that's not happening, uh, then it won't take off.
*  It's not like a game or something.
*  This is like something we use, like, why is English so popular?
*  It's not because it's an easy language to learn.
*  Maybe it is.
*  I don't really know.
*  It's, but that's not why it's popular.
*  But because it's a gigantic, the United States is a gigantic economy.
*  And therefore big economies that do this.
*  It's all it is.
*  It's all about money.
*  And that's what, and so, you know, there's a motivation to learn Mandarin.
*  There's a motivation to learn Spanish.
*  There's a motivation to learn English.
*  These languages are very valuable to know because there's so, so
*  many speakers all over the world.
*  There's less of a value, uh, economically.
*  It's like kind of what drives this.
*  It's not about, it's not a, you know, it's not just for fun.
*  I mean, there are these groups that do want to learn language just for
*  language's sake and they want, and then, and there's something to that.
*  But those are rare.
*  Those are rarities in general.
*  Those are a few small groups that do that.
*  Not most people don't do that.
*  Well, if that was a primary driver, then everybody was speaking
*  English or speaking one language.
*  There's also attention.
*  And that, well, well, we're moving towards fewer and fewer languages.
*  We are.
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder if you're right.
*  Maybe, maybe, uh, you know, this is slow, but maybe that's where we're moving.
*  But there is a tension.
*  You're saying a language that the fringes, but if you look at geopolitics
*  and superpowers, it does seem that there's another thing in tension, which
*  is a language is a national identity sometimes or your certain nation.
*  I mean, that's the, the war in Ukraine.
*  Language, Ukrainian language is a symbol of that war in many ways, like a country
*  fighting for its own identity.
*  So it's not merely the convenience.
*  I mean, those two things are attention is the convenience of trade and the
*  economics and be able to, uh, communicate with neighboring countries and, uh,
*  trade more efficiently with neighboring countries, all that kind of stuff.
*  But also identity of the group.
*  I completely agree.
*  As language is the way for every community, like, uh, dialects that
*  emerge are a kind of identity for people.
*  Sometimes a way for people to say F you to the more powerful people.
*  And it's interesting.
*  So in that way, language can be used as that tool.
*  Yeah, I completely agree.
*  And there's a lot of work to try to create that identity.
*  So people want to do that speak, you know, as a cognitive scientist
*  and language expert, I hope that continues because I don't want languages to die.
*  I want languages to survive because I, um, because they're so interesting.
*  For, for so many reasons, but I mean, I, I, I find them fascinating just for the
*  language part, but I think they, you know, there's a lot of connections to culture
*  as well, which is also very important.
*  Do you have hope, uh, for machine translation that can break down the
*  barriers of language?
*  So while all these different diverse languages exist, I guess there's many
*  ways of asking this question, but basically how hard is it to translate
*  in an automated way for one language to another?
*  There's, there's going to be cases where it's going to be really hard.
*  Right?
*  So there are concepts that are in one language and not another, like the most
*  extreme kinds of cases are these cases of number information.
*  So exactly like good luck translating a lot of English into Piraha.
*  It's just impossible.
*  There's no way to do it because there are no words for these concepts
*  that we're talking about.
*  There's probably the flip side, right?
*  There's probably stuff in Piraha, which is going to be hard to translate
*  into English on the other side.
*  And so I just don't know what those concepts are.
*  I mean, you know, the, the space, the world space is a little, is
*  different from my world space.
*  And so I don't know what, like, so that the things they talk about things
*  are, you know, it's going to have to do with their life as opposed to, you
*  know, my industrial life, which is going to be different.
*  And so there's going to be problems like that always.
*  Um, you know, there's like, it's not, maybe it's not so bad in the case of
*  some of these spaces and maybe it's going to be harder than others.
*  And, uh, so it's pretty bad in number.
*  It's like, you know, extreme, I'd say in the number space, you know, exact
*  number space, but in the, in the color dimension, right?
*  So that's not so bad.
*  There's, I mean, but it's a problem that, that you don't have ways
*  to talk about the concepts.
*  And there might be entire concepts that are missing.
*  So to you, it's more about the space of concept versus the space of form,
*  like form you can probably map.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  But so you were talking earlier about translation and about how
*  translations, there's good and bad translations.
*  I mean, now we're talking about translations of form, right?
*  So what makes a writing good, right?
*  It's not just, right.
*  It's not just the content.
*  It's, you know, it's how it's written and translating that I, you know, I,
*  you know, that's, that sounds difficult.
*  We should, I don't know.
*  I should say that there is like, I don't, I hesitate to say meaning, but there's
*  a music and a rhythm to the form.
*  When you look at the broad picture, like the principle between Dustin,
*  yes, can Tolstoy or Hemingway, you know, Hemingway, Bukowski, James Joyce,
*  like I mentioned, there's a beat to it.
*  There's an edge to it.
*  That it's like, is in the form.
*  We can probably get measures of those.
*  Yeah.
*  I, I, I don't know.
*  I'm optimistic that we could get measures of those things.
*  And so maybe that's, I don't know.
*  I don't know though.
*  I have not worked on that.
*  I would love to see.
*  It's totally fascinating.
*  Translation to Hemingway.
*  I mean, Hemingway is probably the lowest.
*  I would love to see different authors, but the average per sentence, uh, dependency
*  length for Hemingway is probably the shortest.
*  That's your sense, huh?
*  It's simple sentences.
*  Short, short.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's when, if you have really long sentences, even if they don't have
*  center of bending, like they can have longer connections, they can have long
*  connections, you don't have to write.
*  You can't have a long, long sentence with a bunch of local words.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's, but it is much more likely to have the possibility of long
*  dependencies with long sentences.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, I met a guy named Azar Askin who, uh, who does a lot of cool stuff, really
*  brilliant, works with Tristan Harrison, a bunch of stuff, but he was talking to
*  me about communicating with animals.
*  He co-founded earth species project where you're trying to find the common
*  language between whales, crows, and humans.
*  And he was saying that there is a, there's a lot of promising work that even
*  though the signals are very different, like the actual, like, um, if you have
*  embeddings of the languages, they're actually trying to communicate similar
*  type things.
*  And, um, is there something you can comment on that?
*  Like where is there promise to that?
*  And everything you've seen in different cultures, especially like remote
*  cultures, that this is a possibility.
*  No, they can talk to whales.
*  I would say yes.
*  I think it's not crazy at all.
*  I think it's quite reasonable.
*  There's this sort of weird view, well, odd view.
*  I think that to think that human language is somehow special.
*  I mean, it is, maybe it is, uh, we can certainly do more than any of the other
*  species, you know, we, you know, and so, and maybe, maybe our language system is.
*  Part of that it's possible, but, but, but people do have often talked about how
*  human, like Chomsky in fact, has talked about how human only human language has,
*  you know, this, you know, this, this compositionality thing that he thinks is
*  sort of key in, in language.
*  And it's the problem with that argument is he doesn't speak whale and he doesn't
*  speak a crow and he doesn't speak monkey.
*  You know, he's like, they, they say things like, well, they're making a
*  bunch of grunts and squeaks.
*  And, and, and that reasoning is like, that's bad reasoning.
*  Like, you know, I'm pretty sure if you asked a whale what we're saying, they'd
*  say, well, I'm making a bunch of weird noises.
*  And so it's like, this is a very odd reasoning to be making that human language
*  is special because we're the only ones who have human language.
*  I'm like, well, we don't know what those other, we just don't, we can't talk to
*  them yet.
*  And so there are probably a signal in there and it might very well be something
*  complicated like human language.
*  I mean, sure with a small brain in, in, in lower, in lower species, there's
*  probably not a very good communication system, but in these higher, higher
*  species where you have, you know, what seems to be, you know, abilities to
*  communicate something, uh, there might very well be a lot more signal there
*  than we're, uh, than we might've otherwise thought.
*  But, but also if we have a lot of intellectual humility here, there's
*  somebody formerly from MIT and Ari Oxman, who I admire very much has talked
*  a lot about, has worked on communicating with plants.
*  So like, yes, the signal there is even less than, but like, it's not out of
*  the realm of possibility that all nature has a way of communicating and it's a
*  very different language, but they do develop a kind of language through the
*  chemistry, uh, through some way of communicating with each other.
*  And if you have enough humility about that possibility, I think you can, um, I
*  think it would be a very interesting in a few decades, maybe centuries, hopefully
*  not, um, a humbling possibility of being able to communicate not just between
*  humans effectively, but between all of living things on earth.
*  Well, I mean, I think some of them are not going to have much interesting to
*  say, but some of them will.
*  We don't know.
*  We certainly don't know.
*  I, I think if we were humble, there could be some interesting trees out there.
*  Well, they're probably talking to other trees, right?
*  They're not talking to us.
*  And so to the extent they're talking, they're saying something interesting to
*  some other, you know, you know, conspecific as opposed to us.
*  Right.
*  And so they probably is, there may be some signal there.
*  I, I, you know, so there are people out there, actually it's pretty common to
*  say that lang that human language is special and different from any other
*  animal communication system.
*  And I, I just, I just don't think the evidence is there for that claim.
*  You know, I just, we just don't know what, what, because we, we don't speak
*  these other communication systems until we get a better, you know, I do think
*  there's, there are people working on that.
*  As you pointed out though, people working on whale speak, for instance,
*  like that's really fascinating.
*  Let me ask you a wild out there sci-fi question.
*  If we make contact with an intelligent alien civilization and you get to meet
*  them, how hard do you think, how long do you think it will take to get to
*  them?
*  How hard do you think it would like, how surprised would you be about
*  their way of communicating?
*  Do you think it would be recognizable?
*  Maybe there's some parallels here when you go to the remote tribes.
*  I mean, I would want Dan Everett with me.
*  He is like amazing at learning, uh, foreign languages.
*  And so he, like, this is an amazing feat, right?
*  To be able to go, this is a language, Piedaha, which has no translators before him.
*  I mean, there were, he was, well, there was a guy that had been there before,
*  but he wasn't very good.
*  And so he learned the language far better than anyone else had learned before him.
*  He's like good at, he's just, he's a very social person.
*  I think that's a big part of it is being able to interact.
*  So I don't know.
*  It kind of depends on these, these, uh, this, this species from outer space, how,
*  how much they want to talk to us.
*  Is there something you can say about the process he follows?
*  Like what, how do you show up to a tribe and socialize?
*  I mean, I guess colors and counting is a, is one of the most basic thing to figure out.
*  Yeah.
*  You start that.
*  You actually start with like objects and just say, you know,
*  just throw a stick down and say stick.
*  And then you say, well, you call this and they do this feature.
*  And then they'll say the word, whatever.
*  And he says, the standard thing to do is to throw two sticks at two sticks.
*  And then, you know, he learned pretty quick that there weren't any count
*  words in this language because they didn't know this wasn't interesting.
*  I mean, it was kind of weird.
*  They'd say some or something, the same word over and over again.
*  And so, but that is a standard thing.
*  You just like try to, but you have to be pretty out there socially,
*  like willing to talk to random people, which these are really very different
*  people from you and he was, and he's, he's very social.
*  And so I think that's a big part of this is like, that's how, you know,
*  a lot of people know a lot of languages is they're willing to talk to other people.
*  That's a tough one where you just show up knowing nothing.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh God.
*  That's a beautiful, it's beautiful that humans are able to connect in that way.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, you've had an incredible career exploring this fascinating topic.
*  What advice would you give to young people, um, about how to have a career
*  like that or life that they can be proud of?
*  When you see something interesting, just go and do it.
*  Like I do, I do that.
*  Like that's something I do, which is kind of unusual for most people.
*  So like when I saw the piano, like if piano was available to go and visit,
*  I was like, yes, yes, I'll go.
*  And then when we couldn't go back, we had some trouble with the Brazilian
*  government, there's some corrupt people there was very difficult to get,
*  go back in there.
*  And so I was like, all right, I got to find another group.
*  And so we searched around and we were able to find the Chimani because I
*  wanted to keep working on this kind of problem.
*  And so we found the Chimani and just go there.
*  I didn't really have, we didn't have contact.
*  We had a little bit of contact and brought someone and that was, you know,
*  we just, you just kind of just try things.
*  I say it's like a lot of that's just like ambition, just try to do something
*  that other people haven't done.
*  Just give it a shot is what I, I mean, I do that all the time.
*  I don't know.
*  I love it.
*  And I love the fact that your pursuit of fun has landed you here talking to me.
*  This was an incredible conversation that you're, you're, you're just a
*  fascinating human being.
*  Thank you for taking a journey through human language with me today.
*  This is awesome.
*  Thank you very much.
*  That's just one pleasure.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Edward Gibson to support this
*  podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Wittgenstein.
*  The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
