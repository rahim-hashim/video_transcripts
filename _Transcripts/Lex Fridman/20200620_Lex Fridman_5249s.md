# Steven Pressfield The War of Art  Lex Fridman Podcast #102
**Lex Fridman:** [June 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgtedwKGhXs)
*  The following is a conversation with Steven Pressfield,
*  author of several powerful nonfiction and historical fiction books, including The War of Art,
*  a book that had a big impact on my life and the life of millions of people whose passion is to
*  create in art, science, business, sport, and everywhere else. I highly recommend it and
*  others of his books on this topic, including Turning Pro, Do the Work, Nobody Wants to Read
*  Your Shit, and The Warrior Ethos. Also, his books Gates of Fire about the Spartans and the Battle
*  of Thermopylae, The Lions Gate, Tides of War, and others are some of the best historical fiction
*  novels ever written. As some of you know, I don't shy away from taking on a big, difficult challenge.
*  One of the hardest for me and for millions of others is the discipline of staring at an empty
*  page every day, pushing on to think deeply, to create, despite the millions of excuses that fill
*  the head. In his work, Steven has articulated this struggle better than anyone I've ever read.
*  Quick summary of the ads. Two sponsors, The Jordan Harbinger Show and Cash App. Please consider
*  supporting the podcast by going to JordanHarmiger.com slash Lex and subscribing to it
*  everywhere after that and downloading Cash App and using code LexPodcast. Click on the links.
*  Buy all of the stuff. It really is the best way to support this podcast.
*  This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. I recently considered renaming this podcast,
*  but decided against it. AI is my passion. And in some sense, this podcast is not as much about AI,
*  but more about a journey of an AI researcher struggling to explore the human mind, the physics
*  of our universe, and the nature of human behavior, intelligence, consciousness, love, and power.
*  I will continue to return home to the technical, computer science, machine learning, engineering,
*  math, programming, but also venture out to talk to people who had a big impact on my life
*  outside the technical fields. Writers like Steven Pressfield and Stephen King,
*  musicians like Tom Waits, political leaders like, well, you know who, and even athletes.
*  I hope you join me on this journey. As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and no ads in
*  the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. Click on the links. Buy all of
*  the stuff. It's the best way to support this podcast. This episode is supported by the Jordan
*  Harbinger Show. Go to JordanHarbinger.com slash Lex. It's how he knows I sent you. On that page,
*  there's links to subscribe to it on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and everywhere else.
*  I've been binging on this podcast. Jordan is a great human being. He gets the best out of his
*  guests, dives deep, calls them out when it's needed, and makes the whole thing fun to listen
*  to. He's interviewed Kobe Bryant, Mark Cuban, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Garry Kasparov, and many more.
*  I just finished listening to his recent conversation with Mick West about debunking
*  conspiracy theories. This topic can be both fascinating and frustrating on both sides,
*  but in this conversation, Jordan thread the needle beautifully, and so it turned out to be
*  a great listen. I highly recommend it. Again, go to JordanHarbinger.com slash Lex. It's how he
*  knows I sent you. On that page, there's links to subscribe to the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify,
*  and everywhere else. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the app
*  store. When you get it, use code LexPodcast. Cash App lets you send money to friends,
*  buy bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar.
*  Since Cash App allows you to buy bitcoin, let me mention that cryptocurrency in the context of
*  the history of money is fascinating. I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.
*  Debits and credits on ledgers started around 30,000 years ago. The US dollar created over
*  200 years ago, and the first decentralized cryptocurrency released just over 10 years ago.
*  Given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development.
*  But it's still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money. So again, if you get Cash App
*  from the app store or Google Play and use the code LexPodcast, you get $10. And Cash App will also
*  donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping advance robotics and STEM education for
*  young people around the world. And now here's my conversation with Steven Pressfield.
*  Modern society in many ways dreams of creating universal peace. And yet war has molded civilization
*  as we know it throughout its history. So let's start at the high philosophical level. If you
*  could imagine a world without war, how would that world be different? Perhaps put another way,
*  what purpose has war served? Why do we fight?
*  I think we're basically the same creatures internally that we were in the cave, right? In
*  tribal society back for however many, you know, hundreds of thousands, millions of years,
*  which means that we're in the dynamic in our mind is a kind of an us versus them dynamic where
*  our tribe is the people and everybody else or whatever, you know? And I don't see that,
*  I don't think that's changed one iota over the centuries. It's just a question of how
*  one might sublimate that urge to compete. I mean, you're a martial artist, you know,
*  that, you know, a great part of your day, I'm sure, is dedicated to reaching that place of,
*  you know, of total commitment and in the face of competition, in the face of adversity,
*  etc., etc., which is, I think, natural and great for the human race on an individual basis. So
*  the hope that I have, if there is any hope, personally, I don't think the human race is
*  going to be around for very long, but would be in sports or in other kind of sublimated activities.
*  Where people can act out their need for conquest or aggression or so forth, but at the same time,
*  relate to their opponents as human beings. And when the game is over, you know, you embrace your
*  competitor and stuff like that. So you think war was inevitable. It's a part of human nature,
*  as opposed to a force, a creative force in society that served a benefit.
*  Well, I'm sure it has benefited, you know, spreading cultures and mixing cultures and
*  stuff like that. But I think the urge to conquest, if you think about Alexander the Great or Julius
*  Caesar or Napoleon or anybody like that, or even individual, or if we even think about one of the
*  plants that we're looking at right outside, I mean, if you let a particular plant have its way,
*  it would take over the whole hillside. And certainly in the days of Alexander the Great,
*  let's say, there were who knows over the face of the earth, hundreds of little kingdoms,
*  China, Japan, Asia, Europe, wherever. And every prince that grew up dreamt of conquering his
*  neighbor and conquering a neighbor after that. That seems to be a universal human imperative,
*  at least in the male of the species. War is just a realization of that imperative.
*  I think so. So you've written about Spartans in the battle of Thermopylae, about Alexander the
*  Great, about the Six Day War in 67 in Israel against Egypt, Jordan, Syria. What war,
*  not just out of those, but in general, do you think has been most transformative for the world?
*  Well, these are great questions, Lex.
*  Easy ones, right?
*  I mean, I wish I knew more about the Mongols. Because I certainly, from what little I know,
*  I think that was a very, their conquests were very transformative, bringing cultures in a horrible,
*  bloody way together. But gosh, what's then the most transformative? Maybe the Roman conquest,
*  establishing the Roman Empire and bringing that culture. Maybe Alexander the Great's
*  wars that united East and West, at least for a minute.
*  So building of empire. Do you have a sense? So there's wars. I mean, the Six Day War
*  is not about building empires. It's about deeply held religious, cultural conflict, and
*  holding the line, holding the border. And then there is conquests, like the Mongols, that,
*  what is it, some large percentage of the population is a descendant of Genghis Khan,
*  I believe, right? So that has transformative effects. And then World War II, I mean,
*  personally, and my family and so on, the transformative effects.
*  Let me ask you this, Lex. What are you trying to get at with these questions? What is this kind of
*  the theme that you're aiming at?
*  Well, I talked to Eric Weisdach and he said, everything is great about war, except the killing.
*  And there's a romantic notion of war. Certainly there's a romantic notion of being a warrior,
*  but there's a romantic notion of war that somehow there's a creative force to it.
*  But that because we fight out of that fighting comes culture, comes music and art, and more
*  and more desire to create with the societies that win. And to me, war is not just, hey,
*  I have a stick and I want your land. It's some kind of,
*  like it has echoes of the creative force that makes humans unique to other animals.
*  Like wars, it can't be just four people or 10 people or a hundred people. You have to
*  have thousands of people agreeing, usually thousands or more, for something so deeply
*  that you would be willing to risk your own life. And there's a romantic notion to that.
*  And because you've written so well and passionately about some of these, I wanted to see,
*  because I don't have any answers, I wanted to untangle that. If there is a reason we fight
*  that's more than just anger and hate and wanting to conquer.
*  Well, let me take it from a completely different side. I don't think that I, in writing about war,
*  am really that interested in war per se. I'm more interested in the metaphor. I think for me,
*  I'm really writing about my own internal war and the war against myself and against my own
*  resistance, my own negativity, all of those things that are, that spirituality would be the
*  opposite of. So I'm not really an expert on war. It's not like talking to Jim Mattis or to
*  Victor Davis Hansen or whatever. To me, the human being, we are spiritual beings in a physical
*  envelope. And there's an automatic terrible tension within that, which creates a war
*  inside ourselves. So the outer war, when I think about the Israeli army standing up to whatever,
*  10 to 1 odds or whatever it was, that is a metaphor to me of the fight we're fighting inside
*  ourselves. For me, the Six Day War was, as you know, my feeling was it was about a return from
*  exile. It was sort of the culmination of the reestablishment of the state of Israel, which
*  had never really been completed because the holiest places of the Jewish people were in the
*  hands of their enemies. So now, on the other hand, Alexander the Great's conquests, I think, were a
*  whole other different scenario where the metaphor was that Alexander's father, Philip, I think,
*  created the First Nation, capital and nation, and he created a sort of a pathway for these guys who
*  were mountain men and basically barbarians, Macedonians, and by creating this army and this
*  dream of conquering the world, which Alexander took to the, you know, really enacted, he gave them a
*  way of rising out of themselves, of transcending themselves, not just individually, but as a people.
*  So that would go along with what you're saying, Lex, of a certain creativity to it. But again,
*  that's not for whatever, and I'm just realizing this as I'm answering this, that's not really
*  what's interesting to me about these stories. And the Spartans, what was a whole, at Thermopylae,
*  that was a whole other kind of metaphor of war. That was a sort of a willingly going to one's own
*  death for a greater cause, just like to me, the Spartans at Thermopylae enacted as a group what
*  Jesus Christ enacted as an individual, a sacrifice of their lives for the greater good.
*  I don't know if that answers your question, but that's how I see it. I do feel like, you know,
*  I get invited to speak to Marine Corps groups and things like that all the time, and I decline
*  because I don't really feel like I'm a spokesman for the warrior class or anything like that.
*  Um, it's not, that's not what's interesting about it to me.
*  But didn't you just say, with war as a metaphor, that we're all essentially in various ways warriors?
*  If we think of it in terms of Jungian archetypes, and think of our life as, at least as males,
*  and the earliest archetypes that kick in are the youth and the wanderer and the student,
*  and that kind of thing. And then at some point around age 15 to 20, whatever, the warrior
*  archetype kicks in. And we want to play football, I want to do martial arts, we want to join the
*  special forces, we want to hang out with our buddies, that's our great bond, we want to test
*  ourselves against adversity, and so on and so forth. But at some point, that archetype, we move
*  beyond that archetype, and we become fathers and teachers and so on and so forth. And then there
*  are many archetypes beyond that towards the end. So I'm interested in the warrior archetype,
*  but not to the be all and end all of everything else. You know, there's a, in my book, The Virtues
*  of War, have you read that? There's a character named Telemann, who's actually, it's a long story,
*  but when he's with Alexander's army, and when they arrive in India, he becomes fascinated by
*  the gymnastophists, the fakirs, the naked wise men, the yogis. And he says to Alexander that these
*  guys are warriors beyond what we are. Even though they do nothing because they are inside their own
*  selves all day long. If we go to the Six Day War,
*  you write about, in Lionsgate, you write about the Six Day War in Israel.
*  I think of the wars you've written about as the one we're still, in many ways, in the midst of
*  today. Yes. So what is at the core of that conflict in Israel? The Israeli-Palestinian conflict?
*  I mean, today it's the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but it echoes of the same conflict
*  in that part of the world with Israel. What is, in your sense, the nature of that conflict? What
*  can we learn about society and human nature from that conflict? That is one of the hottest
*  conflicts that still goes on today. Well, when I was working on the Lionsgate
*  about the Six Day War, I wrote in the introduction that this was not going to be a multi-sided story.
*  I was taking it entirely, I'm a Jew, I identify with the Israeli people, I was going to see it
*  entirely from their side. So that's probably not what you're asking, but to me, the Six Day War
*  and that whole, it's a piece of land that's holy to at least three religions and probably more.
*  From the Jewish point of view, it's where the state of Israel, it's where David founded Jerusalem,
*  it's all where the 12 tribes were, et cetera, et cetera, where Moses came and brought the people.
*  So to me, the Six Day War was about, as I said, a return from exile, from diaspora after 2000 years.
*  Now, obviously, from the Palestinian point of view or the Saudi Arabian point of view or whatever,
*  it's a whole other scenario. Religion is at the core of this conflict in some ways,
*  the religious beliefs. Religion and racial slash ethnic tribal identity.
*  Again, what is a Jew? Is a Jew somebody that believes in the religion or is it somebody of
*  a certain race that race arose in a certain place? Same thing as a Muslim, what is a Muslim? Do they
*  believe in Muhammad or whatever or did they arise in a certain place and a certain ethnicity?
*  If we landed from Mars, we couldn't tell a Jew from a Palestinian, could we? Just looking at them,
*  you could easily mix them and you'd never know. The specifics of the faith is not necessarily
*  the thing that defines a person. No, I don't think so.
*  Many are secular Jew living in Israel and still have a strong bond.
*  Definitely. In fact, almost all of the Jews, the fighters that I spoke to,
*  from the sixth day were secular and it really was not a religious thing with them as much as it was
*  a national thing. Having spent time in Israel, how's the world where military conflict is directly
*  felt as opposed to maybe if we look at the US where it's distant and far away? How's that world
*  different? How are the people different? It's very different, as you know.
*  I've never been to Israel actually. Oh, you haven't?
*  Haven't felt it. Well, you should definitely go. Here in the United States,
*  when an incident like Charlottesville comes up where people are chanting, Jews will not replace
*  us, blah, blah, blah, the impulse in the Jewish community is to think of, well, how can we reach
*  out to the other side? How can we show them that we are human beings like they are and show them
*  that we care for them, et cetera, et cetera? That's the sort of distant from war. If you're
*  in Israel, like if you and I were Israeli citizens right now, you would be a fighter pilot or a tank
*  commander or whatever. You would not just be working at MIT or whatever. I would be in the army too.
*  From their point of view, they say all those people who hate us, can I curse on this? Of course.
*  On this thing, fuck them, we'll kill them. We'll kill them.
*  If they dared across the line, and that's their whole different point of view. To me, it's actually
*  a healthier point of view. You think so?
*  Let me ask the hard question. Maybe it's an impossible question. How do we resolve that
*  conflict? In Israel and anywhere where the instinct is to reach out in the US and say,
*  F you, and the people. I think that the only way that two warring sides or two sides that are
*  opposed to one another can ever really come together is when there's mutual respect. We'll
*  get just more water. When there's mutual respect and they can see each other as equals and when
*  there's mutual fear, where one side says, we don't dare cross the line with this other side,
*  and the other side says the same thing. I think then you can reach across that thing and say,
*  okay, we'll stay here, you stay here. We'll mingle in cultural ways and we'll have interchange,
*  winter marriage, but as soon as one side has no power, as the Jewish people have had no power
*  throughout the diaspora forever, then it's just a human nature. You can see it in Trump and what he
*  does to any vulnerable minority. He's not alone. I'm not blaming him alone. That's human nature.
*  I do think that idea of like, fuck you, if you cross the line, we'll kill you,
*  is really a good way, is a good place to start from because now you can sit down on opposite
*  sides of the table and say, what do we have in common? We want to raise our children,
*  you want to raise your children. How can we do this in a way that we're not hurting each other?
*  You said that you need to arrive at some kind of balance of power, but you haven't spoken to the
*  fact that there's deeply rooted hatred of the other. So is there no way to alleviate that hatred?
*  What role does love and hatred come?
*  I think that hatred can go away. I really do. If you look at even now that I haven't seen this
*  in person, but they say that the Saudis and the Israelis are collaborating in certain things by
*  their mutual fear of or antagonism to Iran, I do think that even really long, long, longstanding
*  hatreds and animosities, thousands of years old, can go away under the right circumstances.
*  On what time scale?
*  For instance, do generations have to die and pass away and new generations come up with less
*  hate or can a single individual learn to not hate?
*  I think a single individual can learn to not hate because it certainly doesn't seem to,
*  over thousands of years, doesn't seem to work. We keep thinking that that's going to happen.
*  But I think we're in a real spiritual realm here when you're talking about that. You're in a realm
*  of Buddha, Jesus, whatever, something like that, where a true change of soul happens.
*  But I do think that's possible.
*  So what do you think is the future of warfare, especially with what many people see as the
*  expansion of the military industrial conflict? I know you're not a military historian.
*  I'm asking more as a metaphor. Do you see us as people continuing to fight?
*  It's a really great question, Alex, because I think now with social media, TV, movies,
*  all of these things that create empathy across cultures, it becomes harder and harder, I think,
*  to totally demonize the other the way it was in previous wars. I also think I don't really see
*  an appetite for people wanting to go to war these days. In a way, I don't know if that's good or
*  bad. It's like everybody's so fat and lazy and so concerned with how many clicks they're getting
*  that whereas I know at the start of World War I, both the younger generations were
*  eager to go to war. I think it was insane, but it was that warrior archetype that we were talking
*  about before, that generational testosterone, Eros thing. Whereas nowadays, I don't know.
*  I mean, it's hard to say there's not going to be another war because there always are,
*  but it's sort of hard to imagine people getting off their ass these days to do anything.
*  Well, it's funny that you mentioned social media as a place for empathy, sure,
*  but in a sense, it's a place for war as well.
*  For hatred, yeah.
*  True.
*  Hatred. Perhaps the positive aspect of hatred on social media is that it's somewhat less harmful
*  than murder. It dissipates the hatefuls. You get the hate out on a daily basis and thereby never
*  boils up to a point where you want to kill.
*  It's also a really weird thing that's going on. I don't know if anybody really understands.
*  Like with video games where kids are acting out these incredible horror things,
*  but you know that if they cut their finger, they would freak out.
*  I also don't think that many of the people that are hateful on social media, if they were face
*  to face with the person, there's sort of two mental spheres happening at the same time.
*  I don't know how that actually maps to military conflict.
*  If you in the United States have a draft, for example, how the populace would respond
*  different than they did in previous generations.
*  Yeah, I think they certainly would.
*  Yeah. Another question, not sure if you've thought about it, but I work on building
*  artificial intelligence systems. In our community, many people are worried about AI being used in war,
*  so automating the killing process with drones and in general. It's being used more and more.
*  I should recuse myself on that one. I really haven't thought about that.
*  You haven't thought about it.
*  I'd rather ask you what you think about it.
*  Well, it's interesting because it's so fundamentally different from,
*  if you look at the Battle of Thermopylae. It means just if we talk about the difference
*  between a gun and a sword.
*  I'll tell you one little anecdote. There was a Spartan king, I don't know which one it was,
*  but at one point they showed him a new invention and it could launch a bolt that would kill someone
*  at a range of 200 yards. The king wept and said, alas, valor is no more. Because their
*  point of view of war was highly ritualized, as you know, and the code of honor was that you were not
*  supposed to be able to kill another person unless you yourself were in equal danger of being killed.
*  Any other way of doing that, even bow and arrow was considered less than manly and less than
*  honorable. Maybe we should go back to that because at least it makes the stakes real and true.
*  Not that we could.
*  Not that's the point. You were in the Marine Corps, so
*  we talk about the real, the bloody conflicts. You've written about many of them.
*  So let me ask a personal question. Have you, as writing and in general, have you
*  thought about what it takes to kill a person if you yourself could do it?
*  I have thought about it, yeah.
*  And how that would make you feel?
*  Of course, one never knows. I certainly, I have not been in combat. I haven't killed anybody.
*  But I would imagine in the real world that it would change you utterly forever because
*  you can't help but identify with the person that you've just killed.
*  And it's another human being. And I have a hard time killing a spider. So I would imagine that
*  it's something that warriors understand and nobody else understands.
*  And you've spoken with many. You've spoken with people who've seen military combat.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  What have they been able to articulate, the experience of killing?
*  It's sort of just what I said. I mean, I'm even thinking of one pilot that I interviewed over there
*  who was strafing a tank in his Mustang at really low altitude and saw what his bullets did to the
*  guy and could see his face and everything like that, which is even one remove or more removes
*  from an infantryman, what an infantryman does. And he said that, that same thing that I said,
*  that it just changes you and you can never say it, never look at the world or look at anything the
*  same way again. And when that happens at scale, it's thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds.
*  That changes entire societies. I mean, that's what we've seen.
*  But the problem is it doesn't change the politicians back home.
*  Right. How important is mortality, finiteness, the fact that this thing ends to the creative process?
*  So killing and war really emphasizes that, but in general, the fact that this thing ends.
*  It does?
*  It does.
*  Shit.
*  And on a serious note, do you think about your own mortality? Do you meditate on your own mortality
*  when you think about the work you do?
*  That's another great question, Lex. I actually, I'm 75 and I just was having,
*  I had breakfast in New York a few months ago with a friend of mine who's like my exact same age.
*  And I said to him, I said, Nick, do you ever think about mortality? And he said,
*  every fucking minute of every day. And I was kind of relieved to hear that because I do too.
*  But actually, I always have, I think. And I think, you know, the fact of mortality
*  is kind of gives meaning to life, you know? I think that's why we want to create.
*  That's why we want to make a mark of some kind. And the other aspect of it is what's on the other
*  side of that mortality. I'm a believer in previous lives. So I sort of, and the question I've never
*  been able to answer among many, many others is like, why are we even here? Why are we in the flesh?
*  You know, I sort of, I like to believe that God or some force is, we're on some kind of journey.
*  But I'm not sure why we were put in this world where the ground rules are, if you think about
*  animal life, that you cannot live from one day to the next without killing and eating
*  some other form of life. I mean, what a demented thing, you know? Why couldn't we just have a solar
*  panel on our head and, you know, be friends with everybody? So I sort of, I don't get what that was
*  all about, but that's sort of the big issue. Have you read the Ernest Becker's Denial of Death,
*  for example, is Ernest Becker's a philosopher that said that the death, that the fear of death
*  is really the primary driver of everything we do. So Freud had what?
*  Right. I would agree with that.
*  So to you, you've always thought about even your own mortality.
*  Yes, definitely.
*  And can you elaborate on the reincarnation aspect of what you were talking about?
*  What's your sense that we had previous lives? Have you thought concretely or is it a lot of it?
*  No, I've thought concretely about it. I mean, it's very clear when you see children,
*  young kids, or even dogs and cats, that they come into the world with personalities,
*  you know, and three kids in a family are going to be completely different and completely their own
*  person. And that person that they are doesn't change over life. And I, you know, there's one of
*  the things that I did in my book, The Artist's Journey, is that there were certain things where
*  I tracked or just listed in order, like all of Bruce Springsteen's albums or all of Philip
*  Roth's books, you know, kind of a body of work throughout over, you know, a period of 30, 40,
*  50 years, you know. And you can see that there's a theme running through all of those things,
*  that it's completely unique to that person. Nobody else could have written Philip Roth's books or
*  Bruce Springsteen's songs. And you can even see sort of a destiny there. So,
*  I ask myself, well, where did that come from? It seems to be a continuation of something that
*  was that happened before, and that will lead to something else, because it's not starting from
*  scratch. It seems like there's a calling, a destiny in there already. This gets back to the muse and
*  all that kind of thing. So, yeah, it's almost like there's this, let's call it a god, it's passing,
*  it's almost like sampling parts of a previous human that has lived and putting those into the
*  new one. Sampling is probably a pretty good word. Taking some of the good, well, you can't take all
*  the good parts because the bad parts is what makes the person. Right. Let's say you're taking it all
*  together. Okay. This is humans only, or does it pass around from animals in your view?
*  I don't know. That's above my pay grade. I don't know.
*  So, okay. So, you talk about the muse as the source of ideas, maybe. Since you've gotten a few glimpses
*  of her in your writing, tell me, what is it possible for you to tell me about her?
*  Where does she reside? What does she look like? I mean, you can look at it many different ways.
*  Right? The Greeks did it in an anthropomorphic way, right? They created gods that were like human
*  beings. But if you look at it from a Kabbalistic Jewish perspective, Jewish mysticism, you could
*  say that it's the soul, the neshama, right? That the soul is above us on a higher plane, your soul,
*  my soul, and it's trying to reach down to us and communicate with us. And we're trying simultaneously
*  to reach up to it through prayer or through, if you're a writer or an artist, you know, when you
*  sit down at the keyboard, you're entering into a kind of prayer. You're entering into a different
*  state of an altered consciousness, to some extent. You're opening yourself, opening the pipeline,
*  turning on the radio to tune into the cosmic radio station. Another way of looking at it,
*  this is an... Do you ever see the movie City of Angels? The visual of the movie, it was
*  Meg Ryan and- Oh, with Nicholas Cage? Yeah, yeah, I've seen it. Yep.
*  And the visual of the movie sort of was Meg Ryan is a heart surgeon, and as she's operating on
*  somebody, suddenly Nicholas Cage in this long duster coat, like Jesse James, appears right next
*  to her in the operating room, and he's an angel. And he's waiting to take out the soul of the
*  patient on the operating table. And she doesn't see him, she's totally unaware of him,
*  and so is everybody else in the operating room, except maybe the guy who's about to die,
*  who suddenly sees him. But I kind of believe that there are beings like that, or if you don't like
*  that, it's a force, it's a consciousness, it's something that are right here, right now. And
*  they're trying to communicate to us, and like through a membrane, like tapping on that window
*  over there, they're like right out there, and they carry the future. They are everything
*  that is in potential, all the works that you will do, Lex, your startup, whatever else you're doing,
*  they know that. And it's not really you that's coming up with those ideas, in my opinion.
*  Those things are appearing, it's like somebody knocks on the door and puts it in. I mean,
*  in the Iliad, where gods and goddesses appear, along with the human antagonists on the battlefield
*  all the time, right? There'll be Homer flashes to Olympus and then back to the real world,
*  and there's a thing where one Aphrodite, let's say, wants to help Paris. And so she says,
*  well, I will appear to him in a dream, and I'll take the form of his brother,
*  and I'll say, bum-pada-bum-pada-bum. So that's creatures, beings on one dimension,
*  as the Greeks thought, communicating with, and I believe that that's exactly what's going on,
*  in whatever analogy you want to use.
*  That communication, to which degree do you play the role in that communication,
*  as opposed to sitting at the computer, if you're a writer, and staring at the blank page,
*  and putting in the time, and waiting? So in your view, are these creatures
*  basically waiting to tell you about your future? Or is there a choice? How many possible futures
*  are there? How many possible ideas are there?
*  That's a great question. I think there's basically,
*  yes, there are alternatives, degrees within it, but if you look at Bruce Springsteen's albums,
*  how much could he have done really differently? Yeah, you can just see there's a whole impetus
*  going through the whole thing, and nothing was going to shake him off that. And yeah,
*  maybe the river could have been different, it could have been called something else, but
*  he was dealing with certain issues. His conscious self was dealing with certain issues that were
*  really out of his control. He was drawn, he was called to it, right? Nothing could stop him.
*  So it is sort of a partnership, I think, the creative process between the creative impulse
*  that's coming from some other place, or it's coming from deep within us is another way to
*  look at it. It's like if we're acorns and we're growing into oaks. So the conscious artist
*  who's sitting there at the keyboard or whatever is applying his or her consciousness to that,
*  but is also going into opening themselves to the unconscious or to this other realm,
*  whatever that is. I mean, certainly songwriters for a million years have said, a song just came
*  into their head, right? Palms, all I had to do was write. But then you ever see that thing
*  of Keats' notes for a thing of beauty is a joy forever? It covers the entire page,
*  and it's like he's crossing this out and that out, and yet his consciousness, his conscious mind is
*  working on it. So I do think it's a partnership. And I think that, I know when I was first starting
*  out as a writer, I worked in advertising and I tried to do novels that I could never do,
*  I was really unskilled at getting to that, tuning into that station.
*  I just, I beat my brains out and was unable to do it, except because I was trying too hard,
*  it was like a Zen monk or a monk of some kind trying to meditate and just constantly
*  thoughts driving you crazy. But over time, knock wood, I've gotten better at it.
*  And I can sort of let go of those, that part of me that's trying so hard, and
*  so these angels can speak a little more easily through the membrane.
*  Can you put into words the process of letting go and clearing that channel of communication?
*  What does it take? That's another great question. For me, it just took,
*  it took probably 30 years. And I don't even, I guess I would liken it to meditation, even
*  though I'm not a meditator, but it would seem to me to be one of the hardest things in the world,
*  to just sit still and stop thinking. And so it's very hard to put into words. And I think that's
*  why these teachers of meditation use tricks and co-ons and stuff like that. But for me, at least,
*  I think it was just a process of years of years and years of trying, and finally,
*  of beating my head in the wall, and finally, little by little giving up that beating of the
*  head. But there doesn't seem to be any trick. Everybody wants a hack these days,
*  and I don't think there is a hack. If you look at it in terms of the goddess, the muse,
*  she's watching you down there, beating your head in the ball. You're like a Marine going
*  through an obstacle course, or a martial artist trying to learn like Uma Thurman in the casket,
*  trying to make that little four inch punch. The muse or the goddess is just watching going,
*  Lex, he's trying, he's trying. I'm going to come back in another couple of months and see if he's
*  still there. And finally, she'll say, all right, he's had it, he's paid his dues. I'm going to give
*  it to him. So the hard work and the suffering, yeah. But I'm also being Russian in wrestling
*  and martial arts. We're big into drilling technique. I was also just even getting at,
*  certainly there's no shortcut, but is there a process? So the process of practice.
*  So you had two, one you had an example of meditation. So it's essentially the practice
*  of meditation. I think so. Drill, I think is a good way to look at it too. But what are you
*  drilling? You're just sitting and- You're writing, you know? Just writing. You're writing,
*  then you're looking at what you wrote, you know? You're hitting moments when it flows,
*  you know? And in your other hitting moments where you just can't do anything and you're trying to,
*  from the moments where it flowed, you're trying to come back and look at it and say, what did I do?
*  How did that happen? Where was my mind, you know? But I think it's just a process of over and over
*  and over and over until finally it gets a little bit easier. And did you always, when you read
*  something you write, did you always have a pretty good radar for what's good and not after it's
*  written? No. I think I do now, but no. It was always really hard for me to know what was good.
*  I mean, do you edit, the process of editing is the process of looking at what you've written
*  and improving it? Are you a better writer or an editor? How often do you edit?
*  That's another great question. Great question. Because I do think that in writing,
*  the real process of looking at it is the process that an editor does rather than what a writer does.
*  The gentleman I was just talking to on the phone is my editor, Sean Coyne, who was the guy who
*  bought Gates of Fire when he was an editor at Doubleday. And who basically, when I finish a
*  book, I give it to him. And he gives me, editing doesn't really mean like crossing out commas.
*  It really means looking at the overall work and saying, does it work? And if it doesn't work,
*  why doesn't it work? Is there something wrong here? Like if you were building the Golden Gate Bridge,
*  you know, in one span was out of whack, you know, you could, and I think a really skilled editor,
*  which Sean is, understands what makes a story tick. And he also has the perspective that I've
*  lost in something I've wrote because I'm so close to it to say, you know, this isn't working and
*  that is working. What kind of advice has he given you? Is it like layout? Like this story doesn't
*  flow correctly. Like you shouldn't start at this point. Or does he even sit back at a higher level
*  and say, I see what you're doing, but you could do better. No, he doesn't do that. Okay. But a lot
*  of it is about genre and kind of the defining what genre you're working in. And I'm going to get up
*  here to just bring something over here for the camera. This was one where Sean tore this down
*  and made me start from scratch. And what the specifics of it were really, this is a supernatural
*  thriller. That's the genre, sort of like Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist. And what he made, what he
*  showed me was that I had violated certain conventions of the genre, you know, that,
*  and you just can't do that. You know, it's got to be, you know, it has to be done the right way.
*  And so he pointed out certain things to me. So he must be a prolific reader himself too, actually.
*  That's such a tough job of editor. Yeah. Again, he was sort of born to do that. He just kind of
*  glommed onto it. But since he was his first job publishing, you know,
*  cat thrillers, you know, cat detective, you know, he studied how it works, what makes a story work,
*  et cetera, et cetera. And so he really, he's great. And I think any really successful writer,
*  unless they're utterly brilliant on their own, has got to have a great editor behind them.
*  But you yourself edit as well. I'm constantly trying to learn from him and teach myself.
*  Everything you see in my blog posts that is about the craft of writing is me trying to teach myself
*  the rules so that, you know, I'm sure it's the same in martial arts or anything else, right? You
*  try to not be dependent on that other person because it's so painful to make those mistakes.
*  You really feel like, God, I wish I could get it right the first time the next time I do it.
*  Well, in research, we go through that. In research, more than writing. So what you do is a little more
*  solitary. In research, there's usually two, three, four people working on something together, and we
*  write a paper and there's that painful process of where you write it down and then you share it with
*  other. And not only do they criticize the writing, they criticize the fundamental
*  aspects of the approach you've taken. I would think so. So it's exactly like,
*  you know, they would say you're attacking, you're asking the wrong questions, right?
*  And that's extremely, you know, painful, especially when you watch, yes, painful and helpful,
*  but there's disagreement and so on. And through that comes out a better product.
*  Yeah.
*  As you want to still have an ego, but you also want to silence it every once in a while. So there's
*  a balance. In your book, The War of Art, you talk about resistance with the capital R as the invisible
*  force in this universe of ours that finds a way to prevent you from starting or doing the work.
*  Where do you think resistance comes from? Why is there a force in our mind that's constantly
*  trying to jeopardize our efforts with laziness, excuses, and so on?
*  That's another great question. I mean, in Jewish mysticism, in Kabbalistic thinking,
*  it's called the Yetzer Hura, right? And it's a force that if this up here is your soul of Neshema
*  trying to talk to you, us down here, the Yetzer Hura is this negative force in the middle. So I'm
*  not the only one that ever thought about this. And I don't know if anybody really knows the
*  answer, but here's my answer. I think that there are two places where we as human beings can seat
*  our identity. One is the ego, the conscious ego, and the other is the greater self. And the self,
*  in the Jungian sense, the self in the Jungian sense includes the unconscious and butts up against
*  what Jung called the divine ground, which what I would call the muse, the goddess, or whatever.
*  And I think the ego is just this little dot inside this bigger self. And the ego has a
*  completely different view of life from the self. The ego believes, I'm going to give you a long
*  answer here, Lex. No, perfect. The ego believes that death is real. The ego believes that time
*  and space are real. The ego believes that each one of us is separate from the other. I'm separate
*  from you. I could punch you in the face and it wouldn't hurt me. It would only hurt you.
*  And in the ego's world, the dominant emotion is fear because we are all made of flesh. We can all
*  die. We can all be hurt. We can all be ruined. So we are protecting ourselves and even our desire
*  to create, as we were talking about before, comes out of that fear of death. The self, on the other
*  hand, the greater self that butts up against the divine ground believes that death is not real,
*  that time and space are not real, that the gods travel swift as thought. And the ego also believes
*  that the self believes that there's no difference between you and me, that we're all one. If I hurt
*  you, I hurt myself, karma. And in the world of the self, of the greater self, the dominant emotion is
*  love, not fear. So I think that, I'll go farther back here, a long way to answer your question.
*  When Jesus died on the cross, or when the 300 Spartans willingly sacrificed their lives at
*  Thermopylae, they were acting according to the rules of the self. Death is not real, no difference
*  between you and me, time and space are not real, predominant emotion is love. So in my opinion,
*  and we as conscious human vessels are in a struggle between these two things, the ego
*  and the self. To me, resistance is the voice of the ego saying, and it's a fearful voice, because
*  if, when we identify with the self, we move our consciousness over to the self, as artists or
*  scientists opening ourselves up to the cosmic dimension, to the other forces, the ego is
*  tremendously threatened by that. Because if we're in that space, that head space, we don't need the
*  ego anymore. So I think resistance is a voice of the ego trying to keep control of us. In a way,
*  I'll give you a bad example, Trump is the ego. That's probably a very good example, right?
*  Yes. It's a zero sum world for him. And for anybody that's in that. And the opposite of that
*  would be somebody like Martin Luther King or Gandhi. And that's of course why they all wind
*  up getting assassinated. Because that voice, that ego is hanging on to itself and feels so threatened
*  by, I could talk more about this if you want.
*  No, for sure. That's fascinating. It's interesting why the fear is attached to the ego.
*  I really like this dichotomy of ego and the self and that struggle. It's just,
*  ego has the self obsession of it. Why fear is such a predominant thing? Why is resistance
*  trying to undermine everything? It's fear. It's out of fear. Let's think about the whole thing
*  in terms of stories. In a story, the villain is always resistance, is always the ego. The hero
*  is always, of course, always not everything, but you know what I mean? Pretty much represents
*  kind of the self. If you think about the alien on the spaceship, that's like the ultimate kind of
*  villain. It keeps changing form. First it goes on the guy's face, then it pops out of his chest,
*  but it always just has that one monomaniacal thing to destroy. Just like the ego, just like resistance.
*  Maybe alien is a bad example because Sigourney Weaver has to sort of
*  fight on the same terms as the alien. But maybe a better example might be something like Casablanca.
*  Where in the end, the Humphrey Bogart character has to, acting out, operating out of the self,
*  has to give up his selfish dream of going off with Ingrid Bergman, Neil Ceylon, the love of his life,
*  and instead puts her on the plane to Lisbon while he goes off to fight the Nazis in the desert.
*  I don't know if that's clear, but in almost every story, the villain is the ego,
*  is resistance, is fear, is that zero-sum thing. And in almost every story, the hero
*  is someone that is willing to make a sacrifice to help others.
*  It's letting go of that fear is what leads to productivity and to success.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think there's a... This is probably the answer, it's either obvious or impossible,
*  but do you think there's an evolutionary advantage to resistance? What would life look like without
*  resistance? That's another great question. I also believe that resistance, like death,
*  gives meaning to life. If we didn't have it, it's gonna be... What would we be? We'd be in
*  the Garden of Eden picking fruit and just happy and stupid. And I do think that that myth of the
*  Garden of Eden is really about this kind of thing, where Adam and Eve decide to take matters into
*  their own hands and acquire knowledge that until then, God had said, I'm the only one that's got
*  that knowledge. And of course, once they've acquired that knowledge, they're cast out into
*  the world you and I live in now, where they do have to deal with that fear and they do have to
*  deal with all that stuff. The human condition. The human condition and the meaning and the purpose
*  comes from the resistance being there and the struggle to overcome it.
*  To overcome it, right. And also the other aspect of it is that it's not real at all. It's not even
*  like it's an actual force. It's all here, right? So the sort of... In a way, it's sort of a surrender
*  to it, you know? Or it's sort of like turning on the light in a dark thing. It's like, it's gone.
*  But not quite because it's never really... Not quite, because it comes back again tomorrow morning.
*  Exactly. So you have to keep changing light bulbs every day. So what's been, maybe recently,
*  but in general, maybe in your life, what's been the most relentless or one of the more relentless
*  sources of resistance to you personally? I mean, it's always the same. It's about writing for me
*  and evolving within my own body of work. It never goes away. It never gets any less.
*  Do you have particular excuses, particular justifications that come out?
*  No, it's always the same. Well, I would say it's always the same, but it's really not because
*  resistance is so protean. It keeps changing form. And as you move to hopefully a higher level,
*  resistance gets a little more nuanced and a little more subtle trying to fake you out. But
*  I think you learn that it's always there and you're always going to have to face it.
*  I mean, your battle is sitting down and writing to some number of words to a blank page.
*  Yeah. Do you have a process there with this battle? Do you have a number of hours
*  that you put in? Yeah, I'm definitely a believer that even though this battle is
*  fought on the highest sort of spiritual level, that the way you fight it is on the most mundane.
*  I'm sure it's like martial arts must be the same way. I mean, I go to the gym
*  first thing in the morning and I sort of am rehearsing myself. The gym is called
*  resistance training, right? You're working against resistance, right? And I don't want to go. I don't
*  want to get out of bed. I hate that. But I'm sort of fortifying myself to be ready for the day.
*  And like I said, over knock wood, over years, I've learned to sort of get into the right kind of
*  mindset and it's not as hard for me as it used to be. The real resistance, I think, for me,
*  and I think this is true for anybody, is the question of sort of what's the next idea?
*  What's the next book? What's the next project that you're going to work on? And when I ask that
*  question, I'm asking it of the muse. I'm kind of saying, what do you want me? Or I'm asking it of
*  my own conscious. If we're looking at Bruce Springsteen's albums, it's kind of, well,
*  what's the next album? Now he's on Broadway. That was a great idea, right?
*  Where'd that come from? And then for him, what's after that? Because
*  that body of work is already alive. It already exists inside us, kind of like a woman's biological
*  clock. And we have to serve it. Otherwise it'll give us cancer. I don't mean to say that if anybody
*  has cancer that they're not, but you know what I mean? It'll take its revenge on us. So the next
*  resistance to me is sort of, or a big aspect of it is what's next? When I finish the book I'm working
*  on now, I'm not sure what I'm going to do next. And I see at the same time you have a kind of,
*  you have a sense that there's a Bruce Springsteen single line of albums. So it's already known
*  somewhere in the universe what you're going to do next is the sense you have. In a sense, yes. I
*  don't know if it's like predetermined, but there's something like that. Yeah, I'd like to believe
*  that there's, it's kind of like quantum mechanics, I guess. Once you observe it, maybe once you talk
*  to the muse, it's one thing for sure. It was always going to be that one thing. But really,
*  in reality, it's a distribution. It could be any number of things. Yeah, I think so. There's
*  alternate realities. Alternate realities. But they're not that far apart. I mean, Bruce Springsteen
*  is not going to write a Joni Mitchell song, you know? No matter how hard he tries. He still did
*  that, which is not a Bruce Springsteen thing to do. So I think you're being, in retrospect,
*  I think it is a Bruce Springsteen thing to do. It's a next sort of evolution for him. Why not
*  take his music to there? In retrospect, it all makes perfect sense, I think. Yeah. Because if
*  you pull it off, especially, do you visualize yourself completing the work? Like Olympic
*  athletes visualize getting the gold medal. Do you, you know, they go through, I mean,
*  that's actually a really, you can learn something from athletes on that is years out, certainly
*  two, three years out, some people do much longer. Every day you visualize how the day of the
*  championship will go. Down to, I mean, everything, down to how it would feel to stand on the podium
*  and so on. Do you do anything like that in how you approach writing? No. Because it's always in the
*  moment. Yeah, it is in the moment, I think. Because it's such a mystery. You just don't know. I think
*  it's different from sports. Right. Because you don't know the destiny. There's no gold medal
*  at the end. No. In fact, I would like to think that as soon as you finish one,
*  the next day you're on the other. And in fact, hopefully you've already started the other.
*  You're already, you know, 100 pages into the other when you finish the first one. But it is a,
*  it's a journey. It's a process. I don't think it is a, in fact, I think it's very dangerous to think
*  that way. To think, oh, this, I'm going to win the Oscar, you know. It's interesting for the creative
*  process. It might be dangerous. It's a, maybe you can, like, why is that dangerous? Because
*  I kind of know. Because it's the ego. It's the ego. Because you're giving yourself over to the ego.
*  I keep saying this myself. My job, I'm a servant of the muse. I'm there to do what she tells me to do.
*  And if I suddenly think, Oh, I'm really, I just want to, you know, whatever the muse doesn't like
*  that. Yeah. And, you know, and she's on another dimension for me.
*  I'm trying to square that because I think it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,
*  trying to square that because I agree. I'm trying to square that with the,
*  I think there's a meditation to visualizing success in the athletic realm to where it focuses,
*  it removes everything else away to where you focus on this particular battle. I mean,
*  I think that you can do that in many kinds of ways. And in sports, the ego serves
*  a more important role, I think, than it does in writing. The ego, there's something.
*  Well, let me, when you say that, I know what you mean, Lex. And I do think there is a sort of a,
*  you know, it's interesting to watch interviews with Steph Curry, who's such, obviously such a nice guy,
*  but he's got such tremendous self-confidence, you know, that it, but it doesn't border on ego so
*  much because he's worked so hard for it, you know, but he knows, so he has visualized, he has
*  visualized maybe not so much winning, you know, as just him being the best he can be, him being in
*  the flow, you know, doing his thing that he knows he can do. And I do think in the creative world,
*  yeah, there is a sort of a thing like that where you, where, and, you know, a choreographer or
*  filmmaker or whatever might be, do an internal thing where they're saying, I can make an Oscar
*  winning movie, I can direct this movie, you know, I'm banishing these thoughts that I'm not good
*  enough. I can do that. I can edit it, I can score it, I can, you know, bump it, bump it, bump.
*  But, and I don't think that's really ego. I think that's, that's part of the process in a good way,
*  like an athlete does that. So extreme confidence is what some of the best athletes come with. And
*  you think it's possible to, as a writer, to have extreme confidence in yourself? I do think so,
*  you know, that I'm sure when John Lennon sat down to write a song, he felt like,
*  shit, I can do this, you know? I'm not so sure. I think, because the great artists I've seen,
*  you're haunted by self-doubt. It's that resistance, I mean, the confidence. Yes, but I mean, I guess,
*  but even beyond the self, within the self, above the self-doubt. Oh, it's the bigger picture.
*  Self-belief, you know? Yeah, I'm freaking out. Yeah, I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to,
*  but you know, I know I can do this. Yeah. And when you look at, when you take a bigger picture,
*  yeah. So the writing process, is it fundamentally lonely? So-
*  No, because you're with your characters. You are.
*  So you really put yourself in the world. Absolutely. You know, I've written about
*  this before that I used to have, my desk used to face a wall instead of seeing, and people would
*  say, well, don't you want to look out the window? But I'm in here. I mean, I'm seeing, you know,
*  the Spartans, I'm seeing, you know, whatever. And the characters that are on the page,
*  whether you create, are not accidents. You know, they're coming out of some issue, some deep issue
*  that you have, whether you realize it or not. You might not realize it until 20 years later,
*  or somebody explains it to you. So your characters are kind of fascinating to you.
*  And their dilemmas are fascinating to you. And you're also trying to come to grips with them.
*  You know, you sort of see them through a glass darkly, you know, and you really want to see them
*  more clearly. So yeah, no, it's not lonely at all. In fact, I'm more lonely sometimes later,
*  going out to dinner with some people and actually talking to people.
*  Do you miss the characters after it's over?
*  Let's say I have affection for them, kind of like children that have gone off to college and now
*  are, you know, you only see them at Thanksgiving. Definitely I have affection for them. Even the bad
*  guys.
*  Maybe especially the bad guys?
*  Especially the bad guys.
*  You've said that writers, even successful writers, are often not tough minded enough.
*  I've read that in the post. That you have to be a professional in the way you handle your emotions.
*  You have to be a bit of a warrior to be a writer. So what are, what do you think makes a warrior?
*  Is it, is a warrior born or trained in the realm, in the bigger realm, in the realm of the
*  writing, in the creative process?
*  I think they're born to some extent. You have the gift, like you might have the gift as a martial
*  artist to do whatever martial artists do, but the training is the big thing. 90% training, 10%,
*  10% genetics. And you know, I use another analogy other than warrior as far as writer, and it's like
*  to be a mother. If you think about, if you're a writer or any creative person, you're giving birth
*  to something, right? You're carrying a new life inside you. And in terms of bravery, if your child,
*  your two year old child is underneath a car, is coming down the street, the mother's going to like
*  stop a Buick, you know, with her bare hands. So that's another way to think about how a writer
*  has to think about, or any creative person has to think about, I think, what they're doing.
*  This child, this new creation that they're bringing forth.
*  Yeah, so the hard work that's underlying that, I've just a couple weeks ago talked to,
*  just happened to be in the same room, both gave talks, Arianna Huffington. I did this conversation with her.
*  I didn't know much about her before then, but she has recently been, she wrote a couple books,
*  and she wrote a couple books, and been promoting a lifestyle where she basically, she created
*  the Huffington Post, and she gave herself like, I don't know, 20 hours a day, just obsessed with her work.
*  And then she fainted, passed out, and kind of, there were some health issues. And so she wrote this book
*  saying that, you know, sleep, basically you want to establish a lifestyle that doesn't sacrifice health,
*  that's productive, but doesn't sacrifice health. She thinks that you can have both, productivity and health.
*  Criticizing Elon Musk, who I've also spoken with, for working too hard, and thereby sacrificing,
*  you know, being less effective than he could be. So I'm trying to get at this balance between health
*  and obsessively working at something, and really working hard. So what Arianna is talking about makes sense to me,
*  but I'm a little bit torn. To me, passion and reason do not overlap much, or at all, sometimes.
*  Maybe I'm being too Russian, but I feel madness and obsession does not care for health or sleep or diet or any of that.
*  And hard work is hard work, and everything else can go to hell. So if you're really focused on what it's writing a book,
*  everything should just go to hell. Where do you stand on this balance? How important is health for productivity?
*  How important is it to sort of get sleep and so on?
*  I'm on the health side. I mean, there was a period of my life when I was just, I had no obligations,
*  and I was just living in a little house and just working nonstop, you know?
*  But even then, I would get up in the morning and I would have liver and eggs for breakfast every day,
*  and I would do my, you know, exercise, whatever it was. But although I was still doing like, you know, 18 hours a day.
*  But I'm definitely, I kind of think of it sort of like an athlete does.
*  I'm sure that like Steph Curry is totally committed to winning championships and stuff like that.
*  But he has his family, he sees his family, you know, the family is always there.
*  I'm sure he eats, you know, perfect, great stuff, gets his sleep, you know, gets the training,
*  you know, whatever a trainer does to him for his knees and his ankles and whatever.
*  So I, or Kobe Bryant or anybody that's operating at a high level.
*  So I do think I'm from that kind of the health school.
*  The good thing about being a writer is you can't work for many hours a day.
*  You know, four hours is like the maximum I can work. I've never been able to work more than that.
*  I don't know how people do it. I've heard of people do 10, 12, I don't know how they do it.
*  So that gives you a lot of other time to optimize your health.
*  Yeah, because you need to. You're in training, you know, you're really you're burning up a lot of B vitamins when you're working here.
*  Yeah, but maybe it's a Russian thing with your legs.
*  Well, it's not even a Russian thing. I mean, it also may be youth, you know, at 35 you can be crazy.
*  You know, that's that's that they they they keep telling me, but I'm pretty sure I'll be added still at a later time, too.
*  I think it has to do with the career choice, too.
*  I think writing is almost for everything I've heard.
*  It's almost impossible to do more than a few hours really well.
*  The when you start to get into certain disciplines like the Lamas can be engineering disciplines that really there's a lot more.
*  Non muse time. Right.
*  So the crazy hours that you're talking that you often are talking about have to be done.
*  And it doesn't think that's true.
*  Yeah. So there's still the two, three hours of muse time needed for truly genius ideas.
*  But it's it's something something I certainly struggle with.
*  But, yeah, I I hear you a lot unclear on the health.
*  So what is a perfect day look like for you if we're talking about writing an hour by hour schedule of a perfect day?
*  I get up early. I go to the gym.
*  I have breakfast with some friends of mine.
*  I was early, by the way. That's like a how early.
*  15 a.m. a.m.
*  So we're talking really early, really early.
*  Now I'm crazy early. It's ridiculously early.
*  Yeah. But and I haven't done that always, but that's kind of what what what I'm on now.
*  So I'm in bed like when I'm with my my nephews that are like four years old and three years old.
*  I'm in bed before them. OK.
*  You got to be you wake up. Sorry.
*  You said exercise first. Yeah.
*  And what does that look like? What's exercise for you?
*  I go to the gym. OK.
*  I have a trainer. I have a couple of guys that I work out with.
*  And I'll you know, it's maybe an hour, maybe a little more.
*  I'll do a little warm up before stretching afterwards.
*  Take a shower. Go have breakfast.
*  But it's an intense kind of a thing that I definitely don't want to do.
*  That's hard. You know, so you feel like you've accomplished something.
*  First thing. Yeah. That's a big accomplishment of the day.
*  At the same time, it's not like so hard that I'm completely exhausted, you know.
*  And then I'll come home and handle whatever correspondence and stuff has to be done.
*  And then I work for maybe three hours and then I just sort of crash.
*  The office is closed. I turn the switch. I don't think about any.
*  I don't think about anything. I don't think about the work at all.
*  Do you listen to oh, you mean afterwards?
*  Afterwards. Once the office is closed.
*  But during, so it was like 12 to 3 kind of thing.
*  Something like that. Yeah.
*  Do you listen to music? No.
*  Do you have anything? But that's just me.
*  I mean, I don't think, you know, but somebody could do it a million different ways.
*  It's fascinating. It's fascinating.
*  You know, the, I mean, you've also, of most, of many writers, you've really,
*  but like I've read Stephen Kington writing,
*  you've optimized this conversation with the muse you're having,
*  not optimized, but you've at least thought about it.
*  So what's, can you say a little bit more about the trivialities of that process of,
*  like you said, facing the wall?
*  What's, do you have little rituals?
*  You mean like the granular aspect of it?
*  The granular aspects, yeah.
*  I do have little rituals.
*  I do have all kinds of, which I'm not even going to tell you about.
*  But the one thing, and I don't want to like talk about this too much
*  because it sort of jinxes things, I think,
*  but the one thing I do try to do is when I sit down, I immediately get into it.
*  First second. Yeah.
*  I don't sit and fuck around with anything.
*  I immediately try to get into it as quickly as I can.
*  The other thing is that writing a book or screenplay or anything like that
*  is a process of multiple drafts.
*  And it's the first draft that's where you're most with the muse,
*  where you're going through the blank page.
*  Like right now I'm on, I don't know what, the fifth or sixth,
*  seventh draft of something I'm working on.
*  So I've got pages already written, and I'm kind of reading them afresh
*  as I go through the story.
*  So it's not quite where I am now.
*  It's not quite a deep muse scenario.
*  Partly it is, but it's also sort of bouncing back and forth
*  between the different, between the right brain and the left brain.
*  I'm kind of looking at it and trying to evaluate it,
*  then I'm going into it and try to change it a little bit.
*  When, do you know, sit down, get right into it,
*  do you know the night before of what that starting point is?
*  I always try to stop, and I learned this,
*  I think Hemingway wrote about this, or John Steinbeck,
*  or maybe both of them, to always stop when you kind of know what's coming next.
*  So you're not facing a chasm, you know?
*  Yeah. Okay, so afterwards when you're done, the office is closed.
*  The office is closed. I let the muse take care of it, you know?
*  And I don't want to, and I think it's a very unhealthy thing
*  to worry about it or think about any creative process.
*  You don't, like on a long walk later, think about...
*  Yeah, then I will sort of keep my mind open to it,
*  but I won't be like obsessing about it.
*  Because actually on walks, sometimes things will pop in your head, you know,
*  and you'll go, oh, I should change that.
*  But that's not your ego doing it, that's the deeper level.
*  Okay, so how does the day end?
*  In terms of writing?
*  So yeah, the writing, the office door closes,
*  and then the rest of the day you just do whatever the hell.
*  Maybe go out to dinner, my girlfriend is not here now,
*  she's in New York working, we'll make dinner or whatever,
*  go out to dinner, something like that,
*  maybe I'll read something, nothing heavy,
*  and I go to bed pretty early.
*  And the gym is a big thing for me.
*  I'll already, probably like with you with martial arts,
*  the night before I'll be visualizing what I have to do the next day
*  and getting myself psyched up for that.
*  And then I'll just conk out like a light and wake up at the crack of dawn.
*  So looking out into the future, this year, next few years,
*  what do you think the Muse has in store for you?
*  I don't think you can ever know.
*  It's probably something along the same lines.
*  I really believe, you know, there's that exercise where they say to you,
*  visualize yourself five years in the future,
*  then write a letter from that person to yourself.
*  I don't believe in that at all.
*  Because I don't think you can, you know,
*  there's a line in Out of Africa that God made the world round
*  so that we couldn't see too far ahead.
*  You just don't know as a writer or as a creator.
*  I personally, you know, I never knew.
*  My first book was A Legend of Bagger Vance.
*  Before that happened, I had no clue that I was going to be writing anything like that
*  subject, anything at all, no clue until it just sort of came.
*  And then when that was done, people said, well, you've got to write another one.
*  I had no idea what it was, which was going to be Gates of Fire.
*  No clue.
*  So if somebody had sat me down at the start of that and asked the question,
*  I would have been crazy to say it.
*  So I just hope as the future unfolds that I'm open to it, you know?
*  Well, I think I speak for a lot of people in saying that we look forward to what that future looks like.
*  Stephen, thank you so much for talking today.
*  It was fun.
*  You've got the best job in the world going around talking to people that you want to talk to
*  and that they will talk to you, you know?
*  So thank you for doing it.
*  Thank you for the great questions you made me think.
*  Certainly a bunch of questions I never have answered before.
*  Awesome.
*  So thanks a lot.
*  Great.

*  Are you paralyzed by fear?
*  That's a good sign.
*  Here is good.
*  Like self doubt, fear is an indicator.
*  Fear tells us what we have to do.
*  Remember one rule of thumb.
*  The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
