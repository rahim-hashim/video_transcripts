# Sheldon Solomon: Death and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #117
**Lex Fridman:** [August 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfKyNxfyWbo)
*  The following is a conversation with Sheldon Solomon, a social psychologist, a philosopher,
*  co-developer of terror management theory, and co-author of The Warm at the Core on the Role of
*  Death in Life. He further carried the ideas of Ernest Becker that can crudely summarize as the
*  idea that our fear of death is at the core of the human condition and the driver of most of the
*  creations of human civilization. Quick summary of the sponsors, Blinkist, ExpressVPN, and CashApp.

*  this podcast. Let me say as a side note that Ernest Becker's book, Denial of Death, had a big
*  impact on my thinking about human cognition, consciousness, and the deep ocean currents of
*  our mind that are behind the surface behaviors we observe. Many people have told me that they
*  think about death or don't think about death, fear death or don't fear death, but I think not
*  many people think about this topic deeply, rigorously, in the way that Nietzsche suggested.
*  This topic, like many that lead to deep personal self-reflection, frankly is dangerous for the mind,
*  as all first principles thinking about the human condition is. If you gaze long into the abyss,
*  like Nietzsche said, the abyss will gaze back into you. I have been recently reading a lot
*  about World War II, Stalin, and Hitler. It feels to me that there is some fundamental truth there
*  to be discovered in the moments of history that changed everything, the suffering, the triumphs.
*  If I bring up Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin in these conversations, it is never through
*  a political lens. I am not left nor right. I think for myself, deeply, and often question
*  everything, changing my mind as often as is needed. I ask for your patience, empathy,
*  and rigorous thinking. If you arrive to this podcast from a place of partisanship,
*  if you hate Trump or love Trump or any other political leader, no matter what he or they do,
*  and see everyone who disagrees with you as delusional, I ask that you unsubscribe and
*  don't listen to these conversations because my hope is to go beyond that kind of divisive thinking.
*  I think we can only make progress toward truth through deep and pathetic thinking and conversation,
*  and as always, love. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars

*  with Sheldon Solomon. What is the role of death and fear of death in life?
*  Well, from our perspective, the uniquely human awareness of death and our unwillingness to accept
*  that fact, we would argue is the primary motivational impetus for almost everything that
*  people do, whether they're aware of it or not. So that's kind of been your life work. Your
*  view of the human condition is that death, you've written the book Warm at the Core,
*  that death is at the core of our consciousness of everything, of how we see the world, of what
*  drives us. Maybe can you elaborate how you see death fitting in? What does it mean to be at the
*  core of our being? So I think that's a great question. And to be pedantic, I usually start
*  my psychology classes and I say to the students, okay, let's define our terms. And the ology part,
*  they get right away. It's the study of, and then we get to the psyche part.
*  And understandably, the students are like, oh, that means mind. And I'm like, well, no, that's a
*  modern interpretation. But in ancient Greek, it means soul, but not in the Cartesian dualistic
*  sense that most of us in the West think when that word comes to mind. And so you hear the word soul
*  and you're like, well, all right, that's the non-physical part of me that's potentially
*  detachable from my corporal container when I'm no longer here. But Aristotle's, who coined the word
*  psyche, I think, he was not a dualist. He was a monist. He thought that the soul was inextricably
*  connected to the body. And he defined soul as the essence of a natural body that is alive.
*  And then he goes on and he says, all right, let me give you an example. If an axe was alive,
*  the soul of an axe would be to chop. And if you can pluck your eyeball out of your head
*  and it was still functioning, then the soul of the eyeball would be to see.
*  You know, and then he's like, all right, the soul of a grasshopper is to hop, the soul of a woodpecker
*  is to peck, which raises the question, of course, what is the essence of what it means to be human?
*  And here, of course, there is no one universally accepted conception of the essence of our humanity.
*  All right, Aristotle, you know, gives us the idea of humans as rational animals. You know,
*  we're homo sapiens. But not the only game in town got Joseph Huysinger, an anthropologist in the
*  20th century. He called us homo ludens that were basically fundamentally playful creatures.
*  And I think it was Hannah Arendt, homo faber, were tool making creatures. Another woman,
*  Ellen Dizenayake, wrote a book called Homo Aestheticus. And following Aristotle and his
*  poetic, she's like, well, we're not only rational animals, we're also aesthetic creatures that
*  appreciate beauty. There's another take on humans, I think they call us homo narratans.
*  We're storytelling creatures. And I think all of those designations of what it means to be human
*  are quite useful heuristically and certainly worthy of our collective cogitation. But what
*  garnered my attention when I was a young punk was just a single line in an essay by a Scottish guy
*  who was Alexander Smith in a book called Dreamthorpe. I think it's written in the
*  1860s. He just says right in the middle of an essay, it is our knowledge that we have to die
*  that makes us human. And I remember reading that. And in my gut, I was like, oh, man,
*  I don't like that. But I think you're on to something. And then William James, the great
*  Harvard philosopher and arguably the first academic psychologist, he referred to death
*  as the worm at the core of the human condition. So that's where the worm at the core idea comes in.
*  And that's just an allusion to the story of Genesis back in the proverbial old days in the
*  Garden of Eden. Everything was going tremendously well until the serpent tempts Eve to take a chomp
*  out of the apple of the tree of knowledge and Adam partakes also. And this is, according to the Bible,
*  what brings death into the world. And from our vantage point, the story of Genesis is a
*  remarkable allegorical recount of the origin of consciousness where we get to the point
*  where by virtue of our vast intelligence, we come to realize the inevitability of death.
*  And so the apple is beautiful and it's tasty. But when you get right into the middle of it,
*  there's that ugly reality, which is our finitude. And then fast forward a bit. And I was a young
*  professor at Skidmore College in 1980. My PhD is in experimental social psychology. And I mainly
*  did studies with clinical psychologists evaluating the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions
*  to reduce stress. And that was good work and I found it interesting. But in my first week as a
*  professor at Skidmore, I'm just walking up and down the shelves of the library, saw some books
*  by a guy I had never heard of, Ernest Becker, a cultural anthropologist, recently deceased. He
*  died in 1974. After weeks before actually, he was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize in
*  non-fiction for his book, The Denial of Death. And that was his last book?
*  It's actually his next to last book. I don't know how you pulled this off, but he had one more after
*  he died called Escape from Evil. And evidently it was supposed to, originally the denial of
*  death was supposed to be this giant thousand page book that was both. And they split it up and what
*  became Escape from Evil, his wife Marie Becker finished. Well, be that as it may, it is in the
*  denial of death where Becker just says in the first paragraph, I believe, that the terror of death
*  and the way that human beings respond to it or decline to respond to it is primarily responsible
*  for almost everything we do, whether we're aware of it or not. And mostly we're not. And so I read
*  that first paragraph, Lex, and I was like, wow, okay, this dude-
*  You're onto something.
*  You're onto something.
*  It's the same thing here.
*  It's the same thing. And then it reminded me, I think, not to play psychologist, but,
*  let's face it, I believe there's a reason why we end up drifting where we ultimately come to.
*  So I'm in my mid-20s, I got Ernest Becker's book in my hand. And the next thing I know,
*  I'm remembering when I'm eight years old, the day that my grandmother died.
*  And the day before, my mom said, oh, say goodbye to grandma. She's not well.
*  And so I was like, okay, grandma. And I knew she wasn't well, but I didn't really appreciate
*  the magnitude of her illness. Well, she dies the next day. And it's in the evening and I'm just
*  sitting there looking at my stamp collection. And I'm like, wow, I'm going to miss my grandmother.
*  And then I'm like, no, wait a minute. That means my mother's going to die after she gets old.
*  And that's even worse. After all, who's going to make me dinner?
*  And that bothered me for a while, but then I'm looking at the stamps, all the dead American
*  presidents. And I'm like, there's George Washington, he's dead. There's Thomas Jefferson,
*  he's dead. My mom's going to be dead. Oh, I'm going to get old and be dead someday.
*  And at eight years old, that was my first explicit existential crisis. I remember it being,
*  you know, one of these blood curdling realizations that I tried my best to ignore
*  for the most of the time I was subsequently growing up. But fast forward back to Skidmore
*  College, mid 20s, you know, reading Becker's book in the 1980s, thinking to myself, wow,
*  one of the reasons why I'm finding this so compelling is that it squares with my own
*  personal experience. And then to make a short story long and I'll shut up, Lex, but what grabbed me
*  about Becker, and this is in part because I read a lot of his other books, there's another book,
*  The Birth and Death of Meaning, which is framed from an evolutionary perspective.
*  And then the denial of death is really more framed from an existential psychodynamic vantage point.
*  And as a young academic, I was really taken by what I found to be a very potent juxtaposition
*  that you really don't see that often. Yet usually evolutionary types are eager to dismiss the
*  psychodynamic types and vice versa. And maybe only John Bowlby, you know, there's other folks, but
*  the attachment theorist, John Bowlby, was really one of the first serious academics to say these
*  these ways of thinking about things are quite compatible.
*  Can you comment on what a psychodynamics view of the world is versus an evolutionary view of the
*  world, just in case people are not... Oh, yeah, absolutely. That's a fine question.
*  Well, for the evolutionary types in general are interested in how it is and why it is that
*  we have adapted to our surroundings in the service of persisting over time
*  and being represented in the gene pool thereafter.
*  It used to be a fish.
*  Yes.
*  It used to be a fish and I'll end up talking on a podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  How we came to be that way.
*  How we came to be that way. And so whereas the existential psychodynamic types,
*  I would say, are more interested in development across a single lifespan,
*  but the evolutionary types dismiss the psychodynamic types as overly speculative
*  and devoid of empirical support for their views. They'll just say these guys are talking shit,
*  if you'll pardon the expression. And of course, you can turn right around and say the same about
*  the evolutionary types. They are often and rightfully criticized evolutionary psychologists
*  for what are called the just so stories, where it's like, oh, this is probably why fill in the
*  blank is potentially adaptive. And my thought again early on was I didn't see any intrinsic
*  antithesis between these viewpoints. I just found them dialectically compatible and very powerful
*  when combined.
*  So one question I would ask here is about a science being speculative. We understand so
*  little about the human mind. You said you picked up Becker's book and it felt like it was onto
*  something. That's the same thing I felt when I picked up Becker's book, probably also in my
*  early 20s. I read a lot of philosophy, but it felt like the question of the meaning of life,
*  this seemed to be the most, the closest to the truth somehow. It was onto something.
*  So I guess the question that I want to ask also is like, how speculative is psychology? How
*  all of your life's work? How confident do you feel about the whole thing?
*  About understanding our mind. I feel confidently,
*  unconfident to have it both ways. Like, what do we make of psychology? What it makes starting with
*  Freud's, you know, starting just, just our, or even just philosophy, even the aspects of
*  the sciences, like, you know, my field of artificial intelligence, but also physics,
*  you know, it often feels like, man, we don't really understand most of what's going on here.
*  And certainly that's true with the human mind.
*  Yeah. Well, to me, that's the proper epistemological stance.
*  I don't know anything.
*  Well, it's the Socratic, I know that I don't know, which is the first step on the path to wisdom.
*  I would argue forcefully that we know a lot more than we used to. I would argue equally forcefully,
*  not that I have a PhD in the philosophy of science, but I believe that the Thomas
*  Coons of the world are right when they point out that change is not necessarily progress.
*  And so on the one hand, I do think we know a lot more than we did back in the day when if you wanted
*  to fly, you put on some wax wings and jumped off a mountain. On the other hand, I think it's quite
*  arrogant when scientists, I'll just speak about psychological scientists, when they have the
*  audacity to mistake statistical precision for knowledge and insight. And when they make the
*  mistake in my estimation that Einstein bemoaned, and that's this idea that the mere accumulation
*  of data will necessarily result in conceptual breakthroughs. And so I like the, well, we're all,
*  I hope, appreciative of the people who trained us, but I remember my first day in graduate school
*  at the University of Kansas, they brought us into a room and on one side of the board was a quote by
*  Kurt Lewin, or Levine, famous German social psychologist, and the quote is,
*  there's nothing more useful than a good theory. And then on the other side was another quote by
*  German physicist, his name eludes me, and it was all theories are wrong. And I'm like,
*  which is it? And of course, the point is that it's both. Our theories are, I believe, powerful ways
*  to direct our attention to aspects of human affairs that might render us better able to
*  understand ourselves in the world around us. Now, I also, as an experimental psychologist,
*  I adhere to the view that theories are essentially hypothesis generating devices, and that at its
*  best, science is a dialectical interplay where you have theoretical assertions that yield
*  testable hypotheses, and that either results in the corroboration of the theory, the rejection
*  of it, or the modification thereafter. If we look at the existentialists,
*  or even like modern philosopher, psychologist types like Jordan Peterson, I'm not sure if you're
*  familiar with that. I know Jordan pretty well. We go way back, actually. If he were here with us today,
*  he would be jumping in in, I believe, very interesting and important ways. But yeah,
*  we go back 30 years ago. He was basically saying our work is nonsense.
*  Let's get into this. I'll talk to Jordan eventually on this thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Going through some rough times right now.
*  Oh, absolutely. And I wish him well. Jordan was working on his maps of meaning,
*  and we were publishing our work. And I think Jordan at the time was concerned about our vague
*  claims to the effect that all meaning is arbitrary. He takes a more Jungian, as well as evolutionary
*  view that I don't think is wrong, by the way, which is that there are certain kinds of meanings
*  that are more important, let's say religious types, and that we didn't pay sufficient attention to
*  that in our early days.
*  So can you try to elucidate what his worldview is? Because he's also a religious man.
*  So what was some of the interesting aspects of the disagreements then?
*  Yeah, well, back in the day, I just said Jordan was a young punk. We were young punks. He was
*  just kind of flailing in an animated way at some conferences saying that we-
*  You're still both kind of punks.
*  Yeah, we are both kind of punks. So I saw him three or four years ago. We spoke on a,
*  it was an awesome day. We were in Canada at the Ontario Shakespeare Festival where we were asked
*  to be on a Canadian broadcast system program. I think we were talking about Macbeth from a
*  psychodynamic perspective. And I hadn't seen him in a ton of years. And we spent two days together,
*  had a great time. We had just written our book, The Worm at the Core. And he's like,
*  you're missing a big opportunity every time you say something. You have to have your phone
*  and you have to film yourself and then you have to put it on YouTube.
*  Yeah. He was onto something that just as a small tangent,
*  it's almost sad to look at Jordan Peterson and somebody like yourself.
*  After having done this podcast, I've realized that there is really brilliant people in this world.
*  And oftentimes, especially like when they're, I mean it with love, are a little bit like punks.
*  That's right.
*  They kind of do their own thing and the world doesn't know they exist as much as they should.
*  And it's so interesting because most people are kind of boring.
*  Yes.
*  And then the interesting ones kind of go on their own and there's not a smartphone recording.
*  No, no. That's what-
*  And it's so interesting. He was onto something that, I mean, it's interesting that I don't think
*  he was thinking from a money perspective, but he was probably thinking of connecting with people
*  or sharing his knowledge. But people don't often think that way.
*  That's right.
*  So maybe we can try to get back to, you're both brilliant people and I'd love to get some
*  interesting disagreements earlier and later about in your psychological work, in your world views.
*  Well, our disagreements today would be along two dimensions. One is he is,
*  and again, I wish he was here to correct me when I say that he is more committed to
*  the virtues of the Judeo-Christian tradition, particularly Christianity. And in a sense,
*  is a contemporary Kierkegaard of sorts when he's saying there's only one way to leap into faith.
*  And I would take ardent issue with that claim on the grounds that that is one,
*  but by no means not the only way to find meaning and value in life. And so, and I see his-
*  What's his worm at the core? What is, like, so we're talking about a little bit of a higher
*  level of discovering meaning. What's his, what does he make of death?
*  Oh, I don't know. And this is where it would be nice to have him here. He has,
*  you know, from a distance criticized our work as misguided. Having said that, though, when we were
*  together, he said something along the lines that there is no theoretical body of work in academic
*  psychology right now for which there is more empirical evidence. And so, I appreciated that.
*  He's a great researcher. He's a good clinician. The other thing that we will agree to disagree
*  about rather vociferously is ultimately political slash economic. So, I remember being at dinner
*  with him and telling him that the next book that I wanted to write was going to be called
*  Why Left and Right Are Both Beside the Point. And my argument was going to be, and it is going to be,
*  that both liberal and political, no, liberal and conservative political philosophy are each
*  intellectually and morally bankrupt because they're both framed in terms of assumptions
*  about human nature that are demonstrably false. And Jordan didn't mind me knocking
*  liberal political philosophy on those grounds. That would basically be like Steven Pinker's
*  blank slate. But he took issue when I pointed out that actually it's conservative political
*  philosophy, which starts with John Locke's assumption that in a state of nature, there
*  are no societies, just autonomous individuals who are striving for survival. That's one of the
*  most obviously patently wrong assertions in the history of intellectual thought. And Locke uses
*  that to justify his claims about the individual right to acquire unlimited amounts of property,
*  which is ultimately the justification for neoliberal economics.
*  Can you look around a little bit? Can you describe his philosophy again as view of the world and
*  neoliberal economics?
*  Yeah, let me translate it in English. So basically, these days anybody who says I'm a
*  I'm a conservative free market type, you're following John Locke and Adam Smith, whether
*  you're aware of it or not. So here's John Locke, who by the way, all of these guys are great. So
*  for me to appear to criticize any of these folks, it is with the highest regard. And also,
*  we need to understand in my estimation, how important their ideas are. Locke is working
*  in a time where all rule was top down by divine right. And he's trying desperately to come up with
*  a philosophical justification to shift power and autonomy to individuals. And he starts in his
*  second treatise on government 1690 or so, he says, okay, let's start with a state of nature. And he's
*  like in a state of nature, there's no societies, there's just individuals. And in a perfect universe,
*  there wouldn't be any societies, there would just be individuals who by the law of nature have a
*  right to survive. And in the service of survival, they have the right to acquire and preserve the
*  fruits of their own labor. But his point is, and it's actually a good one, he's following Hobbes
*  here. He's like, well, the problem with that is that people are assholes. And if they would let
*  each other alone, then we would still be living in a state of nature, everybody just doing what they
*  did to get by each day. But it's a whole lot easier if I see like an apple tree a mile away,
*  well, I can go over and pick an apple. But if you're 10 meters away with an apple in your hand,
*  it's a lot easier if I pick up a rock and crack your head and take the apple. And his point was
*  that the problem is that people can't be counted on to behave, they will take each other's property.
*  And moreover, he argued, if someone takes your property, you have the right to retribution
*  in proportion to the degree of the magnitude of the transgression. English translation,
*  if I take your apple, you have the right to take an apple back. You don't have the right to kill
*  my firstborn, but people being people, they're apt to escalate retaliatory behavior, thus creating
*  what Locke called a state of war. So he said, in order to avoid a state of war, people reluctantly
*  give up their freedom in exchange for security. They agree to obey the law and that the sole
*  function of government is to keep domestic tranquility and to ward off foreign evasion
*  in order to protect our right to property. All right, so now here's the property thing.
*  All right, so Locke says, if you look in the Bible and in nature, there is no private property.
*  And but Locke says, well, surely, you if there's anything that you own, it's your body.
*  And surely you have a right by nature to stay alive. And then by extension, anything that you
*  do where you exert effort or labor, that becomes your private property. So back to the apple tree,
*  if I walk over to an apple tree, that's everybody's apples until I pick one. And the minute I do,
*  that is my apple. And then he says, you can have as many apples as you want,
*  as long as you don't waste them. And as long as you don't impinge on somebody else's right
*  to get apples. All right, so far, so good. And then he says, well, okay, in the early days,
*  you could only eat so many apples or you could only trade so many apples with somebody else.
*  So he was like, well, if you put a fence around a bunch of apple trees, those become your apples.
*  That's your property. If somebody else wants to put a fence around Nebraska, that's their property.
*  And everybody can have as much property as they want, because the world is so big,
*  that there is no limit to what you can have if you pursue it by virtue of your own effort.
*  But then he says money came into the picture. And this is important because he noticed long before
*  anybody before the Freud's of the world, that money is funky because it has no intrinsic value.
*  He's like, oh, look at that shiny piece of metal that actually has if you're hungry,
*  and you have a choice between a carrot and a lump of gold in the desert, most people are going to
*  go for the carrot. But his point is, is that the allure of money is that it's basically a concentrated
*  symbol of wealth. But because it doesn't spoil, Locke said, you're entitled to have as much money
*  as you're able to garner. All right, then he says, well, the reality is, is that some people
*  are more the word that he used was industrious. He said some people more industrious than others.
*  All right, today we would say smarter, less lazy, more ambitious. He just said that's natural.
*  It's also true. Therefore, he argued, over time, some people are going to have a whole lot of
*  property and other people not much at all. Inequality for Locke is natural and beneficial
*  for everyone. His argument was that, you know, the rising tide lifts all boats and that the truly
*  creative and innovative are entitled to relatively unlimited worth because we're all better off
*  as a result. So the point very simply is that, well, that's basically, and then you have Adam
*  Smith, you know, in the next century with the invisible hand, where Adam Smith says,
*  everyone pursuing their own selfish, that's not necessarily pejorative. If everyone pursues their
*  own selfish interests, we will all be better off as a result. And what do you think is the
*  flaw in that way of thinking? Well, there's two flaws. One is that, well, one flaw is, first of all,
*  that it is based on an erroneous assumption to begin with, which is that there never was a time
*  in human history when we were an asocial species. In a sense, you don't feel like there's this
*  emphasis of individual autonomy is a flawed premise. Like there's something fundamentally,
*  deeply interconnected between us. I do. I think that Plato and Socrates, you know, in the Crito,
*  were closer to the truth when they started with the assumption that we were interdependent,
*  then they derived individual autonomy as a manifestation of a functional social system.
*  That's fascinating. So when Margaret Thatcher, you're too young, you know, in the 1980s,
*  she said, societies? There's no such thing as societies. There's just individuals pursuing
*  their self-interest. So that's one point where I would take issue respectfully with John Locke.
*  Point number two is when Locke says in 1690, well, England's filled up,
*  um, so if you want some land, just go to America, it's empty. Or maybe there's a few savages there,
*  just kill them. So Melville does the same thing in Moby Dick where he thinks about, well, there
*  ever come a time where we run out of whales. And he says, no, but we have run out of whales.
*  And so Locke was right maybe in 1690 that the world was large and had infinite resources.
*  He's certainly wrong today in my opinion. Also wrong is the claim that the unlimited pursuit
*  of personal wealth does not harm those around us. There is no doubt that radical inequality
*  is tragic psychologically and physically. Poverty is not that terrible. It's easy for me to say it
*  because I have a place to stay and something to eat. But as long as you're not starving and
*  have a place to be, poverty is not as challenging as being having the impoverished in close proximity
*  to those who are obscenely wealthy. So it's not the absolute measure of your well-being,
*  it's the inequality of that well-being is the feeling of the painful. So maybe just to
*  linger on the Jordan Peterson thing in terms of your disagreement in his world view. So he went
*  through quite a bit, there's been quite a bit of fire in his defense or maybe his opposition
*  of the idea of equality of outcomes. So looking at the inequality that's in our world, looking at
*  certain groups measurably having an outcome that's different than other groups, and then drawing
*  conclusions about fundamental unfairness, injustice, inequality in the system. So like systematic
*  racism, systematic sexism, systematic anything else that creates inequality. And he's been kind of
*  saying pretty simple things to say that the system for the most part is not broken or flawed.
*  Yeah.
*  That the inequality of outcomes is part of our world. What we should strive for is the
*  equality of opportunity.
*  Yeah. And I do not dispute that as an abstraction. But again, to back up for a second, I do take
*  issue with Jordan's fervent devotion to the free market and his cavalier dismissal of Marxist ideas,
*  which he has in my estimation mischaracterized in his public depictions.
*  Let's get into it. So he just seems to really not like socialism, Marxism, communism.
*  Yeah.
*  Historically speaking, sort of, I mean, how would I characterize it? I'm not exactly sure.
*  I don't want to, again, he'll eventually be here to defend himself. John Locke, unfortunately,
*  not here to defend himself.
*  Exactly.
*  But what's your sense about Marxism and the way Jordan talks about it, the way you think about it
*  from the economics, from the philosophical perspective?
*  Yeah. If we were all here together, I'd say we need to start with Marx's economic and
*  philosophical manuscripts of 1844 before Marx became more of a polemicist. And I would argue
*  that Marx's political philosophy, he's a crappy economist. I don't dispute that. But his arguments
*  about human nature, his arguments about the inevitably catastrophic psychological and
*  environmental and economic effects of capitalism, I would argue every one of those has proven quite
*  right. Marx maybe did not have the answer, but he saw in the 18, whenever he was writing,
*  that inevitably capitalism would lead to massive inequity, that it was ultimately based on the need
*  to denigrate and dehumanize labor, to render them in his language a fleshy cog in a giant machine.
*  And it would create a tension and conflict between those who own things and those who made things
*  that over time would always, the Thomas Pickardy guy who writes about capital
*  and just makes the point that return on investment will always be greater than wages.
*  That means the people with money are going to have a lot more. That means there's going to
*  come a point where the economic house of cards falls apart. Now the Joseph Schumpters of the
*  world, they're like, that's creative destruction. Bring it. That's great. So I think it's Niles
*  Ferguson. He's a historian. He may be at Stanford now. He was at Harvard. He writes about the
*  history of money and he's like, yeah, there's been 20 or whatever depressions and big recessions.
*  In the last several hundred years. And when that happens, half of the population or whatever
*  is catastrophically inconvenienced, but that's the price that we pay for progress.
*  Other people would argue and I would agree with them that I will happily sacrifice the rate of
*  progress in order to flatten the curve of economic destruction. To put that in plainer English,
*  I would direct our attention to the social democracies that forgetting for the moment
*  of whether it's possible to do this on a scale in a country as big as ours on all of the things that
*  really matter, you know, gross domestic GDP or whatever, that's just an abstraction.
*  But when you look at whatever the United Nations says, how we measure quality of life,
*  life expectancy, education, rates of alcoholism, suicide, and so on, the countries that do better
*  are the mixed economies. They're market economies that have high tax rates in exchange
*  for the provision of services that come as a right for citizens.
*  Yeah, so I mean, I guess the question is, you've kind of mentioned that, you know,
*  like as Mark's described, that capitalism with a slippery slope, eventually things go awry in some
*  kind of way. So that's the question is when you have, when you implement a system, how does it go
*  wrong eventually? You know, eventually we'll all be dead.
*  That's exactly right. No, no, no, that's right.
*  So and then the criticism, I mean, I think these days, unfortunately, Marxism is like,
*  is a dirty word. I say unfortunately, because even if you disagree with a philosophy,
*  like calling somebody a Marxist should not be a thing that shuts down all conversation.
*  No, that's right. And then the fact is, is I'm sympathetic with Jordan's dismissal of the folks
*  the talking heads these days who spew Marxist words. To me, it's like fashionable nonsense.
*  Do you know that book that the physicist wrote mocking? You're too young. So in the
*  20 or so years ago- We're all pretty young, relatively.
*  Yeah, that's right. But I think there were these NYU physicists, they wrote a paper just mocking
*  the kind of literary postmodern types. Oh, yeah. Oh, those kinds of, yeah.
*  Yeah, and it was just nonsense. And of course, it was made the lead article.
*  And you know, my poor is Marx wouldn't be a Marxist.
*  True. I've read and listened to some of the work of Richard Wolff. He speaks pretty eloquently
*  about Marxism. I like him.
*  He's one of the only people speaking a lot about Marxism in the way we are now, in a serious way,
*  in a sort of saying, what are the flaws of capitalism? Not saying like, yeah, basically
*  sounding very different. People should check out his work. Because all this kind of outrage,
*  mob culture of sort of demanding equality of outcome. That's not Marxism.
*  It is not Marxism. He didn't say that. He literally said each, what was it, like each
*  according to their needs and each according to their abilities or something like that.
*  So the question is the implementation, like, humans are messy. So how does it go wrong?
*  It is messy. There you go. Brilliant. It's messy. And this gets back to my rant about
*  the book that I want to try if I don't stroke out why left and right are both beside the point.
*  Conservatives are right when they condemn liberals for being simple minded by assuming that
*  modification of external conditions will yield changes in human nature.
*  Again, that's where Marx and Skinner are odd bedfellows. Here they are just saying,
*  oh, let's change the surroundings and things will inevitably get better. On the other hand,
*  when conservatives say that people are innately selfish and they use that as the justification
*  for glorifying the unbridled pursuit of wealth, well, they're only half right. Because it turns
*  out that we can be innately selfish, but we are also innately generous and reciprocating creatures.
*  There's remarkable studies, I think they've been done at Yale, of, you know, babies, 14-month-old
*  babies. If someone hands them a toy and then wants something in return, babies, before they
*  can walk and talk, will reciprocate. All right, fine. If someone, if they want a toy, let's say,
*  or a bottle of water, baby wants a bottle of water and I look like I'm trying to give it to the baby,
*  but I drop the bottle so the baby doesn't get what she or he wanted, when given a chance to reciprocate,
*  little babies will reciprocate because they're aware of and are responding to intention.
*  Similarly, if they see somebody behaving unfairly to someone, they will not help that person in
*  return. So my point is, yeah, we are selfish creatures at times, but we are also simultaneously
*  uber-social creatures who are eager to reciprocate and, in fact, we're congenitally prepared to be
*  reciprocators to the point where we will reciprocate on the basis of intentions above and beyond what
*  actually happens. How close, though, I mean, your work is on the fundamental role of the fear of
*  mortality in ourselves. How fundamental is this reciprocation, this human connection to other
*  humans? Oh, I think it's really innate. Yeah, bats reciprocate not by intention, but
*  you know, this I'm going here from Richard Dawkins, the selfish gene, you know, I love
*  the early Dawkins, I'm less enamored. Like the early Beatles. Yeah, no, no, no,
*  and again, I say this with great respect, but you know, Dawkins just points out that, you know,
*  reciprocation is just fundamental, cooperation is fundamental. You know, it is the it's a one-sided
*  view of evolutionary takes on things when we see it solely in terms of individual competition.
*  It's almost from a game theoretic perspective, too. It's just easier to see the world that way.
*  It's easier to, I don't know, I mean, you see this in physics, there's a whole field of folks,
*  complexity that kind of embraced the fact that it's all an intricately connected mess,
*  and it's just very difficult to do anything with that kind of science, but it seems to be much
*  closer to actually representing what the world is like. So like you put it earlier, Lex, it's messy.
*  So left and right, you mentioned you're thinking of maybe actually putting it down on paper or
*  something? Yeah, I would like to because what I would like to point out, again, in admiration of
*  all of the people that I will then try and have the gall to criticize is, look, these are all
*  geniuses. Locke, genius. Adam Smith, genius when he uses the notion that we're bartering creatures.
*  So he uses that reciprocation idea as the basis of his way of thinking about things.
*  But that's not at the core. The bartering is not at the core of human nature.
*  Well, he says it is. He says we're fundamentally bartering creatures.
*  Well, that doesn't even make sense then, because then how can we then be
*  autonomous individuals? Well, because we're going to barter with an eye on
*  for ourselves. For ourselves.
*  Self-interest. Yeah. But all right, so but back to Adam Smith for a second, Lex, he's like,
*  Adam Smith, he's got the invisible hand. And my conservative friends, I'm like, you need to
*  read his books because he is a big fan of the free market. And this is my other
*  gripe with folks who support just unbridled markets. Adam Smith understood that there was
*  a role for government for two reasons. One is, is that just like Locke, people are not going to
*  behave with integrity. And he understood that one role of government is to maintain a proverbial,
*  you know, even playing field. And then the other thing Smith said was that there's some things that
*  can't be done well for a profit. And I believe he talked about education and public health and
*  infrastructure as things that are best done by governments, because you can't, you can make a
*  profit, but that doesn't mean that the institutions themselves will be maximally beneficial.
*  Yeah, so I would, I'm just eager to engage people by saying, let's start with our most
*  contemporary understanding of human nature, which is that we are both selfish and tend to cooperate.
*  And we also can be heroically helpful to folks in our own tribe. And of course, how you define
*  one's tribe becomes critically important. But what some people say is, look, what would then be,
*  what kind of political institutions and what kind of economic organization
*  can we think about to kind of hit that sweet spot? And that would be, in my opinion,
*  how do we maximize individual autonomy in a way that fosters creativity and innovation and the
*  self-regard that comes from creative expression, while engaging our more cooperative and reciprocal
*  tendencies in order to come up with a system that is potentially stable over time? Because
*  the other thing about all capital-based systems- The stability, it's fundamentally unstable.
*  Yeah, because it's based on infinite growth. And it's a positive feedback loop. To be silly,
*  infinite growth is only good for malignant cancer cells and compound interest. Otherwise,
*  we want to seek a steady state. And that would be, so when Steven Pinker writes, for example, again,
*  great scholar, but I'm going to disagree when he says the world has never been better. And all we
*  need to do is keep making stuff and buying stuff. So your sense is the world, sort of in disagreement
*  with Steven Pinker, that the world is like facing a potential catastrophic collapse in multiple
*  directions. And the fact that there are certain, like the rate of violence and aggregate is
*  decreasing, the death, the quality of life, all those kinds of measures that you can plot
*  across centuries, that it's improving, that doesn't capture the fact that our world might be,
*  we might destroy ourselves in very painful ways in the next century.
*  So I'm with Jared Diamond in the book Collapse, where he points out studying the collapse of
*  major civilizations, that it often happens right after things appear to never have been better.
*  And in that regard, I mean, there are more known voices that have taken issue with Dr. Pinker. I'm
*  thinking of John Gray, who's a British philosopher here in the States. I don't know where he is these
*  days, but Robert J. Lyft and the Psycho Historian. Yeah, they're both of my view, which I hope is,
*  by the way, wrong. But between ongoing ethnic tensions, environmental degradation, economic
*  instability, and the fact that the world has become a petri dish of psychopathology.
*  Like what really worries me is the quiet economic pain that people are going through,
*  the businesses that are closed, the dreams that are broken, because you can no longer do the thing
*  that you've wanted to do. And how, I mentioned to you off camera that I've been reading
*  The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. And I mean, the amount of anger and hatred, and on the flip
*  side of that, sort of a nationalist pride that can arise from deep economic pain. Like what happens
*  with that economic pain is you become bitter. You start to find the other, whether it's other
*  European nations that mistreated you, whether it's other groups that mistreated you, it always
*  ends up being the Jews that somehow are fault here. That's what worries me is where this
*  quiet anger and pain goes in 2021, 2022, 2030. If you look, sorry to see the parallels. No, no, no.
*  Rise and fall of the third Reich, but what happens 10, 15 years from now from what's
*  because of the COVID pandemic that's happening now.
*  And Lex, you make, I think, a really profoundly important point, back to our work for a bit,
*  or Ernest Becker rather. His point is that the way that we manage existential terror
*  is to embrace culturally constructed belief systems that give us a sense that life has
*  meaning and we have value. And in the form of self-esteem, which we get from perceiving that
*  we meet or exceed the expectations associated with the role that we play in society. Well,
*  here we are right now in a world where, first of all, if you have nothing, you are nothing.
*  And secondly, as you were saying before we got started today, a lot of jobs
*  are gone and they're not coming back. And that's where the self-esteem.
*  That's where the self-esteem and identity come in. Where people, it's not only that you don't have
*  anything to eat, you don't even have a self anymore to speak of because we typically define
*  ourselves, as Marx put it, you are what you do. And now who are you when your way of life,
*  as well as your way of earning a living, is no longer available?
*  Yeah. And it feels like that yearning for self-esteem, though we could talk a little
*  bit more because you, about defining self-esteem is quite interesting. The more I've read the
*  warm at the core and just in general, you're thinking it made me realize I haven't thought
*  enough about the idea of self-esteem. But the thing I want to say is it feels like when you lose your
*  job, then it's easy to find. It's tempting to find that self-esteem in a tribe that's not
*  somehow often positive. It's like a tribe that defines itself on the hatred of somebody else.
*  So that's brilliant. And this is what John Gray, the philosopher in the 1990s,
*  he predicted what's happening today. He wrote a book about globalism. And actually, Hannah Arendt
*  in the 1950s said the same thing in her book about totalitarianism. When she said that
*  the economics has reached the point where most money is made not by actually making stuff.
*  You use money to make money. And therefore, what happens is money chases money across
*  national boundaries. Ultimately, governments become subordinate to the corporate entities
*  whose sole function is to generate money. And what John Gray said is that that will inevitably
*  produce economic upheaval in local areas, which will not be attributed to the economic order.
*  It will be misattributed to whoever the scapegoat du jour is, and the distress associated with that
*  uncertainty will be picked up on by ideological demagogues who will transform that into rage.
*  So both Hannah Arendt as well as John Gray, they just said, watch out, we're gonna have
*  right-wingish populist movements where demagogues who are the alchemists of hate,
*  what makes them brilliant is the hate's already there, but they take the fears
*  and they expertly redirect them to who it is that I need to hate and kill
*  in order to feel good about myself. So back to your point, Lex, that's right. So the self-regard
*  that used to come from having a job and doing it well, and as a result of that, having adequate
*  resources to provide a decent life for your family, well, those opportunities are gone,
*  and yeah, what's left? So Max Weber, German sociologist at the beginning of the 20th century,
*  he said in times of historical upheaval, we are apt to embrace, he was the one who coined the term
*  charismatic leader, seemingly larger than life individuals who often believe or their followers
*  believe are divinely ordained to rid the world of evil. Now, Ernest Becker, he used Weber's ideas
*  in order to account for the rise of Hitler. Hitler was elected, and he was elected when
*  Germans were in an extraordinary state of existential distress, and he said, I'm gonna make
*  Germany great again. All right, now what Becker adds to the equation is his claim that what
*  underlies our affection for charismatic populist leaders, good and bad, is death anxiety. All right,
*  now here's where we come in, we're egghead experimental researchers. You know, Becker
*  wrote this book, The Denial of Death, and he couldn't get a job. People just dismiss these
*  ideas as fanciful speculation for which there's no evidence. And you've done some good experiments.
*  Yeah, here's where I can be more cavalier and where what I would urge people, like what you said, Lex,
*  ignore my histrionic and polemic language, if possible, and step back, if you can, myself
*  included, and let's just consider the research findings. Because in September 11th, 2001,
*  people that are old enough to remember that horrible day, two days before George W. Bush
*  had the lowest approval rating in the history of presidential polling.
*  Three weeks later, after he said, we will rid the world of the evildoers, and then a week or two
*  after that, he said in a cover story on Time magazine that he believed that God had chosen
*  him to lead the world during this, to lead the country rather, during this perilous time.
*  He had the highest approval rating. And so we're like, well, what happened? What happened to
*  Americans that their approval of President Bush got so high so fast? Well, our view following Becker
*  is that 2001 was like a giant death reminder. The people dying plus the symbols of American
*  greatness, World Trade Center and the Pentagon. So we did a bunch of experiments, and most of our
*  experiments are disarmingly simple. We have one group of people and we just remind them that
*  they're going to die. We say, hey, write your thoughts and feelings about dying. Or in other
*  cases, we stop them outside, either in front of a funeral home or a hundred meters to either side.
*  Our thought being that if we stop you in front of a funeral home, then death is on your mind,
*  even if you don't know it. And then there's other studies, they're even more subtle, where we bring
*  people into the lab and they read stuff on a computer. And while they're doing that, we flash
*  the word death for 28 milliseconds. It's so fast, you don't see anything. And then we just measure
*  people's reactions or behavior thereafter. So what we found in 2003 leading up to the election of 2004
*  was that Americans did not care for President Bush or his policies in Iraq in control conditions.
*  But if we reminded them of their mortality first, they like Bush a lot more. So in every study that
*  we did, Americans like John Kerry, who was running against Bush, they like Kerry more than Bush.
*  Policy-wise in a control.
*  In a control condition. And but if they were reminded of death first, then they like Bush a lot more.
*  So by the way, just a small pause, you said they're dissimilarly simple experiments. I think that's
*  and people should read Warm at the Core for some other descriptions. You have a lot of
*  different experiences of this nature. I think it's a brilliant experiment connected to the stoics,
*  perhaps, of how your worldview on anything and how delicious that water tastes. Yes.
*  After you're reminded of your own mortality. It's such a fascinating experiment that you could
*  probably keep doing like millions of them to draw insight about the way we see the world.
*  No, that's right, Lex. And I appreciate the compliment, not because we did anything,
*  but because what these studies, many of which are now done by other people around the world in labs
*  that we're not connected with what I'm most proud about our work, I am proud of the experiments that
*  we've done. But it's not science until somebody else can replicate your findings and independent
*  researchers are interested in pursuing them. It's such a fascinating idea. I don't have to think
*  about a lot about the experiments you've done and that you've inspired about the fact that death
*  changes the way you see a bunch of different things. I think the stoics talked about the,
*  I mean, general just momentum, or like just thinking about death and meditating on death
*  is a really positive, not a positive, it's an enlightening way to live life. So what do you
*  think about that at the individual level? What is the role about bringing that terror of death,
*  fear of death to the surface and being cognizant of it?
*  For us, that's the ball game. So what we write in our book, and here we're just
*  paying homage to the philosophers and theologians that come before us, is to
*  point out that literally since antiquity, there has been a consensus that
*  to lead a full life requires Albert Camus had come to terms with death, thereafter anything is
*  possible. So you've got the stoics and you've got the Epicureans and then you've got the
*  Tibetan Book of the Dead and then you've got the medieval monks that worked with a skull on their
*  desk. The whole idea, I should back up a bit because and just remind folks that our studies,
*  when we remind people that they're going to die and we find that, yeah, they drink more water,
*  if a famous person is advertising it, they eat more cookies, they want more fancy clothes,
*  they sit closer to people that look like them, it changes who they vote for. But all of those things,
*  those are very subtle death reminders. You don't even know that death is on your mind.
*  And so our point is that, and this is kind of counterintuitive, and that is that
*  the most problematic and unsavory human reactions to death anxiety are malignant manifestations of
*  repressed death anxiety. You know, we try and bury it under the psychological bushes and then it comes
*  back to bear bitter fruit. But what the theologians and the philosophers of the world are saying,
*  is it behooves each of us to spend considerable time, you don't have to be a goth death rocker,
*  wallowing in death imagery, to spend enough time entertaining the reality of the human condition,
*  which is that you too will pass to get to the point where there is, to lapse into a cliche,
*  the capacity for personal transformation and growth.
*  Let's go personal for a second. Are you yourself afraid of death?
*  Yeah.
*  And how much do you meditate on that thought? Maybe your own study of it
*  is a kind of escape from your own mortality.
*  Absolutely, Lex. So you got it.
*  Like if you figure out death, somehow you won't die.
*  So my colleagues and good friends, Jeff Greenberg and Tom Pazinski, we met in graduate school in the
*  1970s. We've been doing this work for 40 years and we cheerfully admit, even though it doesn't
*  reflect well on us as humans, that I should just speak for myself, but I feel like there's a real
*  sense in which doing these studies and writing books and lecturing has been my way of avoiding
*  directly confronting my anxieties by turning it into an intellectual exercise.
*  Every once in a while, therefore, when I think that I'm making some progress as a human,
*  I have to remind myself that that is probably not the case and that I have at times, like all humans,
*  been more preoccupied with the implications of these ideas for my self-esteem.
*  It's like, oh, we're going to write a book and maybe we'll get to go on TV or something.
*  Well, no, that's not the same as to actually think about it in a way that you feel it rather
*  than just think it.
*  Yeah, like you did when you were eight.
*  That's exactly right.
*  When I first read The Denial of Death, I was so literally flabbergasted by it that I took a
*  leave of absence for a year and just did what would be considered menial jobs.
*  I did construction work, I worked in a restaurant, and I was just like, well, wait a minute.
*  If I understand what this guy is saying, then I'm just a culturally constructed meat puppet
*  doing things for reasons that I know not in order to assuage death anxiety.
*  And I was like, that's not acceptable.
*  Maybe another interesting person to talk about is Ernest Becker himself.
*  Sure.
*  So how did he face his death?
*  Is there something interesting, personal?
*  I think so.
*  Interesting to me is Becker, also from a Jewish family, claimed to be atheistic,
*  did not identify ultimately as Jewish.
*  I believe he converted to Christianity, but was himself a religious person.
*  And he said he became religious when his first child was born.
*  Now, religious, what does that mean?
*  Does he have a faith?
*  Let's talk more, most importantly is the afterlife.
*  He was agnostic on that.
*  But he did.
*  Now, the denial of death is there's a chapter devoted to Kierkegaard.
*  And he talks about, for Kierkegaard, if you want to become a mature individual,
*  if you want to learn something, you go to the university.
*  If you want to become a more mature individual, according to Kierkegaard,
*  you got to go to the school of anxiety.
*  What Kierkegaard said is that we have to let this vague dis-ease,
*  put a hyphen between dis and ease, about death.
*  Kierkegaard's point is you have to really think about that.
*  You have to think about it and feel it.
*  You got to let it seek in or seep into your mind.
*  At which point, according to Kierkegaard, basically, you realize that your present identity
*  is fundamentally a cultural construction.
*  You didn't choose the time and place of your birth.
*  You didn't choose your name.
*  You didn't choose necessarily even the social role that you occupy.
*  You might have chosen from what's available in your culture,
*  but not from the full palette of human opportunities.
*  What Kierkegaard said is that we need to realize that we've been living a lie of sorts.
*  Becker calls it a necessary lie.
*  We have to momentarily dispose of that.
*  Now Kierkegaard says, well, here I am.
*  I have shrugged off all of the cultural accoutrements that I have used to define myself,
*  and now what am I or who am I?
*  This is like the ancient Greek tragedy where the worst thing was to be no one or no thing.
*  At this point, Kierkegaard said, you're really dangling on the precipice of oblivion.
*  And some people tumble into that abyss and never come out.
*  On the other hand, Kierkegaard said that what you can now do metaphorically and literally is
*  to rebuild yourself from the ground up.
*  And in the New Testament, there's something, you have to die in order to be reborn.
*  And Kierkegaard's view, though, is that there's only one way to do that.
*  This is his proverbial leap into faith.
*  And in Kierkegaard's case, it was faith in Christianity, that you can't have unbridled
*  faith in cultural constructions.
*  The only thing that you can have unequivocal faith in is some kind of transcendent power.
*  All right, but of course, this raises the question of, well, is that just another death-denying
*  belief system?
*  Right.
*  And at the end of the denial of death, Becker admits that there's no way to tell,
*  while still advocating for what is ultimately a religious stance.
*  Now, one of the things that I don't understand, and Becker has been the most singularly potent
*  influence in my academic and personal life, but a year or two ago, I started reading Martin
*  Heidegger.
*  I'm reading Being in Time.
*  And what I now wonder is why Becker, who refers to Heidegger from time to time in his work,
*  why he didn't take Heidegger more seriously.
*  Because Heidegger is like a secular Kierkegaard.
*  He has the same thing, which is death anxiety.
*  Oh, and I should have pointed out that what Kierkegaard says is that death anxiety, most
*  people don't go to the school of anxiety.
*  They flee from death anxiety by embracing their cultural beliefs.
*  Kierkegaard says they then tranquilize themselves with the trivial.
*  And I love that phrase.
*  It's beautiful.
*  It's a beautiful phrase, because at the end of the denial of death, Becker's like, look,
*  the average American is either drinking or shopping or watching television, and they're
*  all the same thing.
*  Heidegger says the same thing.
*  He says, look, and he acknowledges Kierkegaard.
*  He says what makes us feel unsettled.
*  Evidently, that's an English translation of angst, that we don't feel at home in the
*  world.
*  Heidegger says that's death anxiety.
*  And one direction is the Kierkegaard one.
*  Heidegger calls it a flight from death.
*  You just unself-reflexively cling to your cultural constructions.
*  And Heidegger borrows the term tranquilized, but he points out that he doesn't care for
*  that term because tranquilized sounds like you're subdued, when in fact what most culturally
*  constructed meat puppets do is to be frenetically engaged with their surroundings to ensure that
*  they never sit still long enough to actually think about anything consequential.
*  Heidegger says there's another way, though.
*  He's like, yo, what you can do is to come to terms with that death anxiety in the following
*  way.
*  Thing number one is to realize that not only are you going to die, but your death can happen
*  at any given moment.
*  So for Heidegger, if you say, I know I'm going to die in some vaguely unspecified future
*  moment, that's still death denial because you're saying, yeah, not me, not now.
*  Heidegger's point is you need to get to the point where you need to realize that, you know,
*  I need to realize that I can walk outside and get smote by a comet, or I can stop for gas on the
*  way home and catch the virus and be dead in two days, or any number of potentially unanticipated
*  and uncontrollable fatal outcomes.
*  It's brilliant, by the way.
*  Sorry.
*  To bring you into the now.
*  Yeah, it is brilliant.
*  I agree, Lex, and that's just why I'm wondering why didn't Becker notice this?
*  Because that's the being and time thing.
*  It's got to be now.
*  And then he says, so now I've dealt somewhat with the death part, and now he says,
*  now you've got to deal with what he calls existential guilt.
*  And he says, well, all right, you have to realize that like it or not, you have to make choices.
*  You know, this is Jean-Paul Sartre.
*  We are condemned by virtue of consciousness to choosing, but Heidegger's a little bit more
*  precise.
*  He's like, look, as I was saying earlier, you're in reality, you're an insignificant spec of
*  respiring carbon-based dust born into a time and place, not of your choosing when you're here for
*  a microscopic amount of time after which you are not.
*  And for Heidegger, you have to realize that, like I said, I didn't choose to be born a male
*  or Jewish or in America, the offspring of working class people.
*  And Heidegger, what he says is, yeah, but you still have to make choices and accept responsibility
*  for those choices, even though you didn't choose any of the parameters that ultimately limit what's
*  available to you.
*  And moreover, you're going to not always make good choices.
*  So now you're guilty for your choices.
*  And then he uses the poet Rilke.
*  I don't know.
*  He has a phrase, Becker uses it in the denial of death, the guilt of unlived life.
*  I just love that.
*  You have to accept that you have already diminished and in many ways amputated your own
*  possibilities by virtue of choices that you've made or just as often have declined to make
*  because you are reluctant to accept responsibility for the opportunities that you are now able to
*  create by virtue of seeing the possibilities that lay before you.
*  So anyway, Heidegger then says, look, okay, so, you know, I'm a professor and I live in America
*  in the 21st century.
*  Well, if I was in the third century living in a yurt in Mongolia, I'm not going to have an
*  opportunity to be a professor.
*  But what he submits is that there is some aspects of whatever I am that are independent of my
*  cultural and historical circumstances.
*  In other words, there is a me of sorts.
*  Heidegger would take vigorous issue.
*  It's so would I.
*  Heidegger scholars, because I'm not claiming to understand him.
*  This is my classic comic book rendering.
*  But Heidegger's point is that you get to the point where you're able to say, okay,
*  I am a contingent historical and cultural artifact.
*  But so what?
*  You know, if I was transported a thousand years in the past in Asia, I'd be in the same situation.
*  I would still be conditioned by time and place.
*  I would still have choices that I could make within the confines of what opportunities
*  are afforded to me.
*  And then Heidegger says, if I can get that far, and this is his language.
*  He says that there is a transformation and he literally he calls it a turning.
*  You're turning away from a flight from death and you are allowed you.
*  Therefore, you see a horizon is his word of opportunity that makes you.
*  In a state of anticipatory resolute Ness with solicitous regard for others.
*  That makes your life seem like an adventure perfused with unshakable joy.
*  All right, let me unpack those things.
*  It is beautiful.
*  I love, Lex, that you're resonating to the time thing.
*  So he's like, okay, we already talked about now anticipatory is already hopeful because
*  it's looking forward.
*  I to be resolute.
*  It means to be steadfast and to just have to be.
*  Just have confidence in what you're doing moving forward.
*  All right, solicitous.
*  I had to look up all these words, by the way.
*  It just means that you are concerned about your fellow human beings.
*  But I love the idea.
*  Even if it seems allegorical, I don't mind that at all.
*  This idea you said love earlier.
*  I think that when Heidegger is talking about being solicitous, that's as close as he can get.
*  There's an Italian.
*  What was that line again with the solicitous?
*  The whole thing of turning away from death.
*  All the words you said are just beautiful.
*  I love those words.
*  Yeah.
*  Anticipatory resolute Ness that is accompanied with solicitous regard to our fellow humans,
*  which makes life appear to us to be an ongoing adventure that is permeated by unshakable joy.
*  Now, again, Heidegger is not Mary Poppins.
*  I just got a tattoo.
*  This is great.
*  I just love that.
*  Wait, is that an exact quote?
*  No, I'm piecing together.
*  These are his exact words that, and I spent the last two years reading almost everything
*  that I can find because I want to.
*  I'm sick of death.
*  You said it, so I want to second what you say, Lex.
*  It's not about death.
*  It's the Sherwood Anderson guy.
*  He's a novelist that I like about.
*  He wrote a book called Winesburg, Ohio, and now I'm going to forget what he said on his tombstone.
*  But it was something to the effect.
*  Oh, he said life, not death is the great adventure.
*  The point being is that to consider that we must die and the existential implications of that,
*  really, the goal, the way I see it, is getting from hate to love.
*  I feel like Heidegger has a way of thinking about things that moves us more in that direction.
*  And so that's kind of my current preoccupation is to take what I just said to you and to talk about
*  it with my colleagues and other academic psychologists because the way we started with Ernest Becker,
*  remember I said earlier, I wasn't trained in any of these things.
*  I'm an egghead researcher that was doing experiments about biofeedback.
*  And then we read these Becker books and I thought they were so interesting that
*  for the first few years we didn't have any studies.
*  I just would travel around and I'd be like, here's what this Becker guy says.
*  I think this is cool.
*  Well, my present view is I'm like, here's what this Heidegger guy says.
*  I think these ideas are consistent with what Becker is saying because they are anchored in
*  death anxiety. But I like that direction as an alternative to the Kierkegaardian insistence
*  that the only psychologically tenable way to extricate ourselves from maladaptive reactions
*  to death anxiety is through faith in the traditional sense.
*  Yeah, I always kind of saw Kierkegaard unfairly, like you said, in a comic book sense
*  of the word faith as a non-traditional sense. I kind of like the idea of leap of faith.
*  Oh, I love that idea. And so what I've been babbling about with Heidegger, I'm like, yeah,
*  Kierkegaard is a leap of faith in God. Heidegger is a leap of faith in life.
*  And I just like it.
*  I found the leap of faith really interesting in the technological space. I've talked to him on
*  this thing with Elon Musk, but I think he's also just in general for our culture, a really
*  important figure that takes, I mean, sometimes a little bit insane on social media and just in
*  life. When I met him, it was kind of interesting that, of course, he's a legit engineer, so he's
*  fun to talk to about the technical things. But he also just the way the humor and the way he sees
*  life, it just like refuses to be conventional. So it's a constant leap into the unknown. And one
*  of the things that he does, and this isn't even like fake. A lot of people say, because he's a
*  CEO, there's a business owner, so he's trying to make money. No, I think this is, I looked him in
*  his eyes, I mean, this is real, is a lot of the things he believes that are going to be accomplished
*  that a lot of others are saying are impossible, like autonomous vehicles, he truly believes it.
*  To me, that is the leap of faith. We're like, the entirety of our experience is shrouded in mystery.
*  We don't know what the hell's going to happen. You don't know what we're actually capable of as human
*  beings. And he just takes the leap. He fully believes that we can colonize Mars. I mean,
*  how crazy is it to just believe and dream and actually be taking steps towards it,
*  to colonizing Mars when most people are like, that's the stupidest idea ever.
*  Yeah. Well, I'm in agreement with you on that. Two things, one is it reminds me of Ben Franklin,
*  who in his autobiography has a similarly childish in the best sense of the word,
*  unbridled imagination for what might become. Ben Franklin's like, yeah, I got electricity,
*  that's cool, but we'll be levitating soon. And we can't even begin to imagine what we are capable
*  of. And of course, people are like, dude, that's crazy. And there's a guy, it's FCS Schiller,
*  some humanistic guy at the beginning of the 20th century. He's like, you know,
*  lots of things that people think about may appear to be absurd to the point of obscene,
*  but the reality is historically, every fantastic innovation has generally been initiated by someone
*  who was condemned for being a lunatic. And it's not that anything is possible, but surely things
*  that we don't try will never manifest as possibilities.
*  Yeah. And then that's, that's, uh, that there's something beautiful to that. That's the,
*  embracing the abyss. And again, it's like the, uh, it's the embracing the fear of death, the,
*  the, the, the reality of death and then turning, uh, and to look at all the opportunities.
*  Oh, yeah, that's right.
*  Let me ask you, whenever I bring up Ernest Becker's work, which I do and yours quite a bit,
*  I find it surprising how that it's not a lot more popular in a sense that, uh, no, we're not,
*  I don't mean just your book, uh, that's well written. People should read it, should buy it,
*  whatever. Uh, uh, I think it has the same kind of qualities that are useful to think about as like
*  Jordan Peterson's work and stuff like that. But I just mean like, why do you think that,
*  like why people, um, are not, don't think of that as a compelling description of, um, the core of
*  the human condition. Like I think what you mentioned about Heidegger's is quite, connects
*  with me quite well. So I ask, uh, on this podcast, I often ask people if they're afraid of death.
*  That's like almost every single person, I almost always get criticized for asking
*  world-class people, uh, scientists and technologists and about fear of death and
*  the meaning of life. And on the fear of death, they often like, don't say anything interesting.
*  What I mean by that is they haven't thought deeply about it. Like what you kind of brought this up a
*  few times of really letting it sink in. They kind of say this thing about what exactly you said,
*  which is like, uh, it's something that happens not today. Like I'm aware that it's something
*  that happens and I'm not the, the thing they usually say is I'm not afraid of death. I just
*  want to live a good life kind of thing. And what I'm trying to express is like when I look in their
*  eyes and the kind of the, the core of the conversation, it looks like they haven't really
*  become like they haven't really meditated on death. I guess the question is, um, what do I say to people
*  that there's something to really think about here? Like there's some demons, some realities that need
*  to be faced by more people. Well, that's a tough one. You know, I could tell you what not to do,
*  you know, so when we are young and annoying, um, a lot of famous people, mostly psychologists,
*  because that's who we intersected with that, you know, we would lay out these ideas
*  and they would be, well, I don't think about death like that. So these ideas must be wrong.
*  And we would say, well, you don't think about death because you're lucky enough to be comfortably
*  ensconced in a cultural worldview from which you derive self-esteem. And that has it's spared you
*  the existential excruciations that would otherwise arise. But that's like Freud, you know,
*  you're repressing. So you're either agree with me in which case I'm right, or you disagree with me,
*  in which case you're repressing and I'm right. Well, so that's the, the, the niche of thing.
*  What I've felt when I've, there've been moments in my life, moments in my life when I really
*  thought about death. I mean, there's not too many, like really, really thought about it and feel the
*  thing when you felt that eight, maybe I'm traumatizing or romanticizing it, but, uh,
*  I feel like it's, uh, uh, the conservatives call it popularly like, or the movie matrix call it the
*  red pill moment. Uh, I feel like it's a dangerous thought because, um, I feel like I'm taking a step
*  out of a society. Like there's a nice narrative that we've all constructed and I'm sticking a
*  step out and, uh, it feels, there's this feeling like you're basically drowning. I mean, it's,
*  it's not a good feeling. It is not, but this gets back to the Heidegger Kierkegaard school of anxiety.
*  You are stepping out and you are momentarily shrugging off the, again, the culturally
*  constructed psychological accoutrements that allow you to stand up in the morning.
*  And so, I mean, in that sense, it feels like, I mean, uh, what do you, uh, how do you have
*  that conversation? Because I guess I am, I'm dancing around a set of questions, which is like,
*  I guess I'm disappointed that people don't, are not, uh, as willing to step outside,
*  like, uh, even just, uh, even any kind of thought experiment, let's forget, uh, denial of death. Like,
*  there's, there's not a community of people. Let's take an easy one that I think is scientifically
*  ridiculous, which is, there's a community of people that believe that, uh, the earth is flat,
*  or actually even, even better, the space is fake. Like what I find surprising is that a lot of
*  people I talk to are not willing to, uh, be like, imagine if it is like, imagine the earth is flat,
*  like, think about it. Like a lot of people just like, no, the earth is round.
*  They, they're like, uh, like scientists too. They're like, yes. Well, actually, wait, have you
*  actually like thought about it? Like, imagine like a thought experiment that, that like basically step
*  outside the little narrative that we are comfortable with. Now that one in particular is, has really
*  strong, uh, evidence, uh, and scientific validation. So it's a pretty simple thing to show that it at
*  least is not flat. Uh, but just the willingness to take a step outside of the stories that bring us
*  comfort is, uh, been disappointing that people are not willing to do that. And I think, uh, the
*  philosophy that you've constructed and the Ernest Beck is constructing, you've tested, uh, I think
*  it's really compelling in the fact that people aren't often willing to take that step. Yeah.
*  Disappointing. Well, yes, but perhaps understandable. I mean, one of the, this is an anecdote,
*  of course, but when we were trying to get a publisher for our book, um, I had, um, we had
*  a meeting with, um, a publisher who, uh, published some Malcolm Gladwell books. Yeah. And, um, she
*  said, I'm very interested in your book, but can you write it without mentioning death?
*  Cause people don't like death. And we're like, no, it's really kind of central. Um,
*  and I think that's part of it. I think again, if these ideas have merit,
*  and I actually like the way that you put it, Lex, it's that to step away is to momentarily
*  expose yourself to all of the anxiety that our identity and our beliefs
*  typically enable us to manage. I think it's as simple as that. Yeah. I had this experience, um,
*  in college with my best friend, uh, who got really high, uh, uh, and he forgot it was, uh,
*  in the winter. It was really freezing. It was memorable to me. I think as an analogist,
*  very useful. Um, so he went to get some pizza and he, so I, and he left me outside and said,
*  I'll be back in five minutes. And he forgot that he left me outside. And I remember it was, uh,
*  I was in like shorts. It was freezing winter. And I remember standing outside is a dorm
*  and I'm looking from the outside in, it's a light and it's warm. And I'm just standing there frozen
*  and think for an hour or more. And I, that's how I think about it. Like I just, I don't give a damn
*  about the stupid winter rain. I just want to, I'd like, it's like, uh, I'm drawn to be back to the
*  warm. And that's how I feel about thinking about like death. It's like, at a certain point, it's
*  like, it's too much. It's like that cold. I want to be back into the warm.
*  Getting back to Heidegger for a moment. I like the, yeah, he uses a lot the idea of feeling
*  at home, not as like in your house, but just feeling like you're comfortably situated.
*  Maybe we can talk about, like I had a conversation about this with my dad a little bit. Um,
*  um, how does, um, religion relate to this?
*  I see it as the, um, the disease and the cure, um, in the, in a sense, um, a few things. Um,
*  one is that, um, I think a case could be made that humans are innately religious.
*  Uh, so now we're going to get into territory where there's going to be a lot of disputes. Um,
*  And by, what do you mean by religious?
*  Uh, religion is an evolutionary adaptation.
*  And religion is like a belief in something outside of yourself kind of thing.
*  Not necessarily. So here we got to be a little bit more, um, careful. Um, and again, I'm not a
*  scholar. How about I'm a well-intentioned dilettante in this, in this regard, because what,
*  what I have read is that religion, um, evolved very early on, long before our ancestors were
*  conscious and the issue of death arose. Um, and, um, the word religion evidently is from a Latin
*  word, regatayar. We can look it up, but, and it means to bind. And Emile Durkheim, the dead
*  French sociologist, he said, you know, originally religion is a Darcy Lessing who's a dead novelist.
*  She calls it the substance of we feeling that it's literally that it arose because we're uber
*  social creatures who from time to time took comfort in just being in physical proximity
*  with our fellow humans and that there is this kind of sense of transcendent exuberance
*  just back to the unshakable joy that Heidegger alludes to and that the original function of
*  religion was to foster social cohesion and coordination and that it was only subsequently
*  some claim that a burgeoning level of consciousness made it such that religious belief systems
*  that included the hope of some kind of immortality were just naturally selected thereafter.
*  So there are some people, so, uh, it's, uh, David Sloan Wilson wrote a book called Darwin's
*  Cathedral and he said religion has nothing to do with death. It's a bit evolved to make groups
*  viable. He's actually a group selection guy. What's group selection? The idea that it's the
*  group that is selected for rather than the individual. Yeah, so people have vigorous
*  disagreements about that. But I guess our point would be we see religion as being inextricably
*  connected ultimately to assuaging concerns about death. Well, I guess another question to ask around
*  this, like, what does the world look like without religion? Will we, if it's inextricably connected
*  to our fears of death, do you think it always returns in some kind of
*  shape? Maybe it's not called religion, but whatever, it just keeps returning?
*  Yeah, who knows? So that's a great question, Lex. So this woman named Karen Armstrong,
*  she was a nun turned historian. And she's, I can't remember the name of the book,
*  but no matter, she, we could look that up, but
*  If you want, I can look it up, but I can also, I'll just add it.
*  Okay. Yeah. Her point, it says has God in the title, of course, but you know, she's like, look,
*  she's like, look, all religions are generally fairly right-minded in that they advocate the
*  golden rule. And all religions at their best do seem to foster pro-social behavior
*  towards the in-group. And that confers both psychological as well as physical benefits.
*  That's the good news. And the bad news is historically all religions are
*  subject to being hijacked by a lunatic French who declares that, you know, they're the ones
*  in sole possession of the liturgical practices or whatever they call them. And they're the ones that
*  they're the ones that turn, you know, religion at its best into your crusades and holocausts.
*  My view, not that it should matter for much, but I grew up just skeptical of religion
*  because I'm like, as a kid, I'm like, well, if we didn't have these beliefs, we wouldn't be killing
*  each other because of them. And I'd be like to my parents, well, you're telling me that all people
*  should be judged on the merits of their character, but don't come home if you don't marry a Jewish
*  woman, which is implying that if you're not Jewish, you're an inferior form of life.
*  Yeah, that's what tribes always do.
*  And there's the tribal thing. And so there's a guy named Amin Malouf, a Lebanese guy who writes in
*  French in the 1990s, I think, wrote a book called In the Name of Identity,
*  Violence and the Need to Belong. And that was his point is
*  unless we can overcome this tribal mentality, this will not end well. But you said earlier
*  something, Lex, that I think is profound and profoundly important. And that is you did not
*  recoil in horror when I mentioned Kierkegaard's use of the term faith. And so I'm a big fan of faith,
*  and I'm not sure what that implies. And by the way, this is just a peripheral comment, but I
*  find less resistance to Becker's ideas in our work when I'm in like Jesuit schools.
*  It's the Americans that, the secular humanists who are most disinclined to accept these ideas.
*  It's an important side comment because I think it's mostly because they don't think philosophically.
*  I mean, I speak with a lot of scientists and I think that's my main criticism.
*  That's the problem with science is it's so comforting to focus in on the details
*  that you can escape thinking about the mystery of it all, the big picture things, the philosophical,
*  the fact that you don't actually know shit at all. So in terms of Jesuit, that's
*  the beauty of the experience of faith and so on is like, wherever that journey takes you,
*  you actually explore the biggest questions of our world.
*  Yeah. So I don't see religion going away because I don't see humans
*  as capable of surviving without faith and hope. And everyone from the Pope to Elon Musk
*  will acknowledge that it is a world that is unfathomably mysterious.
*  And like it or not, in the absence of beliefs, here I'm Charles Peirce, the pragmatic philosopher.
*  He just said, beliefs are the basis of action. If you don't have any beliefs,
*  you're paralyzed within decision, whether we're aware of it or not, whether we like it or not.
*  In order to stand up in the morning, you have to subscribe to beliefs that can never be
*  unequivocally proven right or wrong. Well, then why do you maintain them?
*  Well, ultimately it's because of some form of faith.
*  But also, also faith shouldn't be a dogmatic thing that you should always be leaping.
*  Yeah, I guess the problem with science or with religion is you can sort of
*  all of a sudden take a step into a place where you're super confident
*  that you know the absolute truth of things.
*  There you go. And again, back to Socrates, Plato, back in the cave.
*  At Skidmore, where I work, that's what I have the students read in their first week.
*  Plato's like, oh, look at all those poor bastards. They're in the cave, but they don't know it.
*  And then they are freed from their chains. And they have to be dragged out of the cave,
*  by the way, which is another interesting point. They don't run out.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  But that gets back to why people don't like to be divested of their comfortable illusions.
*  But anyway, they get dragged out of the cave into the sunlight,
*  which he claims is a representation of truth and beauty.
*  And I say to the students, well, what's wrong with that?
*  And they're like, nothing. That's like awesome. And then I'm like, yo, dudes,
*  you added the cave, but how do you know that you're not in another cave?
*  The illumination may be better, but the minute you think you're at the end of the proverbial
*  intellectual slash epistemological trail, then you have already succumbed
*  to either laziness or dogmatism or both. That's really well put.
*  That's both terrifying and exciting that we're always, there's always a bigger cave.
*  A little bit of an out there question, but I think some of the interesting qualities of
*  the human mind is the ideas of intelligence and consciousness.
*  So what do you make of consciousness? So do you think death creates consciousness,
*  like the fear of death, the terror of death creates consciousness?
*  And consciousness in turn magnifies the terror of death. I do.
*  What is consciousness to you?
*  Don't ask me that. So now, if I could answer that, I'd be chugging rum out of a coconut
*  with my Nobel Prize. That it's literally, Steven Pinker, I do agree with his claim,
*  and I think how the mind works, that it is the key question for
*  the psychological sciences broadly defined in the 21st century.
*  What is consciousness?
*  Yeah, what is consciousness? And I don't think it's an epiphenomenological afterthought.
*  So a lot of people, I think Dan Wagner at Harvard, a lot of folks consider it
*  just the ass end of a process that by the time we are aware of what it is, it's just basically
*  an integrated rendering of something that's already happened. Evidently, there's a half second delay
*  between when something happens, you know those studies and our awareness of it.
*  And then that's where ideas of free will will step in, so you can explain away a lot of stuff.
*  And I think those are all important and interesting questions. I'm of the persuasion,
*  I mean, even, not even, but Dawkins in The Selfish Gene is very thoughtful. Actually,
*  it's actually more in notes than in the text of the book, but he's just like, it's hard for me to
*  imagine that consciousness doesn't have some sort of important and highly adaptive function.
*  And what Dawkins says is he thought about it in terms of just that we could do mental simulations,
*  that one possibly extraordinary product of consciousness is to rather than find out,
*  often by adverse consequences through trying something, would be to run mental simulations.
*  And so one possibility is that consciousness is highly adaptive. Another possibility is Nicholas
*  Humphrey, a British dude who wrote a book about, I think it's called Regaining Consciousness.
*  And he hypothesized, I think this is 1980s, maybe even earlier, that consciousness arose
*  as a way to better predict the behavior of others in social settings, that by knowing
*  how I feel makes me better able to know how you may be feeling. This is like the rudiments of
*  a theory of mind. And it really may not have had anything to do with intelligence so much as social
*  intelligence. So in that sense, consciousness is a social construct. It's just a useful thing for
*  interacting with other humans. I don't know, but there seems to be something about realizing your
*  own mortality that's somehow intricately connected to the idea of consciousness.
*  Well, I think so also. So this is where, and Nietzsche, he said a solitary creature would not
*  need consciousness. What do you think? Well, I don't know what I think about that.
*  But what I do, and then he goes on to say that consciousness is the most calamitous stupidity
*  by which we shall someday perish. And wow, I was like, dude.
*  Relax.
*  Say you were on an island alone and you saw a reflection of yourself in the water.
*  If you were alone your whole life. Yeah, great question.
*  The his view, Nietzsche's view would be that your thoughts of yourself would never come to mind.
*  I don't know how I feel about that though. In a sense, this sounds weird, but in a sense,
*  I feel like my mental conversation has always been with death. It's almost like another, you know,
*  um, another notion like, um, you know, there's these visualizations of, of a death in the cloak.
*  Like I always felt like I am a living thing. And then there's an other thing that is the end of me.
*  And I'm having like a conversation with that. So in this sense, that's, uh,
*  that's the way I construct my, the fact that I am a thing is because there's
*  somebody else that tells me, well, you won't be a thing eventually. So this feels like a conversation,
*  perhaps, but that's, uh, that might be kind of this mental stimulation kind of idea that you're,
*  you're kind of, it's not really a, it's a conversation with yourself essentially. Sure.
*  Yeah. But yeah, I don't know how I feel about that, but I, I tend to be in agreement with you when
*  we're talking about economics more so that, uh, that we're deeply social beings, like everything,
*  the way it just feels like we're humans. I'm, I'm with, uh, uh, Harari with the Syrians that were
*  kind of, we seem to construct ideas on top of each other. And that's a fundamentally a social
*  Absolutely. I think that's a fine book. Uh, it overlaps considerably with our take on these
*  matters and the fact that we get to these points, uh, drawing on different sources, I think makes me
*  more confident that it's so, it's so fascinating. Just, just like reading your book, I'm sorry,
*  on a small tangent, uh, that sapiens is like one of the most popular books in the world.
*  Like, yeah. And it's reading your book is like, well, this sounds,
*  yeah. I mean, like, I don't know. I don't know what makes a popular book.
*  Yeah. Well, if you want me to be petty and stupid, I will tell you that from time to time. Um,
*  we also wonder, um, why our book, you know, like all books, people, um, can take issue with it,
*  but we thought it would be a bigger hit that would be more widely read.
*  It's funny because I, I've, um, I don't know if I have good examples because I forgot already,
*  but I'm often saddened by like Franz Kafka. I think he wasn't known in his life,
*  but I always wonder like these great, like some of the greatest books ever written
*  are completely unknown during the author's lifetime. And it's like,
*  man, for some reason that it's again, it's that identity thing. I think, oh man, that sucks.
*  Well, I'm comforted by that. So Van Gogh sold one painting in his life and evidently, uh, Thoreau
*  sold like 75 copies of Walden. Uh, Nietzsche's books did not sell well. And how did Ernest
*  Beckers sell? He, he is the, uh, his books are published by the free press and have sold more
*  than any other books, um, that they have published. So, so what does that mean? That's a lot. I,
*  I don't know if it's like Jordan Peterson millions, but it's hundreds of thousands.
*  He respected, uh, I just don't see him. I, okay. Uh, I don't see him brought up as a,
*  like in the top 10 philosophers of, uh, so how far away is he? Is he in the top hundred for people?
*  I don't think so. Like he doesn't, he's not brought up that often because again,
*  like your work has brought up more often. Yeah. Like a term like, cause I think it got,
*  and yeah, I mean, I think he's one of the great philosophers of the 20th century.
*  So what we say, Lex is that our goal, certainly when we first started and now just as much
*  actually, but what I say at all my talks is look, if these ideas have interest you enough
*  to go read Ernest Becker, then this has been good. I consider him to be one of the most
*  important voices of the 20th century who does not get the attention that he deserves.
*  All right. Similarly our work, I believe to be important because point by point,
*  we provide empirical corroboration for all of the claims. If you know, when, um,
*  so that's literally the students that read the denial of death and then escape from evil.
*  They're like, yeah, wow. Every chapter of the book, you have studies. And I'm like,
*  yeah, because for 40 years, if a Skidmore students said, oh, that's gotta be bullshit.
*  I'm like, well, let's do a study. Let's do a study. And my own dreams are in creating
*  a robots and artificial intelligence systems that a human can love. And I think there's something
*  about mortality and fear mortality that is essential for implementing in our AI systems.
*  Yeah. And so maybe can you comment on that? Like, well, uh, on, uh,
*  so this is, this is a different perspective on your work, which is like, how do we engineer a human?
*  Yeah. So, no, this is awesome. Lex, I'm delighted that you said that. First of all,
*  and I may mention this to you and I don't, I can't remember it cause I am seeing now,
*  when you first contacted me, I had just been told I have to learn more about your work
*  because I'm working with some very talented people in New York and they're, they're writing
*  a screenplay for a movie about an artificial intelligence. It's a female AI and set in like
*  30 years in the future. And basically the little twist, this is how I had to read Heidegger. So
*  these people call me and they're like, we're making a movie. It's based on Becker and your work
*  and Heidegger and this other philosopher, Levinas, and then another philosopher, Sylvia Benso,
*  who's an Italian philosopher. And the long short story is the movie is about supposedly the most
*  advanced artificial intelligence entity, an embodied one and who human form, human form,
*  who finds out who is having, having essentially existential anxieties. And the, I think the
*  project is called a dinner with her or something, and it doesn't really matter, but the punchline is
*  that she finds out that her creator has made her mortal. And so the question is what happens
*  phenomenologically and behaviorally to an artificial intelligence who now knows that it's mortal? And
*  it's actually the same question that you're posing. And that is, is that necessary
*  in order for an AI to approximate humanity? Yeah, I think, yeah. So the intuition, again,
*  it's, it's unknown, but I think it's absolutely, I think it's absolutely necessary.
*  A lot of people, the same kind of shallow thinking that people have about our own end of life,
*  our own death is the same way people think of, I think about artificial intelligence.
*  It's like, well, okay, so yeah. So within the system, there's a, there's a terminal position
*  where like, there's, there's a, there's a point at which it ends. You just, the program ends.
*  There's a goal state. There's a, you reach the end point, but the thing is
*  making that end a thing that's also within the program. Like, like the making the thing,
*  and then it's also the mystery of it. So the thing is, we don't know what the hell this death thing
*  is. I mean, it's not like, it's not like we, I mean, the program doesn't give us information
*  about the meaning of it all. Exactly. And that's where the terror is. And I, it feels like, I mean,
*  in the language that you would think about is, is the terror of this death or like anticipation of
*  it or thinking about it is the creative force that builds everything. Right. And that feels like,
*  uh, you know, that feels really important to implement again, very difficult to know how to
*  do technically currently, but it's important to think about what I find is you mentioned like
*  screenplays and so on is sci-fi folks and, uh, philosophers are the, the only ones thinking
*  about it currently. And that's what these folks have convinced me. Yeah. And engineers aren't,
*  which is, uh, I get, yeah, most of the, most, most of the things that I talk about, I get kind of,
*  um, people rolled their eyes from the engineer perspective. Not these folks.
*  They're like, cause I, again, I saw your name and they're like, wait a minute, I've just seen that.
*  They're like, here's someone you should check out. Yeah. So this was a delightful conference.
*  Yeah. I was a, I was a huge fan of, um, your work and Ernest Becker. And, um, it's funny that
*  not enough people are talking about it. Yeah. I don't know what to do with that. I think that
*  there's a possibility to create real deep, meaningful connections between AI systems and
*  humans. Absolutely. And, uh, I think some of these things of fear of mortality are essential,
*  are essential for the element of human experience. I don't, I don't think it might be essential to
*  create general intelligence, like very intelligent machines, but to create a machine that connects
*  the human in some deep way. What's your view, not to make me the interviewer, but what's your view
*  about machine ethics? Can you imagine an ethical AI without some semblance of.
*  Yeah. So finitude, let's say. Well, I think ethics is, uh,
*  it's a, you know, there's a, there's a trolley problem that's often used in the work that I've
*  done at MIT. Yeah. Yeah. With, uh, with autonomous vehicles in particular, uh, that people
*  don't know how to deal with. And so I don't know if a machine is able to, uh, do a better job on
*  ethical, on difficult ethical questions, but I certainly think to behave properly and effectively
*  in this world and needs to be, um, have a fear of mortality and like being able to do it, uh,
*  I think, uh, ethics is like a dance floor. You have to just, you have to, uh, dance properly
*  with the rest of the humans. Like if people are dancing Tango, you have to dance in the same kind
*  of way. And for that, you have to have a fear of mortality. Like I think of a more practically
*  speaking, I think of a fear of mortality of people who are very, very, very, very, very, very
*  very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
*  I said, autonomous vehicles, like the way you interact with pedestrians
*  fundamentally has to have a sense of mortality. So, uh, when pedestrians cross the road,
*  now I've watched most certainly a hundred plus hours of pedestrian videos.
*  There's a kind of social, uh, contract where you walk in front of a car and you're putting
*  your life in the hands of another human being. And like death is, is, uh, is in the car,
*  in the game that's being played, death is right there. Uh, it's part of the calculus. It's not,
*  but it's not like a simple calculus, not a simple equation. It's, uh, it's an S it's a, I mean,
*  I don't know what it is, but it's, it's in the, it's in there and, uh, it has to be part of the
*  optimization problem. Like it's not as simple as so from the computer vision, from the artificial
*  perspective, it's detecting there's a human estimating, estimating the trajectory,
*  like treating everything like it's a billiard balls, uh, as opposed to like being able to
*  construct an effective model, the world model of the, what the person is thinking, what they're
*  going to do, what are the different possibilities of how this scene might evolve, I think requires
*  having some sense of, yeah, fear of fear of mortality of mortality. I don't see the thing is
*  I think it's really important to think about. I can be honest enough to say that it's, I haven't
*  been able to figure out how to engineer any of these things, but I do think it's really,
*  really important. Like I have a, so I have a bunch of Roombas here. I can show it to you after, uh,
*  that I've Roombas is a robot that does, um, vacuums the floor and I've had them, um,
*  make different sounds. Like I had them scream in pain and it, uh, it, uh, you immediately
*  anthropomorphize and it creates a, I don't know, knowing that they can feel pain. See, I'm, I'm
*  speaking like knowing, uh, that I immediately imagine that they can feel pain and it immediately
*  draws me closer to them. Yes. The human experience and that there's, there's something in that,
*  that should be engineered in our, in our systems. It feels like, well, I believe personally, I don't
*  know what you think, but, uh, I believe it's possible for a robot and a human to fall in love,
*  for example, in the, in the future. Oh, I think it's, yeah, it's already there.
*  Well, there's a certain kind of deep connection with technology in a real,
*  like you would choose to marry. Um, I mean, again, it sounds, uh, uh, I'll find a book title and I'll
*  send it to you. And it's a serious consideration of people who started out with these sex dolls,
*  but it turned into a relationship of enduring significance that the woman who wrote the book
*  is not willing to dismiss as a perversion. Yeah, that's what, uh, you know, people kind of joke
*  about sex robots, which is funny. Uh, like it's a, it's a funny, I mean, there's a lot of stuff
*  about robots. It's just kind of fun to talk about that is that it's not necessarily connected to
*  reality. Uh, people joke about sex robots, but if you actually look how sex robots are, uh,
*  which are pretty rare these days are used, they're not used by people who want sex precisely.
*  They're actually, uh, they're companions. They're compared. They become companions. Yeah.
*  They, it's, uh, yeah, it's fascinating. And they're just, we're not even talking about any kind of
*  intelligence. We're talking about just, I mean, human beings see companionships were deeply lonely.
*  I mean, that was the other sense I have that I don't know if I can articulate clearly. You
*  can probably do a better job, but I have a sense that there's a deep loneliness within all of us.
*  Absolutely. In the face of death, it feels like we're alone.
*  So, you know, the, what drew me to the existential take on things, Lex was the, uh,
*  who is it? Rollo May and Erwin Yalem, right? About existentialism. And they're like, look,
*  what there's different flavors of existentialism, but they all have in common. What is it? Four
*  universal concerns. The overriding one is about death and that next is choice and responsibility.
*  The next one is existential isolation. And they're like, that's one of the
*  things about consciousness. And the last one is meaninglessness. But the existential isolation
*  point is, you know, we are by virtue of consciousness able to apprehend that unless you're a Siamese twin,
*  twin, you are fundamentally alone. And because it is claimed it's Eric Fromm in a book called
*  Escape from Freedom. He's like, look, you, you're smart enough to know that the most
*  direct way that we typically communicate with our fellow human beings is through language.
*  But you also know that language is a pale shadow of the totality of our interior
*  phenomenological existence. Therefore there's always going to be times in our lives where even
*  under the best of circumstances, you could be trying desperately to convey your thoughts and
*  feelings and somebody listening could be like, yeah, I get it. I get it. I get it.
*  And you're like, you have no fucking idea what I'm talking about. So you can be desperately lonely
*  in a house where you live with 10 people in the middle of Tokyo, where there's millions.
*  Yeah. It's a great Gatsby. Yeah. To be alone.
*  Precisely. Yeah. Exactly. Maybe this is a small tangent, but let me ask you on the topic of
*  academia, you're kind of, we talked about Jordan Peterson, there's a lot of sort of
*  renegade type of thinkers, certainly in psychology, but it applies in all disciplines.
*  What are your thoughts about academia being a place to harbor people like yourself,
*  that people who think deeply about things who are not constrained by sort of the,
*  I don't think you're quite controversial. No, not really. But you are a person who thinks
*  deeply about things and it feels like academia can sometimes stifle that.
*  I think so. So my concern right now, Lex, for young scholars is that
*  the restrictions and expectations are such that it's highly unlikely that anybody will do anything
*  of great value or innovation except for, and this is not a bad thing, but stepwise improvement
*  of existing paradigms. So in simple English, I went to Princeton for a job interview 40 years
*  ago and they're like, what are you going to do if we give you a job? And I'm like, I don't know,
*  I want to think about it and read. And I saw that that interview was over, the window of opportunity
*  shut in my face and they actually called my mentors and they're like, what are you doing? Tell
*  this guy to buy some pants. I had hair down to my waist also. He's like, this guy looks like Charles
*  Manson. Jesus. But the expectation is that you come to a post, you start publishing so that
*  you can get grants. That's certainly true, but there's also kind of a behavioral thing. You said
*  like long hair. There's a certain style of the way you're supposed to behave. For example,
*  I'm wearing a suit. It sounds weird, but I feel comfortable in this. I wore it when I was teaching
*  at MIT. I wore it to meetings and so on, sometimes a blue and red tie, but that was an outsider thing
*  to do at MIT. So there was a strong pressure to not wear a suit. And there's a pressure to behave,
*  to have a hair thing. The way you wear your hair, the way you... This isn't like a liberal or
*  anything, it's just in tribes and academia to me, or any place that dreams of having
*  renegade, free thinkers, really deep thinkers should in fact glorify the outsider. Should welcome
*  people that don't fit in. That sounds weird, but I can just imagine an interview at Princeton.
*  I can imagine why aren't you at Harvard, for example, or at MIT?
*  Yeah. Well, so look, I would love to... I haven't lectured at MIT, but I've lectured at Harvard.
*  I've gotten to lecture at almost every place that wouldn't consider me for a job.
*  Well, a few things, I'm lucky because I go to Princeton, I'm like, I don't know what I want
*  to do. And then two days later, I go to Skidmore and I'm like, I don't know what I want to do.
*  And they offer me a job later that day, which I declined for months because of the extraordinary
*  pressure of my mentors who right-mindedly felt that I wouldn't get much done there.
*  But what they told me at Skidmore was, take your time, show up for your classes and don't molest
*  barnyard animals and you'll probably get tenure. And I'm like, I'll show up for my classes.
*  That was the negotiation.
*  Yeah, I negotiated, I drove a hard bargain. But honestly, Lex, that's...
*  I feel I'm very committed to Skidmore because I was given tenure when our first terror management
*  paper wasn't published. It took eight years to publish. It was rejected at every journal
*  and I submitted it as like a purple ditto sheet thing. I'm like, here's what I've been doing,
*  here's the reviews, here's why I think this is still a pretty good idea.
*  And I don't know that this would happen even at Skidmore anymore, but I was very lucky to be given
*  the latitude and to be encouraged. I took classes at Skidmore. That's how I learned all this stuff.
*  I got a PhD unscathed by knowledge. We were great statisticians and methodologists,
*  but we didn't have any substance. And I don't mean this cynically, but we were
*  trained in a method in search of a question. So I appreciate having five years at Skidmore,
*  basically to read books. And I also appreciate that I look like this 40 years ago. And my view is
*  that this is how I comported myself. Other people, the guy I learned the most from
*  at Skidmore is now dead, a history professor, Ted Kuroda, he wore a bow tie. And there's another guy,
*  Darnell Rucker, who taught me about philosophy. And he was very proper and he had like his jacket
*  with like the leather patches. But these guys weren't pompous at all. They were, this is the way
*  I am. And I always felt that that's important that somebody who looks at you and says,
*  oh, what a stiff, he's probably an MBA. Well, they're wrong. And someone who looks at me,
*  when I first got to Skidmore, other professors would ask when I be coming to their office to empty
*  the garbage. They just assumed, you know, as in my twenties, they assumed I was housekeeping.
*  I always felt that was important that the students learn not to judge an idea by the appearance of
*  the person who pervades it. And yeah, I mean, that's, I guess this is such a high concern now,
*  because I personally still have faith that academia is where the great geniuses will come from.
*  I do too.
*  And great ideas.
*  I love hearing you say that. I still, and it's one of the reasons why I'm really apprehensive
*  about the future of education right now, in the context of the pandemic. I, is that a lot of folks,
*  and a lot of these are Google type people who I don't, you know, they're geniuses also,
*  but I don't like this idea that all learning can be virtual and that much could happen.
*  I'm big on embodied environments with actual humans interacting.
*  Yeah, there's, I mean, there's so much to the university education, but I think the key part
*  the mentorship that occurs somehow and at the human level, like I've gotten a lot of flack,
*  like this conversation we're in in person now. And I've, even with Edward Snowden, who done all
*  interviews remote, I'm a stickler to in person. It has to be in person. Like, and a lot of people
*  just don't get it. They're like, well, why can't this is so much easier? Like why go through the
*  pain? Like I've traveled, I'm traveling in the next month to Paris for a single stupid conversation
*  nobody cares about just to be in person. Well, it's important to me. I, I honestly, I was like,
*  this, and thank you for coming down today. It's my pleasure, but again, very self-serving. I've
*  enjoyed this. I knew I was going to, but it's not about our enjoyment per se. Again, at the risk of
*  sounding cavalier, there are a host of factors beyond verbal that I don't believe can be
*  adequately captured. I don't care how much the acuity is decent on a Zoom conversation. I feel,
*  again, I felt within five minutes that this was going to be for me easy in the sense that I could
*  speak freely. I just don't see that happening so easily from a distance. Yeah, I tend to. Well,
*  I'm hopeful. I agree with you on the current technology, but I am hopeful, unlike some others
*  on the technology eventually being able to create that kind of experience. Oh, I think it's,
*  we're quite far away from that, but it might be able to. My hope is, I'm hopeful. I was at
*  Microsoft in Seattle and I can't remember why. No, I can't. That's how I'm in my early Mr. Magoo phase
*  and somebody there was showing us a virtual wall where the entire wall,
*  when you're talking to somebody, so it's life size and they were beginning to
*  get the appearance of motion and stuff. It looked pretty.
*  Yeah, with virtual reality too. I don't know if you've ever been inside a virtual world.
*  It's to me, it's, I can just, I can see the future. It's quite real in terms of like a terror of death.
*  I'm afraid of heights. Me too. And there's, I don't know if you've ever tried,
*  you should, if you haven't, there's a virtual reality experience where you can walk a plank
*  and you can look down and, oh man, I was on the ground. Like I was like, I was afraid. I was
*  deeply afraid. I was, it was, it was as real as anything else could be. And I mean, these are very
*  early days of that technology, relatively speaking. So yeah, I mean, I don't know what to do with that.
*  Same with like crossing the street. We did these experiments across the street in front of a car
*  and, you know, it's being run over by a car. It's terrifying. It's just that, yeah. So there is a
*  rich experience to be created there. We're not there yet, but yeah. And I've seen a lot of people
*  try, like you said, the Google folks, Silicon Valley folks try to create a virtual online
*  education. I don't know. I think they've raised really important questions about like what
*  makes the education experience fulfilling? What makes it effective? Yeah. These are important
*  questions. And I think what they highlight is we have no clue. Like there's a, Thomas Sowell
*  wrote a book about, a recent book on charter schools. Yeah. I would like to talk to him.
*  Yeah. He's an interesting guy. We will disagree about a lot, but respectfully.
*  Yeah. Such a powerful mind. Yeah. But he, I need to read. I've only heard him talk about the book,
*  but he argues quite seemingly effectively that, that, that the public education system is broken,
*  that we blame. He basically says that we kind of blame, like the conditions or the, the environment,
*  but the upbringing of people like parenting, blah, blah, blah, like the, the set of opportunities.
*  But okay. Putting that aside, it seems like charter schools, no matter who it is that attends them,
*  does much better than in public schools. And he puts a bunch of data behind it. And in his usual
*  way, as you know, just is very eloquent in arguing his points. So that to me just highlights, man,
*  we don't, education is like one of the most important, it's probably the most important
*  thing in our civilization. And we're doing a shitty job of it. Yeah. In academia, in
*  in university education and, you know, younger education. Yep. The whole thing. The whole thing.
*  And yet we value just about anyone or anything more than educators. You know, part of it is just the
*  relatively low regard that Americans have. For teachers. For teachers.
*  Also similarly, like, um, just people, people of service, I think great teachers, uh,
*  are the greatest thing in our society. And I would say now on a controversial note, like black lives
*  matter, uh, uh, you know, great police officers is the greatest thing in our society. Also like all
*  people that do service, we undervalue cops severe, like this whole defund the police is missing the
*  point. And it's a stupid word. I'm with you on that. Our neighbors to one side of our house
*  are three generations of police. Our neighbors across the street are police. They know my,
*  you know, political predilections. And we've gotten along fine for 30 years and I go out and
*  tell them every day, you know, when you go in today, uh, you tell the people on the force
*  that, uh, I appreciate what they're doing. I think it's really important to not tribalize
*  those concerns. I mean, we mentioned so many brilliant books and philosophers,
*  but it'd be nice to serve in a focused way. Tried to see if we can get some recommendations
*  from you. So what, what three books, technical or fiction or philosophical had a,
*  Oh man.
*  Big,
*  No, that's awesome.
*  Had a big impact in your life and you would recommend.
*  Spent four hours driving here, uh, perseverating about that. I didn't, I, everything else you sent
*  me.
*  That's fine.
*  And I actually, I skimmed it and I'm like, I don't want to look at it because I want,
*  I want us to talk. The ones in blue. I'm like, all right. And you know, I've already said that
*  I've found Becker's work and I put the denial of death out there. Um,
*  Is that his best, sorry, a small tangent. Is there other books that of his?
*  Yeah. See, if I could have this count as one that the, the birth and death of meaning,
*  the denial of death and escape from evil are three books of Ernest Becker's that I believe to all be
*  profound
*  in a, in a little sort of brief dance around topics. Uh, I've only read denial of death.
*  Like how do those books connect in your,
*  Yeah, nice. So the, the birth and death of meaning is where Becker situates his thinking
*  in more of an evolutionary foundation. So I like that for that reason. Escape from evil
*  is where he applies the ideas in the denial of death more directly, um, to economic matters
*  and to inequality and also to our inability to peacefully coexist with other folks who don't
*  share our beliefs. So I would put Ernest Becker out there as one. Um, I also like novels a lot
*  and here I was like, God damn it. No matter what I say, I'm going to be like, yes, but,
*  the existentialists, do you like all those folks? Camus, do you like that literary existentialism?
*  I do, but I mean, you know, I, I've read all those books. I will tell you the last line of the plague,
*  we learn in times of pestilence that there's more to admire in men than to despise. And I love that.
*  Yeah. Plagues such a, I don't know. I find the plague is a brilliant book.
*  Me too.
*  Before the plague has come to us in 2020, it was just a book about love.
*  But I'll toss a one that may be less known to folks. I'm enamored with a novel by a woman
*  named Carson McCullers written in 1953 called Clock Without Hands. And I find it a brilliant
*  literary depiction of many of the ideas that we have spoken about.
*  Fiction?
*  Fiction. Yeah.
*  What's, what kind of ideas are we talking about?
*  All of the existential ideas that we have encountered today, but in the context of a story
*  of someone who finds out that he is terminally ill, it's set in the South and the heyday of like
*  segregation. So there's a lot of social issues, a lot of existential issues, but it's basically
*  a fictional account of someone who finds out that they're terminally ill and who reacts
*  originally as you might expect anyone becomes more hostile to people who are different,
*  like petty and stupid, denies that anything's happening. But as the book goes on and he comes
*  more to terms with his own mortality, it ends lovingly. And I'm back to your idea about,
*  you know, love being incredibly potent.
*  That's the nice thing, as you mentioned before with Heidegger. I really like that idea. And I've
*  seen that in people who are terminally ill is they bring, you know, the idea of death becomes
*  current. It becomes like a thing. You know, I could die. I really like that idea. I can die
*  not just tomorrow, but like now. Now. Now. Yeah. That's a really useful. I don't even know. I
*  think I've been too afraid to even think about that. Like, I have like, like sit here and think
*  like in five minutes, it's over. Yeah. This is it. This is five minutes. It's over. Yeah.
*  So that would be my most recent addition is I really am struck by Heidegger.
*  Oh, would you recommend? Well, okay. Well, if you have a few years, I tuned out being in time. I
*  was like, I try to read it. I was like, that's it. It's a look. It took me 40 years to read Ulysses.
*  It could not get past the first five pages. And it took me 40 years to read being in time.
*  It's a slog. Yeah. And I took a James Joyce course in college. So I've, I even,
*  I guess, read parts of fitting his wake. No way. But like, there's a difference between reading
*  and like, I don't think I understood anything. I like his short stories. The dead, the dead. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Well, I'm that and I like Faulkner. Absalom, Absalom is a fine book. But would you,
*  is there something Heidegger connected in a book you would recommend or no?
*  No. So maybe I got to abandon him. I mean, I mean, being in time is awesome.
*  But here's an interesting thing and not to get all academic-y, but, you know, it's, there's two
*  parts to it. And most of the most philosophers are preoccupied with the first part. It's in the second
*  part where he gets into all the flight from death stuff and this idea of, you know, a turning.
*  And philosophers don't like that. And I'm like, this is where he's starting to really shine.
*  To really shine for me. So. Yeah. Yeah. All right. That's a beautiful set of books. So what
*  advice would you give to a young person today about their career, about life,
*  about how to survive in this world full of suffering?
*  Yeah, great. My advice is to get competent advice. That's what I tell my students at StemR.
*  Don't listen to me. Don't listen to me. Well, you know, I think
*  my big piece of advice these days is, you know, again, it's at the risk of sounding
*  like a simpleton, but it's to emphasize a few things. One is,
*  you know, one of your questions, I think, was, you know, what's the meaning of life? And of course,
*  the existentialists say life has no meaning, but it doesn't follow from that, that it's intrinsic,
*  that it's meaningless. You know what? The existential point is not that life is meaningless
*  so much as it doesn't have one inevitable and intrinsic meaning. You know, when you're
*  inevitable and intrinsic meaning, you know, which then it opens up, you know, I think it was
*  Kierkegaard who said, consciousness gives us the possibility of possibilities. And, but there's
*  another lunatic, Oswald Spengler, who wrote a book called Declan of the West. And he says that the
*  philosopher, the German philosopher Goethe, he says the purpose of life is to live.
*  And I want that's, so that's one of my pieces of advice.
*  So the possibility of possibilities, it's interesting. So what do you do with this
*  kind of sea of possibilities? Like, well, this is one of the, when young folks talk to me,
*  especially these days, is there swimming in the sea of possibilities?
*  Yeah. Well, so this is, it's great. And so that's another existential point, which is that we yearn
*  for freedom. We react vigorously when we perceive that our choices have been curtailed.
*  And then we're paralyzed by indecision in the wake of seemingly unlimited possibilities,
*  because we're not choking on choice. And I'm not sure if this is helpful advice or not,
*  but what I say to folks is that the fact of the matter is, is that, you know, for most people,
*  choice is a first world problem. And sometimes the best option is to do something,
*  as silly as it sounds. And then if that doesn't work, do something else,
*  which just sounds like my mom torturing me when I was young. But, you know, part of the thing that
*  I find myself singularly ill equipped is that we're at the, I may be at the tail end of the last
*  generation of Americans where you like picked something and that's what you did. Like I've been
*  at a job for 40 years where you can expect to do better than your parents, because those days are
*  gone. And where you can make a comfortable inference that the world in a decade or two
*  will have any remote similarity to the one that we now inhabit. And so-
*  But still you recommend just do.
*  Yeah. And to do so, again, this is so back to the Heidegger guy, because
*  all right, I may, you know, I consider myself a professor, but what happens if most of the
*  schools go out of business? Somebody else may consider themselves a restaurateur, but what
*  happens if there's no more restaurants? So what I, this is negative advice, but I tell folks,
*  don't define yourself as a social caricature. Don't limit how you feel about yourself
*  through identification with a host of variables that may be uncertain.
*  May be temporary.
*  And temporary.
*  What? I'm sorry.
*  No, but of course that gets back to your point earlier, Lex, where you're like, yeah,
*  but when you step out of that, it's extraordinarily discombobulating.
*  So what, I think you talked about an axe of chopping wood and soul from Socrates.
*  Yeah.
*  What is your soul? What is the essence of shell in?
*  Wow. That was like awesome.
*  Like when God, when you show up at the end of this thing, he kind of looks at you. He's like,
*  oh yeah. I remember you.
*  Yeah. Well, you know, to be honest, what I muse about
*  is to me, when people are, I told you, we have two kids, late twenties, early thirties.
*  And over the years, when we meet people that know our kids and they're like, oh,
*  your kids are kind and decent. And I'd be like, that's what I would like.
*  To be. Because I think intelligence is vastly overrated. You know, the Unabomber was a smart
*  guy. And I do admire intelligence and I do venerate education. And I find that to be
*  tremendously important. But if I had to pay the ultimate homage to myself,
*  it would be to be known as somebody who takes himself too seriously to take myself too seriously.
*  Again, as corny as it sounds, I'd like to leave the world a tad better than I found it,
*  or at least do no harm.
*  And I think you did all right in that regard.
*  I love that question, Alex. That's a good one. I think everyone should be asked that.
*  What is your soul?
*  Do you have maybe just a few lingering questions around it?
*  So, I mean, on the point of the soul, you've talked about the meaning of life. Do you have
*  on a personal level, do you have an answer to the meaning of your life of something that brought you
*  meaning, happiness, some sense of sense?
*  No, I mean, yes, yes and no. I mean, I'm 66, so I'm in the kind of
*  not ready to wrap it up literally or metaphorically. But I look back and
*  just really with a sense of awe and wonder, gratitude.
*  And is there memories that stand out to you from childhood from earlier that like,
*  it's like, you know, stand out as something you're really proud of or
*  just happy to have been on this earth?
*  Mainly, yeah, that I mean, you know, my family, also a chunk were my folks,
*  my grandparents are from Eastern Europe, you know, Russia, Austria.
*  As far as we know, some of them never made it out. I consider myself
*  very fortunate to have been a so-called product of the American dream.
*  You know, my grandparents were basically peasants, my parents, my dad worked two full-time jobs.
*  When I was growing up and I would see him on the weekends, I'd be like,
*  why are you working all the time? He'd be like, so you won't have to.
*  He said, look, the world does not owe you a living. And so your first responsibility is
*  to take care of yourself. And then your next responsibility is to take care of other people.
*  I think you did a pretty good job of that.
*  Those are the things that I'm proud of.
*  It's funny, you've talked about just yourself as a human being,
*  but you've also contributed some really important ideas for your ideas and also
*  kind of integrating and maybe even popularizing the work of Ernest Becker, of connecting it,
*  of making it legitimate scientifically. I mean, you know, as a human, of course, you want to be,
*  you want your ripple to be one that makes the world a better place. But also I think
*  in the span of time, I think it's of great value, you've contributed in terms of how we
*  think about the human condition, how we think about ourselves as finite beings in this world.
*  And I hope also in our technology of engineering intelligence, I think, at least for me,
*  at least for me, and I'm sure there's a lot of other people like me that your work has been a
*  gift for. So thank you. I like that. And then we have described ourselves as giant interneurons.
*  I'm like, we have had no original ideas. And maybe that's the only thing that's original
*  about our work is we don't claim to be original. What we claim to have done is to integrate,
*  to connect these disparate and superficially unconnected discourses. You know, so existentialists,
*  they'd be like, evidence? What's that? And yeah, there's now a branch of psychology,
*  experimental existential psychology that I think we could take credit for having encouraged the
*  formation of. And that in turn has gotten these ideas in circulation and academic communities
*  where they may not have otherwise gotten. So I think that's good.
*  Well, Sheldon is a huge honor. I can't believe you came down here. I've been a fan of your work.
*  I hope we get to talk again. Huge honor to talk to you. Thank you so much for talking today.
