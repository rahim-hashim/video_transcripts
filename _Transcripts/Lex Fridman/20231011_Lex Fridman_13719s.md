# Jared Kushner: Israel, Palestine, Hamas, Gaza, Iran, and the Middle East | Lex Fridman Podcast #399
**Lex Fridman:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co_MeKSnyAo)
*  The following is a conversation with Jared Kushner, former senior advisor to the president
*  during the Donald Trump administration and author of Breaking History, a White House memoir.
*  He's one of the most influential and effective presidential advisors in modern history,
*  helping conduct negotiations with some of the most powerful leaders in the world
*  and deliver results on trade, criminal justice reform, and historic progress towards peace
*  in the Middle East. On Thursday, October 5th, we recorded a conversation on topics of war and peace,
*  history and power in the Middle East and beyond. This was about a day and a half before the Hamas
*  attack on Israel, and then we felt we must sit down again on Monday, October 9th, and add a
*  discussion on the current situation. We opened the podcast with the second newly recorded part.
*  My heart goes out to everyone who has and is suffering in this war. I pray for your strength
*  and for the long-term peace and flourishing of the Israeli and Palestinian people. I love you all.
*  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and now, dear friends, here's Jared Kushner.
*  We did a lot of this conversation before the Hamas attack on Israel, and we decided to sit down again
*  and finish the discussion to address the current situation, which is still developing.
*  If I may, allow me to summarize the situation as it stands today. It's morning, Monday, October 9th.
*  On Saturday, October 7th, at 6.30 a.m. Israel time, Hamas fired thousands of rockets into
*  southern Israel. The rocket attack served as cover for a multi-pronged infiltration of Israel
*  territory by over 1,000 Hamas militants. This is shortly after, at 7.40 a.m. The Hamas militants
*  went door to door in border towns, killing civilians and taking captives, including women
*  and children. In response to this, Israeli Air Force began carrying out strikes in Gaza,
*  also fighting on the ground in Israel to clear out Hamas militants from Israel territory
*  and preparing to mobilize Israeli troops for a potential ground attack on Hamas in Gaza.
*  Now, of course, this is what it appears to be right now, and this, along with other things,
*  might change because the situation is still developing. The IDF is ordering civilian residents
*  of Gaza to evacuate their homes for their safety. Benjamin Netanyahu declared war
*  in several statements and warned Israelis to brace themselves for a long and difficult war.
*  Just today, Israeli ministers ordered a, quote, complete siege of
*  Gaza, interrupting supplies of electricity, food, water, and fuel from Israel to Gaza.
*  As of now, October 9th, the death toll is over 1,200 people and over 130 hostages taken to Gaza
*  by Hamas. So, as I said, the events are rapidly unfolding, so these numbers will sadly increase,
*  but hopefully our words here can at least in part speak to the timeless underlying currents of
*  the history and, as you write about, the power dynamics of the region.
*  So, for people who don't know, Gaza is a 25-mile-long, 6-mile-wide strip of territory
*  along the Mediterranean Sea. It borders Israel on the east and north and Egypt on the southwest.
*  It's densely populated, about 2.3 million people, and there's been a blockade of Gaza by Israel and
*  Egypt since 2007 when Hamas took power. I can just summarize that Hamas is a Palestinian
*  militant group which rules the Gaza Strip. It originated in 1988 and it came to power in Gaza
*  in 2006. As part of its charter, it's sworn to the destruction of Israel and it is designated by
*  the United States, European Union, UK, and, of course, Israel as a terrorist group.
*  So, given that context, what are your feelings as a human being and what is your analysis as
*  the former senior advisor to the president under the Trump administration of the current situation
*  in Israel and Gaza? So, I think you did an excellent job of summarizing a lot of the context, but
*  watching what's unfolded over the last 48 hours has been truly heartbreaking to see. We're still
*  in the early stages of what's developing, but seeing the images on X of militants,
*  terrorists going door-to-door with machine guns, gunning down innocent civilians,
*  seeing beheaded Israeli soldiers, seeing young 20-year-olds at a rave, a dance party to celebrate
*  peace with militants flying in and then shooting machine guns to kill people indiscriminately,
*  seeing young children captive and held prisoner, seeing 80-year-old grandmothers, a Holocaust
*  survivor, also being taken captive. These are just images and actions that we have not seen
*  in this world since 9-11. This is a terror attack on the scale of which we have not seen,
*  and it's been incredibly hard for a lot of people to comprehend. My heart goes out, obviously, to
*  all of the families of the victims, to the families of those who are held in captive now,
*  and to all of Israel, because one of the beautiful things about the state of Israel is that
*  when one Israeli is hurting, the entire nation comes together. It's a shame that it's taking
*  an action like this to unify the nation, but I have seen incredibly beautiful signs over the
*  last 48 hours of a country coming together. The Jewish people have been under oppression before
*  the Jewish people know what it's like, and seeing people rally together to fight for their homeland,
*  to try to reestablish safety is a very beautiful thing to watch. I wish it wasn't something we had
*  to watch, but it is. With that being said, though, the backdrop, I've been speaking to friends over
*  the last couple of days. I have one friend I spoke with last night who was saying that, a good friend
*  messaged him saying, I'm going in, we're going to do some operations to try to free some of the
*  hostages held in one of the kippurzes. I messaged him the next morning. He was one of the first
*  through the door to try to free these hostages, and he was killed by a Hamas militant. Sadly,
*  we're going to be hearing many, many more stories of brave Israeli soldiers trying to get these
*  terrorists out of Israel, trying to free innocent civilians who, unfortunately, are risking their
*  lives to do it. They're all heroes, but some will have less good faith than others, sadly.
*  It's a very, very heartbreaking moment. I do think that it's very important at this moment in time
*  for the entire world to stand behind Israel. I think that Hamas has shown the entire world
*  who they really are, what their aim is, what they're willing to do, and all of the strong
*  security that Israel's put in place over the last years, which in some instances was criticized
*  is now being validated that there was a real threat that they were looking to deter.
*  Short answer is my heart is broken, praying for peace, praying for strength, praying for
*  Israel to do what it needs to do to avoid being in this situation again, which is either eliminating
*  or severely degrading Hamas's capabilities. There cannot be peace in Israel and in the Middle East
*  while there is a terror group that is being funded by Iran that is allowed to flourish and
*  is allowed to plan operations that are going to aim to kill innocent civilians. As somebody who
*  was formerly in this position, who was intimately involved with Israel with the strategies to
*  minimize attacks from Hamas and to try to turn the region around, I think we did do
*  a very substantial job under President Trump. The Middle East went from one of the most
*  chaotic regions in the world. You had ISIS in 2016. ISIS had a caliphate the size of Ohio.
*  They were beheading journalists. They were killing Christians. They controlled 8 million people.
*  They were planning attacks all over the world from their caliphate. They were
*  using the internet to radicalize people. We had the San Bernardino shooting in America. We had
*  the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. There was real threat. Then you had Iran,
*  which was given $150 billion in a glide path to a nuclear weapon. They were using their newfound
*  riches to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, different rebels all over the region that were
*  looking to destabilize further. Syria was in a civil war where 500,000 people were killed. Yemen
*  was destabilized. Libya was destabilized. It was just a mess. All of America's allies had felt
*  betrayed. President Trump came into power. We rebuilt the trust and the relationships with all
*  of our traditional allies. We were able to eliminate ISIS, the territorial caliphate.
*  Then we were able to project strength in the region, really go after Iran's wallet. We were
*  able to stop through crushing sanctions, a lot of their financial resources, which they were using
*  to fund all these terror groups. So we left the Middle East with six peace deals and a fairly
*  peaceful world. So seeing what's happening, I think it was completely avoidable. I think it's
*  horrible to see that it's occurring. I pray that those in power will make the right decisions to
*  restore safety, but also to potentially create a better paradigm for peace in the future.
*  LW So I have a lot of questions to ask you about the journey towards this historic progress towards
*  peace with the Abraham Accords. But first, on this situation, to step back and some of the history,
*  is there things about the history of Hamas in Gaza that's important to understand
*  what is happening now? Just your comments, your thoughts, your understanding of Hamas?
*  BD I think you did an excellent job, Lex, of really giving the summary. Just a couple things
*  maybe I'll add to it is that Hamas was originally founded from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt,
*  which is a group that's caused a lot of issues in the region. They've attacked Israel many times
*  in the past. There's a lot of discussion about how Israel is an occupying power. Well, in Gaza,
*  in 2005, they withdrew from all the land, and then they say Israel's an apartheid state. Well,
*  Israel then gave governance of the region to the Palestinians. And then what's happened is,
*  is the Palestinian people's lives have now gone down, not up since then. I will say that under
*  Hamas's leadership in Gaza, the people who have suffered the most are the Palestinian people.
*  And I've watched cries throughout my time in government from people saying,
*  we want to see the Palestinian people live a better life. I agree with those people. I think
*  that the Palestinian people in Gaza are essentially hostages. In Gaza, you have basically
*  2 million people that are being held hostage by 30,000 Hamas terrorists. And that's really the
*  problem. And I would just encourage people to push their attention and energy in this moment and
*  their anger towards Hamas. Those are the people who are killing innocent civilians, who are
*  murdering indiscriminately. And those are the people who have held back the Palestinians from
*  having a better life. And just finally, what I would say is, what we saw with Hamas was that
*  if you go back to 2007, they basically had just one plan that they did over and over. And we were
*  very careful to try to monitor very closely and stop the Iranian money and the resources from
*  coming in. And again, we took a little bit of criticism from the international community from
*  keeping the border tight. But unfortunately, every time you'd allow construction materials
*  to go into Gaza, they'd use them to build tunnels, not homes. You would have equipment
*  that would come in to build pipes. They'd turn it into bombs. So it was very, very hard to figure
*  out how do you get the resources into Gaza to help people have a better life, while at the same time,
*  the leadership in Gaza was taking all those resources and turning it into military equipment
*  to attack Israel. What role does Iran play in this war, in this connection to Hamas?
*  Can you speak to the connection between Hamas and Iran that's important to understand, especially as
*  this most recent attack unfolds? Sure. So the correlation, I mean, there's reports that
*  Iran is behind the attack. Hamas has thanked Iran for their support. And it's been very well known
*  that Iran supports the destruction of the State of Israel. And I won't say Iran is a country. I'll
*  talk about Iran in the leadership. There's actually a beautiful thing I saw on the internet,
*  where at one of the soccer games in Iran, they were trying to rally support for the Hamas terror
*  attacks. And a lot of people in the crowds were chanting, you know, F you to the regime,
*  because I think the Iranian people, the Persian people generally are peace-loving people who don't
*  want to see this focus on destruction and annihilation. But you saw this in 2015, 2016,
*  when the Iranian government had resources, the region was less safe. And since now,
*  there's been more resources allowed to go to the Iranian regime by lack of enforcement of sanctions.
*  And as a result, Iran is funding Hezbollah, Hamas. They were funding the Houthis. Now there's a little
*  bit of a detente between Saudi and Iran, which has led to that going down, which only further
*  proves that Iran was behind the Houthis, which is what the Saudis had been saying for years,
*  and Iran was denying. So there's a very strong relationship between the two. And we always knew
*  that the way that Iran fights wars or fights conflicts is never directly, it's usually
*  through its proxies. And in this case, Hamas has been a proxy for Iran, who wanted to obviously
*  see the destruction of Israel, but also does not want to see the Israelis and the Saudis
*  come together for a peace agreement. So the name of this operation,
*  of the Hamas operation, is Al-Aqsa Flood, referring to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. How much of this attack is
*  about the Al-Aqsa Mosque? In actuality, I don't think any of it is, but the Al-Aqsa Mosque is
*  something that all of the Shia jihadists have used for years in order to justify their actions that
*  are aggressive towards Israel. So this is something I'll maybe even take a step back and go through.
*  When I was working initially in my first year on the peace plan, I was doing a lot of listening.
*  And quite frankly, a lot of what people were saying to me didn't make sense.
*  And the reason why I was trying to figure out they were talking about sovereignty over Al-Aqsa
*  Mosque, the Al-Aqsa Mosque is a mosque that's built in the Holy of Holies, the Haram al-Sharif
*  in Israel, where the Jewish Beit Hamigdash, the Holy Temple, was built in a very religious place
*  about after the temple was destroyed. Then there was a big mosque built there, and it's one of the
*  more holy places in Islam now. So the big thing everyone was saying is, what do you do with this
*  land where you have a mosque built over a very big Jewish site? And I was hearing all of the experts,
*  and I always say experts with quotes because only in Washington can you work on something for a
*  decade and continue to fail, and then you basically leave and are considered an expert.
*  But that's one of the problems with Washington, which maybe we could talk about later.
*  But the notion here was I went and I said, let me try to understand what the issue is with the
*  Israeli-Palestinian conflict with the people. I always felt the politicians were a little
*  disconnected, so I commissioned several focus groups, one in Amman, one in Cairo, one in Dubai,
*  and one in Ramallah. And I asked people, Muslims, what is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about?
*  And time and time again, the most popular thing that they said was that
*  Israel was not allowing access to the mosque for Muslims to pray. And what was interesting was
*  is that Israel's policy is to allow anyone who wants to come and pray peacefully at the sites
*  to come and pray. Sometimes they have security issues when there's provocations, but by and
*  large since 1967 when Israel was able to take back Jerusalem in a defensive war, just to be very
*  clear, they were attacked in the south and they were attacked from the east and they basically
*  were able to beat back the Jordanians and the Egyptians and then reconquer the old city of
*  Jerusalem. And during that time, immediately after Israel then passed the protection of holy places
*  law, which was they basically took resources they didn't have and they said we're going to
*  restore the Christian sites, the Muslim sites, the Jewish sites, and they've worked to allow
*  everyone access to the mosque. So today, any Muslim who wants to come can come and pray at
*  the mosque. The mosque is, Israel's acknowledged that King Abdullah, the King of Jordan, is the
*  custodian of the mosque. And as long as people want to come to the country and pray peacefully,
*  they're able to do that. But if you look at a lot of the propaganda that's been used by
*  ISIS or Iran to recruit terrorists or to justify their incursions, they often say they're doing it
*  in the name of liberating the Al Aqsa Mosque. But from an operational and pragmatic perspective
*  today, any Muslim who wants to go to the mosque, you can book a flight to Israel now through Dubai
*  because there's flights between Israel and Dubai. And as long as your country has relations with
*  Israel and they'll accept your passport in there, you can come and pray. And that's what Israel wants.
*  Israel wants Jerusalem to be a place where all religions can come and celebrate together. But
*  you have a lot of actors that look to find ways to use these religious tensions in order to sow
*  division and justify violent behavior. I wonder how it's possible to lessen the effectiveness of
*  that propaganda message that a lot of the war, a lot of the attacks about access to the Al Aqsa Mosque.
*  Is there something you can speak to why that message hasn't disseminated across the Arab world?
*  So Israel's good at a lot of things. They're not very good traditionally with public relations.
*  After the Abraham Accords, we made the first Abraham Accords deal in August 2020. And then
*  we made five other deals. We first did United Arab Emirates. Then we did a deal with Bahrain.
*  Then we did a deal with Kosovo. Then we did a deal with Sudan. Then we did a deal with Morocco.
*  And then we got the GCC deal done as well. The tension between Qatar, Saudi, UAE, Egypt, and
*  Bahrain. And that was allowing us to create a pathway to then pursue the Israeli-Saudi
*  normalization. So we had so much momentum then that the goal was just keep getting more
*  countries to normalize relations with Israel. Once you create the connection between people
*  and create the ability for people to do business together, the ability for flights to fly between,
*  then you would just start naturally having people coming. And everyone has a smartphone today so
*  they can then post and combat the misinformation that's been out there. But this misinformation
*  is not something that's new. One of the characters who played a very big role in spreading the
*  anti-Semitism and the violence in Israel in the 1920s was a guy named Haj Amin al-Husseini, who was
*  known as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. He was very close with Hitler and Mussolini. And he was
*  working with them to try to get some claims to the Middle East once the Jewish people were
*  annihilated. And what he did for a very long time was he did the same shtick, only it was before
*  he had smartphones and YouTube, where he would say the mosque is under intact. These imperialist
*  Zionists are coming in to try to destroy the mosque. And he would use that to raise money from
*  Indonesia, from Pakistan, from all over the world, and then use that threat to justify recruiting
*  groups of young vulnerable Muslim men and then getting them in the name of religious rights to
*  go and kill people, which is not, which really is more of a perversion of the religion than I
*  think the true essence of what Islam is. I think Islam at its core is a peaceful religion. And I
*  think that's where a lot of the great leaders in Islam want to take it. But the people who use
*  Islam or the mosque as a justification for violence, those are people who I think are really,
*  they are disrespecting the Islam religion. As you said, you helped make major strides
*  towards peace in the Middle East with the Abraham Accords. Can you describe what it took to accomplish
*  this? And maybe this will help us understand what broke down and led to the tragedy this week.
*  Yeah. So, you know, I always believed in foreign policy. I learned very quickly that the difference
*  between a political deal and a business deal is that in a business deal, you have a problem set,
*  you come to a conclusion, and then if you buy or sell something, you either have, you know, more
*  cash or you have a company, so more to do, less to do. Political problem set is very different,
*  where, you know, the conclusion of a problem set is essentially the beginning of a new paradigm.
*  So when I would think about how do you move pieces around the board, you couldn't say,
*  let me just solve the problem. You have to think about what happens the day after the signing
*  and how do you create a paradigm that has positivity to it. So the biggest piece of what
*  President Trump did during his four years in office was he really strengthened the relationship
*  with Israel, number one, and he did things like recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
*  He moved the embassy to Jerusalem. He recognized the Golan Heights. He got out of the Iran deal.
*  We did an economic conference in Bahrain where we brought Israelis to meet with, you know,
*  Saudi and Emirati and Qatari businessmen, and everyone came together, and each one of these
*  instances were unthinkable previously, and everyone said that if you did it, the world was
*  going to end, and every time President Trump did one, the next morning the sun rose, the next evening
*  the sun set, and things moved on. And so by doing that, what President Trump did was he slaughtered
*  a lot of the sacred cows of these false barriers that people had erected and showed people that
*  the vast majority of the people in the Middle East, whether they're Jewish, Muslim, Christian,
*  whatever religion they are, they just want to live better lives. And so what we basically did
*  was create a paradigm where the voices for peace, the voices for together, now finally had a forum
*  where they were able to do it, and we did that in the backdrop. The way we were able to be successful
*  was we severely limited the resources of Iran, and they were focused more internally, and they
*  couldn't cause the trouble that they were causing everywhere else. Since we've left, obviously the
*  dynamics have changed, but the way you get to peace is obviously, number one, through strength,
*  and number two, by finding a way for people to be better off tomorrow than they are today. And what
*  I found was that most of the voices looking for violence or trouble were people who were just
*  focused on what happened two years ago, 20 years ago, 70 years ago, a thousand years ago. People
*  who were trying to solve those problems in that context often were looking more to use those
*  past grievances as a justification for their power and for the bad behavior that they were
*  looking to perpetuate. So managing, as we have talked about extensively, managing the power
*  dynamics of the region and providing a plan. This is something you did with the economic plan titled
*  Peace to Prosperity, a Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli People.
*  Can you first of all describe what's in the plan? Sure. So this was something I took on.
*  I was working on the political framework between the Israelis and the Palestinians and trying to
*  understand what were the issues. And the issues were not very many. It basically was you had a
*  land dispute, so you had to figure out where do you put borders ultimately. You had a security
*  paradigm, which I was much more favorable to Israel's perspective on. And obviously the
*  events of the past 48 hours have fully justified that bias. And then in addition to that, you had
*  to deal with the religious sites, but I felt operationally that wasn't actually as complicated
*  as people made it because you wanted to just leave it open for everybody. Then I went through
*  and I felt that the Palestinian leadership was fairly disincentivized to make a deal because
*  there was just this paradigm where they had billions of dollars coming in from the
*  international community. And I think that they feared that if they made a deal, they would lose
*  their relevancy internationally and the money would stop flowing into the country. So what I
*  tried to do is to say, my approach when I would get into a hard problem, say, how do I understand
*  all the different escape hatches? How do I try to eliminate them and then build a golden bridge
*  that becomes really the only but also the most desirable pathway for the decision makers to walk
*  through? And it wasn't always hard. And sometimes you have to go and hold their hand or you try to
*  pick them up and walk them across. But a lot of these leaders are very reluctant to change.
*  And the dynamics of the Palestinians also were such that I think they were fairly stuck where
*  they were. So we developed a business plan for Gaza, the West Bank. We threw in some improvements
*  for Jordan and Egypt as well. I based it off of the Vision 2030 that they did in Saudi Arabia,
*  which I thought was a visionary document. I went back through this process and I studied
*  basically every economic project in post-World War II periods. So we looked at what they did in
*  South Korea, why it was successful with some strong industrial planning. We looked at Japan,
*  we looked at Singapore, we looked at Poland, why it was successful. We spent a lot of time on the
*  Ukraine plan for the country and why it wasn't successful. And that was mostly because of
*  governance and corruption, which actually resembles a lot of what's gone wrong with
*  the Palestinians where there's no property rights, there's no rule of law. And what we did is we built
*  a plan to show it's not that hard in the sense that between the West Bank and Gaza, you had 5
*  million people. And we put together a plan, I think it was about $27 billion. We got together
*  a conference, I had the head of AT&T, we had Steve Schwartzman from Blackstone came,
*  which was very gracious of them. We had all the leading Arabic businessmen, the leading builders,
*  leading developers. And the general consensus of that conference was that this is very doable.
*  We think that for Gaza in particular, it would cost maybe $7 to $8 billion to rebuild the entire
*  place. We felt we could reduce the poverty rate in half, we can create over a million jobs there.
*  The only thing that people said was holding it back wasn't Israel. What was holding it back was
*  governance. And people wouldn't have confidence investing there with the rule that Hamas was
*  perpetuating. So I encourage people actually to look at the plan. It was very thoughtful,
*  it was 181 pages. We went project by project. Each project has costed out. It's a real plan
*  that could be implemented, but you need the right governance. And all of the different Arabic
*  countries are willing to fund it, the international community is willing to fund it because they've
*  just been throwing so much money at the Palestinians for years that's never been
*  outcomes-based or conditions-based. It's just been entitlement money. And unfortunately,
*  it hasn't really achieved any outcomes that have been successful. So it's a great business plan.
*  It just shows too rebuilding Gaza could be easy. But like I said, the problem that's held the
*  Palestinian people back and that's made their lives terrible in Gaza has not been Israel. It's
*  really been Hamas' leadership or lack of leadership and their desire to focus on
*  trying to kill Israelis and start war with Israel over improving the lives of the Palestinian people.
*  And the current approach of Hamas, the more violence they perpetrate, the more they can
*  hold onto power versus improving the lives of people. So they, as you said, maybe you can
*  comment on, they do not propose an economics plan. I mean, Hamas has been running it now
*  for 16 years and they don't have a lot to show for it. And our posture with them was basically
*  a very simple deal. If you think about what's the end state in Gaza, it's actually not that complicated.
*  There's no territorial disputes, right? The border's the border. There's no religious issues
*  there as well. You're not dealing with Jerusalem. You're basically just dealing with the fact that
*  Israel wants to make sure that there's no threat from Gaza. So it's a demilitarization or some kind
*  of security guarantee from a credible source where Israel doesn't feel like Gaza can be used to stage
*  attacks into Israel or to fire rockets into Israel. And by the way, these are things I was saying
*  three, four years ago that that was the objective and that was really the fear. Now that's been
*  proven. Unfortunately, the fear has manifested and in exchange you can rebuild the place and
*  you can give the people a much better life. But Hamas has not shown desire for that or a capability
*  for that. And I don't think there's enough trust to allow them to do that, which is why,
*  under the current circumstances, if you do want to have peace there, Hamas has to be either eliminated
*  or severely degraded in terms of their military capabilities. I would love to ask you about
*  leadership, especially on the side of the United States. What has the current administration,
*  the Biden administration, done different than the Trump administration, as you understand,
*  that may have contributed to the events we saw this week?
*  So all I can talk about are where we left them. We left them a place where they had tremendous
*  momentum in the Middle East. I met with them during the transition and said, look, we even got the
*  Qatar-Saudi conflict done, which was a big... No peace between Israel and Saudi would have been
*  possible without that. So we even got that done in our lame duck period. And they came in and they
*  said, look, we want to focus on the three Cs, which is COVID, climate change, and China. And I said,
*  that's great. But the Middle East, we have an amazing place right now. It's stable. There's
*  momentum. Iran is basically broke. We put such crippling sanctions on Iran that they went from
*  2.6 million barrels a day of oil they were selling to about 100,000 under Trump. So their foreign
*  currency reserves were basically depleted and they were broke. Same with the Palestinians.
*  We stopped the funding to UNRWA, the UN agency, which is totally corrupt. We've put $10 billion
*  in there. Over time, I did a poll in the Middle East, in Gaza, to say, okay, we've invested $10
*  billion here as a country. Are we popular? The US had a 7% approval rating. USAID had a 70% approval
*  rating, but it just felt like a waste of our taxpayer dollars. And again, we wanted to make
*  it conditions-based. The Biden administration came in. Number one, they started insulting Saudi and
*  Russia. Oil prices went up. At the same time, what they did was they stopped domestic production of
*  oil. They disincentivized a lot of oil and shale production with regulations. They stopped pipelines.
*  Oil prices went up. They stopped enforcing the sanctions against Iran, probably to get the oil
*  prices lower to make up for what they were doing. They ran to Iran to try to make a deal.
*  They started funding the Palestinians again right away. And I even said, if you're going to fund
*  them, if that's your policy, I respect that. Again, elections have consequences and you can
*  take a different policy. But what I would recommend is get some conditions, make them do
*  some reforms, make them give property rights to people, make them do real economic investments
*  for people. But they just went right away. So they were funding the Palestinians,
*  not enforcing the sanctions, and then overall just projecting a lot of weakness in the region.
*  So one of the most embarrassing examples is what happened in the United Arab Emirates. Again,
*  an amazing, probably one of America's best allies over the last 20, 30 years. They fought with us in
*  Afghanistan. They were the first Muslim country to stand up and do that after 9-11 because they
*  didn't want it to be a war of the West against the Muslim religion. So they joined the fight
*  because they saw it as a fight between right and wrong. They have rockets shot into their country
*  from the Houthis and they basically don't get a call from the US for 17 days. They need their
*  equipment that they buy from the US, which creates jobs in the US. They need it restocked. We don't
*  call. So they've severely degraded the trust that we had to rebuild with our allies. I think they've
*  been working now to get it back. They, after two years, started working with Saudi and Israel,
*  which I think was good. I think that they realized after a stint that maybe the process
*  that President Trump had created in the region was the right policy. Keep in mind, President Trump's
*  policy that I was working on was very strongly criticized during the first three years before
*  we were able to achieve the results because it was departure from the failed policies of the past.
*  So first there was a return to those policies, appease Iran, let's criticize Saudi Arabia.
*  Then they started embracing and working on the Israel-Saudi deal, which was really exciting. I
*  think we were all very excited about it. But they did it in public. I think that also was something,
*  I didn't have access to their intelligence, so I assumed that by doing it so publicly, they thought
*  that they'd either had to deal with Iran because they were letting them get all this revenue or
*  Iran wouldn't be a problem. But one of the reasons with the Abraham Accords, we kept it so quiet
*  during the whole time was because we always felt like the troublemakers in the region,
*  particularly Iran, who we thought would be disadvantaged by having UAE, Saudi, Israel
*  altogether. Israel's a nuclear power. You have other strong economies. Iran seeks instability.
*  They seek looking to create division in the region. If you can create that economic sphere
*  where you have security from Haifa to Muscat, from Israel to Oman all the way through with Saudi,
*  Jordan, UAE, Qatar, Egypt, that's an incredibly powerful block. If you can make it secure and
*  then get economic integration, that really could be a Middle East that thrives. Iran obviously
*  wanted nothing to do with that, and that's why they've been working to disrupt. I think the
*  administration has, they took an incredibly stable situation with momentum. I think they underestimated
*  the way that Iran would approach the region to undermine. I think they gave way too much
*  rope to Iran, and I think that they didn't seize when they had an opportunity of strength with
*  the Palestinians to try to drive to a conclusion that I believe could have prevented us being where
*  we are today. Not to mention that even just three weeks ago, it's a bad look that they
*  basically gave $6 billion to Iran in exchange for hostages, and then Iran's basically found
*  these terror attacks are killing American citizens in Israel. It's a heartbreaking situation,
*  again, totally avoidable, and one that I think has been very badly mismanaged to date.
*  If Trump was currently president and you were still working with him on this part of the world,
*  what actions would you take? What conversations would you have? What ideas would you be working
*  with in order to unite the various allies that you mentioned in the Middle East over this tragedy,
*  and not let it be a thing that divides the Middle East, but make it a thing that
*  catalyzes further progress towards peace? I want to say one thing, Lex. I have a lot of friends who
*  are fans of Trump or not fans of Trump, but one thing I want to say with absolute certainty is
*  that if President Trump was in office, this never would have happened. When President Trump
*  was in office, anyone who supports Israel or who wants to see Jewish people not be innocently
*  slaughtered, he would never have allowed that to happen. It did not happen when he was in power,
*  and I hope people recognize that as something that's very, very true.
*  How I would play the ball where it lies right now, keep in mind we transferred the ball,
*  it was on the green. Now it's almost like it's gone back 150 yards and it's in a sand trap.
*  I think the way that I would play the ball right now is, number one, is you have to show strength.
*  I actually think President Biden's words were the right words. I see that they're moving
*  aircraft carriers to the region. Again, the purpose of having a strong military,
*  I believe obviously if you get into a war, you want to win the war, but the purpose of a very
*  strong military primarily is to avoid a war. I don't know what kind of credibility the Biden
*  administration has to show the strength, but right now you have to support Israel completely.
*  You have to really let people in the region know that there'll be consequences if they try to
*  escalate. Again, we saw a little bit of rocket skirmish from Lebanon, from Hezbollah, but again,
*  this is the type of thing that they have to know there'll be severe consequences if they make this
*  a multi-party fight. I think sending a strong message to Iran, I think that they have to see
*  some consequences from this and know that they're not going to be allowed to have a free rein to
*  cause instability and that Iran doesn't usually fight face to face. They usually do it through
*  proxies, but let's just all be honest about where this is coming from and let them know that there
*  will be a consequence if they instigate these actions. Again, at least with the Biden
*  administration, they've had contact with Iran, they've been talking with Iran, but they've
*  allowed Iran. Again, the number I saw last year, I think under Trump, the number was maybe like
*  $4 or $5 billion of oil revenue. In total, I think last year it was something like $45 billion in
*  revenue. This year, I think there'll be even more. That's a combination of them driving up oil prices
*  but also allowing much more sales. You would think that they would find a way to get them to behave
*  and allow them to have this happen, or if that's not the case, then be tough. Go back to being tough.
*  That's what you have to do. Building off of Abraham Accords, as you mentioned,
*  Israel-Saudi normalization, there's been a lot of promising progress towards this.
*  What does it take to not allow this tragedy damage the progress towards Israel-Saudi normalization?
*  I think right now is probably not the best to think about that. I think that we want to think
*  about that after whatever is going to happen is going to happen now. I think right now, the number
*  one priority for Israel has to be to fully regain security in the country. Then number two is to
*  figure out how you can, like I said, eliminate or degrade the Hamas capability or other Iranian
*  threats to make sure that you have your security apparatus. I think that the Israeli leadership
*  right now should proceed with that. I don't think that they should be thinking about
*  normalization with Saudi at this moment. My instinct, and I've been watching this Israeli-Saudi
*  normalization play out, obviously just speaking with people and seeing what I've been reading
*  and watching with great excitement. I think it would be a game changer for the region. I think
*  it's one of Iran's worst nightmares to have Israel and Saudi interlinked together. I think it'd be
*  great for the Saudi people from a security perspective. What they're discussing with
*  America would be very strong. The ability to get different elements across would be incredible.
*  What I would say with it is that the industrial logic held yesterday and I think it will hold
*  again tomorrow. I always expect countries to act in their interests. I think that
*  the deal that's on the table right now between Saudi, Israel, and America is in
*  Saudi's interests. It's in America's interests and it's in Israel's interests.
*  What's going to happen now, though, is the political dynamics are going to shift.
*  I think that, as we've seen with political dynamics, they come and go. I think,
*  let's get through this moment and then I hope at the right time that those talks will be able to
*  resume and conclude in an appropriate way. It's funny, Lex, when I was working on the U.S.-Mexico
*  agreement for the trade, every day there would be a tweet that would go out or there would be an
*  issue. People forget how intense it was between America and Mexico. I would speak to my counterpart
*  in Mexico after a rough day. We were working on something. We were making progress. He'd get
*  blown up. I'd speak to him and say, you know what? Look, they're not moving America. They're not
*  moving Mexico. Let's just stop for today. Let's pick up tomorrow and let's find a new way to
*  bring this forward. I would just encourage everyone working on that not to give up,
*  to keep working hard at it, and to find a way. But like I said, I would take a little bit of a
*  pause for the time being. Let's let the current situation play out and then hopefully there'll
*  be a way for it to move forward. I just hope there's still people on the U.S. side picking
*  up the phone and calling UAE, Saudi Arabia, just as human beings, as friends, as allies,
*  and just keeping that channel of communication going. Maybe you can correct me, but I just feel
*  like there's just simple human dynamics that play out here, that divisions can form and just run away
*  from you over simple misunderstandings, over just the inability to see a tragedy
*  from the same perspective because of conversations that could have happened but didn't happen.
*  I think there'll definitely be communication, but words on phone calls is only worth so much. It's
*  really trust between people and power. Obviously, when you're in a position of power, you represent
*  your country and your country's interests, but the ability to have trusting relationships
*  where people feel like they're okay taking more risks to help each other,
*  that's actually what's most important. Communication, I hope, but deepening and
*  trusting relationships, that's what I believe makes progress and keeps people safe.
*  We talk quite extensively about the value of trust and negotiation and just working
*  with leaders, which I think is a fascinating conversation, and you've taught me a lot about
*  that. Let me ask you about the end here. What are the various trajectories this war can take,
*  in your view? What are some of the end states, as you've said, which are desirable and are achievable?
*  I mentioned this earlier, but whenever I would get a problem set in government, I'd always think
*  from a first principles perspective, what's the logical outcome? Forget about all the reasons why
*  it can't happen. That's what everyone in governments always rush to talk about, but I do think here,
*  number one, Israel has to have a secure environment where they don't feel threatened from Gaza.
*  Number two is the people in Gaza need to have an environment where they feel
*  like they can live a better life and have opportunities. That's the end state.
*  I think that the international community should come together. I do think that
*  the people who are usually putting blame on Israel should now realize that maybe they've
*  been a little bit harsher and that Hamas has been as big a threat, if not an even bigger threat,
*  than Israel has been saying. I do think that if the international community comes together
*  and unites behind Israel and really forces Hamas and their Iranian backers to stop hostilities,
*  to stop saber rattling, to stop misrepresenting the history in order to justify their violent
*  behavior, and if they say instead, we want to hold you accountable, no more money, and they all say
*  that they're going to stand behind Israel's efforts to eliminate their national security threats,
*  and then we will all come together and only fund again into a framework that we believe can be a
*  long-term solution where the Palestinian people really have a chance to live a better life.
*  That's really the best way to get there. There's tons of complicating factors,
*  but that's the end state that the global community should be looking to come together,
*  and it's very achievable. It's very, very achievable.
*  As we stand here today, there's a lot of different ways that this war can evolve.
*  If a ground invasion happens by Israeli forces of Gaza and if the number is correct of 100,000
*  Israeli soldiers, do you worry about various trajectories that can take
*  of the consequences that might have of an unprecedented ground troop attack?
*  I think as a leader, you can't change yesterday, but you have the ability to change tomorrow,
*  and that's a very important fundamental. That's true for all of us, not just leaders, but
*  we saw with 9-11 how America was caught off guard by a terrorist attack. We acted
*  somewhat rationally, somewhat emotionally, which led to a 20-year war with trillions of dollars
*  lost, I think almost a million lives lost, not just American, but all lives, and it was a total
*  tragedy what occurred. I think right now, the temptation is to be strong. I think that's a
*  necessity. I do think eliminating risk is the right objective. I think the goal should be to stay very
*  clear about what the objective is, but also this attack was very well planned not to walk into
*  another trap. I think you have to be very smart, very cautious. I've been happy to see that what
*  they've been doing in retaliation so far has been somewhat measured, and they've taken their time to
*  try to assess what's achievable. Again, I don't have access to the intelligence, and we're talking
*  at a very early stage in this conflict, so a lot could happen even by the time this is published,
*  but my hope is that they'll just stay very focused on what the objective is and try to make sure that
*  they're acting appropriately in order to do that. I will say this too, that this has been different
*  than what I've seen in the past in that the attacks were so heinous and so disgusting that
*  I've seen the international community rally around Israel more so than I ever have, and I hope that
*  Israel continues to keep the moral high ground and continue to communicate what they're fighting for,
*  why they're fighting, and I do hope that the international community supports the objective
*  and they can work together to achieve it. Benjamin Anyahu, Bibi, somebody you've gotten to know well
*  in negotiation, in conversation. He has made statements, he has declared war,
*  he has spoken about this potentially being a long and difficult war. What have you learned about the
*  mind of Benjamin Anyahu that might be important to understand here in this current war? Bibi is
*  definitely a historic figure. I meet with a lot of different world leaders and some of them I would
*  say they're very, very special transformational figures and some I would say, how the hell is this
*  person running a country? Bibi is somebody who has done a lot for the state of Israel. He has
*  a tremendous understanding of the security apparatus, he has tremendous global relations,
*  so for a crisis like this, I think Bibi is the leader you want if you're Israel to be in that
*  seat. I think he's ambitious in what he's going to look to achieve. He understands his role in
*  history as somebody who's helped strengthen Israel economically, militarily, and I don't think he
*  wants to see his legacy be somebody who left Israel more vulnerable than it had to be. So I think in
*  that regard he'll be incredibly strong, but I also think that he'll hopefully be calculating in the
*  risk that he takes and not create more risk than is needed. And that's easy to say, the two of us
*  sitting here having a conversation when you're sitting in that chair as a leader in the fog of
*  war. It's a very, very hard decision to make. He's been here before. He knows the weight of the
*  situation. I'm sure he knows the moment, and I pray that he'll do what's right here to bring
*  the best outcome possible. I wonder if you can comment on the internal political turmoil that
*  Bibi has been operating in and how that relates to the tragedy that we saw.
*  On the one hand, the political turmoil is a sign of a vibrant democracy. I think it's been
*  actually nice to see how people have fought for their country and their beliefs in a democratic
*  way. You compare that to the Palestinians where there's no democracy, there's no free speech,
*  there's no free press. You can't disagree with the leadership. In Israel, if you want to be
*  homosexual, you can go to a parade and live your life. In Gaza, they'll throw you off a building
*  and kill you. In Israel, you have the freedoms which I think make it a special place and you
*  have a very vibrant democracy. With that being said, the times in Jewish history where the
*  Jewish people have been most vulnerable have been when there's been division. That's when
*  the temple was destroyed. That's not just with the Jewish people and with Israel. That's in all
*  societies. I definitely believe that this division has left them less prepared for the situation
*  than it would. I do think there's real lessons we should be taking from this here in America where
*  we're in a time where we're very divided. I do think that it'd be very wise for our leaders to
*  find the areas where we do agree and find ways to secure our southern border, to make sure that we
*  know who's in our country, what risks we all face. I do think that division definitely creates risk
*  for countries. Let me switch gears here and just zoom out and look at our society and our
*  public discourse at the moment. What do you make of the scale and nature of the Palestinian support
*  online in response to this situation? This is something I've observed over the years since I
*  got involved with the Israeli-Palestinian issue with a lot of interest. I think a lot of the people
*  who are pledging support for the Palestinian people, I think that they want to see the
*  Palestinian people live a better life. I actually agree with them in that regard. Unfortunately,
*  I think many of them are incredibly ill-informed as to the facts on the ground. I think all of the
*  people who are advocating online for the Palestinian people, who are going to these marches in support
*  of them, I think they'd be best served if they really care about effectuating the outcome of
*  joining with Israel right now and directing their anger towards the Hamas leadership.
*  I think that it's very clear that the group that's responsible for the Palestinian people
*  living the lives that all these people are angry about is Hamas. If they direct their anger towards
*  Hamas and put the attention on the failings of Hamas and put forth a vision for what they'd like
*  to see leadership in Gaza do and they respect that there's a real fear that Israel has and
*  any country would have of having a group of terrorists next to them that's calling for
*  their destruction, I think that that recognition of finding a way for Israel to be secure and then
*  having an opportunity for the Palestinian people to live a better life is the right pathway to try
*  and pursue. So to you there's a clear distinction between Hamas and the Palestinian people in that
*  Hamas is the enemy of progress and the flourishing of the Palestinian people? 100%. It's very, very
*  clear and I think that if people were honest about the situation, if they spent the time to really
*  understand it, again, if you follow the conference I did in Bahrain, we had all the leading
*  businessmen there and they said we can rebuild Gaza very easily. We all want to. The leading
*  Arab businessmen, the leading American businessmen, everyone wants to. They're just held back by Hamas
*  and so I do think having an honest conversation about this at this point in time has really only
*  one logical conclusion and my hope is that maybe this conflict leads to that conversation being
*  had and if it is then maybe that brings more unity and understanding and we kind of get to a
*  conclusion better that could improve the lives of the Palestinian people. Pragmatic question about
*  the future. Do you hope Donald Trump wins in 2024 and how can his administration help bring peace
*  to the Middle East? I think when Donald Trump was president we had a peaceful world. Everyone said if
*  he was elected we would have World War III. Meanwhile he gets elected and he not only is
*  the first president in decades to not start any wars, he's making peace deals, he's making trade
*  deals, he's working with our allies getting them to pay their fair share of NATO, he's
*  having a dialogue with China, with Russia, he's weakening Iran and so I do think that the job he
*  did as a foreign policy president was tremendous. I think now more and more people are starting to
*  recognize that. Again under President Biden this is the second war that's broken out in the world
*  and when you have a weak American leadership the world becomes a less safe place and so
*  my hope and prayers are that President Trump is re-elected and that he's able to then restore
*  order and calm and peace and prosperity to the world. From a place of strength. That's the only
*  way he knows how to do it. What gives you hope about the future of this region, of Israel
*  and of the Middle East? The Middle East for 20 years was an area of conflict. They spent all
*  their money on bullets and bombs. You have young leadership now in Saudi Arabia and UAE and Qatar
*  and there's a much more ambitious agenda now for the region to make it an economic superpower and
*  hub of the world. Israel is one of the most burgeoning and exciting tech economies in the
*  world and if you think about it it's almost like having Silicon Valley not connected to California.
*  The thing that's held the region back for all these years has just been the conflict and the
*  division and the lack of connectivity but if you have that region, if it can all come together,
*  if you can create a security architecture, you have an incredibly young population, you have a
*  lot of wealth and resources and a lot of capabilities and know-how. I think that if
*  it's managed correctly and if Iran is able to be restrained and suppressed with their ambitions to
*  cause destabilization, I don't mean Iran the country, I mean the Iranian regime because
*  actually once you have this economic sphere, if you could bring Iraq into it, if you could bring
*  Iran into it, that makes it even bigger and stronger and the Persian people are incredibly
*  entrepreneurial and incredibly industrious. So I do think that the region has tremendous potential.
*  It's just been held back by bad policy, bad leadership, bad objectives and again when
*  President Trump left office in 2021, the Middle East was really on a very, very positive trajectory
*  and if the right things happen it can continue to be so. So I'm praying at this moment in time that
*  we navigate the current crisis, that the important objectives are achieved of eliminating the
*  terrorists and their threats and then allowing the leaders who are focused on giving their
*  citizens and their neighbors the opportunity to live a better life are able to work together and
*  really dream and be ambitious and find ways to create a paradigm where humans can flourish.
*  What is the best way to defeat hate in the world? Hate is a very powerful
*  force and it's much easier to hate people you don't know. It's funny, when I was working on
*  prison reform, one of the most interesting people I met was a reverend actually down in Texas who
*  negotiated the first truce between the Bloods and the Crips, two of the notorious gangs in America
*  in prison and I was very excited to meet him and when I met him I said, well how'd you do it?
*  And he said it was very simple, he says I got all the guys together and I had a tremendous
*  amount of barbecue brought in, he says and I got the meeting, he says no drinking, he says drinking
*  sometimes gets people a little bit more against each other, he says but I got a meeting and they
*  started sitting down together and they started saying, you know what, you're just like me and
*  all of a sudden they started finding areas where they were more together. Look, I've traveled all
*  over the world now, I've been very fortunate to meet people from different states in America,
*  I've different political persuasions, different ages, different classes and what I found is that
*  there's a fundamental driving amongst all of us where we all want to live a better life and
*  you know people don't want to fight naturally but it's easy to fight when you feel wronged or you
*  feel like somebody disrespected you or somebody did something from hatred and hatred leads to
*  more hatred which sometimes just pushes that cycle further and further. So I believe that each and
*  every one of us has the power to stop that cycle and we don't do it by you know being on Twitter
*  and yelling at people, we don't do it by just being critical, we do it by finding the people
*  we disagree with, by listening to them, by asking questions, by sitting with them and then if we each
*  take responsibility to try to make the world better then I think that there's no limits to
*  the incredible place that this world can be. So as you've said you've traveled all across the world,
*  do you think most people are good, most people have love in their heart?
*  I do believe that yeah and you have some bad people, I mean you have some real evil people,
*  I mean a big part of the work I did was on prison reform and you know previously the mentality was
*  is that the prison should basically be a warehouse for human trash and if you've
*  made a mistake in this world then you know we're going to throw you out and we're going to make
*  the rest of your life incredibly difficult because you're going to have a criminal record,
*  you're not going to have access to jobs but what I found is when I would sit with people in prison,
*  the people I've met through my father's experience and who I met along the way is that you know
*  people make mistakes, we're all human, I think it's the right thing from a religious perspective to
*  give people second chances. I always believe you shouldn't judge people by the worst mistake they
*  make in their life, unfortunately now in the era of social media people will say one wrong thing,
*  it sticks with them forever, they get cancelled or they get put out. We're all humans, we grow
*  from our mistakes, we learn from our mistakes and I think that some people are just evil,
*  there are some evil people but I do think the vast vast vast majority of people are good
*  and I do think that people sometimes also can be in a bad place and then society can push them to
*  a worse and worse place but we all have the power to make them feel loved, make them feel heard
*  and I think there's also tremendous power that we have as people to help people get to a better
*  place and so you know my wife and I we've always tried to be a force for good, we've always tried
*  to be you know we've always tried to provide a place where people can discuss with each other.
*  When we were in Washington we would host dinners at our house all the time or we would have
*  Democrats and Republicans sitting together you know we just had I saw Senator Feinstein just
*  passed away, we had a great dinner at our house when she was a senator with her and her husband
*  and Mark Meadows when he was on the Freedom Caucus and we actually had a fascinating discussion about
*  Iran. Mark was much more hardline than me, I had to actually bite my tongue, I was impressed at how
*  much he did whereas you know Feinstein and her husband were like super into you know they knew
*  the Iranians well, they thought they were peace loving and it was an incredibly robust and
*  respectful debate and so I don't think we maybe concluded anything that night but it was interesting
*  for people to get together. Having a dinner at my house where I had Dick Durbin you know the number
*  two ranking Democrat in the Senate, Lindsey Graham and Stephen Miller who's known to be a very hard
*  line on immigration discussing what an immigration reform could look like. I mean they left that dinner
*  saying wow you know we hadn't spoken to people on the other side and we actually agree on like 85%
*  of things like maybe something is possible and so I believe that we should always be trying to push
*  to make the world a better place and you only do that by listening to people and connecting with
*  people and by respecting people. And finally I'll just say on this is that you know I meet people
*  all the time who have so much confidence in their perspectives and I'm very jealous that these people
*  are able to be so confident about every single thing because for me I have you know some degree
*  of confidence in the things that I've studied and what I've learned but I'm always trying to find
*  you know people who disagree to kind of sharpen my perspectives and to help me grow and to help me
*  learn further and so I think that's kind of the beauty of the world is that you know the knowledge
*  base continues to grow the facts continue to change and what's possible tomorrow
*  continues to become different and so as humans we have to continue to thrive to to learn and to
*  grow and to connect and if we do that everything's possible. Well Jared thank you for your
*  compassion first of all but also your wisdom today and this very difficult this tragic set of
*  events these difficult days for the world it's a big honor to speak with you again
*  every time I speak to you I learn a lot about the world and I deeply appreciate like I said like
*  your humility and your understanding of the details of all the complex power dynamics
*  and human dynamics that are going on in the world once again thank you for talking today.
*  Thank you and Lex if I could say just one final thing which is that my thoughts and prayers are
*  really with all the people in Israel and and the innocent civilians as well from the Palestinian
*  side and my prayers are with the IDF soldiers that they should be safe and they should be
*  really watched by God to accomplish whatever mission will enable to make the world a safer place.
*  Thank you for listening to this newly recorded segment of the conversation
*  that addresses the current situation in Israel and Gaza and now we'll go on to the second part
*  of the conversation recorded on Thursday October 5th. Given your experience in negotiating with
*  some of the most powerful and influential leaders in the world what's the key to negotiating
*  difficult agreements in geopolitics? I start with a big question. If I look back on the different
*  negotiations I had when I was in government either with leaders of countries with representatives
*  of leaders or even with members of congress to pass legislation the most important thing I would
*  draw back to would be trust. I think getting to know each other understanding what was motivating
*  the other party to get to the outcome and making them feel like you weren't going to use
*  whatever information they gave you to benefit yourself at the expense of them is probably
*  what I would call table stakes to have a shot at accomplishing anything that was hard in negotiation.
*  After that I would say taking maybe a first principles approach to what the outcome of
*  whatever problem you're looking to solve should be. Now you have different kinds of negotiations.
*  I always tried to create a framework in the negotiation where it wasn't me against you.
*  It was always let's agree on what the outcome is that we're trying to accomplish. Let's all sit on
*  the same side of the table and say we want to get to this outcome. How do we get there? Really trying
*  to create a roadmap and so once you understand the destination you want to get to the end point
*  then you'd have to work backwards and really try to put yourself in their shoes and try to understand
*  what were their motivations macro. Most of the time you have to assume that a leader's primary
*  objective was to stay in power and so all decisions made would be made through the framework of
*  what it would take to do that and how it would impact their ability to do that.
*  Then finally I would just say that in any negotiation you have to understand the power
*  dynamics as well and you have to then wait your approach in order to maneuver pieces
*  to accomplish the objective. In areas where we had stronger power dynamics I'd always look at it and
*  say what are the potential escape routes where a politician would say this is just the reason why
*  we can't get there and I'd always think how can you try to eliminate those escape routes or make
*  them much harder to accomplish and then ultimately think about what's the golden bridge that you want
*  to create for them in order to get to the other side where they were motivated to get there because
*  it was in their self-interest to get there but also because it helped accomplish the different
*  objective and I have many examples that I lived through with that obviously negotiating in Congress
*  for prison reform. I had to form a lot of trust with Democrats whether it was Hakeem Jeffries or
*  Dick Durbin and then also on the Republican side with I had Mike Lee, I had Lindsey Graham, I had
*  Tim Scott, Senator Grassley and then also Doug Collins in the House was tremendous and you know
*  every time we maneuvered something we would get attacked either from the left,
*  there's a time we were being attacked by Nancy Pelosi, John Lewis for not being inclusive enough
*  and then there were times that we maneuvered it we'd be attacked from the right for maybe going
*  too far and ultimately we had to find just the right place where we can get it done and the same
*  thing happened with USMCA where we were negotiating the biggest trade deal in the history of the world
*  which was 1.3 trillion dollars in annual trade between Mexico, Canada, the United States of
*  America and we were able to form good trust with the other side and try to say how do we create win
*  win outcomes and ultimately we're able to do something in a record time that people thought
*  was very hard to do and both of them in a divided time of the Trump administration
*  were bipartisan wins with with big big votes in the Senate and the House.
*  You have a lot of stories of this kind sometimes a soft approach sometimes a hard approach
*  like there's I think a story where with Bibi there was a potential like a dramatic election
*  coming up and you have to say no no excuses no delaying you have to we have to make this
*  agreement I know Bibi cares about Israel more than the particular dynamics of the election
*  like you have to draw a hard line there. Yeah but in fairness too like you know for him
*  during the time that we were dealing with him he was always in election versus election and
*  then election and you know what he was saying wasn't wrong and I think he was more expressing
*  his concerns given the dynamics and you know we never held those concerns against him we just
*  said those are real concerns he had we respected those concerns but then we helped him prioritize
*  to help accomplish the right things and that's ultimately what the partnership is right.
*  My job was to represent America his job was to represent Israel and you had other parties
*  representing their own interests and as long as you assumed that you know people were
*  acting mostly in good faith you were able to navigate areas where you didn't have you know
*  complete overlap of priorities and objectives. Just to go back to the trust thing you sometimes
*  see that with leaders where they're kind of it looks like they're trying to screw over the other
*  person when they're talking and so not having that I think is a really powerful thing for earning
*  trust like that people actually can believe that your results driven are and are working
*  towards a certain end. Is there like a skill to that like what is that genetics you're born with
*  that or is that something like you develop so basically it requires you to look at the game
*  of politics and not have a kind of cynicism about it to where everybody's trying to manipulate you
*  and actually just go in with a kind of open mind and open heart and actually speak truthfully to
*  people that kind of basic human level. I would say that I always would think about how can I
*  be a partner to others like I would want somebody to be a partner to me and a lot of it comes from
*  just my different experiences in business. I've had great partners, I've had terrible partners,
*  my father you know again a lot of my my childhood was I was exposed to business my father
*  you know on Sundays he would take us to job sites into the office with him instead of the football
*  games like my friends you know fathers would do and so we were exposed to business and what he
*  would say about his father who was an immigrant to America came over with nothing and no formal
*  education but he would always say a good deal with a bad partner will always be a bad deal
*  and a bad deal with a good partner you'll figure it out and so going through some of the challenges
*  that I had in my life early on whether it was the issue with with my father that we'll I'm sure
*  we'll talk about or even going through some you know tougher financial times during the great
*  financial crisis I really learned a lot about partnership and I always thought how can I act
*  in a way where I could be the type of partner or friend to others that I wish others would be to me.
*  So when you look for a good partner don't you think there's the capacity for both good and bad
*  in every person so when you talk when you negotiate with all these leaders aren't there
*  like multiple people you're speaking to inside one person that you're trying to encourage
*  catalyze like the goodness in the human? Yeah so leaders are generally chosen by their country
*  and so my view was if I had an objective I didn't get to choose who was the leader of other
*  countries my job was to deal with that leader understand their strengths understand their
*  weaknesses understand their power dynamics as well you know one of my greatest takeaways when
*  I grew up I'd read the newspapers about all these powerful famous people and then as I got older and
*  had the chance to meet them and do business with them and then ultimately you know interact with
*  them in government as I realized that they're just like you and me they wake up every morning
*  you know their kids are pissed at them their wife doesn't want to talk with them you know
*  and they've got you know a set of advisors around them one saying you know let's go to war one
*  saying let's make peace one saying do the deal one saying don't do the deal and they're all
*  thinking where do I get advice how do I make decisions and so understanding the true human
*  nature of them and then the different power dynamics around them I thought was very key
*  and so I didn't have a choice do I deal with them or not it was a function of how do you deal with
*  them effectively in order to find areas where you have common interests and then work well together
*  to pursue those common interests in order to achieve a certain goal you uh first of all you're
*  incredibly well read I've gotten to know you and I've gotten to know Ivanka and the book
*  recommendation list is just incredible so first of all thank you for that you told me about the
*  guns of august by Barbara Tuckman it's a it's a book on world war one and I went down a whole
*  rabbit hole there it's like an incredible historian but anyway the there's a bunch of
*  stuff you learned from that but one of the things you told me is it influenced your general approach
*  to diplomacy of just picking up the phone and giving it a try so as opposed to planning and
*  strategizing just pick up the phone so this was a book I read way before the notion of
*  serving in government was ever even on my mind or reality and I remember thinking about it
*  reading it and thinking how world war one started where you had somebody was assassinated and then
*  you had all these different alliances that were created and then in order to accomplish objectives
*  it triggered all of these people getting in bed with everyone else because of documents that
*  were created without the intent of going to a massive war and I think in the course of
*  world war one it was one of the greatest atrocities that we've seen as humanity we've
*  had 16 million people killed in that war and I was I was reading the book I remember thinking to myself
*  even though you know things are set in a certain way go sit with somebody go talk to them and say
*  this doesn't make sense this is wrong how do we create a better pathway and as a civilian all my
*  life you know I would read the newspapers I would I would I would you know observe how different
*  leaders would act but when we had the opportunity to serve in government and have the position you
*  realize you're not a civilian you don't have the luxury of sitting back and letting the world
*  happen the way it's happening you have agency and you have the potential to influence the outcome
*  of things and one thing I've seen is you know most political prognosticators are wrong anyone who
*  tells you what's going to happen really has no clue and it's not because they're bad or they're
*  not intelligent it's because nobody knows and at the end of the day the outcomes in the world are
*  usually driven by the decisions of humans and if you're able to come together form relationships
*  listen to each other you can do that and one of the great examples that I speak about in the book
*  is with North Korea whereas if you remember in 2017 it was very intense when President Obama was
*  leaving office he told President Trump that the single biggest fear that he had and this is a time
*  when the world was a mess you had the Middle East was on fire ISIS was beheading journalists
*  and killing Christians they had to caliphate the size of Ohio Libya was destabilized Yemen was
*  destabilized Syria was in a civil war where 500 000 people were killed Iran was on a glide path
*  to a nuclear weapon yet the single biggest fear he had was North Korea and then it got compounded
*  by the fact that we get into office and President Trump brings his generals around and he's you know
*  learning how to interact with all the generals and says okay what are my options and they said
*  calm down we've been using all of our ammunition in the Middle East we don't have enough ammunition
*  to go to war over there he says let's not let that be due public let's try to restock and come up
*  with a plan yeah and at the time there was a lot of banter back and forth and you know I was able
*  to I got a call from a friend who was a an old business contact who actually had done business
*  in North Korea and he said you know I'd love to find a way to solve this and I was getting calls
*  from friends at the time saying I'm trying to go to Hawaii for a vacation should I not be going is
*  it not safe I mean we forget we forget the psychology of how intense that was at the time
*  and then through that interaction he called some of his contacts in North Korea and then we were
*  able with the CIA to open up a back channel that ultimately led to the the de-escalation the meeting
*  between Trump and Kim Jong-un which led to a de-escalation so that was really the mindset
*  which was whenever there's a problem just pick up the phone and try and I think President Trump had
*  a very similar approach which was let's let's give it a shot and he wasn't afraid to go after
*  the hard ones too and I'll say one final thing on this which is that in politics the incentive
*  structure is just much different than in the real world right in the sense that you have a hard
*  problem then if you try to solve a hard problem the likelihood of failure is great whereas in
*  the business world if you're going after a hard problem we celebrate those people right we we want
*  our entrepreneurs and our great people to go after solving the big hard problems but in politics if
*  you try to take on a hard problem you have a high likelihood of failure you'll get a lot of criticism
*  on your pathway to trying to accomplish that if you fail and then if you fail it has a higher
*  probability of leading to you losing your opportunity to serve and so it's just one of
*  these things where people want to play it safe which is not the notion that that that really was
*  taken during the time that President Trump was in office. Do you think it has to be that way? I think
*  I think there's something in in the human spirit like in the public that desires politicians to
*  take big take on the big bold problems right like why why is it the politician needs to be so afraid
*  of failure? I don't think it has to be that way and that's I think one of the great lessons from
*  the time of the the Trump administration he brought a lot of people from the business world into
*  government the business people have a much different mindset than government people
*  and there was a lot of resistance and I think part of why there was so much resistance was because
*  you know I think about it from my personal sense was that if I was successful with no traditional
*  qualifications to do diplomacy it meant that all the people with traditional qualifications and
*  diplomacy didn't necessarily need those qualifications in order to be successful and that same
*  that same sentiment manifested itself in many areas in government and and I think that in the
*  business world it's it's outcome oriented it's results oriented and you know what we would see
*  in in New York is there they would stab you in the eye in DC they would stab you in the back and
*  it just became a whole different dynamic of how you work through these different areas so the
*  answer is it doesn't have to be that way you just need the right courageous leader and that's why
*  I'm so optimistic about what the future of America and the world could be if you have the right
*  people in power who are willing to take on the right challenges and do it in the right way.
*  So if we just linger on the North Korea and the de-escalation and the meeting
*  what's the trajectory from this could be the most catastrophic thing that destroys the world
*  to you find back channels you start talking and start arranging the meeting like is there some
*  insights you can give to how difficult that is to do in that in the North Korea case which seems
*  like to be one of the more closed off parts of the world and in the other cases that you worked on.
*  Yeah it's it's always very challenging and especially when you're going against the grain
*  of what's established right we did something different to think that an old business contact
*  that I had could then do it I mean that's the type of thing that you know if the press knew what we
*  were doing they would have you know derided it and criticized it in every which way but that was one
*  of the benefits of operating very much below the radar is that we were able to try all these
*  different things and not all of them worked but some of them did and you know but that is what's
*  amazing about the world right this could be the biggest story on the front page of every paper and
*  they're inciting fear in everyone and it's not illegitimate fear I mean there were missile tests
*  you know over over Japan I mean you had a lot of very challenge big challenges with that file and
*  then all of a sudden we make contact we go through negotiations to set a meeting there's a meeting
*  between President Trump and Kim Jong-un and then all of a sudden there's there's a framework
*  um to try and move things forward um and again I think that there's a lot of possibility there for
*  what could happen if it's worked in the right way I just want to know like how you word that first
*  email or text message like what emojis to use like the hugging emoji I think it's just personally
*  I've gotten to know a lot of powerful and uh rich people and just it's funny that they're all human
*  just like you're saying and like a lot of the drama a lot of the problems can be resolved with
*  just like a little camaraderie a little kindness a little like just actually just reaching out
*  we're all human beings and people want to be successful and people want to be good and
*  you're right too there's there's way more emojis involved in diplomacy than I ever would have
*  expected but and every leader I'm sure has their favorite emoji this is also I learned about people
*  they use like they there's the everybody has their go-to emoji like I usually go to the heart very
*  quickly emoji there's some people who go the hugging whatever that where you're like doing
*  the hugging thing anyway this conversation quickly turned to the ridiculous but to do another book
*  reference you mentioned the book 13 days in September by Lawrence Wright well in discussing
*  all the work you've done in in Israel in the Middle East I just want to ask you sort of the
*  interesting aspect of that book which is the influence of the personalities and personal
*  relationships on these negotiations you kind of started to allude to that with the trust but
*  how much do the personalities matter in this so going from North Korea to the Middle East here
*  to within Congress and all that kind of stuff yeah completely in every way I mean that that's
*  an incredible book and it's a very entertaining read it has obviously a lot of good historical
*  context on some of the key players whether it's on more Sadat or Menachem Begin or Jimmy Carter and
*  Cy Vance and a lot of the others who were involved with those negotiations and the thing that I kind
*  of took from that experience was just how personal it was and and again one of my favorite stories
*  from that book was how Anwar Sadat who was a big big leader he had a mystic who was according to
*  this book again history I like reading it but I always you know realize that you have to notice
*  that this is just the perspective of a given author that's writing it but the way that they
*  write this book was that he had an advisor who was a mystic and the mystic was having a back
*  channel with the Israelis and the mystic told Sadat if you go to Israel and you make a speech
*  at the Knesset Begin is ready to give you the Sinai and so he goes to Israel they set this whole
*  thing up he goes and gives the Knesset they go for their meeting after and Sadat says okay well
*  are we going to do this thing and Begin says what are you talking about I'm not giving you an inch
*  of our land and it was just one of these things where it was a miscommunication that brought about
*  the symbolic visit of Anwar Sadat to Israel and that was one of these notions that just made
*  everyone think that something was possible that they thought was impossible a moment before.
*  Actually we had an example like that during our time in government when we did the Abraham Accords
*  the first step of the Accords was really a phone call between President Trump Prime Minister
*  Netanyahu and Hamid ben Zayed who at that point was the Crown Prince and de facto ruler of the UAE
*  but all we had was a phone call and then a statement that was released and what was
*  interesting after that is we said okay well how do we integrate countries nobody's done this in
*  a long time and we were trying to figure out all the issues and there's big miscommunications
*  between Israel and UAE and we were navigating through all the issues and so after a couple
*  weeks I said you know I've got to go over there and try to sort through these issues so we make
*  a plan to go to Israel then we can go to UAE and then a young gentleman who worked with me named
*  Avi Berkowitz says well if we're flying from Israel to UAE instead of flying on a government
*  plane why don't we see if we can get an LL plane and we'll do the first official commercial flight
*  and so I said that's a great idea let's call you know Ambassador Otaiba Youssef who was a tremendous
*  player in the Abraham Accords working behind the scenes you know day and night and was really a
*  big catalyst so he calls Youssef and he said sure no problem let's give it a shot so we go and we
*  do it and he says if we can work out these issues what we'll do it so we go to Israel we do our
*  meetings we get everything back into a good place we set up this trip over we fly in an LL plane
*  we fill it up at the time it was during COVID with a health delegation we had the financial ministry
*  because we had to open up you know banking relationships they could wire money between
*  countries we want to get you know health partnerships then we just had a lot of legal
*  things and national security things we wanted to start putting together so we do this flight
*  and we end up landing in UAE and the picture of us coming off the plane being greeted by
*  you know Emiratis and tobes with an LL plane with an Israeli flag on it just captured everyone's
*  imagination and so it was one of these things where it's like you work so hard on the details
*  and the negotiation I mean hundreds of hours to kind of make sure everything's perfect and the one
*  thing that you do kind of you know yeah let's give it a shot that image ended up capturing
*  everyone's heart so going back to Sadat that visit was very critical and what was interesting was is
*  according to this book it happened because of a miscommunication that was the first part the
*  second part of the book that's just amazing theater and actually the book was based on a play it was
*  just going back and forth with all of the the different methodologies that they tried that
*  failed but they kept trying at it and then ultimately seeing how the personalities were
*  able to find ways to make the compromise that ultimately was a very very big thing for
*  more stability in the middle east and so amazing book I would highly recommend it a very entertaining
*  read and something that at least gave me encouragement to to keep going when the task
*  I was pursuing seemed so so so large I mean if you could just linger on the personalities
*  you you write in the book that words matter or you you write in the context of saying in the
*  diplomacy business words matter and then you said that we're in the results business there's a badass
*  line but um but if we just stick to the diplomacy business and words mattering it seems like one of
*  the things you really highlight that individual words can really have like you can fight over
*  individual words so like how do you operate in a world where like single words matter I think
*  you have to be respectful to the craft that you're in where words matter but then realize that they
*  don't matter as much and then also focus on the fact that you know the actions are actually what's
*  going to matter more than the words and so you have a difference between leaders and politicians
*  you know politicians are there to say the right thing and to hold the power leaders are people
*  who are willing to do things that will be transformational from my perspective and so
*  when I would think about diplomacy words without actions or without the threat of actions and that
*  was something that president trump did very well was that people knew that he was willing to take
*  action he was very unpredictable and how he would act and that made our words much more effective
*  in what they did so it's all a combination but you know coming from the private sector we were
*  all about results right if you're in government you can work on something for 10 years and fail
*  and then retire and they consider you an expert in the private sector if you work on something
*  for 10 weeks and you don't have a success then you're unemployed you know so it's a different
*  kind of notion and it was just understanding the mentality and trying to adjust and bridging the
*  divides between the different trainings is that the biggest thing you took from your business
*  background is that just be really results focused it was just the only way to be I mean if I was
*  giving up you know a nice life in New York and if I was giving up you know the the stuff that I
*  really enjoyed the company that I'd helped build and you know the the the life that I was enjoying
*  in order to do government I was going there to make a difference and you know we had to focus
*  on it the other skill set so there was a couple skill sets that I found were quite deficient in
*  government first of all there was a ton of amazing people I mean people talk about the bureaucracy
*  what I found was is you had incredibly committed passionate intelligent capable people all
*  throughout the government and what they were waiting for though was direction and then cover
*  in order to get there and so there were a lot of tasks that I worked on whether it was you know
*  building the wall at the southern border where I was able to work with you know customs border
*  patrol you know army corps of engineers military dhs professionals do d and we basically all came
*  together and then once we had a good project management plan we were able to kind of move
*  very very quickly I think we built about 470 miles of border barrier in about two years basically
*  and that was very that worked very well because we basically brought private sector project
*  management skill sets which which were quite often missing in government the second one is just you
*  know we spoke about negotiation earlier I would say that most people in government it's just a
*  different form of negotiation than you see in the private sector and way less effective in that
*  regard which is why I think it's good the more we can encourage more people with private sector
*  experience to do a stint in government and to really try to contribute and serve their country
*  that's how our founders I mean George Washington and all the the founding fathers they were working
*  on their farms they they left their farms serving government then they went back to the farm and
*  that was kind of the design of you know the representative government it wasn't a career
*  political class it was you know people coming in to you know show gratitude for the freedoms and
*  the liberties that they enjoyed and then you know you know do their best to kind of you know help
*  others have those same opportunities that they had and then they'd go back and live their lives and
*  so so I think that there's a lot of opportunity with our government of people with more business
*  mindsets who are going to think about things from a solutions perspective go and serve.
*  Is that one of the main problems here so you you also mentioned the book The Great Degeneration by
*  Neil Ferguson an awesome historian he's been on this podcast it helped you understand the
*  inefficiencies of government regulation I'd love it if you can give an insight into why
*  government is so inefficient at times like when it is inefficient when it doesn't work why is that
*  the case the bureaucracy that you spoke to the negative aspects of the bureaucracy.
*  So we don't have enough time on this podcast to go into it but it's a look there's there's a lot
*  of aspects that work as well right but I do think we've gotten too big you know Neil's book that
*  you mentioned you know one of the things that I took from that I read it I think in in 2012
*  right kind of in the middle of the great financial crisis was he was talking about how
*  government regulation often was put in place to deal with old crises right so it was never
*  going to solve future problems it was more to kind of create to solve for problems that had
*  happened in the past and I remember thinking about that one thing I was very proud of of the work of
*  the Trump administration was that you had four years consecutively where there was a net decrease
*  in the cost of regulations so to give you a context in the last year of Obama in 2016
*  there were six million man hours spent by the private sector complying with new federal
*  regulations and that's not really what the intent of our government was right if we have rules or
*  regulations those should be legislated by Congress they shouldn't be put in by you know by
*  bureaucrats who are basically saying I want to follow this objective so using kind of the power
*  of the pen in order to do that so the deregulatory effort was actually very critical to Trump's
*  economic success that happened at the beginning of the administration and then what I saw with
*  regulation was anytime either there was legislation or regulation coming the people pushing for it
*  were usually the people who would benefit from the regulatory captures you had these you know you look
*  at you know the great financial crisis where you had this big banking reforms well what happened
*  during the big banking reforms then you had a big reduction in the amount of banks that occurred
*  and the big banks became even bigger whereas I don't think that was the intention of the
*  legislation but the people who were writing the legislation and influencing it had a lot of the
*  constituencies from those larger institutions and then what happened as a result of that a lot of
*  these smaller institutions didn't have the ability to be as competitive they had more restrictions
*  more costs they became less profitable but these were the banks that were serving small business
*  which is the biggest creator of jobs in our country and then as a result the bigger banks
*  got more powerful and what happened in the country as a result of the the regulations that they put
*  in place the wealth gap in the country grew it didn't shrink and so I think oftentimes what they
*  say these regulations are intended to be the result often becomes the opposite and so you know what
*  what President Trump did in his administration was they did a massive deregulatory effort and
*  I think they pledged that for every one regulation they put on because you do need some regulation
*  in an economy and in a society they would take off too and in the first year they eliminated
*  eight regulations for every one and so that was just something I took from it which was
*  I thought very interesting and you had to really I think you just have to think through what are the
*  consequences going to be of the different actions you take and often government gets it wrong by
*  taking an action that feels right but has big negative consequences down the road.
*  Let's go to some difficult topics. You wrote in the book about your experience with some very
*  low points in government. You've been attacked quite a bit. One of the ones that stands out
*  is the accusations of collusion with Russia and you tell in the book in general this whole story
*  on a personal level on a sort of big political level. Can you tell me some aspects of the story?
*  Sure. So to give the listeners some context and people remember this now it's been kind of swept
*  away because it turned out not to be true was that after President Trump won the election in 2016
*  instead of the media saying we were wrong because again everyone thought he had zero chance of
*  winning they said okay well we couldn't have been wrong it must have been the Russians who
*  worked with him and so at first when this started coming up I thought this was ridiculous. I mean I
*  was very intimately involved with the operations of the campaign. I was running the finance of the
*  campaign. I was running the digital media of the campaign. I was running the schedule for the
*  campaign and I knew that on most days we had trouble like you know working coordinating with
*  ourselves you know let alone you know you know collaborating with another government
*  and colluding as they called it and so we did a great job I think as an underdog campaign very
*  leanly staffed and then they said that you know we were working with the Russians and so
*  at the time I didn't take it too seriously because I knew there was no truth to it
*  but it was amazing to me to start seeing all of these institutions whether it was CNN,
*  the Washington Post, New York Times, these were news organizations that I grew up having a lot
*  of respect for taking these accusations so seriously and then working themselves up in
*  order to just cover it for two years. Then as a result you had a special counsel, you had a
*  house investigation, a senate investigation and I personally spent about I think over 20 hours
*  just you know testifying before these different committees. Again spent millions of dollars
*  out of my own pocket on my legal fees to make sure I was well represented and the reason I did that
*  was because I saw in Washington it was like a sick game right it's almost like you know even
*  though there was no underlying problems to the accusation I felt like this is one of those things
*  where they're going to try to catch you and then if you step on the line they catch you with one
*  misrepresentation they're going to try to put you in jail or worst of you know and so for me that
*  was a big concern so and it was amazing I mean my my poor mom you know I told her to stop you know
*  reading whatever I said I promise you we didn't do anything wrong it's good but you know she'd
*  call me and say well you know our friends were you know on the Upper East Side were talking with
*  Chuck Schumer says Jared's going to jail you know we know for sure that he colluded with the Russians
*  and this is like a leading senator saying things like this and so it was just interesting for me
*  to see how the whole world could believe something and be talking about it that I knew
*  with one thousand percent certainty was just not true and so seeing that play out was very very
*  hard obviously you know I was accused of a lot of things there were times in Washington I was
*  radioactive I remember one weekend you know it was all over CNN you know the people they had
*  panels on CNN like the news organization that I grew up thinking was like the number one trusted
*  name for news in the world talking about how I committed treason because I met with an ambassador
*  and said we'd like to hear your perspective on what you think the policy should be in Syria where
*  there was a big civil war happening and and ISIS and a lot of different things
*  so it was quite a crazy time in that regard but luckily again we were able to fight through it
*  it was a major distraction for our administration I think we were able to kind of stay focused on
*  the objectives and the policies but it was a crazy time and I learned a lot from that experience.
*  It's crazy how just an accusation can be viral and can just go one of the things that worries me is
*  the effect on your mind the psychology of it to make sure it doesn't make you cynical like people
*  that are trying to do stuff those kind of stories that can destroy their mind so one of the things
*  I'd love to sort of understand you kind of rolled in from the business world and all of a sudden
*  the entire world from CNN to everybody is accusing you of colluding with the Russians like what do
*  you uh like when you're sitting at home how do you keep a calm mind a clear mind an optimistic one
*  that doesn't become cynical and actually just keep trying to push on and do stuff in the world?
*  So it was a surreal experience um I would say number one is I felt very confident that I hadn't
*  done anything wrong so you know I'd always tell my lawyer like you know the good news is I've got a
*  good fact problem right like I need a good lawyer to get me through it but it's it's much easier to
*  be a good lawyer if you have a very innocent client and so you know the fact that I knew that
*  I didn't have I didn't believe that I had any legal liability helped me kind of intellectually
*  separate the challenge I needed to do to fight through it from it and then I just basically said
*  like you know I'd had hardship earlier in my life where I dealt with the situation with my father and
*  what I realized there is that you can't really spend energy on the things that you don't control
*  all you can do is spend your time and energy worrying about what you can control and then
*  how do you react to the things that you have there and so it took a lot of a lot of discipline it
*  took a lot of strength and again I give my wife Ivanka and even Donald a lot of credit for
*  you know for kind of having my back during that time and and and you know encouraging me just
*  to kind of fight through it and then I also had to make sure that I didn't allow that to distract
*  me from my job I felt like I had an amazing opportunity in the White House to make a
*  difference in the world and if I would have spent all my time playing defense you know in politics
*  it's a time duration game in business you have whatever duration you set for yourself in politics
*  it's time duration we had four years every day with sand through an hourglass my mindset was
*  I need to accomplish as much as I can in these four years and I guess the traditional game that's
*  played in Washington is whether it's the media the opposition their job is to distract you and then
*  try to stop you from being as successful as you want to be and so just fought through it and
*  wasn't always fun but we we got through and thank god it's it's something people don't talk about
*  and it has been amazing to me just the lack of self-awareness and reflection of a lot of the
*  people who hyped this up for for two years they don't think there was anything wrong with it and
*  and that's interesting but you know my view is we got through it it's good so it's in the past and
*  then I started moving to the future and that's really where I spent yeah but I want to linger
*  on it because to me that has a really discouraging effect on anyone who's trying to do positive in
*  the world like these kinds of attacks are intense yeah I mean you you say kind of one of the lessons
*  you learned is that you really have to be perfect but I hate that to be the lesson like I feel like
*  you should be able to do stupid stuff take big risks and like people celebrate the big risks
*  and not try to weave gigantic stories over nothing they just want to kind of understand
*  the two aspects of this how to not have such stories of so much legs and the other is how
*  to stay psychologically strong so you kind of waved it off that you didn't have a fact problem
*  but it can just have a effect on your psyche yeah you seem to be pretty stoic about the whole thing
*  but like how I mean just on the psychology side how did you stay calm and not become cynical or
*  you can continue to do stuff and take big risks I didn't have a choice what do you mean I mean I
*  could have spent every day feeling sorry for myself or complaining or saying things aren't fair but
*  the general way I looked at it was that in life every opportunity has a cost and you know you
*  could look at it and say maybe this was a massive cost either in in dollars or in time or in reputation
*  or in or in or in an emotional drain but you could also say that you know I had an opportunity
*  to work in the White House and I had an opportunity to work on some of the hardest challenges and you
*  talk about how that's not celebrated that is something very different in the private sector
*  when you take on big challenges that is celebrated in government when you take on big challenges
*  people want to see it fail or they want to criticize those people who are trying to take that
*  on and I think that's wrong and I think that you know as a country we should be thinking big we
*  should be dreaming big and we should be encouraging our politicians to try and to fail more and to
*  you know to go and to to take on big things knowing that there's risk of failing obviously
*  want them to succeed not to fail but but let's take on the big things let's try to do that
*  so I think it's just very basic that you know you're in a situation I've made decisions I
*  can't go back and change decisions in the past I still felt you know very blessed to be in the
*  position I was in and I knew that I just had to work through it and like I said I was very lucky
*  to have you know support from my wife and from my family and from good friends again I think I'd
*  chosen very good friends in life and my friends were with me I had one friend who who you know my
*  lowest moment you know got on the plane you lived in Arizona got on a plane and came just have dinner
*  with me to say just just pick your head up I know you're down now you're going to be fine just just
*  fight through that meant a lot to me and again I always think in my life you know you don't learn
*  as much from your successes you don't learn as much from your high points you learn the most about
*  who you want to be and how the world works from your lowest moments and at those lowest moments
*  it just it made me better and it taught me how to be a better friend to people who are in tough
*  situations and I tried to just get get tougher and I tried to just get better and work through it
*  yeah you said that you and Ivanka this this this intense time brought you two together and
*  helped you kind of deal with the intensity of the chaos of it all so I think it was just number one
*  knowing that you had a partner and knowing that you had somebody who loved you and believed in you
*  I think that was definitely by far the biggest of anything and love is the answer love is very
*  important but then there's also a lot that I've learned from her always you're getting me to to
*  read different books or learn different things which I love but she's also I think an amazing
*  role model and I go through our time in Washington where there were so many people who were I thought
*  very nasty to her unfoundedly and I'm not talking about individually because again you know most
*  people interacted with her were super kind but I would see people you know on twitter or different
*  places go after and she always stayed elegant and I felt like that was something that she never
*  stooped down to a lower level she kept her elegance the whole time and she really went
*  to Washington wanting to be a force of good and I see all the time that she she follows her heart
*  she does what's right and she has a very strong moral compass and I feel very lucky to have as
*  a partner and I respect her tremendously. Yeah she walks the fire with grace I would say and she's
*  recommended a bunch of amazing books to me and she's she has an incredible a fascinating mind so
*  but one thing that jumped out to me is you both love diners jersey diners so I lived in Philly for
*  a while and I've you know I traveled quite a bit and traveling from Boston down to Philly maybe to
*  DC you can drive through Jersey it's something about Jersey I don't know what it is it's the
*  best you listen to Bruce Springsteen there's a uh Lucy Kay has this bit where I think it's part of
*  criticizing cell phones today where people are too much on their phone they don't just sit there be
*  bored but he uses that story to tell where he's just driving and the Bruce Springsteen song comes
*  on and he just wants to pull over to the side of the road and just like weep for no unexplainable
*  reason um and I think that's true because life is difficult life is full of suffering or struggle
*  or challenges so and there's some sometimes it's always Bruce Springsteen but like some kind of
*  song like this can really make you reflect on life that melancholy feeling but that melancholy feeling
*  is the other side of the happiness coin where if you just allow yourself to feel that pain
*  you can also feel the highest joys that's the sort of the point Lucy Kay makes and there's something
*  about Jersey with the diners often late at night that there's several diner experiences I should
*  say okay there's like the family friendly there's a nice waitress and just this is sweetness a kind
*  it's like hello sweetheart that kind of thing there's also like the 3 a.m. diner where you're
*  the ones that are open 24 hours that has a romantic element when you're a young man or young woman
*  you're like traveling the loneliness of that just all of it the American diner is like from like
*  Jack Kerouac on represents something I'm not sure what that is but it's like a real beautiful
*  experience and the food itself too always fresh yeah the thing with diners there's so much to love
*  about it but I grew up obviously in New Jersey when I'd go you know with my father to business
*  he'd always stop we'd eat at a diner late night I'd be coming back with my friends we'd stop at a
*  diner and it's a tradition that Ivanka and I love doing as well and I think there's there's a notion
*  of it's very egalitarian and that you know people from all places are there you could order basically
*  whatever you want I mean the the menus at the diners look like the phone book and it's amazing
*  how they keep you know so much fresh ingredients to do it at least the good ones do I love as a
*  Jersey guy you get mozzarella sticks and an omelet you know at any hour of the day because
*  most of them are open 24 hours and that's basically by Ivanka my go-to we'll throw in a milkshake or
*  two as well but for me as a kid you know my father would take me sometimes I'd sit with him in the
*  meeting sometimes I'd be at the table next to him he'd give me a bunch of quarters to put in the
*  the music machine that they would have on the the wall and it was always just a great experience
*  doing it in Jersey and I joke that you know if you grow up in Jersey you grow up with just
*  just enough of a chip on your shoulder that you have to go and make something of yourself in life
*  it's a it's a special place I had an amazing childhood there and very very proud to be from
*  the state and I will just give a little bit of a plug now because the state has now actually
*  turned the corner and they had a 10 billion dollar budget surplus for many years you know
*  it was a state that was basically bankrupt and and now actually under a pretty progressive
*  Democrat governor Phil Murphy he's turned the state around and it's actually has a very
*  bright future ahead and it's it's probably one of the best places to raise a family in the country
*  right it's got very low crime one of the best public school systems in the country
*  pretty good health care system a lot of green parks people know the turnpike but it's got a
*  lot to it that's really great so I'm a big big fan of Jersey and I like how this is a first for
*  this particular podcast you literally give a plug to a state so in New Jersey everybody
*  it's where it's at there's South Jersey there's North Jersey I mean there's all kinds of Jersey's
*  too I mean the whole thing it just I and don't get me started on the Jersey Shore Lex that's
*  the shore that's and I'm not talking about the snooki part I'm talking about the real
*  nice parts where there's great food great people I mean nice parts it's all beautiful the full
*  range of human characters that are in New Jersey are all beautiful I agree with that and every
*  time I travel across the world there's always to meet somebody from New Jersey and you kind of
*  give a nod of understand a deep understanding it's the cradle of civilization maybe it's okay
*  so back I don't know how we got there oh all right going back to the the low points you mentioned
*  your father if we could just return there even just the personal story of your father of that
*  you write about that other betrayal that happened in his life and then how he responded to that
*  betrayal and he was after that arrested can you just tell the story sure so my father is an
*  amazing person and we grew up in New Jersey my father was a big developer a great entrepreneur
*  built an amazing business he got into a dispute with two of his siblings and through that dispute
*  they basically took all the documents in his company went to the U.S. Attorney's Office
*  and you know turned into from a civil dispute into a real public dispute my father did something
*  you know wrong in that process and you know when he got arrested for that he basically said you
*  know what I did was wrong and he took his medicine and he did it like a man and he said I'm going to
*  go to prison and he did that for a year and so for me that was a very challenging time in the
*  family obviously you know it was a shock it was a total change I mean I grew up my my childhood was
*  I think a very nice childhood you know my parents always said you know do good in school work hard
*  you know it was very very focused on my athletics I was captain of the basketball team captain of the
*  hockey team you know I ran a marathon with my father and it was always about pursuing went to
*  Harvard graduated with honors and that was in NYU pursuing a law degree and a business degree
*  and I was working at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office at the time actually thinking
*  I wanted to go into public service because my father always taught us we were always surrounded
*  by politicians and he always said you know my parents came to America they lived in the land
*  of opportunity and they had these opportunities because this is the best country in the world and
*  so you should you know be successful work hard don't ever let your opportunities become your
*  disadvantages because you have advantages in life you have to work harder and that's what he
*  instilled in myself and my brother and he always pushed us to make the most of ourselves and
*  when we did that you know everything changed overnight when my father got arrested obviously
*  it's very embarrassing for a family when you're on the front page of the papers I would see
*  the newspapers writing all these things about my father that I didn't think were representative
*  of the person that I knew it was a big change for our family and you know I was angry I was angry I
*  said you know I could be angry at at the prosecutor I could be angry at my father's brother I could be
*  angry at my father's lawyers I could be angry at my father for for making this mistake and then I
*  kind of said that's not going to change anything and I had a real shift and I do think that that
*  was a turning point in my life where I basically said let me focus on the things I can control let
*  me focus on the positive things I can do and from that moment forward I said how can I be a great
*  son to my father how could I be a great older brother slash you know substitute father for my
*  my two sisters my younger brother how could I be there for my mother how could I be there for my
*  father's business and I just went into to battle mode and I put my eye my my my I put my armor on
*  and I just you know ran into it and for the next two years it was uh every day was painful I mean
*  I was dealing with banks I was dealing the company was still at subpoenas I was still in law school
*  I tell my father I wanted to drop out of law school and business school but he said please
*  don't so I would basically go to law school one day a week or maybe I'd skip it most days and I'd
*  go to his office every day and my friends would joke that if my professors wanted to fail me the
*  the law professor would have to give me a test that had four pictures and say circle who your
*  professor is you know but I would basically take a week off I'd read the books and I did well and I
*  got my degrees and it was just a very very challenging time but like I said to you before
*  is that you learn the most about life and you learn the most about humanity and yourself when
*  you're in your most challenging periods and I'll say that you know that experience also changed
*  you know the people I interacted with spending weekends with my father down in a prison in
*  Alabama I met the other inmates I met their families I spent time then trying to advise
*  the children of other people who were going through the same experience that I'd gone through
*  on how to navigate it you know correctly and you just learn a lot about the world and you see that
*  you know in life everything could get taken from you your status your money your friends I saw that
*  certain people were very disloyal to my father at the time who he thought were friends it was
*  only a handful but again I learned from those people how can I be a true friend to people how
*  can I be better and I learned a tremendous amount through that experience you're right that your
*  father told you about being humble that I'd love to ask you about this that in life sometimes you
*  get so powerful that we start to think we're the dealers of our own fate we're not the dealers God
*  is the dealer sometimes we have to be brought back down to earth to get perspective on what is
*  really important what do you think he meant by that what did what did you learn from that experience
*  the way I interpreted at the time and those were very very memorable words and it occurred I was
*  down after I picked up my father from the arraignment I drove him down I drove the car and
*  my father and I are very very close and he didn't say a word for the whole time and I think he was
*  processing number one what was happening to him and I couldn't even imagine but I actually
*  think the bigger pain for him because my father is such a committed person to the family is like
*  did I let my family down did I let my kids down and I do think he felt at that moment like his
*  life was over he couldn't really see past what this challenge was going to bring and if there
*  would be a life for him after it so I could see that he had a lot of fear and he really wasn't
*  saying much and then I didn't know what to do and so I just stood by him and stood close and
*  you know later that that that day or the next day he got up and started walking he had an
*  ankle monitor for whatever reason the prosecutor was such a so aggressive he was a flight risk so
*  they made him wear an ankle monitor they were very very aggressive and nasty and at the time
*  my father was the biggest donor to democrats the prosecutor was a republican it was a very political
*  thing and and what happened was is he was walking around the pool and I just started walking with
*  him and he said to me you know Jared in life sometimes we get so powerful that we believe
*  that we're the dealer he says but we're not the dealer god's the dealer and we have to you know
*  come down to earth to understand like you said so what I took from that was that my father with all
*  of his success had started to believe that that maybe certain rules didn't apply to him and I
*  think that that's where he made a mistake and I think he had a lot of regret that he made the
*  mistake and you know my father is a very humble person he's a very moral person you know for me
*  with my humility my brother and I joke that we give our credit for being humble number one to
*  being Mets fans because every year you have a lot of promise and then it never ends up paying off
*  although now with Steve Cohen hopefully we run a different trajectory but the other thing is also
*  our mother really raised us to be very humble to be you know we knew we had a lot but every Sunday
*  morning my mom was there clipping the coupons the cereal we ate in our house was based on
*  what was on sale versus what we liked you know when we would have a problem with our teachers
*  in school and I'd say well teacher doesn't like me she'd say well I'm not calling them it's your
*  job to make the teacher like you and so my mother gave us a lot of that my father gave us a lot of
*  the grounding and I think during that time my father was just realizing that maybe he had gotten
*  disconnected from the the grounding and the values and and again I think he also accepted maybe he
*  could have you know blamed others for acting inappropriately but I respect the fact that he
*  took responsibility himself and said I can't control the actions of other people I can't
*  control what they do is right and wrong I can just control my actions and as I go on the next
*  journeys in my life and I go to government I go to Washington I mean I even think through the
*  the craziness of going from you know visiting my father in a prison to 10 years later sitting in
*  the office in the White House next to the President of the United States and like I think about that
*  story and that it's it's a story that only God could write and I really believe that you have
*  to have a lot of faith because the lows and the highs are both so extreme and unbelievable that
*  I feel like those low moments in some ways allowed me to keep my grounding and to understand what was
*  truly important in life for when I ended up going through those other moments. Your father was
*  betrayed perhaps over money by siblings is there some deeper wisdom you can draw from that have
*  you seen money or perhaps power cloud people's judgment? Oh 100 100 100 percent 100 percent.
*  Is there some kind of optimistic thing you can take from that about human nature
*  of how to escape that clouding of judgment when you're talking about leaders when you're talking
*  about government even business as you mentioned there's a power dynamics at play always
*  when you're negotiating is there a way to see the common humanity and not see the sort of will to
*  power in the whole thing? Definitely you know you mentioned about power money corrupting there's a
*  great quote I heard a friend of mine say is a guy Michael Harris who was one of the founders of
*  death row records and you know he was being interviewed recently and they asked him about
*  what happened with shook night and his line was you know money just makes you more of what you
*  already are which I thought was a very elegant way of saying it and I would see this time and
*  time again in the White House where you had people who were now given a lot of responsibility and
*  power and it went to their head and they acted very crazily and maybe it didn't act in a way
*  that I thought was always conducive to the objective so I think it's a very big problem
*  that you have whether it's something that's solvable I think it's about having the right
*  leaders and hopefully for the leaders having good friends I mean I'm still friends with a lot of
*  the people I interacted with when I was in government and you know the number one thing I
*  try to be to them is just a good friend I try to be somebody who they can talk about things with I
*  don't go in trying to tell them what to do on different things or know or and I think that
*  that's a big thing is that people just need friends and they need conversation and if they
*  have that then hopefully that allows them to keep their head in the right place. I think this is a
*  good place to ask about one aspect of the fascinating work you've done which is on prison
*  reform. Can you take me through your journey of helping the bipartisan bill get passed just
*  working on prison reform in the White House in general how you made that happen how you help
*  make that happen? Sure so we passed a law called the First Step Act which was the largest
*  prison and criminal justice reform bill that's been done maybe in 30, 40, 50 years in the U.S.
*  and so what it basically did was two things. Number one is it took the prison system and it
*  took a certain class of offenders and allowed them to become eligible for earlier release if they go
*  through the certain trainings that will allow them to have a lower probability of going back. So you
*  know stepping back you look at the prison system you say what's the purpose is it to
*  punish is it to warehouse is it to rehabilitate and I do think that you know we're a country that
*  believes in second chances. I saw firsthand when my father was a client of the system
*  how inefficient it was and how much better it could be and you know when my father got out we
*  didn't run from that experience he started hiring people from Rikers Island and and you know different
*  prisons into the company into a second chance program which we're very very proud of doing
*  and what we saw through our micro experience was that if you give people mentorship if you give them
*  job training a lot of people you know leave they have addiction issues and they can't find housing
*  and so you know people leave prison with a criminal record and they're less likely to go back and
*  reintegrate in society without help from different institutions that can help them do that. So we
*  modeled the reforms off of what they did in Texas and Georgia and other states where they basically
*  put a lot of job training alcohol and addiction treatment programs in the prisons as a way to
*  incentivize the prisoners to work on themselves while they're there in order to allow them to
*  reenter society. It's turned out to be very successful so far they just had a report that
*  showed that the general population has had a 47 percent recidivism rate meaning that people who
*  leave federal prison half of them go back and people who have now taken this program only 12
*  of them go back. So number one you're making communities safer because if people are going
*  to now get a job and enter society instead of committing future crimes you're avoiding future
*  crimes and number two you're giving people a second chance at life and so that was the first
*  part of it. The second thing we did was there was a rule passed in the 90s that basically penalized
*  crack cocaine at a hundred times the penalty of what regular cocaine was and I think a lot of the
*  motivations what people say in retrospect was that crack was more of a black drug and cocaine was
*  more of a white drug and so there was a really racial disparity in terms of what the application
*  of these sentences were. So they then revised that to make it 18 to 1 and what we did in this
*  bill is we allowed it to go retroactive to allow people who were in prison with sentences under
*  the what we thought was the racist law to be able to make an application to a judge in order to be
*  dismissed and it was based on good behavior, you know, being rehabilitated and the fact that they
*  would have a low probability of offending in the future and so that was really the meat of it and
*  there was a couple other things in there we did as well which were also quite good. So we did it,
*  worked very closely with the Democrats, Republicans to do it. At first President Trump was a little
*  bit skeptical of it because he's a big strong law and order supporter but he made me work very hard
*  to put together a coalition of Republicans and Democrats and law enforcement. We had the support
*  from the policemen, we had the support from the ACLU and ultimately we were able to get it together
*  and it was an amazing thing. We ended up getting 87 votes in the Senate. You know, this was happened
*  for me at a time while the Russia investigation stuff was still happening. A new chief of staff
*  came in, John Kelly, he basically marginalized me and the operations so I had kind of less day-to-day
*  responsibilities in the White House and so for me this effort became one of my full-time efforts
*  along with negotiating the Mexico trade deal and along with the Middle East efforts and the reason
*  why that was great was because it didn't have a lot of support from the Republican caucus originally
*  and people thought there was no way it would happen so I really was able to be the chief executive,
*  the middle executive, the low executive, the intern and through that process I really got an education
*  on how Congress works, on how to pass legislation. I was negotiating text, I was negotiating back and
*  forth and I built a lot of trust. Again, I would deal with whether it's Hakeem Jeffries or Cedric
*  Richmond. We built a lot of trust. We'd speak three times a day. These guys had my back. The ACLU,
*  again, I never thought they were suing our administration every day or every other day
*  on something but for whatever reason we built trust and we were able to work together and then
*  also with the real conservative groups because there was a lot, a big part of the conservative
*  base that felt like we should be giving people a second chance and in addition to that this will
*  keep our country safer and it will reduce the cost of what we spend on prisons and so it was a great
*  effort and I was very, very proud that we were able to get it done under President Trump.
*  How did you convince the Republicans? So they were skeptical at first. Were you talking about
*  just phone conversations, going out to lunch, just back to the emojis or what?
*  Yeah, hand-to-hand combat, meetings. The cool thing about this is everyone always says,
*  I always get frustrated when I hear lawmakers say, oh, the Senate's not what it used to be or
*  Congress isn't what it used to be. Things are broken today. I don't think that's true. I think
*  going through the process, I think that our founders were totally genius in the way that they
*  designed our system of government and what I saw is you just have to work it. So everyone knows the
*  power of their vote. Some would give it to me easily. Some wouldn't give it to me easily. Some
*  would trade it for other things. Some would withhold it because they were pissed about other
*  things and it was just hand-to-hand combat. So it was just making calls, using the phone,
*  walking the halls, going to lunches, hosting dinners at my house. It was a nonstop lobbying effort.
*  By the way, it was also adjudicating issues and making people feel like they were heard,
*  hearing their issues, and then trying to find solutions that you don't put something in that
*  then tips off where you lose a whole coalition. So it was really a balancing act, but it was an
*  amazing thing. I worked very closely on that with Van Jones and Jessica Jackson, who also gave me a
*  lot of help on the left. It was an amazing thing. I had a great team too. So you mentioned the
*  importance of trust at the very beginning of the conversation. From the outsider perspective,
*  maybe a dark question, which is how much trust is there in Washington? The flip side of that,
*  how much backstabbing is there? Can you form long-term relationships with people
*  on a basic human level, where you know you're not going to be betrayed, screwed over, manipulated
*  for, again, going back to the old money and power?
*  The answer is yes, and the answer is no. So I made some incredible friends, lifelong friends,
*  through my time in Washington. But the way I think about it from politics, and I think in geopolitics
*  as well, is I would say that politicians really don't have friends. Politicians have interests.
*  As long as you follow that rule, you should be able to know how to rate where your relationship
*  with a given person falls in the spectrum. But I do think I was the exception. I did make some
*  tremendous friends. Again, I'd go back to what I said about negotiation, where when you're in a
*  situation where there's really nothing in it for any of you personally, but you're in a foxhole
*  together and nobody in Washington can get anything done by themselves. You have people coming from
*  all different backgrounds, all different experiences, all different geographies, coming together,
*  agreeing on an objective, creating a plan, and then every day rowing together in order to get it done.
*  It's a beautiful thing, and you really learn what people are about. So when you go through an
*  experience like that, you learn who's in it for themselves, you learn who's in it for the cause,
*  and for every thing you read about in the press, if a fight I had with somebody because we were at
*  odds, I have about 100 people who have become lifelong friends because I respect the way
*  that when we were under fire together, they got better, they were competent, and they were there
*  to serve for the right reason. So I guess the answer is yes, it is possible. You have to be
*  careful because there are a lot of mercurial people there. I always say the politicians are
*  like gladiators. I didn't have as much respect for politicians until I got there, but if you think
*  about it, everyone who's got a congressional seat or a senate seat, there's 25 people back at home
*  who want their job, who think they're smarter than them, who are trying to backstab them.
*  I always say that the political dynamic, it's like in the private sector, you're standing on
*  flat ground. You choose which fights you take on, when you take them on, how you fight them.
*  In politics, it's like you're standing on a ball. What you have to realize is that there's maybe
*  10 things that you have to do, but there's a potential cost to taking on each one that
*  might destabilize you. You fall off the ball and then you lose your opportunity to pursue those.
*  You have to always be marking everything to market and going through your calculations
*  to make sure you can accomplish what you want to without falling off the ball and losing your
*  opportunity to make a difference. I guess people like power.
*  I just feel like to be a good politician, you should be willing, good meaning good for humanity,
*  be willing to let go of power. Try to do the right thing. If there's somebody back home
*  that does manipulative stuff, screws you over and takes power from you, it's okay. I feel like that
*  kind of humility is required to be a great leader. I feel like that's actually a good way to have
*  long-term power because karma has a viral aspect to it. Just doing good by others, I feel like.
*  I'd like to say that's true, Lex. I think it's just way more complicated. Look what happened
*  this week with Kevin McCarthy. He did what he thought was morally right.
*  He thought he did a bipartisan deal. He was told that they would have his back and then the moment
*  things got tough, they cut him loose. Again, I don't know if that was the right thing or the wrong
*  thing. I've also seen leaders on the other end say, I'm going to do things that are short-term,
*  more selfish, but the way they justify to themselves is to say, I believe that myself staying
*  in power is existential to the greater good, so I will do things that maybe are not in the greater
*  good now because I believe that my maintaining power is. It's complicated. In an idealized world,
*  I'd love to believe that's the case, but it's just way more complicated than that.
*  I wish it wasn't, but it is.
*  Yeah. I do just wish people zoomed out, people in politics zoomed out a bit and just asked
*  themselves, what are we all doing this for? Sometimes you can get a little bit lost in the
*  game of it. If you zoom out, you realize integrity is way more important than little gains in money
*  or little gains in power in the long-term. It's when you look at yourself in the mirror at the
*  end of the day and also how history remembers you. I just feel like people do some dark stuff
*  in that moment when they're losing power and they try to hold on a little too hard.
*  This is when they can do really dark things, bring out the worst in themselves. It's just
*  sad to see, and I wish there was a machinery of government that would
*  inspire people to be their best selves in their last days versus their worst selves.
*  When that system gets invented, you'll share with me what it is. Let me give you another way to
*  frame it. This was the revelation we spoke before about when I was getting my butt kicked by the
*  Russian investigation and all the different areas. The basic framework I looked at was I said, okay,
*  this all feels tough, but I said the game's the game. The game's been here way longer,
*  but way before I came, and it'll be here way long after I leave. I have two choices. I can complain
*  that the game's tough. It's not fair. It's not moral. I can go and I can try to play the game
*  as hard as possible. I think that there's two different things. You have people who are willing
*  to sit in the stands and they're willing to yell at the players or make their points known, or you
*  have people who are willing to suit up and get in the arena and go play. I have a lot of respect
*  for the people who suit up and go play. Again, some of them, I wish they would play for different
*  means, but the fact that they're willing to put their name on the ballot, make the sacrifice,
*  and go put on the pads and get hit and hit others, I think that you need those people. I wish more
*  people who had maybe the moral wiring that you discussed would be putting on a helmet and going
*  to play because it's hard. It's hard. I agree with you. I just would love to fix the aspect of the
*  Russia collusion accusation, the virality, the power of that. That's a really discouraging thing
*  for people. Maybe it's the way it has to be, but it seems like a disincentive to people to participate.
*  It is, but I'll give you again an optimistic side of it is that what you're seeing now with
*  social media is I do think with what's happening at X, there is now more of a reversion towards
*  more egalitarianism of information. For many years, the media publications were the gatekeepers,
*  and then you had these social media companies that grew. They became so powerful,
*  but then they were tilting the scales. Why they were doing it, we can go through long explanations
*  for that, but if there truly is a real forum and democratization of information, then you would
*  think that the marketplace of ideas would surface the real ones and discredit the non-real ones.
*  I think that as a society, we're starting to come to grips with the fact that the power
*  dynamic is changing and that some of these institutions that we used to have a lot of
*  faith in don't deserve our faith. Some of them will actually reform and maybe re-earn our faith.
*  I think that there could be an optimistic tone. Again, the years of Trump, I think that
*  he was an outsider and he represented something that was existential to the system. You think
*  about for the 30 years before, you were either part of the Clinton dynasty or the Bush dynasty.
*  I think a lot of people in the country felt like that whole class, whether you're wearing a red
*  shirt or a blue shirt, wasn't representing them, and Trump represented a true outsider to that
*  system. I do think that as he went in there, there was a lot of norms that were broken to try
*  to stop him from changing the traditional power structure. I think that we're at a time where
*  maybe there will be an optimistic breakthrough where you'll have institutions that will allow
*  for a lot more transparency into what truth really is.
*  I'd love to go back and talk to you about the Middle East because there's so many interesting
*  components to this. Let's talk about Saudi Arabia. First, let me ask you about MBS,
*  Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince. You've gotten to know him pretty well. You've become
*  friends with him. What's he like as a human being, just on a basic human level? What's he like?
*  For the listeners, Mohammed bin Salman is now the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.
*  He has risen to that position over the last couple of years. He's been a tremendous reformer for the
*  country. He's gone in and he's really modernized the economy. He's put a lot more investment into
*  the country. He's marginalized the religious police. He's really done a good job to bring
*  modernization and a lot of reform. He's been a great reformer. What he's like as a person is he's
*  a very high energy. He's got tremendous candle power, very, very smart, incredibly well read.
*  When he was younger, his father would give him a book a week and make him report on it on the
*  weekend. He was trained as a leader and as a politician really by his father. He's not
*  Western educated, so he grew up in the Saudi culture and he's a real Saudi nationalist.
*  He loves their history, loves their heritage, has a deep understanding of the tribal nature of the
*  region. His father was actually known to be a tremendous politician. When he was governor
*  of Riyadh, people who I speak to today about him say that if they had a full election, he would have
*  won in a landslide. They say every time somebody went to the hospital, he was the first person to
*  call. Anytime there was a funeral, he was the first person to show up. He's a very, very beloved
*  leader. Mohammed bin Salman, he was a businessman before he got into Crown Prince. He thinks
*  really with a business mindset about how he runs the country. He's brought, I think, a different
*  mindset and energy to the Middle East. One thing I'll say that maybe that comes to mind here is that
*  I remember early on talking with him about all the different initiatives he was taking on. He's
*  building a big city called Niom in the desert, in a place where there really was nothing on the Red
*  Sea. A lot of people were criticizing the ambition of the plan. I was sitting with him one night and
*  I said, why are you taking on all these things? You've got a lot of different programs, but
*  what most politicians do is they set lower expectations and then they exceed the expectations.
*  He looked at me without hesitation. He says, Jared, the way I look at it is that in five
*  years from now, if I set five goals and I achieve five goals, I'll achieve five things. If I set a
*  hundred goals and I fail at 50 of them, then in five years I'll accomplish 50 things. It's a very
*  different mindset as a leader. The way I got to work with him was Saudi Arabia was a big topic in
*  the campaign. President Trump was basically saying during the campaign that they've got to pay for
*  their fair share. They haven't been a great partner in the region. He's very critical of Saudi. Then
*  during the transition, I was asked by several friends to meet with a representative of Saudi
*  Arabia. I said, I don't want to meet with them. I came over and I met and they said, well, we want
*  to make changes. I said, well, you have to make changes to how you treat women. Then women couldn't
*  drive. They had guardianship laws. You've got to start working with Israel. You have to be paying
*  more if you're fair share and you have to be stopping the Wahhabism that's being spread.
*  I had no knowledge. These were just the traditional talking points about Saudi Arabia.
*  The guy I was with basically said, this guy Fadal Tunzi, who's a very respected minister there,
*  Jared says, you don't know much about Saudi Arabia, do you? I said, no, no, no. I don't.
*  Just really what I've been told or what I read. He says, okay, let me do this.
*  We want to be great allies with America. We've traditionally been great allies with America.
*  Can I come back to you with a proposal on ways that we can make progress on all of the different
*  areas where we have joint interests? Keep in mind at that point in time, the Middle East was a mess.
*  Probably the single biggest issue we had after ISIS was the ideological battle. If you remember
*  in 2016, there was the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. You had the San Bernardino shooting
*  and people were being radicalized online with the extremism. Then there was a lot of crimes
*  that were happening because of that. It was a big topic in the campaign.
*  And so that, when I was thinking about talking to different generals and what capabilities the
*  US had to really combat the extremism and the ideological battle, what we realized was that
*  Saudi Arabia is the custodian of the two holiest sites in Islam, the Mecca Medina,
*  that that would be the best partner to work with if they were willing to. But for years,
*  they really hadn't been willing to kind of lean into this fight.
*  So I said, sure, give a proposal. So they come back, give a proposal. They said, look,
*  if you make President Trump's first trip to Saudi Arabia, we will do all these different things.
*  We'll increase our military spending and cooperation. We'll counter all the terror financing.
*  Unbelievable layer. So I took the proposal. I went to the national, then it was General Flynn. I said,
*  if Saudi Arabia did these things, would this be considered a big, unbelievable, but it will never
*  happen? I said, well, they're telling me they want to do these things. Again, having no foreign
*  policy experience, I'm just saying I've got somebody telling me they want to do it. And that's
*  kind of where we started. Again, to office, I don't think much more about it. And then I think it was
*  like a baby of month in President Trump has a call with King Salman. And before the call,
*  we're in the Oval Office and the president's basically saying, well, you know, this is what
*  we want to go through. And I have Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson, the Minister of Defense,
*  and the Secretary of State basically saying, you have to deal with MBN. MBN is the guy who's been
*  our partner for all these years. He's the head of intelligence and he's been a great partner. I said,
*  well, if he's been a great partner, then why do we have all these problems that you guys are
*  complaining about with Saudi? I said, I've been told that we have this proposal from MBS, who's
*  the deputy crown prince, and that's who we should be dealing with on this. And so the phone call
*  starts and President Trump listened to both of us. And on the phone call with King Salman,
*  President Trump says, okay, we'll go through all these things. These are the things we want to get
*  done. And he says, well, who should we deal with? And King Salman says, deal with my son, the deputy
*  crown prince MBS. And so President Trump said on the phone, have him deal with Jared, because I
*  think he knew that if he would have put him with the other guys, they were not believers in what he
*  had the ability to do. And that's how I got assigned to work with him. I get back to my office after
*  that, have an email from him, spoke to him for the first time. And then we just went to work. And
*  a lot of people were betting against that trip. They thought it wasn't going to be successful.
*  And they've been betting against him. And he's been underestimated, but he's been doing an
*  incredible job. And the whole Middle East is different today because of the work that he's done.
*  Maybe it's instructive to go through the mental journey that you went on from the talking points,
*  the basic narratives, the very basic talking points, understanding of Saudi Arabia,
*  to making that human connection with MBS and making the positive connection that it's actually
*  possible to solve problems. What was that journey like? Why was it so difficult to take for others?
*  And why were you effective in being able to take that journey yourself?
*  Maybe some of it came from my inexperience, but my desire to listen and hear people. So
*  I had this proposal. I was told that all of these things were good. Then we're trying to
*  schedule this trip and the National Security Council calls a meeting where we're in the
*  situation room and we have Homeland Security, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State,
*  and everyone's saying, this is going to be a disaster. They said, if we go to Saudi Arabia,
*  the Saudis never keep their promises. And our Secretary of State at the time was a gentleman
*  named Rex Tillerson, who'd been the CEO of Aksan. So he dealt with all these people very extensively.
*  And he basically said, in my experience, the Saudis won't come through and Jared,
*  you don't know what you're doing. You're wasting your time. And I basically was at a point where I
*  said, look guys, but they're saying they want to do all these things. Shouldn't we at least give
*  them a chance to try to do it? Like, why do we want to predetermine their direction by not giving
*  them a chance to change? Just because things in the past haven't gotten the way you want them to,
*  that doesn't mean they can't go that way in the future. So we fought the battle. They basically
*  deferred and let me go through with it. But when I do the planning meetings for the trip,
*  nobody would show up because they all thought it was going to be an absolute disaster. And by the
*  way, they probably weren't wrong to think that because I'd never planned a foreign trip before
*  and I'd never done any foreign policy before. So during the planning, I'd speak to MBS almost
*  every day and I'd go through all the different details and the things that would be coming up.
*  And I said, look, I really need to get these things in writing. He sent over a guy, Dr. Masada
*  Eibon, who's a tremendous diplomat for them. And he came to Washington, stayed for three weeks,
*  and we worked through all the different details of what we needed. And we ended up coming to
*  an arrangement on what it should be. So I think about now in retrospect, why I was so focused on
*  getting things like this done and why I even believed that they could be possible. But the
*  answer is really the people I was talking to on the other end were telling me that these things
*  were possible. And so just because they hadn't been done before and just because others around
*  me didn't believe that they could be done, I wasn't willing to just say, well, let's not try.
*  LW It just seems like that cynicism that takes over is paralyzing. And you sent me a great essay
*  from Paul Graham, I'm a big fan of, that I think explains a lot of your success. The essay is called
*  How to Do Great Work. And people should go definitely read the full essay. There's a few
*  things I could read from it. Some quotes, having new ideas is a strange game because it usually
*  consists of seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a new idea, it tends
*  to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before? Seeing something obvious sounds easy,
*  and yet empirically having new ideas is hard. And like the steps you took seem trivial. And yet
*  nobody was taking them, or at least in the past, they weren't successful. So the successes you've
*  were as simple as essentially picking up the phone or trying. There's a lot of interesting
*  things here to talk about this aspect of doing this seemingly simple that seems to be so hard to do.
*  It, as Paul describes, requires a willingness to break rules. There are two ways to be comfortable
*  breaking rules, to enjoy breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. That's an interesting
*  distinction. I call these two cases being aggressively and passively independent-minded.
*  So again, that's to enjoy breaking the rules or to be indifferent to the rules. The aggressively
*  independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them. Breaking rules
*  gives them additional energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer of audacity of a
*  project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it started. The other way to break
*  the rules is not to care about them at all, or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why
*  novices and outsiders often make new discoveries. Their ignorance of a field, ignorance maybe in
*  quotes, of a field's assumptions act as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness.
*  Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs.
*  Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas. So the aggressive and the passive.
*  Such an interesting way of looking at it. Perhaps some aspect of this, at least in the story you
*  told us, some passive aspect where you're like not even acknowledging, not even caring that there
*  was rules, just kind of asking the simple question and taking the simple action.
*  I think that is funny. That was an essay I read and we're doing just a snippet of it,
*  but I would encourage anyone listening to go and find it and read the entire thing because it's
*  something that really spoke to me as I was transitioning into my new career now.
*  I just loved it. But when we were talking about why certain people who don't have traditional
*  qualifications are able to come in and do incredible work and solve complex problems,
*  it made me think of that essay, which is why I shared it. I think that in the context of
*  the work that I was doing here, perhaps not having the historical context became an advantage.
*  Obviously, I went back and then tried to study it. But if you go into a problem, I always find that,
*  especially in the political realm, my favorite political issues are ones where they're contrarian
*  by being obvious. Sometimes they feel very intuitive and so you take them on. There's always
*  a lot of resistance when you go against something that's been accepted as the way that you're
*  supposed to do things. I came to learn over the course of my time in government that when
*  everyone was agreeing with what I was doing, then it actually made me more nervous
*  because I felt like you have these problems. They haven't been solved for a long time.
*  Then if you take the same approach as others, you're going to fail just like they did.
*  Taking a different approach doesn't mean you're going to succeed, but at least if you fail,
*  you're going to fail in an original way. I did like this a lot. I think that
*  what I saw was the people who were very good at getting things done that hadn't been done before
*  were people who came with different qualifications, different perspectives,
*  and they came in and really worked the problem in untraditional ways. I think in the Middle East,
*  I came in with a very different approach than people before me, not because I came in deliberately
*  trying to do it differently, but because I came in trying to listen and understand from people
*  why the problem hadn't been solved and then think from a first principles perspective on
*  what's the right perspective today, not based on what happened 50 years ago or not based on
*  what somebody's feelings who were hurt, but what's the right thing to make people's lives better,
*  to make the world a safer and more prosperous place tomorrow.
*  So if we can go back to MPS for a little bit, from the person to the vision, there's something
*  called Vision 2030 about his vision for Saudi Arabia in the future. Can you maybe
*  look from his perspective, what is his vision for the region?
*  Sure. So it's funny, we were talking before about how we wish leaders would set big,
*  audacious goals and take on big things. Well, that's what he did with Vision 2030. When he
*  was young, and again, this is something that was derided and a lot of people were very skeptical
*  of it, but the people who actually picked it up and read it said this is a very thoughtful plan
*  that's very achievable. So he studied his country and said, what's our place
*  in the world? What are our advantages? What are our disadvantages? And then he set publicly
*  KPIs that he wanted to hold his country to and then put in place plans and committees and
*  really worked hard to push things in that direction, which was pretty remarkable.
*  I think that it's something when I saw it, I thought it was very refreshing. I said, wait,
*  in America, why don't we all have set goals? Why don't we have KPIs? And I do think that
*  it's something that most countries, if not all countries, should have. One of my favorite quotes
*  was from the Alice in Wonderland where the Cheshire cat says, if you don't know where you're going,
*  it doesn't matter which path you take. And so I think that that's something that really helped
*  set them on a good path and they've been very successful with it. One of the things he told me
*  about putting that together was he said, my father's generation, they created this country
*  from almost nothing. They came here, they were a poor country, they were Bedouins in the desert,
*  and then they look back and see what they've done over 50 years and they say, it's absolutely
*  remarkable. He said his generation, they come in and they say, we're very grateful for everything
*  that's been done to date, but we have so much opportunity that we're not taking advantage of.
*  And so he's now empowered the next generation to be ambitious and think big and grow with it.
*  What that means for his vision for the Middle East is that the general architecture that should
*  exist, and now there's excitement in the discussions with Israel that have advanced, was the general
*  view of what we thought from a Trump perspective should be the new Middle East is having an economic
*  and security corridor all the way from Haifem to Muscat, from Oman to Israel, where basically you
*  go through and if you can create a security area where people can live free of fear of terrorism
*  and of conflict, the Middle East for the last 20 years has been a sinkhole for arms, for death,
*  for terrorism. It's been awful. It's been a big national security threat for America, a big place
*  where our treasure is gone. We've had a lot of our young, amazing American soldiers killed in action
*  there and the same thing for the Arab countries as well. So if we can create a security architecture
*  for that region and then we can create economic integration between all the different countries,
*  I mean the amount of innovation happening in Israel is unbelievable. Think of it like
*  Silicon Valley is not connected to the rest of California. You have a very young population,
*  a very digital savvy population. You have a lot of resources. And so if you can get that whole set,
*  the potential for it is unbelievable. I do think that that's his ultimate vision is to become
*  strong country economically and then to become a place where you could be funding advancements
*  in science, advancements in humanity, advancements in artificial intelligence, and think about ways
*  to be a positive influence in the world. So a difficult question. One big source of tension
*  between the United States and Saudi is the case of Jamal Khashoggi. I was wondering if you can
*  comment on what MBS has said about it to you. You've spoken to him about it and what MBS has
*  said about it publicly on 60 Minutes and after. Yeah. So what he said to me was no different than
*  what he ultimately said on 60 Minutes, which was, as somebody helping lead this country,
*  I bear responsibility and I'm going to make sure that those who were involved are brought to
*  justice and I'm going to make sure that we put in place reforms to make sure things like this don't
*  happen again. It was a horrible situation that occurred. What I saw from him after that was just
*  a doubling and a tripling down on the positive things he was doing, figuring out ways to kind
*  of continue to modernize his society, build opportunity in the kingdom, and to continue
*  to be a better ally to all the different countries that wanted to be aligned with them.
*  Yeah. One thing I learned from this case is how one particular situation, a tragedy,
*  can destroy so much progress and the possibility of progress and the possibility of connection
*  between the bridges that are built between different nations and how narratives around
*  that can take off and take such a long time to repair. And you've worked with this in the
*  Middle East, with Israel and so on, how the history, the narratives, the stories,
*  they kind of have this momentum that's so hard to break.
*  Even when you have new leaders, new blood, new ideas that come in. And it's just sad to see that,
*  yes, this tragedy happens, but it doesn't mean that you can't make progress. I don't know if you have
*  lessons from that, just how much of a dramatic impact it had on creating tension between the
*  United States and Saudi and in general in the Middle East, like that somehow Saudi's not a friend,
*  but is against the ideals and the values of the United States.
*  So it definitely created massive tension and it became a very high profile
*  action that actually overshadowed a lot of the good work that was being done in the region and a
*  lot of the progress we were making. But when you think about this or you think about the other
*  issues that we've gone through today, I think the general framework that I always try to approach
*  things with is you can't change what happened yesterday, you can only learn from it and then
*  you can change how you deal with tomorrow. And when I think about the people in power,
*  what do I hope that they're spending their time focused on? Two basic things. Number one is,
*  how do I create safety and security for my people and for the world? And then how do I give people
*  the opportunity to live a better life? And so when things like this happen, obviously,
*  there are certain reactions that are appropriate, but ultimately you have to think through how do
*  you not allow the paradigm that you're creating in the world to lead to worse outcomes than would
*  happen otherwise? And so when I would think about foreign policy in general, one of the differences
*  between foreign policy and business is that in business, the conclusion of a problem set,
*  you finish a deal, you either have a company or a property or if you sell it, you have less to do
*  and more capital, hopefully if it's successful. In a political deal, it's always about paradigms.
*  So the end of a problem set is always the beginning of a new paradigm. And you're always
*  thinking through how do you create an environment that leads to hopefully the best amount of positive
*  outcomes that could occur versus creating a paradigm that will lead to negative outcomes?
*  So bad things happen a lot in the world and you have to make sure that when those happen,
*  people are held accountable for it. But you also don't want to make sure that in the process of
*  making sure that there's accountability for these actions, you don't set a lot of progress
*  that the world is making back that will lead to worse off situation for many more people.
*  If we can go back to the incredible work with Abraham Accords in Israel and the Middle East,
*  first the big question about peace. Why is it so difficult to achieve peace in this part of the
*  world between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and the other countries in the Middle East
*  or any sort of peace-like agreements? If I had to give you the most simple answer,
*  I would say that it's structural. And if you go back to the incentive structure of different leaders,
*  this whole peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, and again, I've gotten criticized
*  for saying this, but it's what I believe, so I'm going to say it, is that the incentive structure
*  was all wrong. And when I went before the United Nations Security Council to discuss the peace plan
*  that I proposed, which again, was more of an operational plan, and it was a pragmatic plan,
*  it was over 180 pages in detail. In politics, people don't like putting forward detail
*  because it just gives a lot of places for you to get criticized on. Nobody actually criticized
*  the detail of my plan. They just criticized the fact that it was coming from us and didn't want
*  to debate the merits of the operational pieces of it. So I created a slide where I showed from the
*  Oslo Accords till the day I was there, all the different peace discussions. I put a dove in the
*  slide for those, and then I put a tank for every time there was a war because there was always
*  skirmishes between Hamas and Hezbollah and the Palestinians. And then I showed two lines and
*  they both went from the bottom of the page all the way up like this. One of the lines was Israeli
*  settlements. So every time a negotiation failed, Israel was able to get more land.
*  And then the other one was money to the Palestinians. And I said, every time a negotiation
*  failed, the Palestinians would get more money. The problem with that money though was that
*  it wasn't going to the people. Some of it would make its way down, but most of it was going to
*  the politicians. You had leadership of the Palestinians who was basically, I think at that
*  point it was in like the 16th year of a four-year term, so it wasn't democratically elected. And a
*  lot of what I tried to show was that there was no rule of law, there was no judicial system,
*  there were no property rights, and there was no opportunity or hope for the people to live a
*  better life. And so all of the envoys to date were basically trained to go and do the same things.
*  And again, I got massively criticized by all the previous envoys for not doing it the same way they
*  did, but I thought the problem structurally just didn't make sense. And so I felt like the incentive
*  structure was all wrong, and I took a different approach. And so what's the different approach?
*  I started writing down a document. These are the 11 issues, but there's really only three issues
*  that matter. I said, just tell me what you think the compromise is that you think the other side
*  could live with that you would accept. And it was very hard to get them talking about this. Oh,
*  you have to go back to 1972, you have to go back to 1982, you have to go back to 2001, you have to
*  go to camp. And I was just like, I don't need a headache and I don't need a history lesson.
*  I want a very simple thing. Here today in 2017, what's the outcome that you would accept?
*  And I was dealing with their negotiators, their back channel secret negotiators, their double
*  secret. And I was like, this whole thing is like, it's a process created where nobody wants to talk
*  about the actual solution. So coming from the business world, I said, okay, let me just write
*  down a proposed solution that I think is fair. And let me have each side react. Don't tell me
*  about theoretical things. Tell me, I want to move the line from here to here. I want to change this
*  word. So I tried to make it much more tactical. And what I realized was the Palestinians,
*  they'd worked so hard to get the Arab world to stay with the line of the Arab peace initiative.
*  And so I went back and I read the Arab peace initiative. It was 10 lines and it didn't have
*  any detail. So it was a concept. And so they liked that concept because it allowed them to reject
*  everything. They kept getting more money. I mean, Bibi Netanyahu, who runs one of the most
*  incredible economies in the world, who runs an incredible superpower, militarily for the size of
*  their country, he would fly to Washington to meet us and he'd be taking a commercial LL plane.
*  Abbas, who runs a refugee organization, a refugee group, right? That claims that they don't have a
*  state that gets billions of dollars in aid every year from the global community would fly in a
*  $60 million Boeing BBJ. So the whole thing was just very corrupt and off. And I do think that
*  that's why it, I don't think people were incentivized to solve it, to be honest.
*  What do you think an actual plan on that part, if you can, just before we talk about
*  Abraham Accords, if there is a peace plan that works between Israel and Palestine, what is it,
*  what do you think it looks like? You have to separate it into two
*  different issues. And I think that that's actually how we came to the Abraham Accords is that,
*  you know, I tell the story in the book and it was one of my like favorite experiences
*  during my time in diplomacy, where I went to meet with Sultan Qaboos, who was the Sultan of Oman.
*  And we fly out there because he'd had a secret meeting with Bibi and I thought maybe he was
*  open to normalizing with Israel. So after he meets with Bibi, he calls me and says,
*  I want you to come see me. So I go over to see him. And again, I tell the story. It was a crazy
*  night and all these different areas. But when I was talking to him, he basically says to me,
*  I feel badly for the Palestinian people that they carry with them the burden of the Muslim world.
*  And that line just like stuck with me. And a couple of days later, I was thinking about it
*  and I said, wait a minute, who elected the Palestinian people to represent the Muslim world
*  on the Al Aqsa Mosque? And so the reason why I felt like it had never been solved was it was a
*  riddle, A, that I believed was designed to not be solved. But B, you were conflating two separate
*  issues. You had the issue between Israel and the Muslim world, which really was the issue of the
*  Al Aqsa Mosque. And then you had just a territorial dispute, which throughout history, you have lots
*  of territorial disputes and they're usually resolved in different ways. So if you go back
*  to the Israeli Palestinian issue, there's just a couple of components you need to solve. Number
*  one is territorial contiguity. You need to figure out where do you draw the lines? And that's
*  something that you can talk about what people were owed 70 years ago, but it's much more productive
*  to say this is what you can make work today. And that's kind of what we did. We literally spent
*  months and months drawing a map and we put something out, probably changed a couple lines
*  here and there. But by and large, it was a very pragmatic solution that I think could work. And I
*  think it could work for the safety and security of Israel, which was number one. So first issue is
*  drawing a map. Second issue is security. Again, Israel, and again, this is one issue we were
*  incredibly sympathetic with Israel, which is you can't expect a prime minister of Israel to make
*  a deal where he's going to make his people less secure than before. So we worked very closely
*  with them on a security apparatus. We laid something out that I think would keep the whole
*  area safer and it would make sure Israel was safe and also keep the Palestinian issue safe.
*  You need security. Number three was the religious sites. And that was one that was actually
*  always made much more complicated by people. The Al Aqsa Mosque, because you basically have
*  Haram El-Sharif, which is a place where the mosque was built in the seventh or eighth century.
*  But originally it was where the Holy of Holies were in the Beit Hamigdash for the Jewish people.
*  So, and then, you know, compounding by the fact that you have all the Christian holy sites in
*  Jerusalem, it's a city that should be bringing everyone together, but in fact has become a place
*  where you have, you know, wars and hatred and a lot of different conflicts that have risen because
*  of it. But what I said was instead of fighting over concepts of sovereignty, which is interesting
*  how I got to the notion that this wasn't really the big issue, I basically just operationally,
*  why don't we just make it simple? Let everyone come and be able to worship as long as they're
*  being able to worship peacefully. So that's really the contours of it. And what the Palestinians have
*  done is they've kind of deflected from a lot of their own shortcomings. And a lot of the Arab
*  leaders did that as well, kind of in the pre Abrahamic days, by kind of allowing this issue
*  to be so prevalent. So one thing I'll say on the Palestinians is that, you know, what we tried to
*  do by laying out a plan was we said, okay, what are the reasons why the Palestinian people are
*  not having the lives that they deserve? And I'll give you a couple of things. One is,
*  I studied the economies of, you know, Jordan, West Bank, Gaza, Egypt, Morocco. This was, you know,
*  numbers from like 2019. But what was interesting was the GDP per capita of somebody living in the
*  West Bank was actually the same as Jordan. And it was actually more than somebody living in Egypt.
*  And the debt of GDP that the Palestinians had was like 30, 40% compared to Egypt, which was at like
*  130% in Jordan, which was at 110%. And Lebanon was at 200%. And so, you know, you're in a situation
*  where a lot of this stuff didn't make sense. But if you draw lines, create institutions where
*  Palestinian people can now feel like they have property rights and have ownership over their
*  place and let the money flow past the leadership ranks, you know, to the people, let them have
*  jobs, let them have opportunity, and then let all Muslims from throughout the world have access to
*  the mosque and Israel, making sure that they can control the security, which I think the Jordanians
*  and a lot of others want Israel to have strong, you know, security control there to prevent the
*  radicalists and the extremists from coming. You could have peace there very easily.
*  So there's a lot of things to say here. One is just to emphasize, Al-Aqsa mosque says this holy
*  place. And this is something in our conversations and in my own travels, I've seen the importance
*  of sort of frictionless access to those sites from the entirety of the Muslim world. And that's what
*  Abraham, of course, took big leaps on. Okay, so we'll talk about that a little bit more.
*  But that's kind of a religious component. That's a dignity in the religious practice and faith
*  component. But then the other thing you mentioned so simply, which is you have money flow past the
*  leadership ranks. How do you have money flow past the leadership ranks in Palestine? So
*  make sure that the money that's invested in Palestine, the West Bank gets to the people.
*  So to date, all of the aid that's been given to the Palestinians has been an entitlement. It's
*  not conditions based. It's always just we give the money and there's no expectations.
*  It's very simple. You make the aid conditions based, you fight for transparency, you do it
*  through institutions other than the PA, or you put reformers into the PA that will allow it to go
*  down that way. PA being the Palestinian Authority, which is the leadership. It's not hard to do. It
*  just takes people who actually want to do it. But I think that the mindset of the international
*  community has not been let's solve this problem. It's like, let's just throw a little bit of money.
*  The money is novocaine. Let's put a little novocaine on the problem and let's not have to
*  deal with it. But nobody's ever said, oh, let's do an accounting of the $20 billion we've given them
*  and see how many jobs it's done and where it's gone. That just hasn't happened. Again, it's an
*  incredibly corrupt organization. You think about the post-World War II dynamic. You had a lot of
*  refugees. My grandparents were refugees post-World War II. Every other refugee class has been
*  resettled and you only have one permanent refugee organization ever created. Why was this done? It
*  was done to perpetuate the conflict so that a lot of Arab leaders could basically deflect from a lot
*  of their shortcomings at home. I think for Israel, they view all these things as existential. They
*  value their safety. They've been under attack for a long time. I do think having a deal where we can
*  say how the Jews and the Muslims, Christians come together. I think King Abdullah from Jordan's been
*  an incredible custodian for the mosque. I think everyone in my travels recognize that he's the
*  right guy for that, that the King of Jordan should be the custodian of the mosque. We should have
*  some kind of framework to make sure everyone has access. The more countries that have diplomatic
*  relations with Israel, the more Muslims and Arabs that should be able to come and visit.
*  Now, by the way, the more you have these normalizations, think about what that will
*  do to the economy of the West Bank where they'll have great hotels, hospitality, tremendous tourism
*  industry because of all the Christian, Muslim, and Jewish holy sites that they have there.
*  There's a lot of potential there. We just have to get unstuck. I believe that it's so possible
*  if the leaders want to make tomorrow better than they can. Unfortunately, the people who suffer the
*  most are just the Palestinian people. I think that in Gaza, they're hostages to Hamas and in
*  the West Bank. They're just held back because their leadership is afraid or too self-interested
*  to give them the opportunity to change their paradigm and pursue the potential of what they
*  have. By the way, it's an incredibly well-educated population. It's an incredibly capable population
*  and they're right next to Israel where the economy, they need everything. The potential should be
*  incredible if you can just move some of these pieces. Again, there's still a lot of emotion
*  and hatred you have to work through as well, but I do believe that you're not going to solve that
*  by litigating the past. You're only going to solve that by creating an exciting paradigm for
*  the future and getting everyone to buy in and then move towards that. Maybe increase the chance of
*  being able to establish an economy where the entrepreneurs can flourish in the West Bank and
*  so on in Palestine once the relationship across the Arab world is normalized.
*  So one thing on that, which is very interesting, is when I got into my job in the Middle East,
*  all the conventional thinkers said to me, the separation in the Muslim world is between the
*  Sunnis and the Shias and that's really the big divide. As I was traveling, I didn't think there
*  was any divide in that regard. The divide that I saw was between leaders who wanted to give a better
*  opportunity for their people and create economic reforms and opportunity and leaders who wanted to
*  use religion or fear to keep their stronghold on power. And so if you think about who's not creating
*  the opportunity for their people, it's the Palestinian leadership and the Iranian leadership.
*  All the other Arab countries were focused on how do we give opportunity for our people
*  to live a better life. And there is a big foundation on which that framework can succeed,
*  which I think is in general the idea of Arab-Israeli normalization.
*  So that's where Abraham Accords come in. Can you tell the story of that?
*  Sure. So it's an amazing thing. And I sit here today, somebody not in government, and
*  every day I see another flight that goes between or I see an Israeli student studying at a
*  university in Dubai or a new synagogue opening up in Abu Dhabi. And it just gives me such,
*  or Bahrain, it gives me such tremendous pride to see all of the progress that's been made.
*  How it occurred, part of why I wrote the book was to put this down for history's sake, to go
*  through all the different intentional, unintentional, circumstantial things that occurred.
*  It's funny, we left government, there's a lot of people saying, well, this is why I said,
*  I was kind of at the middle of it and I couldn't even perfectly articulate why it happened because
*  it was an evolution of a lot of things. And I joke that we made peace on plan C, but only because
*  we went through the alphabet three times, failing at every letter. And by the time,
*  but we didn't give up, we kept going and we got it done.
*  And maybe this is a good place to also step back and say, what is Arab-Israeli normalization?
*  What is the state of things for people who may not be aware before the progress you made?
*  That's probably the best place to start. So, what we did is we made a peace deal between
*  Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and then Israel and Bahrain. Then we did a deal with
*  Israel and Sudan, then Israel and Kosovo, Israel and Morocco, were basically countries that didn't
*  recognize each other before, ended up recognizing each other. All of these were Muslim majority
*  countries and getting them to integrate with Israel was a very big thing. The traditional
*  thinking had always been, was that Muslim Arab countries would not make peace with Israel until
*  the Israeli-Palestinian issue was solved. And what we were able to do was separate the issues
*  and then make these connections, which are leading to amazing interaction between Jews and Muslims.
*  So, when I think about kind of, obviously you have national security, you have emotional
*  benefits from these things, but the single biggest benefit that I've seen
*  from the accords is that if you were an Arab or a Muslim and you were willing to say positive
*  things about Israel or the Jews before this came out, you had been viciously attacked by
*  the media or the hordes of influencers or the extremists in these different countries.
*  What this did was it brought out into the public the fact that Jews and Muslims can be together
*  and they can be respectful, they can have meals together, and that the cultures can
*  live together in peace. So, just to linger on this, it's like a once subtle and,
*  in another sense, transformative. So, normalization means you're allowed to travel from one place
*  to the other. That has a kind of ripple effect of that you can now start talking in a little
*  bit more accepting way. You can start integrating, traveling, communicating, doing business with,
*  socializing, so the cultures mix, conversations mix, all of this. This kind of has a kind of
*  ripple effect on the basic connection between these previously disparate worlds. I don't know
*  if there's a nice way to kind of make clear why these agreements have such a transformative effect,
*  especially in the long term. I would say the simplest form is it's just a mindset.
*  And it's almost like you're taught all your life
*  that we're enemies or we can't be friends with that tribe on the other side of the fence.
*  And then one day the leaders get up and say, no, it's okay now. And there was never an issue
*  between the people. The people were just taught different things and they were separated from
*  each other. But again, one of the things that I respect about the work you do is you believe in
*  the power of conversation and the power of human interaction. And these issues and gaps between us
*  feel so big when we think about them, when we're told about them, when we read about them.
*  But when we go and sit with each other, all of a sudden we realize maybe we have a lot more in
*  common than we have that divides us. For me, what I've seen about it that's made the biggest
*  difference is I've seen people who wouldn't have the ability to be together, be together,
*  and that's now forming a nucleus of togetherness, which is a restoration. So you think about the
*  modern Middle East from post-Holocaust to now. Again, in 1948, after that war of independence,
*  you had Jews living in Baghdad and Cairo. Then they became so anti-Jewish that they then expelled
*  all of the Jews from all these capitals of the city. So you think about the Jewish history in
*  Baghdad. I mean, I think the Talmud was written in Baghdad. It was a place in Babylon where the
*  Jewish people thrived. I think in 570 BCE, when Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem, he took about
*  10,000 Jews back with him to Babylon because he thought it'd be good for his economy. During that
*  place, the Jews actually flourished and had a good life there. So for a thousand years before
*  the Second World War, the Jews and the Muslims lived very peacefully together. So people say
*  that what we're doing now is an aberration. I actually think it's not an aberration. I think
*  it's actually a return to the time where people can live together culturally. So this is the
*  beginning of the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It's the beginning of togetherness, which again,
*  you think about how much war, how much provocation, how much terrorism has been made in the name of
*  religious conflict. This is, I think, the start of the process of religious respect and understanding.
*  We've talked about you being attacked in the press for the Russian collusion and other topics. One of
*  the most recent set of attacks comes on the topic of Saudi Public Investment Fund giving
*  $2 billion to your investment firm after you left government. So that includes a 1.25% asset
*  management fee of $25 million a year. Can you respond to these recent set of attacks?
*  Sure. So I left government, obviously worked for four years. It was a very action-packed time.
*  That's why I wrote the book. I wanted to put down all those experiences. I started thinking,
*  what do I want to do next? So my previous career, I'd been in real estate. I'd worked with my brother
*  on some technology businesses that I'd started. And then I got into government. So I kind of had
*  a career shift. In my previous career, obviously, it was very successful. The New York Times,
*  they violated and they published my financial statements. They showed I was making about $50
*  million a year in the private sector before I went into government. I went into government and I
*  volunteered. I didn't take a salary. I paid for my own health insurance for four years, my wife and
*  I. And then we went and I was thinking, should I go back to my old company or should I start
*  something new? And my thinking was is that through my time in government, I'd met so many people. I'd
*  learned so much about the world. I had a big understanding now for how the macroeconomic picture
*  worked. And I did feel like there was a lot more that I could do than just going back to real estate.
*  In the meantime, I was getting a lot of calls from different CEOs and companies saying,
*  you know, can you help me with this company? Can you help me with that company? Your knowledge
*  could be helpful to help this company navigate this challenge or to expand internationally.
*  And so I said, you know what, maybe I should create a business to do an investment firm
*  where I can do something different, where I'm putting together geopolitical expertise
*  and traditional private equity and growth investing and figure out how to do that,
*  where I can do something differentiated, where I can invest in growing things and help with my
*  navigation skills and relationships. So that was kind of the thesis of what I thought could make
*  sense as kind of a next step. I called different friends. They were very excited to back the effort.
*  Obviously, this was coming off the success that I just had in the Middle East where I did, you know,
*  six peace deals there. And, you know, one of the notions I wanted to be able to do with the firm
*  was to be able to take money from the Gulf and then to be able to invest it in Israel
*  to continue to build the economic links between the countries. Again, if countries have more
*  economic ties, I think war and fighting is less likely. And then in addition to that,
*  I wanted to figure out how do you bring the entrepreneurs together from both of those
*  countries. So that was really the mission of what I set out to do. So far, I've been enjoying it.
*  It's been a lot of fun. I've been learning a ton. I think we're doing very well with it.
*  In terms of the criticisms, I think that I've been criticized in every step of everything I've
*  always done in my life. And so what I would say is, you know, this business is actually an objective
*  metric business, right? It's about returns. So, you know, in three, four years from now,
*  five years from now, see how I do. Hopefully I'll do very well and judge me based on that.
*  In terms of any of the nefarious things, you know, I haven't been accused of violating any laws
*  and, you know, I haven't violated any of the ethics rules either. When I was in government,
*  I every year submitted all my financials to the Office of Government Ethics. They certified it
*  every year and I followed every rule and every law possible. So to my critics, I'll say,
*  criticize me before, you'll criticize me now. I'm going to keep doing me and going to keep
*  pursuing things that I think are worthwhile. And I'm very excited about this chapter of my career.
*  Maybe this is a good place to ask. In working closely with Donald Trump,
*  what in your sense, looking into the mind of the man, what's the biggest strength of Donald Trump
*  as a leader? I would say his unpredictability. I think that as a leader, he consumes a ton of
*  information. He doesn't like to be managed or have his information filtered. So he'll speak
*  to a lot of people to draw his information himself. He's very pragmatic. I don't see him
*  as terribly ideological. I see him as somebody who's about results. I think he wants to deliver
*  results. And I think ultimately, I mean, he's an incredible fighter. He's a big counter puncher,
*  but he also wants to get along with people. And that's probably the biggest surprise that
*  people found with him. I mean, you look at even situations like, I would always tell people,
*  if you disagree with him, don't go on television and criticize him. Just pick up the phone and
*  call him and go see him and he'll talk to you about it. He may not agree with you, but again,
*  that's what Kim Kardashian did when she had a case of clemency with a woman, Alice Johnson,
*  that she felt strongly about. We went through the case. I wouldn't have had her call if I didn't
*  think it was a legitimate case. So we spent about eight months quietly working through the case,
*  working through the details to make sure that it really was a worthy case.
*  I brought it to President Trump, said she'd like to come meet with you to talk about this case.
*  And he said, I recommend. So she came in, we went through the case and President Trump ultimately
*  granted the clemency to Alice Johnson, who was a woman who was accused of being part of a drug ring.
*  She had basically a life sentence for doing it. She'd served 22 years in prison while in prison.
*  She basically was a grandmother and she was putting on the prison plays. She was mentoring
*  young women in prison, somebody who, again, there's always a risk, but by and large had a very,
*  very, very low risk of committing a crime in the future. And then it goes back to the notion of,
*  are we going to judge people by the worst decision they make in their life? And so President Trump
*  was willing to grant the clemency and it went. And I think that it just goes to the notion of like,
*  maybe this goes back to his unpredictability in a positive way, which is if you go sit with him and
*  you make your case, he'll hear you, he'll listen to you, and he's not afraid to act and he's not
*  afraid to be controversial, which I think is a good thing. So from a foreign policy point of
*  view in particular, his unpredictability just meant that everyone was always on their back
*  foot. People were afraid to kind of cross America. And what I would tell people who don't like Trump,
*  as I would say, think about how crazy he's making you and his enemies. He did that to the enemies
*  of America. And yeah, so he was a very, very strong president and I think did a great job.
*  So in some of these agreements that we've been talking about and speaking with leaders,
*  how do you think the unpredictability helps? So in all the agreements that I was negotiating,
*  I wasn't doing it as a principle. I was doing it on behalf of President Trump. And people knew that
*  I had access to President Trump and they knew that, you know, I could say, you may say this
*  that we don't like, but I'm going to have to take it back to him and then we'll see what he does.
*  And one of the biggest instances was on the USMCA trade deal where that deal happened because Mexico
*  was legitimately concerned and smartly so that President Trump was going to impose tariffs on
*  the car industry, which would have been decimating to their economy. And by the way, he was ready to
*  do it. We were holding him back from doing it with every ounce of strength that we could. So it wasn't
*  a bluff. I mean, that one was actually real, but they were smart to read that it was real.
*  And ultimately we created a great win-win deal. I'll tell you a funny story just popped into my
*  mind from the tariffs is we did also, we used a 232 national security exemption to protect our
*  steel industry and we put tariffs on steel and aluminum. And again, I thought about this because
*  we also negotiated them with Canada and there was a very funny phone call where Trudeau was calling
*  Trump. And again, they got along decently well. And Trudeau was calling saying,
*  you can't put national security tariffs on us in Canada. We're your NATO ally. We fall
*  wars with you. We do military together. And Trump says to him, didn't you burn the White
*  House down in 1812? And Trudeau says, that was the French. He says, no, it was the Canadians.
*  And so it was just, like I said, he's always keeping everyone on their toes.
*  Yeah.
*  And, but he was, he, he, he wasn't a, he took very calculated risks. And like I said, you know,
*  everyone was outraged all the time with everything, but if you look at his body of work,
*  people said if he was elected, he would start world war three. Meanwhile, we inherited a world
*  filled with wars, no new wars, right? Yeah. Three years, he made peace deals, no new wars. He was
*  tough. He was strong. People respected him. He built relationships and got trade deals done,
*  got peace deals done. The economy was rocking. His body work, I think was pretty strong as president.
*  Like you said, no new wars. This makes me think if Donald Trump won the presidency,
*  what the current situation in Ukraine would look like. But let me just ask you,
*  zoom out and ask you broadly. Do you think the war in Ukraine could have been avoided?
*  And what do you think it takes to bring it to an end?
*  I think a hundred percent it would have been avoided, not 99%. You know, president Trump for
*  four years had no problems with Russia. You know, we were, we were arming Ukraine,
*  but we were working with Russia. And again, the first two years we had a little bit of
*  issue working with Russia because they were accused of colluding with us since we had to
*  go through that investigation. But, but in the second two years we were trying to focus Russia
*  on what are the areas where we can collaborate together. I think Russia, you know, we thought
*  it was in their strategic advantage to play a U S and China against each other because of the
*  way that everything was done before they were stuck with China, but not getting a lot for it.
*  Under Bush, they took Georgia under Obama, they took Crimea under Trump. There was no problems.
*  And then under Biden, unfortunately, I think they misplayed a couple of things,
*  which I think provoked, you know, Russia to go forward. Still no excuse to do what they did.
*  I think that the invasion was a terrible thing and should not have occurred. But with that being
*  said, I think a hundred percent, if Trump was president, there would not be a war in Ukraine
*  today. Coming to the table and negotiating a peace, whether it's Donald Trump, whether it's
*  Biden, whether it's anybody, what do you think it takes? Do you think it's possible?
*  And if you're in a room, if Jared Kushner is in the room, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky,
*  what does it take to have a productive conversation? And what does it take for that
*  conversation to fail? Like what are the trajectories that lead to success and failure?
*  I think we go back to negotiations. Number one is trust, right? Both leaders have to have the
*  ability to communicate what an off-ramp is without fearing it's going to lead to the public.
*  So if you go to the posture of Zelensky right now, and by the way, President Zelensky,
*  I have a lot of respect for the courage he showed, especially initially. You know,
*  you saw what Ghani did in Afghanistan. They were getting attacked by the Taliban. He took the cash
*  and got the hell out of there. Staying in Kiev when he did how he did, it was one of the most
*  brave things we've seen in a long time. And he has a ton of my respect and admiration for doing that.
*  But now he's promising his people, we're going to win the war. And the military action has not
*  necessarily coincided with that sentiment. And so there has to be some form of off-ramp, but he can't
*  say that publicly. So for him to be able to work privately with somebody who can help create a new
*  paradigm where both leaders can say, we're going to stop the bloodshed, we're going to stop the
*  risk of nuclear war for the world, we're going to stop what's happening. That's really what it will
*  take. How that occurs, again, it's not something I'm involved in now, so I don't know who the right
*  broker is or how to put that together. But essentially they need somebody in between them
*  who can figure out how do you create a landing zone that works, because neither party is going
*  to jump until the pool is filled with water. And you have to outline what the go-forward looks like,
*  because you can't just stop it for them to get worse for both parties. You have to move it forward
*  into what happens next that hopefully can start to turn the tide to benefit both sides where they
*  can focus on the future instead of being stuck into the old paradigm of who started what, who's
*  to blame for what, who did what to who. It's just a lot of tough stuff now that's occurred, that's
*  going to be hard to walk back. And it's a big task to get it done. But for the sake of the world,
*  it'd be amazing if we were able to reach a conclusion to that conflict.
*  Just going back to your earlier mention of North Korea,
*  what do you think it takes to bring Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky to the table together?
*  Leadership.
*  So you're saying it has to be a US president?
*  It has to be somebody who's willing to put themselves on the line to go and do it. And
*  again, if you're the US president and you're the most powerful nation in the world,
*  you should be trying. But I do think again, the posture that the US has taken has probably
*  been in a place where it would be very hard for them to get the trust of Russia based on the
*  way that they've played their moves to date. I always thought from the beginning that Putin
*  would try to bring in President Xi in China to resolve it, to basically give a big screw you
*  to America to say, China is now the one in charge of this. But that hasn't seemed to manifest itself
*  to date either. But it takes leadership. The leaders have to get it and say, let's get everyone
*  together and let's try to get this done. Because every day it goes wrong, A, more people are dying.
*  And B, we do risk a nuclear war for the world, which is not a good situation.
*  Let me ask, since you helped set up phone calls between Donald Trump, Putin and King of Saudi
*  Arabia, if I were to interview Putin, what advice would you give on how to
*  get a deep understanding of the human being?
*  So I didn't deal with Russia a ton. But in my interaction with Putin and with Russia,
*  you know, I would kind of point out a couple of things. Number one is when America was hit with
*  COVID and New York was looking like we were going to run out of ventilators and masks,
*  Russia was the second country that sent us a plain load of supplies. And they didn't send that
*  because they hate America. They sent that because we were starting to make progress together as
*  countries. And they thought that they wanted to show goodwill to figure out how can we start
*  working together. And again, people may attack me for saying that that sounds naive.
*  Again, the past 15 years may show that that's not the case. But I don't believe that countries
*  have permanent enemies. I don't believe countries have permanent allies. Again, you think about the
*  US and Russia in World War II, we worked together to defeat the Nazis. And now we're great allies
*  with Germany, who basically was our great enemy in World War II. We're great allies with Japan,
*  who was our great enemy in World War II. So it goes back to the notion we discussed earlier of
*  you shouldn't condemn tomorrow to be like yesterday if you're unhappy with yesterday.
*  So number one is I would definitely ask him about that. The phone call that you mentioned
*  was after we did a pretty intense negotiation to create the largest oil cut in the history of oil
*  production. So during COVID, demand just shut off like crazy. And it was stopping very quickly.
*  Saudi and Russia at that time were having a conflict. They created this thing called OPEC Plus,
*  which goes back again, history between the two countries where they had conflicts. And then all
*  of a sudden, they were working together to try to stabilize the oil markets. But they couldn't agree
*  on the cuts. So Saudi actually increased production. So you had two things hitting at once where
*  Saudi and Russia were both increasing production and demand was dropping. So you were headed for
*  a real crisis. And I was starting to get calls from a lot of the oil industry executives here
*  in America saying, you don't understand, we can't just flip a switch and turn off our oil wells.
*  We're running out of storage here. And I said, look, President Trump likes low oil prices,
*  so he's not upset about what's happening. You have to call him. And if he gives me
*  permission or the instruction, then I can try to intervene. But right now, he's not
*  inclined to intervene. After a little bit, he said, you know what, it's time, get involved,
*  go do it. It was right over Passover. This was during COVID. I spent three days nonstop on the
*  phone with Kirill Dmitriev from Russia and with MBS directly. And I was dealing with Dan Burlett,
*  who was our energy minister, going back and forth. And it was crazy. It was just one of
*  the craziest negotiations. We ended up agreeing on the largest oil cut in the history of the world.
*  But the story you went to before, which was pretty funny, was finally make the deal.
*  And we set up a call between King Salman, Vladimir Putin, and President Trump to announce the deal.
*  I'm like, oh, this is great. So President Trump gets on us, congratulations, we have a deal.
*  And then King Salman says, we don't have a deal. Mexico hasn't agreed to their cuts.
*  And he's saying, what do you mean? And so they were part of the OPEC+.
*  And so I get a note saying, you got to go call Mexico. So I'm calling Mexico. They're saying,
*  we're not doing any cuts. I said, why? I said, we're hedged at $55. I said,
*  why do you tell us that in the beginning? So I'm telling the Saudis. So we were working
*  through this whole thing. So meanwhile, we were trying to find the compromise with Mexico.
*  I set up a call with Trump and Putin so they can kind of talk this through.
*  And he was always trying to play the game of how do we get Russia away from China? He always thought
*  that that was not the right strategic framework for US interests. And again, we had no problems
*  with them during that time. What I would say is that for Zelensky and Putin, any conversation
*  with both of them is about understanding their perspective. I think with Putin, he's a student
*  of history from the things that I saw with him. If you look at Russia over the last 500 years,
*  I think they were attacked by the Polish in early 1600. I think they were attacked by
*  the Swedes in the 1700s. I think they were attacked by Napoleon in the 1800s. And then
*  in the 1900s, they were attacked by Germany twice. And so from his perspective, there is,
*  in the early days of Russia, they were attacked by the Mongols. They were very vulnerable. And a
*  lot of the geography of Russia today is really designed for defensive purposes, that they have
*  natural barriers that makes them easier to defend. And Russia is a massive landmass. It's twice the
*  size of America. They have 11 time zones in the country. And so I do think that for Vladimir
*  Putin, his biggest concern is how do we create a security paradigm in the west of his country
*  that won't be a creep. And I think that there's like two different parts of the mindset. The people
*  who are most cynical of Putin will say, well, he's just trying to recreate the USSR. He's being
*  expansionist. And the people who want to be sympathetic to him will say, well, if you think
*  about it, the Russian perception of the NATO arrangement was that they wouldn't be expanding
*  westward. Over the last years, they've included all these countries that they said they promised
*  they wouldn't include, who knows what the promises were or weren't. But what I do know from his
*  perspective is allowing Ukraine into NATO was always a red line. And that's why we never offered
*  it. We never provoked it. We never brought it up. We said, we're going to arm them. And we basically
*  said, just calm down. We don't want any conflicts there. We have bigger issues and bigger opportunities
*  to work from. So I do think you have to think through what's a paradigm that he can accept.
*  And I do think that he'll give the justification for why he's done what he's done. And then I think
*  the framework for a solution is about how do we move both parties forward? Tough job. I hope you
*  get the opportunity to do it because I think it's a conversation that will only help the world
*  hopefully find a pathway forward. And I should mention, because you mentioned geography,
*  one of the many books you've recommended to me that gives a very interesting perspective on
*  history is called Prisoners of Geography by Tim Marshall. And it has a very interesting perspective
*  on the geopolitical conflicts and perspective of Russia from a geography perspective.
*  And also for China in the second chapter. And there's a lot of understanding of why
*  the expansion of NATO is such a concern for Russia. Because geography still, even in the 21st century,
*  less and less so because of technology and so on, but it still plays a major role
*  in conflicts between nations, rivers, mountains. And understanding the DNA of countries. It was
*  one of the most phenomenal books. And I just found it on Amazon randomly, but I loved every
*  minute of it. The chapter on America is also incredible. Going through the evolution of
*  you know, how we became the country we are, the different acquisitions, the different changes,
*  why we have all these geographic advantages. And it's an unbelievable book for anyone who's
*  interested in geopolitics. So I have to ask on several aspects of China. First on the president,
*  the meeting, you helped set up a first call and first meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.
*  Can you tell the story of that? Because that's also interesting. Again, that first phone call,
*  the reaching out, the forming the human connection, which ultimately leads to the
*  connection between nations and the possibility of collaboration. So during the transition,
*  President Trump took a call from the head of Taiwan and that sent the Chinese into a real
*  tailspin. And he didn't do it, I think, to be provocative to them as much as just as a businessman,
*  he felt the answer your call. Somebody wants to speak to you, you speak to him like you,
*  you want to have conversations, hear their point of view. And but it was taken as a very big
*  insult and it was against tradition and norm. And so that was something that set us off in a
*  wrong direction. My view at the time was that, you know, we are kind of entering a G2 world,
*  whether people want to admit it or not. And that a lot of these countries in what I call the middle
*  market countries were basically playing this when China was being aggressive with their one belt,
*  one road, they were basically playing US and China against each other. And I thought that by
*  the two leaders coming together, there were some things they wouldn't agree on. But there's a lot
*  that they probably could agree on, which could lead to resolutions to a lot of issues in the
*  world. That was like my most optimistic view. My most more pragmatic view was that President Trump
*  had very big issues on trade that he wanted to get to with China. You know, he felt like China,
*  their trade practices were unfair, they weren't following all the global rules of trade. He was
*  a little bit nervous that they would be provocative with Taiwan. And I felt like the two of them
*  getting together would be the best way to try and resolve that. So the Chinese are very proud and a
*  lot of it is about face. And so we in order to negotiate for that first call, we basically agree
*  on what would happen in the call. So not let's just have a call say hi, nice to meet you is a
*  question of President Trump basically agreed that he would acknowledge the one China policy, which
*  he didn't see as a big concession because you could always unacknowledge it the next day. So yeah,
*  acknowledge it and then we'll go and exchange President Xi was going to come over to the US
*  for a visit so they could sit together. And they want to do it outside the White House. And so we
*  agreed on Mar-a-Lago, which I also thought was good because President Trump always felt much
*  more comfortable when he was hosting at his properties and he just felt at home. And so
*  he liked having people as his guests and he loved he loved it. He always felt really relaxed and it
*  was great. So that was really what we did. Then the Chinese come over very much anticipated visit.
*  And it was incredible. So they were supposed to sit together for 15 minutes. And they sent about an
*  hour and a half together. And during that meeting, President Trump, they said, look, let's just set
*  some ground rules to this relationship. Like, let's just not talk about Taiwan. Like, you know,
*  just don't do anything I don't want on the table. If it does, I'm gonna have to do harsh things.
*  I still want this to be a problem for four years. We got bigger issues. They basically just again,
*  you notice four years of Trump administration, no Taiwan talk whatsoever. It was a non-issue.
*  Started talking about the trade issues. They spent a lot of time on North Korea.
*  President Trump was trying to get the perspective from President Xi about North Korea because that
*  was, again, considered from Obama the biggest national security issue that we faced at the time.
*  And they just had a good feeling for each other. It also helped that, you know, my wife and I,
*  we actually had a Chinese nanny and teacher in our house and our kids learned fluent Mandarin.
*  And our daughter actually opened when President Xi and President Trump were together with
*  Melania and with Madam Pang, is my daughter actually sang them a couple of Chinese songs.
*  And I thought that was a nice way to show, you know, we're tough, but we respect your culture.
*  Because the Chinese have an incredible culture that goes back thousands of years. They're very
*  proud in how they do it. And I think that sign of respect also set things off in a very warm
*  way for President Trump to say, my granddaughter speaks Chinese and we're showing you the respect,
*  which I think is very important. And he did have respect for them.
*  The next part about the visit, I mean, obviously we had a lot of discussions on trade,
*  but the part that was probably most impactful to me was President Xi basically did an hour monologue
*  at lunch where he just went through Chinese history from his perspective. And he talked about,
*  with particular emphasis on kind of the Treaty of Unequals and then the 100 years of humiliation.
*  And then you go through from Mao all the way to today and you had, you know, China coming back
*  and rising. And you could tell that he was learned the lessons from the past and was very committed
*  to kind of seeing China go through. So that was a different time, right? So China today is different
*  than it was in 2017. In 2017, I remember President Xi was at Davos and he was feted by all the top
*  business people in the world as the, you know, Donald Trump was the threat to the global world
*  order. President Xi was the champion of free trade and the biggest champion of environmentalism
*  and fighting for climate change. And what occurred was President Trump came in and basically said,
*  I think China has not been following the rules-based order, took very, very drastic
*  approaches with tariffs. Every time he would do the tariffs again, you know, I had Mnuchin,
*  our treasury secretary, come to von Kama House. If he does this, this is going to crash the whole
*  economy. I mean, these, and by the way, he believed it. I mean, these were things that people were
*  telling him would be very tough to do. You know, President Trump had a gentleman named Ambassador
*  Lighthizer, Robert Lighthizer. He was really the tip of the spear on all of our trade negotiations.
*  He worked very well with Secretary Mnuchin and they ended up, we ended up increasing tariffs to
*  numbers that hadn't even been thought could happen. So we did the first round of tariffs.
*  Then, you know, the Chinese came back and retaliated very surgically trying to hit us in all the
*  areas that politically would have been difficult. And what Trump did was instead of backing down,
*  he took some of the revenue from the tariffs, gave it to the farmers and said, I know that this is
*  going to hurt your business, but I'm going to make sure you guys are made whole. And then he doubled
*  down and basically went back at the Chinese with even more tariffs. So what we watched over a year
*  and a half was probably the biggest hand of poker that was ever played. And it was an amazing
*  experience to be a part of it. And the role I played was really working for Secretary Mnuchin
*  and Ambassador Lighthizer as a back channel with the Chinese to make sure we can just
*  deescalate things and get to solutions in the best way possible. And so anyway, it was a fascinating
*  time. But if you think about the global awareness of the bad practices that China was
*  putting in place today versus what they were in 2016, I think one of President Trump's most
*  successful policies was shifting the way the entire world understood the threat of China and
*  then putting in place the beginning of a regime to try and rebalance the world so that we could have
*  more economic parity. So you mentioned to me the book, The Hundred Year Marathon by Michael
*  Pillsbury when we discussed China. And I've got a chance to read parts of it. And I highly
*  recommend people read it because there's a few, it's definitely an eye opening perspective.
*  I don't know if I agree with all of it. I don't know if you agree with all of it, but it certainly
*  opens, it gives a very intense perspective on China. And you said it was instructive
*  to how you thought, how Donald Trump thought about China. Can you describe the main thesis of the
*  book and maybe with the hopeful view, how it's possible to have a trajectory of these two
*  superpowers working together in the 21st century versus fighting against each other?
*  Perfect. So it's a very, very big book. And I think it's a book definitely worth reading.
*  Michael is tremendous. He speaks fluent Mandarin. So he spent a lot of time researching to do the
*  book. So I highly recommend it to everyone. And it was considered more of a fringe perspective
*  in 2016, but it really, I think, came to represent the underpinning of what the collective thought
*  was of the Trump administration. And maybe you could argue that it was even more cynical. The
*  whole thesis of the book was that China from 1949 to 2049 was working to reclaim their position as
*  the global leader. So you had the Chinese empire. One of the things, I don't know if it's from this
*  book or a different book that I read that spoke about how in the late 1700s, basically the emperor
*  of China was offered some of the industrial capability from England, which was basically
*  now becoming the industrial revolution. And basically, no, we're fine. We're the great
*  Chinese empire. We don't need any of these things. We're better than that. And by rejecting that,
*  the rest of the world got stronger. China remained weaker. Then you had the opium wars. The Chinese
*  had big opium problems through all the trade back and forth. And then China from about 1840 to 1940,
*  had 100 years where they really, after all these treaties, were really a second class country.
*  Then you have the People's Revolution that comes in. He talks about how China, very strategically,
*  is a very, very poor country, would fight their way back and build brick by brick.
*  He proffers in the book that Nixon didn't go to China and open China. It was China that actually
*  went to Nixon and was able to use Nixon in order to open up. Then they talk about how under Carter,
*  they were able to get the US to contribute to a lot of their, they were able to start borrowing
*  the US know-how from our university systems, from our medical, from our science, from our research.
*  And the whole notion that was the conventional thinking of American leaders was that the more
*  we helped China advance, the more they would become a free market economy. And it was a great
*  market. The only difference was that they weren't allowing us access. They were making our companies
*  basically give them all of their technical knowledge. They were stealing our intellectual
*  property. They were doing espionage to steal a lot of the patents. They were just ignoring our
*  patents and they weren't following any of the rules of international trade. Then they started
*  becoming the world's manufacturing hub. They basically became the world's factory. And then
*  they started this whole initiative called the Belt and Road Initiative in order to start locking in
*  their lines of trades. They were buying up all the ports everywhere. They were building railways,
*  thinking how do we lock in our distribution so that we can maintain the dominance as the world's
*  global factory. And so it was a brilliant long-term plan that they were doing. And by raising
*  awareness, by putting the tariffs, Trump slowed them down a lot. The real question is if they
*  actually did achieve this full objective of becoming the world dominant country, what they
*  would have done with it, whether they would have been nefarious or not. I think from my perspective,
*  even with some of the divisions and issues we have now in America, I still would rather an American
*  led world order than a Chinese led world order. But the notion was that they were playing a very
*  zero sum game and really going to be the dominant leader in this new world order.
*  That really framed the perspective. And it wasn't necessarily, people ask me, and the Chinese were
*  always fearing is Trump trying to stop our rise. And you have a great book also by Graham Allison
*  that he writes about, are we destined for war between US and China? And he goes through different
*  historical times where you have a power and a rising superpower. And I think more than half the
*  time it ends up leading to war. So the question is, what's going to happen here? And I do think
*  that Trump's perspective, and this is my interpretation, because everything was always
*  tactical day to day. And he was unpredictable to the Chinese, which they couldn't deal with. And
*  he was unpredictable even to his team sometimes because he was playing it day by day and issue by
*  issue and always changing and adjusting, which is how an entrepreneur thinks. He respected the job
*  they did by building their country. They moved 300 million people out of poverty into the middle
*  class. They did it at the expense of a lot of other countries throughout the world, especially
*  America. But Trump says, look, stupid politicians made deals. I respect China for doing what they
*  did. But what I want to do is I want to change the paradigm so that for the next 20 years,
*  we can maintain our advantage over them. We can maintain our competitive dynamic. And his general
*  view was that America is the best private sector in the world. We have a lot of the best minds
*  in the world. And if we can just have a level playing field with set rules, then America should
*  be able to outperform. And so that's really what we were trying to do. We were trying to kind of
*  get rid of some of their state subsidies, get rid of, make them follow some of these international
*  rules of trade and not allowing them to do predatory investments that then undercut
*  different industries that we had so that they can have global market dominance or monopolies
*  on different industries and then have pricing power, but also geopolitical power. So one of the
*  examples that people talk about now is China for the last 20 years was very advanced on seeing this
*  electrification trend. They subsidized solar panels. A lot of the American solar panel players
*  were put out of business. So now I think it's like 90 plus percent of solar panels in the world
*  are manufactured in China. Then all the rare earths that you need in order to
*  make these solar panels and to make these electric vehicles, China's bought up most of them in a lot
*  of the refining capacities in China. So thinking through strategically, how do we create an even
*  playing field so that we're not at the mercy of them and how you can have a rules-based world
*  order, that was really kind of the thought of what we were trying to work towards.
*  So there's this SNL skit where Jimmy Fallon plays you and you're walking into the Oval Office
*  looking cool, wearing shades and a bulletproof vest to the song Unbelievable by EMF. I don't know if
*  you've seen it, but it's pretty epic. And then Trump says that you've traveled the world representing
*  the administration, but no one has ever heard you speak. So there's a lot of questions I can ask
*  about that, but one of them is, can you introspect why you choose this low-key approach
*  of kind of operating behind the scenes and not speaking much to the public?
*  At least at the time, you've spoken a little bit more and today you've spoken for a really long time,
*  which I deeply appreciate.
*  No, it's been a pleasure to do this and thank you for the opportunity to talk about these things.
*  And so that was a really funny skit. And it's funny, the thing I got made fun of the most for
*  that was the wardrobe. And that came from after three months in the administration, we were having
*  dinner with all the generals and they were saying, updating us on the war, and they were saying,
*  we're going to start a war with ISIS. And General Dunford said to me after, look, the president can't
*  come to see how we're fighting this war, but I'd like to invite you to come with me to Iraq
*  and come see. And would you come with me? I said, no, that's great. I always learned in business
*  that you can't make decisions from just an ivory tower. You have to go to the front lines and see
*  what's actually happening. So I said, no problem. I'd love to go. Meanwhile, two days before I'm
*  about to go, the doc from the White House stops by my office and says, we need to get your blood
*  type. You're going to an active war zone. I'm like, okay, so I guess we'll go to a war zone.
*  I didn't really think this thing fully through. So I get on the plane with Dunford and we land in
*  Iraq and he looks like GI Joe. He's a great general. He's very, very well respected in the military.
*  And we go in and we get on Black Hawk helicopter. They said, today's a nice day. Let's take the
*  sides off. And so I get on the plane and there's a guy, a military service officer who then takes
*  a machine gun, locks it into a thing, takes the bullets, puts them into the gun and is sitting
*  there saying, we're ready to go. And then I'm looking out and there's like three other helicopters
*  with guys. One was an Osprey with a guy buckled in, also with a machine gun looking out. We take off
*  and we're flying over Baghdad from the airport to the embassy. And as we're going, I'm sitting in
*  an open air helicopter with the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, guys with machine guns
*  everywhere. This is a new experience for you. You have an experience. I was doing real estate
*  like three months ago, you know, and now I'm flying over Iraq and the chairman says that's
*  Saddam Hussein's palace. And I looked down, there's like a big bomb right through the middle. Then you
*  see the area with the two swords in the hands. I'm saying to myself, like, how the hell did I get
*  here? Like, well, what is happening? So meanwhile, we ended up going to the front lines to be with
*  the Iraqi military, which the US military is working closely with. And I had a meeting that
*  night with the president of Iraq. And so I wore, what are you wearing to the front lines in a battle
*  zone? And also me and the president. So I put a sports jacket on. We land at the front line and
*  they give me a bulletproof vest that says Kushner on it. I tape it. I just, I put it on, I go out
*  and I cover the NER. So it just said Kush. And I went and I didn't realize they were taking pictures.
*  I think the picture looks pretty epic. He was sunglasses. I think I love it.
*  So anyway, so that was the funny story behind that. And then actually my brother was at some
*  society event in New York and he ran into Jimmy Fallon. So the two of them took a selfie together
*  and Josh writes me, he says, hanging out with my older brother in New York, you know, I'm trying
*  to explain to him what your voice sounds like. So, so it was good. So that was a funny one. But
*  I think just being behind the scenes for me just gave me more maneuverability in the sense that,
*  you know, again, it goes back to trust and people knowing that I wasn't going to try to
*  publicize the things they were telling me. I think it just gave me more ability to
*  operate that way. And I also realized too, like communicating is a very important skill. Luckily
*  in Washington, there's no shortage of amazing communicators. I think there were a lot of people
*  who were much better at me than being communicators. So I was very happy that
*  they were willing to do it because it wasn't something that I had a lot of experience with
*  or necessarily I thought was very, I was very good at. And so I kind of just did my job and,
*  and just focused on getting things done. So let me ask you, you have a very interesting life.
*  If you were to give advice to young folks on how to have such an impactful life, what would you say?
*  Career and life, how to have a successful career and a successful life.
*  Number one is I would say you just have to work hard at everything you do.
*  Number two, I would say never stop learning and always try to say yes more than you should. Go
*  out of your comfort zone. And I think just, just you gotta work hard at everything you do. And,
*  and, and if you're going to take something on, do it the best you can. You know, one of the lessons
*  I write about in the book from my father was, I remember I was going for a job interview and he
*  asked me, he says, well, what time are you leaving to the job interview? Is that nine o'clock? I said,
*  I'll leave at eight o'clock. He says, well, what if there's traffic? I said, dad, I've done this
*  drive a thousand times. Like there's never traffic. So what if there's an accident? I said,
*  I can't control that. He said, Jared, the only excuse you ever have for being late is that you
*  didn't leave early enough. And I just think it's something where if you want to accomplish
*  something, you know, a lot of people I hear, they complain about what other people do or why it's
*  hard or why it's impossible. And again, I say this as somebody who's been so blessed with, with,
*  with so many things in life. But, you know, when I've had challenges or things I've wanted to achieve,
*  I just focus and say, what can I do? And I'll, I'll read everything I can get my hands on.
*  I'll, if I fail at one, the door closes, I'll try the window. If the window closed,
*  I'll try the chimney. If the chimney throws, I'll try to dig a tunnel. It's just,
*  if you want to accomplish something, you just have to go at it. And, you know, I think the most
*  important thing I'll say, sorry, I'm kind of thinking my way into this answer, is, is just
*  do the right thing. I think that's also right. And I saw that in my career, you know, be good
*  to people, be honest, do the right thing. And, and if you do that, I think long-term, it does pay off,
*  maybe not in politics, but in, in the world at large, it does. And my hope is in politics,
*  it will as well. I wonder if you can comment on your process of learning in general, because you
*  took on so many new interesting problems and approached them with a first principles kind of
*  approach. So what was your source of information? So, because you didn't seem to be listening to the
*  assumptions of the prior experts. You were just taking on the problem in a very pragmatic
*  perspective. So what was, how'd you learn about the Middle East? How did you learn about China?
*  How did you learn about Mexico? How did you, you know, like all of these prison reform, all this
*  that you've taken on and were extremely effective at? It really started with just talking to people.
*  I would try to reach out to people who had been involved in different things and ask them,
*  you know, what they did, what they thought of the problem, who they thought was smart on it,
*  what they read that helped them get a better understanding why they think something had failed.
*  And then I would just read voraciously on every topic. You know, Washington, it was harder to get
*  advice from humans because I found humans had this weird tendency to talk to the media. And so,
*  I talked to somebody and I'd ask advice. And then the next thing I know is the Washington Post would
*  call and say, Jared's an idiot, doesn't know what he's doing. And he's even going to this person to
*  get advice. I'm like, yeah, I'm asking everyone. So books really became an amazing guide for me.
*  Ivanka, she's an incredible researcher. She's just voracious. And so she gave me some of my best books
*  and some incredible advice as well. But that was really the process. And then
*  I think that was kind of the first stage. And then the second stage was just constant iteration
*  and readjusting plan as you continue to get more learning. And one story I tell in the book as well
*  is that on my first trip to the Middle East, where I met with Mohammed bin Zayed, who I spoke about
*  earlier, the ruler of UAE, I spent two hours with him, asking him questions and really going through
*  the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the Israeli-Arab issue. And he said to me at the end of the meeting,
*  he says, Jared, I think you're going to make peace here in the Middle East. And I was shocked
*  because I mean, first of all, he was, you know, at the time, I think one of the most respected
*  leaders in the region, somebody who I found to be very wise and super thoughtful and experienced.
*  And I said to him, why do you say that? I was flattered, obviously, but not certain why he was
*  saying that based on the fact that I didn't know what my plan was. I didn't know what I was going
*  to do. And I had no pathway to make peace. And he said, well, the US usually sends one of three
*  different kinds of people to come see me. He says, the first are people who come and they fall asleep
*  in meetings. He said, the second are people who come and they basically read me notes, but have no
*  ability to interact on the message they're there to convey. And then the third have been people who
*  have come to convince me to do things that aren't in my interest. He says, you're the first person
*  who's ever come here. And it's just ask questions. He says, why have you done that? I said, because
*  I figure, you know, this problem's been going on for a long time. You live here, I'll be gone at
*  some point, you're going to have to live with the consequences of whatever my work is. And the US
*  has a lot of power. And my question is, what would you do if you were me? And how would you approach
*  this and help me think about it? And again, I wasn't going to then take his plan and then execute
*  it. But I thought it'd be very provocative to understand from the people in the region
*  and instructive how they would use the resource and the power that the US had to solve the problems
*  that were having significant impact on their lives.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of power to the simplicity of that human approach, where you're just listening.
*  And one of my wishes for society is I leave government. You know, I was living on the
*  Upper East Side in a very liberal echo chamber. I then traveled the country, I met so many people
*  who I never would have met otherwise, on the conservative side, on the independent side,
*  on so many different issues. I think that people benefit if you have such a strong point of view,
*  I would follow the John Stuart Mill marketplace of ideas, and find people who disagree with you.
*  And don't call them names. Don't say they're a bad person. Say, I want to understand why you feel the
*  way you do. Let's have conversations in this country. And I think that that's probably going
*  to be our best way to work through the issues that we have currently. When you zoom out,
*  and look at the 21st century from a human history perspective, across the time scale of
*  many decades, maybe centuries, what gives you hope about human civilization? Everything you've seen,
*  you've traveled the world, talked to some of the most powerful and influential people,
*  and you look at the future, what gives you hope about this little planet of ours?
*  What gives me the most hope is that anything's possible. If there's one lesson that I took from
*  my time in government, it's that people coming together to try to make tomorrow different than
*  yesterday can succeed. And if the right people in the right places focus on the right ideas,
*  I think the advancement that we can have for human history and for society can be tremendous.
*  And I think that right now, I see we're at a place in society where there's a lot of what I call
*  squabbles between countries, which are really man versus man issues. And those are as old as time.
*  We've been fighting about borders or religion or who wronged somebody 100 or 1000 years ago.
*  These are what I call more tribal battles. But I do think that as we advance with artificial
*  intelligence, as energy becomes cheaper and it's more readily available, I think we're going to
*  have massive industrialization. I think we're going to have massive advancement. I think in
*  medical and science, we're going to have cures for diseases. We have the potential in 10, 20 years
*  from now to enter a dawn for humanity that could be incredible. We could become multi-planetary.
*  We can explore the wonders of the world. We can find things we didn't know. So I think that if we
*  put our energy towards finding these advancements that will improve the lives of everyone on this
*  planet, instead of figuring out ways to have these tensions between us, that for me is the most
*  optimistic case for what's possible. And the reason why I believe it's possible is because
*  somebody with no experience, somebody who all I really had was the faith of a leader,
*  and I had the courage to try. And I went out there with other people and we took on some of the most
*  hopeless, impossible problems and we succeeded. And if we were able to do that, then everyone
*  else should be able to do that as well. Well, Jared, thank you for having the courage to try.
*  Thank you for your friendship, for your kindness, most importantly, for your book recommendations.
*  And thank you for talking today. This was fascinating, eye-opening. I hope to have
*  many more conversations like this. Thank you very much, Lex.
*  Thank you for listening to this conversation with Jared Kushner. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from
*  Mahatma Gandhi. An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind. Thank you for listening,
*  and I hope to see you next time.
