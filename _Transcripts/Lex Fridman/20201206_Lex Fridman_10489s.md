# John Clarke The Art of Fighting and the Pursuit of Excellence  Lex Fridman Podcast #143
**Lex Fridman:** [December 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvhpncC5jZ8)
*  The following is a conversation with John Clark. He's a friend, a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt,
*  former MMA fighter, and at least in my opinion, one of the great UFC cornerman coaches to listen to.
*  And also, he's my current Jiu-Jitsu coach at Broadway Jiu-Jitsu in South Boston. He was once,
*  for a time, a philosophy major in college, and is now, I would say, a kind of practicing philosopher,
*  opinionated, brilliant, and someone I always enjoy talking to even when, especially when,
*  we disagree, which we do often. He's definitely someone I can see talking to many times on this
*  podcast. In fact, he hosts a new podcast of his own called Please Allow Me. Quick mention of
*  each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode. Thank you to Theragun, the device
*  they use for post-workout muscle recovery, Magic Spoon low-carb keto-friendly cereal that I think
*  is delicious, Aidsleep, a mattress that cools itself and gives me yet another reason to enjoy
*  sleep, and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends. Please check out these sponsors in
*  the description to get a discount and to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that
*  martial arts, especially Jiu-Jitsu and Judo, have been a big part of my growth as a human being.
*  So I think I will talk to a few martial artists on occasion on this podcast. I hope that is of
*  interest to you. I won't talk to people who are simply great fighters or great athletes,
*  but people who have a philosophy that I find to be interesting and worth exploring,
*  even if I disagree with parts or most of it. I like alternating between historians and computer
*  scientists, fighters and biologists, and between totally different worldviews and personalities
*  like Elon Musk and Michael Malice. This world, to me, is fascinating because of the diversity
*  of weirdness that is human civilization. I love the weird and the brilliant, and hope you join
*  me on the journey of exploring both. If you don't like an episode, skip it. For an OCD person like
*  myself, sometimes not listening to a podcast episode is an act of courage. It's like not
*  finishing a book even though you're 80% done. Try it sometimes. Listen to ones you like,
*  and don't listen to the ones you don't like. I know, it's profound advice. If you enjoy this
*  thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with Five Stars and Apple Podcasts, follow on Spotify,
*  support it on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now,
*  here's my conversation with John Clark. Are you ready for this?
*  I've been ready for this my whole life.
*  All right. I was thinking of doing a Kerouac-style road trip across the United States,
*  after this whole COVID thing lifts. You ever take a trip like that?
*  I've done a handful of long-distance driving trips, up and down the East Coast, but also
*  from the West Coast back to the East Coast, and then returning to California.
*  I've definitely done my fair share of driving in this country.
*  Do you have the longing for the great American road trip?
*  I think there are so many things that I've been lucky enough to see in the world,
*  that I now, at this point in my life, realize there are tons of things that I need to see here
*  in this country, and a road trip could potentially be the best way to see them.
*  I think to do it effectively, you need an amount of time where you can be as leisurely as possible.
*  There's no deadline, and there's no, I've got to make it from Chicago to St. Louis by sundown to
*  get to this place at this time. I think you really need to be able to take your time, and
*  let the road take you where you need to go. It feels like you need a mission, though.
*  Ultimately, there's a reason you need to be in San Francisco. That's the Kerouac thing.
*  You have to meet somebody somewhere loosely in a few weeks, and then it's the, as you struggle on
*  towards that mission, you meet weird characters that get in your way, but ultimately create an
*  experience. I think having a loose deadline is good, but that's a beginning and an end point.
*  And what I mean is, I don't want to have to be, all right, we're leaving, say, Boston on Sunday
*  night. Let's get to New York by Monday morning, and then from New York, we're going to go to Philly,
*  and we've got to be in Philly at four. A vague beginning and end is fine, but I think having very
*  strict guidelines in between will rob you of certain experiences along the way.
*  If you have a timeframe to get from Philly to Indianapolis, and some awesome shit starts to
*  happen in Philly, do you really want to have to cut it short because you've got to be in Indianapolis
*  by sunup? Why do you have to be anywhere by any time for any reason, really? Well, plans change.
*  Plans change all the time, exactly. But if we're talking about having a mission or the type of
*  road trip, I just think it would be best to have it as loose and flexible as possible.
*  I don't know. You've got to make hard deadlines and then break them. Totally change the plans,
*  disappoint people, break promises. That's the way of life. Somebody's waiting for you in St. Louis,
*  and all of a sudden you fell in love with a biker in New York. I don't know. I don't know what you're
*  up to. I can appreciate that. But on a trip like that, I feel like a trip with deadlines is for a
*  different point in your life. And at this point in my life, I don't want any of the deadlines,
*  because it's not about meeting someone and disappointing them in St. Louis. It's about
*  me not disappointing myself. You want to have enough time in what you're doing to make sure
*  that you get the full breadth of every experience that you encounter. How would you fully experience
*  a place? I don't think I've actually fully experienced Boston. If you were showing up to
*  a city for a week on this road trip, what would you do? So I'm going to answer that in two parts.
*  A few years ago, I had an opportunity to move out of Boston. And the thing that kept me here,
*  no question about it, was the fact that I felt like I had a contract with my students.
*  And I did not. I felt like a great many of them took a leap of faith by joining my gym and asking
*  me to teach them what I know. And when I had an opportunity to leave Boston, I thought of those
*  people and I thought I want to fulfill my obligation to them. So because I made a decision
*  to stay here, I then that summer made a decision to endear myself to the city of Boston. And I
*  tried to find lots and lots of different things to do. I can tell you that the coolest thing that
*  I found to do in this city is the MFA, where they have like on Friday nights, they'll have like
*  different exhibits and stuff. And they'll have like little beer carts and food tents. And you can go
*  do a painting class off on the side. Very cool night of things to do. But in general,
*  whenever I'm in a new city, I try not to pay attention to Google and I try not to do anything
*  that I find on a travel site. The best thing to do is to walk out of your hotel or wherever it is
*  you're staying and find the most normal looking bar, have a drink and talk to a bartender.
*  So the people, the people, the people, and then you can experience that town the way that they
*  experience it. Even in a city where there are tons of tourist attractions, locals probably
*  visit the same tourist attractions when they have visitors come from out of town.
*  But you want to see how they view those places and how they visit them. And you want to go to eat
*  where they're going to eat. Like, you know, you're going to, for the most part, the North End is not
*  a place where I would take someone and say, Hey, this is Boston's, the pinnacle of Boston dining,
*  because it's very touristy. There are a handful of really good restaurants there,
*  but I want to know where the, where the, I want to go to bogey's place. I want to know like the,
*  the down low spots where the hell's bogey's place. It's like a little steak house in the back of
*  jam curlies. Exactly. Like a shitty bar. It's just a bar with like bar food, but I think that like,
*  it's all Boston. It is in Boston. Yeah. It's like South Boston. No, it's in,
*  um, it's in the downtown area. Like, um, I don't know what the neighborhoods are called here,
*  honestly, because they call, they, they have an area called downtown Boston. And I don't even know
*  what the hell that means. And these new financial district, where's Southy? Cause I've heard about
*  the Southy Southy is South Boston, but is there, is there a difference in South Boston, Southy?
*  No, it's the same thing. No, but like, you know, the mythical South, I think the mythical Southy
*  is, uh, something that's long gone now. And the term now actually is Sobo.
*  Oh no. It's changed what, who, who took over what what's the, you know, the goodwill hunting
*  personality that's Southy, isn't it? Strong accent, those bad-ass dudes. I came here right at the end
*  of like what was South Boston. So when I got, and my gym is in South Boston, the neighborhood was
*  just starting to change. So I think as gentrification happened and they started
*  building more luxury condominiums, they were buying all these old businesses out, all the mom
*  and pop businesses. And I think that kind of changed the, the makeup of the community.
*  And it wasn't only because there was an influx of new young people, uh, with disposable income
*  is because there's an exodus of the older people who kind of grew up and raised their families
*  there because they were being offered humongous sums of money for their homes that they had bought
*  like in the late seventies and early eighties so that they could develop those areas. So you have
*  a combination of the influx of new people in the exodus of the old. And now you just got this totally
*  new neighborhood in its place. What do you love about Boston? Is there a love still for Boston?
*  You certainly have the love of the thing that's gone as well. Yeah, I think I don't want to
*  pinpoint pin this on Boston because it's happening in all great cities. As these areas become
*  gentrified, what's happening is the personality and the character of the neighborhood is,
*  is just being run out. And I have nothing against people coming in and making money and things like
*  that. But when you do it at the expense of the culture, the character and the personality of
*  the neighborhood, I mean, you're kind of standing on the shoulders of giants. These are the people
*  that came here and built these areas up. Uh, and it happens here in, in Boston, it happens in all
*  over New York, uh, happened on the West coast. So what I love about Boston is not nearly as
*  romantic as what it might've been 15 years ago. And what I used to love about New York,
*  what I love about Boston is that, um, it's walkable. Um, the food scene is on, is on the
*  rise here. Um, but I think you're, you're hard pressed to find the charm that people think of
*  when they think of old Boston and old New England city. See, I see it differently. People sometimes
*  criticize like MIT, like for the thing that it is now, but I think it is always like that.
*  I tend to prefer to carry the flame of the history of the greatness, the greatest moments of its
*  history and like sort of enjoy that the echoes of that in the halls of MIT in the same way in Boston,
*  you think about the history and that history lives on in the few individuals. Like you can't
*  just look around what Boston is now and be like, what has Boston become? I think it was always
*  carried by a minority of individuals. I think we kind of look back in history and think like
*  times were greater in a certain kind of dimension back then, but that's because we remember, uh,
*  this is a ridiculous non-data driven assertion of mine is to remember just the, the, the, the
*  brightest stars of that history. And so we romanticize it. But I think if you look around now,
*  those special people are still living in Boston for which Boston will be remembered as a great
*  city in like 50 years. I think you're probably right, but isn't there some sort of theory about
*  the point that there's like a certain age in your life where things resonate differently to you?
*  Like, I think they've done studies where most people stop searching for new music after age
*  19. Most dads you see like wearing super old clothes, like the, that's the style of the time
*  period of the last great part of their life. So like there's an evolution in, in people,
*  and it could also be the memories of where they live. And when I was 17, of course,
*  my neighborhood was the best then because I was having the most fun. And we always kind of look
*  at things through that, that tint, I think. And you're right. And I don't think there's
*  anything wrong with the way cities are evolving now. It's just not, I, I, I preferred a time of
*  like a mom and pop store, not a fabricated, like a gastro pub that could just be like
*  on a four lane super highway on your, on your way out of Epcot center.
*  And it's, it's actually owned by like some conglomerate.
*  But there's still the special places. Like I, this takes us back to the road trip is,
*  maybe I tend to romanticize the experiences of like the diners in the middle of nowhere.
*  What would you say makes for like, it feels like life is made up of these experiences
*  that are, that maybe on paper seem mundane, but are actually somehow give you a chance to pause
*  and reflect on life with like a certain kind of people, whether they're like really close
*  friends or complete strangers, maybe alcohol is involved in the middle of nowhere. It seems like
*  road trip facilitates that if you allow it to, like, what do you think makes for those kinds of
*  experiences? Have you had any? I think in the context of a road trip, I think it's like
*  hyper-localization. And I think it is those, those experiences along the way with people.
*  And the people that you're with will color the experiences differently, depending on the person.
*  The road trip you took was with somebody else or alone?
*  So I've driven up and down the East coast several times. When I drove from LA to New York,
*  my friend was on the run from the cops. So we were trying to get out of-
*  Traffic tickets?
*  Yeah, traffic tickets. Yeah, allegedly. We were trying to get out of LA because he was going to
*  have to go away for a little while. So we drove from LA and we just, you know, we're young kids.
*  We had no idea what we were doing. And we drove East. And then, you know, we had an unbelievable
*  trip, mostly because we didn't really have a destination. We didn't really have a timeframe.
*  Thank goodness. Because he got arrested again in Pennsylvania. So we got kind of stuck there.
*  And then we drove back to LA when he got out in Pennsylvania. But all the stops along the way
*  were kind of like weird things. Like you have no money, right? So you're finding that like
*  a little diamond in the rough place to eat, the diner you talk about, like that place.
*  I once was in Buenos Aires and the guy that I was with, he said, I know this quaint little spot
*  around the corner. And I was young, I was like 25. And I thought the coolest thing in the world
*  would be to be such a citizen of the world that you know these quaint little spots around the
*  corner in like all these great cities. Like I know where to get this great chicken sandwich
*  in Argentina. I know where to get this great meal in Costa Rica. I know where to get this super local
*  egg in another country. I just thought that that was really cool. The ability to do that
*  anywhere in the world. Did you get closer with that guy? When I threw the trip? I found that like,
*  so I took a trip across the United States with a guy friend of mine. We had different goals.
*  I was searching for a meaning in life and he was searching for, what's the politically correct way
*  of phrasing it, but just basically trying to sleep with every kind of woman that this world
*  has to offer. What's the difference between those two things? Well, I guess you're searching for
*  the different kinds of meanings. I mean, I still think that you can't find meaning
*  between a woman's legs, I suppose. Have you tried all of them?
*  But there was a tension there. We grew closer with those experiences, but we've gotten in fights.
*  There was a lot of like literal almost fights. And then we were close and there was like
*  silences. But then we were like brothers and this whole weird journey of friendship that we went on.
*  I think anytime you spend that much time in like a small space with another person,
*  you're going to have the different parts of the relationship will manifest themselves.
*  You'll have the periods of closeness. You'll have the periods of vulnerability where it's like,
*  maybe you're driving through Denver and it's three in the morning and you talk about something you
*  might not have otherwise talked about. You'll have the periods where you don't want to see that
*  motherfucker ever again. He didn't, and depending could be because of anything.
*  But the guy that I drove twice with, we're still in contact. We're still buddies. We
*  have very different goals also. But at that point in our lives, we never even contemplated
*  the meaning of life. We were about probably more to the point of the friend that you drove with.
*  We were more about racking up experiences, whatever they were.
*  Right. I want to be able to retell this. Stories. Yeah. I want to be able to retell this and it's
*  got to sound cool. Like I don't want to retell a story about, yeah, and then we drove through
*  Alabama and they've got a lovely library and I checked out this book and I'm not interested
*  in retelling that. Do you remember any, this is a kid's show. Do you remember any stories
*  that the kids would enjoy from those times that were profound in some kind of way?
*  Yeah. There were some impactful moments on the beginning of our road trip where we had no money
*  and as a couple of kids who knew nothing, we literally had to, we stopped in Vegas and we
*  went to Circus Circus. At the time they had $3 blackjack and we had like 12 bucks and my buddy
*  was a kind of a degenerate gambler. So he knew what was up. I was just like kind of stuffing
*  chips in my pockets, making sure we could pay for the gas. And just being at a point,
*  which is like a starting line and like we drove from LA to Vegas, which is only about four hours
*  and being at the starting line and realizing like we may not even like get off the starting line
*  here. And if we don't, what are we doing? We're going to be two guys stuck in Vegas. We have no
*  money. We can't go west because you're going to get pinched. We have no money to go east. What
*  the hell are we going to do? We're going to wind up in Vegas. So, you know, that, that was kind of
*  a profound thing where you just, it's a turning, it potentially could have been a turning point in
*  our lives had we not made enough money to continue going east.
*  That's the beautiful thing about road trips. When you're broke is like in retrospect, everything
*  turned out fine, but you're facing the complete darkness, the uncertainty of the possibilities
*  laid before you. And like, I don't know if you were confident at that time, but like I was
*  really full of self doubt, like just like all I could see is all the trajectories where you
*  just screw up your life. Like, what am I doing with my life? I'm a failure. Like all these dreams
*  I've had, I've never realized I'm a complete piece of shit. All those kinds of things.
*  I had no concept of consequence. I like, I was, I probably had toxoplasmosis.
*  I had literally no concept of consequence. Immediate gratification was all I cared about.
*  Oh, so existentialist.
*  Yeah. It did not, it did not even enter my mind at, in my like early twenties that anything that
*  I was doing at that point could reverberate for the rest of my life. I think part of me didn't
*  even think I'd make it this far. And so I was not interested in like the long play. I remember
*  thinking like, why should I be acting now in a way that might impact a point in my life? I never
*  reach. And yet now you are a man who searches for meaning in life, at least I would say, to put
*  another way, you have, you think deeply about this world and in a philosophical context,
*  while also appreciating the violence of hurting other friends of yours, right? On a regular basis.
*  So what, why do you think, I mean, maybe there's a broader question there, but also a personal
*  question. It seems that people who fight for prolonged periods of time, like Jiu Jitsu people
*  and mixed martial arts people, even military folks become over time philosophers. What is that? Is
*  that, is there a parallel between fighting and violence and the philosophical depth with which
*  you now have arrived from the starting point of being the full existentialist of like,
*  just living in the moment to like being introspective human now?
*  I would say to that being a soldier or a warrior, hundreds of years ago,
*  is probably what started the marriage between martial arts and philosophy. If you're constantly
*  under someone else's charge and you're told to go out and walk in a line and, you know, overtake
*  some Germanic tribe somewhere and that happens all the time. Your job is being a soldier.
*  On any given day, you might not come home. So I think that you have to start your day by thinking
*  deeply about how you've lived to that point and the people that are living in and around you
*  and how you've treated them. And I think that probably is what started the marriage of being
*  kind of like a philosophical martial artist. You've got to really like, on a daily basis,
*  take stock of what's going on around you and inside you because we all suffer with this kind of
*  idea. If today's my last day, did I do it right? And we don't really do it so much nowadays because
*  we're so comfortable. But if we're being marched out to war every day, I think you'd see people
*  live a little bit differently. You know, and you treat the people around you a little bit differently.
*  Do you think there's echoes of that in just even the sport of like grappling and jiu-jitsu where
*  you're facing your own mortality? We don't really think of it that way, but...
*  To be honest, I think that a lot of people that train in a martial art
*  in contemporary society, I don't consider them all martial artists. I think just because you train
*  in martial art does not mean you're a martial artist. There are so many people that use
*  martial arts as a form of exercise and like this little piece of self-concept. They use martial
*  arts as a tagline in their Instagram bio. And it's really a form of exercise. It's something they do.
*  It's not something they are. And I think there's a big difference there.
*  There's a bunch of stuff mixed up in there because the Instagram thing is something you do for...
*  It's also, it could be something you are for display versus who you are in the private moments
*  of searching and thinking and struggling and all that kind of stuff. Instagram is a surface layer
*  that much of modern society operates in, which is really problematic because there's that gap
*  between the person you show to the world and the person you are in private life. And if you make
*  the majority of your project, of the human project of your few years on this earth,
*  the optimization of the public Instagram profile, then you never develop this private person.
*  But it does seem that if you do Jiu Jitsu long enough, it's very difficult not to fall into like
*  this has become a personal journey, an intellectual journey. Because if you get your ass kicked
*  thousands of times, there's a certain point to where that... Maybe it's like a defense mechanism,
*  but that turns into some kind of deeply profound introspective experience versus like exercise.
*  That's true.
*  Yeah. So let me go back first and address the Instagram point, which I think there's a
*  difference between people whose Instagram is intrinsically tied to their profession
*  and they have to put a specific profile out there. And I think in general,
*  people who truthfully are their businesses tied to their Instagram profile, I want to exclude them.
*  I think that most people, Instagram is how they want to be seen. And that's not always congruent
*  with who you are, but I think there is a level of dishonesty there. Like this is how I want people
*  to see me. I'm going to put all this stuff in my Instagram bio, but that's really not me.
*  And when you do that, I think it's a little disingenuous. And you're right. You're never
*  really going to marry those two things together and it gets tough.
*  Sorry to interrupt. Let me push back on something. This is a good time to address
*  the many flaws of the great and powerful John Clark. Okay. Let's go there because it's
*  interesting. You strive so hard for excellence in your life and for extreme competence that you are
*  visibly and physically off put by people who have not achieved competence.
*  Do you think we should be nicer to the people who are those early, like you mentioned,
*  a person who first picks up an art, picks up, becomes vegan, starts doing cross-fists,
*  start doing jiu-jitsu for the first time and create that as their, you know, they're struggling
*  through this, like, who am I? And they're really overly proud and it's kind of ridiculous. And you
*  in your wise chair have seen many battles. Yeah. That you see the ridiculousness of that. I tend to,
*  I'm learning to give those folks, not to mock them and to sort of give them a chance to do
*  their ridiculousness because I think I was that too. Let me first clarify. I want to be clear
*  about what you mean when you say a level of competence. Now I, I've never won a world
*  championship. I've never, you know, there are plenty of things in my life where I've not achieved
*  what most people would consider to be the penultimate level of success. Now-
*  That's accomplishments.
*  It's accomplishments. It's ribbons. It's things like that. And it's not that those things don't
*  mean anything to me. And the fact that I haven't in some arenas is something that I want to change,
*  which is, we can talk about that in a second. But I think that there's a difference between
*  the very eager noob of whatever it is they're doing, who does the thing so that they can
*  signal they do the thing. That's the person I have less respect for.
*  So we know each other primarily through jujitsu. Look at a jujitsu tournament.
*  There's this, there's this idea that people espouse online. I respect anyone with the guts
*  to get on the mat and put it on the line and sign up for a tournament. That is the biggest load of
*  shit I have ever heard. This is great. Do you know, do you know how easy it is for you to put your
*  name on something and pay the registration fee and walk in there? That's not the hard part.
*  That's the easiest part. I don't care if you lose your first match, but I respect the person
*  who signs up for the tournament, registers for the tournament, goes on a diet, loses weight the
*  right way, trains their ass off and does the things properly and then goes on the mat.
*  The person who simply signs their name on the registration form and jumps on the mat,
*  if they haven't done these other things, they actually have nothing to lose.
*  Because what they've done is they've stepped onto the mat in the ring in the cage with a bucket
*  full of excuses. Yeah. Sure you signed up, but when you, but you, you're not really vulnerable
*  because you didn't run, you didn't do this, you didn't do all the things you're supposed to do.
*  The person who eliminates every possible excuse and then steps on the mat and gets their ass
*  kicked in the first round. I have so much more respect for that person than the person who does
*  nothing and maybe on natural ability wins a couple of matches and then, you know, writes on Facebook
*  on how I lost to the eventual champion. That's worth zero. That's worth zero. And in that process,
*  what did you learn about yourself? You learned about yourself that you've got a natural level
*  of aptitude for whatever this activity is that you're doing, but you didn't actually learn how
*  to maximize it through training and through dedication and through all these other things.
*  I'm an incredibly interested, novice musician. I love, I like to play bass, but I don't put that
*  on anything and you know, I stink at it. I would really love to be sick at it. I'm currently not,
*  but like I'm not running around, you know, talking about entering, you know, any of those other
*  things. Like I do it, it's for myself and I want to, I want to reach a level of competence in that.
*  So the person that you have respect for is a person who takes it fully seriously, takes,
*  takes the effort fully seriously. So for bass, that would be that you agree with yourself,
*  that you're going to perform live and just in your own private moments, your private thoughts,
*  you're not going to give yourself an excuse out. Like I'm just going to have fun. This is a nice
*  experience. You're going to, you're going to think I'm going to try to be the best possible
*  bass player given, given everything that's going on in my life, but I'm going to do my like,
*  actually, and put it all on the line. And if I fail that, that's not because I didn't try,
*  it's because I'm a failure. Exactly. And then, and then sit in that sick feeling of like,
*  I'm a failure, but isn't that an important thing to know? Absolutely. But there, there's a,
*  there's a, that's like the best thing we could be, but sometimes it's fun to lose yourself in the,
*  in the, in the bragging in the, in the lesser ways of life. And I think I'm careful not to,
*  because too many people in my life, when I brought them with like a little candle of a fire of a
*  dream, they would just go like, you know, they would just blow that fire out, that they would
*  dismiss me because they see like, you know, I would say, I've said, I've said a lot of ridiculous
*  stuff, but the one, you know, I've always dreamed about, like putting up, I always dreamed of
*  having this world full of robots. And, you know, every time I would bring these ideas up,
*  they'll be shut down by the different people, by my parents, by, you know, you know, that you need
*  to first get to get an education. You need to succeed in these dimensions in order to do all
*  these things. You have to get good grades. You have to, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like there's all the
*  stuff that it's indirect or direct ways of blowing out that little ridiculous dream that you present.
*  And it's like, you know, I remember sort of bringing up, I don't know,
*  things like becoming a state champion in wrestling, right?
*  It's a, it's a weird dance because of course the coaches will tell, they'll kind of dismiss that.
*  It's like, okay, okay. But at the same time, it feels like in those early days, you have to preserve
*  that little, little fire. That's like Johnny Ive. I don't know if you know who that is,
*  is a designer at Apple. He was a chief designer. He's behind most iPhone, all that stuff. And he
*  always talked about that he wouldn't bring his ideas to Steve Jobs until they were matured
*  because he would always shit on them. He would, he wanted them to like little, as little babies,
*  like live for a little bit before they get completely shut down. And I always think about
*  that when I see a beginner sort of bragging on Instagram, you have to be careful. Let,
*  let them play with that little dream. You know,
*  Are you playing with a little dream that you're nurturing and you're trying to take that little
*  flame and you're trying to create a roaring blaze with it? Or are you playing with the idea of it?
*  And behind, behind that, there's no substance.
*  It's hard to know the difference. That's why I struggle with it.
*  I don't think it necessarily is. Certainly you're wrong. And when I say Instagram,
*  I don't want to impugn a bunch of strangers, but I have a gym with a lot of members.
*  And I can tell you that the number of years I've been in the gym, when someone comes to me and
*  says, this is my goal, I don't, I don't tell them yes or no in general, but I know I can tell by
*  the way they say it to me, I can thin slice it. I've seen the look on people's faces. And when
*  people start to like say they want to do X, Y, and Z, I know right off the bat, this person's
*  either going to put an effort in or they're not going to put an effort in. So to me, it's about
*  the effort behind that. If you're busting your ass and you're a new at something and you're brand new,
*  but you're working really hard and you have a series of like moderate successes in that,
*  like that's the guy I want to champion because that persistence and that grit over time,
*  those successes will no longer be moderate. They'll be huge.
*  But the person who's having moderate success by doing nothing, chances are they'll never learn to
*  put that work in and the successes will never grow. You have an admiration for Mike Tyson.
*  I love him. I was going to let that sit for a brief moment. Why?
*  I think there's a combination of factors. One is like the timeliness of his career and like the age
*  I was when he came to prominence, the raw, brutal violence and the raw brutal honesty when he
*  speaks. I think it's easy for people to hear him or see his life and cast him aside as some simian-esque,
*  like just Cretan scourge on society. But when you hear him speak, like this is not a guy who's
*  unintelligent. This is a guy who knows himself better than probably most of us know ourselves.
*  It's disarming and you know, that's a humongous part of my admiration for him.
*  Who is Mike Tyson? Because it feels like there's similarities between him and you.
*  It feels like there's a violent person in there, but also a really kind person. They're all like
*  living together in a little house and you're the same. There's a thoughtful person, but there's
*  also a scary, violent person and they're like having a picnic. They're having a picnic. I think
*  there are dialectical tensions in everyone, these like opposing forces that are constantly
*  pulling at you and at different points in your life, like it's sliding scale.
*  I think that certainly when I was a younger person, there was a lot more manifestation of
*  the violence and a lot less of the kindness. People who were not as close to me probably saw
*  more of the violent side and only the very close people to me saw like what would pass for the kind
*  side and now that's sliding in the other direction. I worry actually sometimes that
*  there could be a situation where I need that old version of me and he's getting further and further
*  away and I can't call him up if I need him and that concerns me to a certain degree.
*  The sad aging warrior seeing his greater self fade away, but you still compete.
*  Does that person return? It seems like for Mike Tyson, that person returned
*  at the prospect of competition. It returns, but I've learned better how to manifest it in competition
*  in terms of like the effects that that type of emotion has on you physically in the middle of a
*  competition. So I've better learned how to utilize that energy. But I think another side effect of
*  this is like having a gym where you're a bigger guy and you're the head instructor. You can't be
*  as mean and violent as you once were because you're also now trying to run a business.
*  You spend so many years trying not to be mean and to soften your technique a little bit that
*  that all of a sudden just becomes who you are. I don't necessarily like that. So I've been trying
*  to reclaim that a little bit on the mat. But I think in competition, there has to be
*  an athlete who really wants to score the points. A fighter really wants to incapacitate you and
*  put you in a position where they can do their own bidding. And the result in a Jiu-Jitsu match might
*  just still be two points, but the motivations are very, very different. What do you make of
*  Tyson and Joe Rogan saying that he was aroused by violence? Do you think that's insane? Do you think
*  that's deeply honest for him? And do you think that rings true for many of us others who practice
*  this in different degrees? I can't speak for a lot of people. And I think that it was a brutally
*  honest statement by him. And I think it's something that even if a lot of people feel it, they're not
*  that comfortable admitting it or saying it. But I think there's great joy in landing a flush right
*  hand on someone's jaw and then watching them crumble. You don't even feel it. You ever play
*  baseball as a kid? You can hit a base hit off the end of the bat and it will sting your hands
*  because of the way that you hit it. You can hit a home run and you won't feel anything. And it'll
*  just feel so good in your hands. And that's, I think, like one of the joys of physical contact.
*  When you do it the right way, and that goes for all physical contact. When you do it the right way,
*  the physical pleasure you can derive from it and the mental pleasure, it's unparalleled.
*  But that's different. Let me draw a distinction. I've had the fortune of being a wrestler.
*  And I would draw a distinction between a very well executed and competition
*  double leg, single leg takedown or a pin. As an OCD person, there's something so comforting about
*  a well executed pin because it's like two seconds and it's just like everything is flush and nice
*  like it's all clean. I mean, okay, as this OCD person who likes to align show,
*  it's just beautiful. Okay. That's good technique. Wrestling also provides you,
*  maybe more than other sports, the feeling of dominating another human. Yes. Of breaking,
*  no, not just of them being very cocky and very powerful. You feel this power of another human
*  being and then you breaking them. And like, I'm not as honest as Mike Tyson, but that's that.
*  I don't think I've ever sort of looked in the mirror and said, like that that was,
*  I enjoyed that aspect of it, but it certainly seems like you chase that.
*  So when I was a wrestler in high school, I lost so many matches because of overaggressiveness.
*  Like, I would pick the top position and let you stand just so that I could do a mat return.
*  And I wasn't trying to return you to the mat. I was actually trying to drive you through the
*  mat and through the ground. It gave me joy to do that. It wasn't like I was trying to
*  just return you to the mat so that I could pin you. What you just talked about,
*  like the dominating another person, I used to look at that as you've got someone who in theory is
*  equally trained and equally skilled as you are. And you're absolutely out there totally dominating
*  them. There's joy in that. You could get in an MMA fight and you could take someone down and you
*  can mount them and all that feels great. But when you start raining down the punches on their face
*  from mount and like dropping elbows and stuff, like there's another level of satisfaction there.
*  And it's tough to describe. And I don't think that everyone is made for it. When I was a,
*  I think when I was a senior in high school, my wrestling coach said, look, you've got to stop
*  with all this crazy aggressive wrestling. Like they tried to turn me into a technician. And
*  it did work to a degree. And it was a humongous shift for me in terms of success. But it wasn't
*  the same level of enjoyment out of it. Like, I mean, I got disqualified from New England
*  because my coach said cross face and I cross face and he said harder. And I basically wound up and
*  blasted a kid in the face and his nose got busted everywhere. But I didn't think not to do it because
*  that felt good. It felt good to cross face him like that. I was, I was a lot of like,
*  that's a weird American warrior ethos that I've picked up. But I also have in me the,
*  the Russian, the city of brothers that don't see it, don't see it as that they don't get draw.
*  They think that there is a tension between the art of the martial art and the violence of the
*  martial art is a poetic way I could put it, but they're not so fascinated with this Dan Gable
*  dominating another human. They think of the effortless, the effortlessness of the
*  technique and your mastery of the art is exhibited in its effortlessness, how much you lose yourself
*  in the moment and the timing that just the beauty of a timing. Like there's much more,
*  like one example in Judo, but also in wrestling, you can look at the foot sweep.
*  Uh, wrestlers in America and even Judo players in America, much of the world don't admire the
*  beauty of the foot sweep, but a well-timed foot sweep, which is a way to sort of off balance,
*  to find the right timing, to just effortlessly, uh, change the tape, turn the tables of, uh,
*  and dominate your opponent is, is seen as the highest form of mastery in, in Russian wrestling
*  in a case of judo, it's in, in Japanese Judo. It's interesting. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what,
*  what that tension is about. I think it actually takes me back to, I don't know, if you listen to
*  Dan Carl in hardcore history and Genghis Khan, if you've ever, I've read a great, great book
*  on Genghis Khan. Um, I'm so, I'm still trying to adjust. I've most of my life said Genghis Khan,
*  but, uh, the right pronunciation is, uh, actually Genghis Khan.
*  There's a tension there. We kind of think, I don't know, we, I kind of thought as Genghis Khan is a
*  ultra violent, a leader of ultra violent men, but another view, another way to see them is the
*  people who warriors that
*  valued extreme competence and mastery of the art of, uh, fighting with weapons, with bows, with
*  horse riding, all that kind of stuff. And I'm not sure exactly where to place them on my sort of
*  thinking about violence in our human history. I think in the context of like a combat sports,
*  I think there's a difference between an athlete winning a contest under a certain set of rules
*  and a fighter winning a fight under those exact same rules. There's a different approach to it.
*  And I don't think one is any better than the other. Um, like in MMA, I think a great example
*  would be George St. Pierre. George St. Pierre is a tremendous, it's a tremendous athlete and he
*  considers himself to be a martial artist first. He's trying to win an athletic competition.
*  Like Nick Diaz is trying to bust your ass, right? There's a different approach to it.
*  And yes, they've had different results at the highest level of competition,
*  but it's difficult to attribute the difference in results just to their approach to the sport
*  because they're different human beings with different abilities and different, different,
*  uh, physical attributes. Um, the Scytia brothers have that luxury of being able to talk about the
*  beauty of a perfectly timed slide by, right? There are other wrestlers that will never be
*  able to pull that off and therefore they have to pursue other ways to defeat someone. And maybe it
*  is the Dan Gable breaking a man's spirit by outworking him type thing, which is beautiful
*  in its own way. Uh, but we, we, we tend to self-select the ways in which we're able to be
*  successful and then kind of take a deep dive into that. What do you think is more beautiful,
*  brute force or effortless execution of a technique that dominates another human?
*  I think it's a subjective thing based on what skills you perceive yourself to have. I'm never,
*  I've never been a slick, uh, super athletic dexterous competitor in anything. And I've
*  always been more of an, I've got to outwork you, I've got to outgrind you, I got to out mean you.
*  And so because I've lived that, I tend to see the beauty in that more because I have a perceptual
*  awareness that I don't have for the people who have the luxury of being very slick and athletic
*  and, and, and using beautiful technique. Now that said, there's a phenomenal little video the other
*  day. I sent a friend of a compilation of foot sweeps by Leota Machida in MMA, and they're so
*  beautiful and they're so awesome. And it's not that I don't have an appreciation for those,
*  but I can't emulate those because I lack the physical ability to do that. Whereas I,
*  I at least have a chance to emulate some of the people who do it through grit and through out
*  working people. But I would love to, uh, return to Genghis Khan and get your thoughts about,
*  like, I have so many mixed feelings about whether he is evil or not, whether
*  the violence that he brought to the world had ultimately, the fact that it had maybe
*  kind of, uh, like Dan Carlin describes, cleanse the landscape. It's like a reset for the world
*  through violence had ultimately
*  a progressive effect on human civilization, even though in the short term it led to massive,
*  you could say suffering. I don't know what to make of that man. What are your thoughts on
*  Genghis Khan? Um, I think it's always difficult to look at a historical figure and their actions of
*  their time through a modern day lens, because it's very, it's easy for us to, um, kind of,
*  you know, impugn their achievements and the things that they did and say, oh, well, you know,
*  what he did was wrong. Well, of course that can be true, but a lot of times we don't actually
*  have any real good context or concept of the, the times they were living in and what really
*  was deemed wrong and what really wasn't. We're looking at it through a very cushy modern lens.
*  That being said, from what I've read about Genghis Khan, uh, yeah, he was a violent dude,
*  but also he gave you an option. He, when he, when he got to a village, he said, look,
*  I'm going to, we're going to, you have a choice. You can come with us or you can run. And you know,
*  he gave them an option to join, uh, his Legion of fighters who he took very good care of. You know,
*  he was the first military leader, uh, to pay his soldiers families when they died. And he did that
*  based on the booty that they got when they raided a village. He took that money. He took his share
*  and they divided that up amongst the soldiers and then the soldiers families. I think he also is
*  credited with, uh, first like horseback mail routes or something like that. Right. Isn't he
*  the godfather of modern postal system or something, something like that? Yeah. He's
*  the Bernie Sanders of the, uh, of the Mongol empire. I do think the, the offering of surrender
*  is an interesting one because, um, it's interesting, like as a thought experiment,
*  whether you would sacrifice your way of like the pride of nations or the nationalism, pride of
*  your country, whether you're willing to give that up, uh, for, uh, you know, to survive.
*  It depends on who depends on you. If you have a, if you have a family and like young kids and stuff
*  like that, I think your, your obligation is primarily to them. And therefore surrender has
*  to be something that you consider in that, in that moment in time so that you can take care of those
*  people. If you're a man alone and you've got like all these principles and all this other stuff,
*  and you just don't, you, you're not down with what Jan Giscon is doing and what he's selling.
*  Yeah. Try and escape, do your thing and just know that, you know, what waits on the other side of
*  that for you potentially. But I think if there's someone else out there that depends on you,
*  your obligation should be to them. It feels like historically people valued principles more than
*  life in this weight of like, what do I value more? The principles I hold versus survival.
*  It seems that now we don't value principles as much that you principles could be also religion.
*  It could be your values, whatever. We're okay. Sort of sacrificing those for, to preserve our
*  survival. And that applies in all forms, like actual survival or like on social media, like
*  preserving your reputation, all those kinds of things. It seems like we,
*  and especially in America value individual
*  life, that death is somehow a really bad thing as opposed to saying, sacrificing your principles
*  is a very bad thing and everybody dies and it's okay to die as what's horrible is to sacrifice
*  your principles of who you are just to live another day. I think a big problem is people
*  don't really even know what their principles are anymore. Social media and just the way that we
*  live nowadays where we're separated from the human contact like this, like we're not,
*  you're not contacting people in a community anymore. You're not, whether you're religious
*  or not, like you're not congregating at a church. You're not part of a parish like you would be
*  like in, you know, down south, you're not part of that community anymore. And so
*  it's difficult to figure out what your principles and values are because you're constantly jumping
*  from one bucket to the next online and you don't get a lot of like direct, like reasonable feedback
*  from people. You just get dipshit feedback. Like, Oh, you don't believe this? Well, you're a jerk.
*  I think the hard thing currently is having the integrity and character to stick by your
*  principles when under, I don't want to equate murder of in the Genghis Khan times to social media,
*  cancel culture, but it certainly doesn't feel good when people are attacking on social media.
*  And it does take a lot of integrity to, without anger, without emotion, without being,
*  without mocking others or attacking others unfairly, standing by the ideas you hold,
*  or in another way, standing by your friends, standing by this little group, like loyalty of
*  the people that you know are good people. I find that in cancel culture, one of the sad things
*  is whenever somebody gets quote unquote canceled, everybody just gets all their friends become
*  really quiet and don't defend them or worse. I mean, quiet is at least understandable.
*  They kind of signal that they throw them out of the bus, I guess, is one way to put it. And
*  that's something I think about a lot because from coming from me, it's like,
*  I hold an ethic. I don't know if others hold this ethic, maybe this like Russian
*  mobster ethic of like, you should help your friends bury the body. You shouldn't criticize
*  your friends for committing the murder. Like there are certain levels of like,
*  you know, yeah, you have that discussion after you buried the body that like, maybe you shouldn't
*  have done that murder thing. I don't know. You know, I understand that that's a problematic,
*  with the terminology, that's a problematic ethical framework within which to operate.
*  But at the same time, it feels like what else do we have in this world except the brotherhood,
*  the sisterhood, the love we have for a very small community. But perhaps that's the wrong way of
*  thinking. Perhaps the 21st century would be defined by the dissipation of this community,
*  of this loyalty concept. We're all just individuals.
*  TG No, I think you're right. And I think you have to have some sort of core framework of
*  principles and beliefs that you operate on. And I think what I was referencing is a little bit
*  different. But to speak to your point, you need a framework of core principles on which you can then
*  base a lot of your other decisions. Like I believe these three things to be true,
*  whatever they are, and that will help inform other decisions you make in your life.
*  As far as how you treat your friends, I've got probably three friends that,
*  if they called me right now and said, let's bury the body. Sorry, Lex, I gotta go.
*  There are other people in my life that if they said, hey, we've got to go bury the body,
*  I would say, who is this? You know, so I think it depends on the relationship.
*  That's a really good measure. I would love that to be in your profile. People put like pronouns.
*  I would love to put like, honestly, like objectively, not self-report, but objective,
*  how many people in your life, if they committed murder, you would not ask any questions and you
*  would help them hide the body. I would love to know that number for people.
*  TG Yeah. And I think it's a weird thing too, because you think right away, like, okay,
*  it must be the group of people that are the closest to you. That's who you're first thinking
*  of, right? But obviously for like my best friend, I would do it, no question about it. But I've got
*  other people that are close to me that are close to me in other ways. And I probably wouldn't do
*  that only because I don't think they do it for me. And that is a consideration. So I guess,
*  is the principle there then that you do for your friends what you think they would do for you?
*  Is that the underlying principle or do you just have a blind loyalty to, you know,
*  people in your life for different reasons? I got people that are not on my inner circle
*  that I probably wouldn't help change a tire at two in the morning if they're on the highway.
*  But if they called me and said, Hey, we got to bury the body. I might show up for that.
*  It's just these weird different connections. TG Yeah. It's fascinating. Yeah. I have a
*  close friends that like, I probably be exactly the tires. A good example would be like,
*  can't you find somebody else to do this? I think part of that is just this leap of faith into
*  like giving yourself to the other person that creates a deep connection that makes life
*  fulfilling, like meaningful that doesn't exist if you don't take that leap. I mean,
*  it's not about the murder. We're sort of focusing. I think that's a, I think you have to, what is it,
*  cross that bridge when you get there? I'm not exactly sure. This is just the thought experiment,
*  but it's, it's, I think about that a lot, especially these COVID times. And as like
*  people become more and more isolated and separated from each other, like how important is it to have
*  those deep, deep connections to other humans? TG I think especially like what you're talking
*  about there. Have you ever seen the movie, the town? There's a great line in the movie where
*  one of the main characters walks into his friend's house and he says,
*  I need your help. We're going to go hurt some people and you can never ask me about it again.
*  And the friend looks up and he says, whose car are we taking? Like that, that is the type of person
*  you need in your life. And the people, like there are people that will walk through that door and
*  say that to you and you drop everything you're doing. And then there's the people that walk
*  through your door and you're like, you know what? I got a hot pocket in the microwave. I'm a little
*  bit, I'm a little bit tied up right now, but I'd love to help you out. But you know, I don't want
*  to do that. And you don't have that, that deep connection in those people. TG You mentioned some
*  principles that you've changed your mind on. Is there, do you want to go there? Is there some
*  interesting principles and the process of changing that is useful to talk about? TG I can't really
*  cite a specific thing except that understanding that the principles that you have at different
*  points in your life can change. And it's okay to change them without being a total pussy and being
*  bullied by other people into thinking what you thought was wrong. If you come to these conclusions
*  of your own volition and you decide to change them, that's great. And it can be really,
*  it can be really liberating. It's really liberating to have an idea that you hold so true to your,
*  your core belief system. And then to actually have someone change your mind for you and be okay with
*  it, as opposed to being like, no, I got to die with this. I got to die with this. It's really
*  liberating. There are definitely our ideas. You want to die on that Hill and no one's ever going
*  to change your mind, but it's really liberating to be confident enough to say, change my mind.
*  I'm lucky enough to have some smart motherfuckers around me who can tell me,
*  listen, you're being a total dipshit. Like let's, let's rethink this. Or like I have one friend who
*  does the five wise all the time and he loves backing me into a corner. And what's the five wise,
*  you just like when someone makes a statement about something to really get to the core issue,
*  they say, if you ask why five times, make a statement, well, why is that? And you answer
*  that, well, why? And you phrase the wise differently, obviously, but then you get to the core. They say
*  five times, you can get to the core of the issue. And that's a challenging thing. But I find later
*  in life, it's so liberating for me to be confident enough to be like, man, was I fucking way off the
*  mark on this and have my mind changed and be able to say that to others that I was wrong.
*  Totally that ability. And I never used to have that. And it's, it feels real good.
*  And there's a hunger for that too. Um, yeah, you're so right. Actually on a personal level,
*  it feels very good. Exactly. As you said, it's liberating because you're free to then think as
*  opposed to defend. Yeah. Without thinking. Yeah. You get so sick of defending the same thing over
*  and over and over and you start to think about it. And it's like, well, I would really like to evolve
*  my thought process here. And when you're constantly defending, you know, one point, it's difficult to
*  let other ideas in you, you, you discount the possibility that you can have your mind change
*  when you're constantly on the defense. You have to have a crack in the front line in order to let
*  a new idea come in and possibly flourish. And maybe the new idea doesn't even prove your current
*  belief system to be wrong, but maybe it's like the, the water to a seed and it grows and now it's
*  something even bigger and better. And you can, you can start to work with that instead. And it's a,
*  it's a tough thing because I'm a stubborn fuck and it's very difficult for me. It was historically
*  to say I was wrong about this one or I messed this one up or, yeah, I wish I could have that one back.
*  There's a public figure for me thing too, which there is, there's a difference between changing
*  your mind with a small circle of friends and changing your mind publicly about something,
*  but it has equal one echoes the other. It is equally liberating, but people,
*  um, people will not make that change easy, but it doesn't matter. That's the, that's the point. It
*  doesn't, I think it's ultimately liberating as a human being public figure or not to, uh, to think
*  deeply about this world and to keep changing, which is like, I think there's a deep hunger for that
*  in like political discourse that people are so tribal currently about politics that they're
*  wanting to see somebody who says, you know what, I changed my mind on this
*  and then keep changing their mind and keep asking questions, keep showing that they're open minded,
*  all that kind of stuff. But you want someone in a position of political power to change their mind
*  because they realize that there might be a better way, not because they realize that by changing
*  their mind, they're going to get a new demographic to vote for them. That's transparent as shit.
*  Nobody wants to see that. Like that's, that's a person who can't separate their, their position
*  from their people. They're supposed to be helped. Yeah. And you can usually smell that. That's,
*  we're just talking, uh, offline about, uh, there's something about Hillary Clinton,
*  which she talked about changing her mind on gay marriage that it felt like this is a political
*  calculation versus like really deeply thinking about like what, you know, what things do we do
*  in this world that violate basic human rights, like really thinking about deeply and, you know,
*  of course politicians are calculating this, but you can see it. You, this, this is the thing.
*  That's why I like, um, as on the human level, there's like political policies, but there's also
*  humans and I've always liked Bernie Sanders, for example. I don't know, not the later, perhaps
*  Bernie Sanders, but I used to listen to him back in the day and there were, it felt that people might
*  disagree with me, but it, it felt like there was a real human struggling with ideas, whatever agree
*  with him or not. It felt like he wasn't doing political calculation. He was just a human.
*  He couldn't be further away from my political ideals, but also like there's an obvious
*  authenticity to his passion for what he's saying that is not present in other candidates. And you
*  could see it. All these people that have been in politics forever, like from all the way back
*  when Hillary was a lawyer in the seventies, there's a couple of shots of her in a courtroom
*  in the seventies though. She's looking all right. She's got those big glasses on kind of a little
*  bit of a nerdy babe back in the day. Oh, you mean like, yeah. Well, John Clark says Hillary Clinton
*  was a baby back in the day. 73 Clinton. Yeah. Uh, that's an interesting question about
*  authenticity and politicians. Do you think like, uh, Hillary Clinton, just the Clintons are in
*  general, are a good example that why do you think they become over time? So inauthentic,
*  is it the system that changes them? Is that their own hunger for power? Is it, uh, what is it? Or
*  they, or are they always inauthentic? Well, first I'd like to say that, I don't know if you know
*  this, but I come from a bit of a political dynasty myself. Uh, I was on the student government several
*  times in high school and my dad won, um, the runoff in a special election in Bradenton beach,
*  Florida. I think there's like 700 people there. So your dad got you the job. Yeah. We're basically,
*  a lot of people compare us to the Kennedys. My guess with the politicians is that, and you can,
*  you can see it now as we're becoming more like cognizant as people to the political process.
*  I think the process corrupts people. And I think that I don't know the ins and outs of it. I've
*  listened to people who are far more educated on it than me. And I, and I'm unprepared to cite any
*  of their points. I think you can see it a little bit in Dan Crenshaw. Can I say this? Yeah. So
*  I like him. I really liked Dan, especially like a year, year and a half ago. He seemed very level
*  headed. It's clear to me now that as he panders more and more to the right, it's because he's
*  setting himself up for a presidential run. It's clear that that's happening. And he just doesn't
*  seem like the same authentic ideals oriented guy that he did a year and a half ago. Now I could be
*  wrong on that. It could be way off, but I think that you can take someone as honest as you want to.
*  When you start them on that path to the presidency, you become so unbelievably beholden to so many
*  people and entities along the way that by the time you get to the final destination, the Oval Office,
*  all you're doing is paying back the favors that got you there. And you never get to serve the
*  people you're supposed to serve. Your primary focus is on your office and not on the people
*  that you're supposed to be helping. And I think that that's a humongous problem. And like, we could
*  talk all about campaign finance reform and the two party system, but at the end of the day,
*  the people who are running for political posts, they're working to keep a job. They're not working
*  to improve the lives of the constituents, which is different. A long, long time ago,
*  like a lot of politicians, like those were like part-time jobs, you know, and they were,
*  they held other posts and, you know, out west, they were ranchers by day and sheriff by night,
*  whatever the case might be. But now, you know, such a cushy path for the rest of your life,
*  that the goal is to just be a politician, not do the things that you think a politician is
*  supposed to do. And that's a problem. By the way, I'll talk to Dan on this. It's funny,
*  I like the version of him from a year ago and I haven't been really paying attention. So I'll be,
*  I'll actually pay more attention now and ask him that exact question. Like, how do you prevent
*  yourself from changing, becoming what the Clintons became? I tend to believe like there's
*  conspiratorial stuff about Clintons and all these politicians. I tend to believe that they were
*  actually good, thoughtful people back in the day. And the system changes them. It's not even the
*  system. There's something about just the process of campaigning. I just think it wears you down to
*  where if you look at the percentage of time you spend on the kinds of conversations you have,
*  it's like, one, you do these speeches, which you repeat the same thing over and over and over. It
*  beats the, the process of thinking, you just exhaust your brain to where you're not thinking
*  anymore. You're just repeating. It's very, it's exceptionally difficult to keep making speech
*  after speech after speech, saying the same thing over and over and over again. And at the same time,
*  thinking deeply and changing your mind and learning. And then also the pandering to financial,
*  like having phone calls, like fundraising, all those kinds of things. That's what they do now.
*  They spend most of their time fundraising. They're not worried about anything. Sorry to interrupt
*  you, but I was going to say that you can see there's a fuel like the, the more attention and
*  the higher regard you're held in, in your community and the more sycophants,
*  like continue to blow smoke up your ass, the more it changes the way you present yourself.
*  And you can see it in every walk of life. I mean, jujitsu is a tiny, tiny little section of the world,
*  but you see it in the jujitsu community. When someone all of a sudden starts a social media
*  page or whatever, and they get a bunch of people like basically like, you know, cyber filleting
*  them on their Instagram page, they, they, they changed. Filleting. Is that a word?
*  I think so. So giving a show. Yeah. So filleting. Yeah. Jamie, look it up.
*  I think, but in those people, they, it changes their character. Yeah. It changes who they are
*  because they become emboldened and, and, you know, now they've got this like mythical cyber mob
*  behind them. There's a sign at the entrance to your gym that reads for every moment of triumph.
*  It's a quote by Hunter S Thompson. It reads for every moment of triumph,
*  for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled. What does this quote mean to you?
*  That quote to me is about mostly about sacrifice.
*  And it's about to achieve anything great or anything beautiful or to triumph. You have
*  to have sacrificed so many things to get there unless you're the most unbelievably genetically
*  gifted person in the world. And greatness is just, you know, falls upon you. It's just raining from
*  the sky. I think on your path to greatness, on your path to success and triumph, you leave a lot
*  of carnage in your wake, personal relationships, other goals, things that you didn't pursue,
*  you know, other unfulfilled dreams. And you kind of have to sell a lot of that out in order to be
*  really at the peak of your field or what you want to be.
*  I know that that's happened in my life. I mean, there's tons and tons of relationships that,
*  you know, couldn't survive the way that I was living my life because when I was trying to be a
*  big time fighter or like when I was just training all the time, tons of relationships dissolved
*  themselves naturally, some not so naturally. Some people get it, some people don't get it,
*  some people hate you. You miss tons of other opportunities. And I think that's kind of what
*  that quote means to me. It's about sacrifice. It's about you're giving up what you want now
*  for what you want more. And it's the trampling of souls. It's messy too, because it's not clear what
*  the right path is. Like that sacrifice is not obvious that those are the right sacrifices to
*  make. You might be ruining your own life, but the fact that you're willing to take that risk
*  and sort of go all in on whether it's stupid or not, to go all in on something,
*  the possibility of creating something beautiful is there.
*  Who says it's stupid? If you're going all in on it, you don't think it's stupid.
*  Someone else might think it's stupid, but I mean, who really cares?
*  Well, I'm of many minds on many things. So I feel like there's certain minds,
*  certain moods of the day where you think it's stupid. Like relationships is a beautiful one,
*  which is, you've seen the movie Whiplash by any chance?
*  Yes.
*  It seems like in a man's life, or it could be a woman's, but I don't identify as a woman,
*  so I know the man, the lived experience. But my lived experience for now is that of a man,
*  we'll see about tomorrow. And there is, in the pursuit of excellence, there's often a choice of
*  some of the souls that must be trampled are personal relationships with humans in your life
*  that you might deeply care about. It could be family, it could be friends,
*  it could be loved ones of all different forms. It could be the people that, your colleagues
*  that dependent on you, people who will lose jobs because of the decisions you make,
*  all this kind of stuff. It seems that that moment happens, and I'm not sure
*  I'm not sure that sacrifice is always the correct one. To me, the movie Whiplash,
*  for people who haven't seen the spoiler alert, maybe, I don't even know if that movie has any
*  spoilers, but there is a relationship with a female. There's a student, there's a drummer
*  that's pursuing excellence of this particular art form of drumming. And he has a brief leading
*  relationship with a female, and he also has an instructor that's pushing him to his limits.
*  And what appears to be awfully a lot like a toxic relationship, and he chooses, not chooses,
*  he naturally makes the decision to sacrifice the romantic relationship with the woman in further
*  pursuit of this chaos of this chaotic pursuit of excellence. And it feels that doesn't feel like a
*  deliberate decision. It feels like a giant mess of an emotional mess where you're just like
*  kind of like a fish swimming against stream, just like, fuck it. You let go of all the things that
*  convention says you should appreciate. You throw away the possibility of a stable life,
*  of a comfortable life, of what society says is a meaningful life, and just pursue this crazy thing
*  full of seaming toxicity with crazy people surrounding you. I don't know. So I don't know
*  what the right decision is. Part of my brain says you should stay with the girl, fuck that instructor
*  that's making you, that's pushing you to places where it's like that are destructive, potentially
*  destructive, like could lead to suicide, could lead you to completely fail or fail on your pursuit
*  of excellence or destroy the dream, the passion of pursuit of the thing that you've always dreamed
*  for, in that case is drumming. I don't know. I'm on many minds there. Like what is the right thing
*  to do? So my first two thoughts are, number one, fuck convention. What is convention? It's like
*  some laid out paths, some linear progression of the way your life is supposed to go,
*  like that someone can draw a picture of at the end. That shit's, first of all, it's just boring
*  and whatever. And I don't want to say that it's cowardly because it isn't cowardly,
*  but for someone who's not conventional to not be non-conventional is cowardly to get sucked into
*  the convention. That's first. Second of all, I believe that scene in the diner in that movie
*  where he tells her you're in my way because I'm going to want to be with you or you're going to
*  want me to be going out to dinner with you. And I know I should be practicing or I know I should
*  be training. And ultimately I'm going to make, I'm either going to feel bad about not being with you
*  by training, or I'm going to skip the training to be with you. And neither one is right.
*  The whole thing that they don't mention in that is that that's the wrong girl.
*  That's the wrong girl. The right girl is a gangster. The right girl says, oh, you have
*  practiced tonight. I'll leave you a sandwich and some milk so that you can, you know, outside the
*  door. Let me know when you're done or you have some like free time. Like the right girl complements
*  that. She's not an impediment in any way. Even if what you want to do is be with her so much
*  that you're putting the drums down or you're putting the bass down or you're picking up the
*  pizza or you're not going to training. Like that girl without even telling you why she's making
*  decisions is making decisions to help you achieve your goal. Now that might sound like some sort of
*  like chauvinistic king of the castle type shit, like where everyone should cater to you. But the
*  fact of the matter is, uh, that person is a compliment to your life and helping you do your
*  thing. And in your own way, you're helping them to achieve whatever their goals are also. It's
*  uncommon that you have two people under the same roof striving to be unbelievably excellent in one
*  small area. It's not impossible, but it's uncommon. Like relationships have to be like binary systems,
*  like two stars, like the gravitational pull is what keeps you together and circling around one
*  another. Right. And, and you know, one is bigger than the other and they'll fluctuate and you know,
*  the stars will get bigger and they'll get smaller and they're contract based on positioning and,
*  you know, composition that that's the way a relationship should be. Not an asteroid coming
*  in to disrupt, you know, your, the, the surface of your planet. It's a binary system. It's a
*  compliment. That girl was the wrong girl for him. So you shouldn't, uh, like the big unconventional
*  dreams should not be adjusted to fit into this world. Cause I mean, there is a part of me that's
*  like full of salt. Well, maybe you're just a dick. Maybe, maybe. Who cares? So first of all,
*  who cares? This is a, by the, by the way, somebody who's, uh, you have, uh, you have recently gotten,
*  well, recently in the span of the history of the universe is recently you've gotten to a relationship,
*  but you haven't always, you have not felt the need to be in the relationship just because you're
*  supposed to by society's kind of momentum. If you, I think that if you really want anything,
*  you've got to be prepared fully to be the exact opposite. If you're a person who's looking for a
*  relationship, the only way you're going to get in an awesome relationship is by being comfortable
*  being alone because that's the risk. If you're a person who's driven by money, you've got to be
*  comfortable being totally poor because that's the risk. Right. And when you're, when, when you're,
*  when you're constantly hedging your bets, you're never all in, you're never all in on the thing
*  you're trying to do. Um, a relationship has to compliment your life. You can't say it's okay to
*  want to be in a relationship, but you can't want to be in a relationship so bad that you take someone
*  in who fits the suit. And it's like, Oh, our schedules kind of work out. You live near me and
*  this and that and the other thing, because the logistics of a relationship are not always perfect.
*  It's what matters is when the two people are together, that's the perfect part of it.
*  And it's great to want to meet people and say, if we meet and some sort of a relationship develops,
*  I'm willing to run with it, but I'm not meeting you hoping a relationship develops. I think you
*  kind of put the cart before the horse in a lot of those situations. It's like when guys meet, like
*  no guy goes out and is like, I'm looking for a bro, right? Nobody does that. You go to the gym
*  and you run into a bunch of dudes. And the next thing you know, someone's cool and they want to
*  talk about fighting and you're fucking shotgun and beers. And all of a sudden you got a bro.
*  And that's how it works. It works the same, same way with what's a shotgun and beers. Um,
*  I'll show you after this and we poke a hole in the bottom and you open the top. Yeah. Yeah. It's
*  very, this is the problem with America. Drink vodka like a man. Okay. Now don't poke holes in beers.
*  This is the problem with the frat culture. They don't really know how to drink. They think they
*  know how to drink. They don't know how to drink. What do you think, uh, makes a successful
*  relationship? If it can linger on that a little longer, like, let me ask John Clark about love.
*  I didn't ask a question, but let me just say love
*  about love.
*  Uh, are you one of those people who never says I love you?
*  No, no, I'm an extreme person and, uh, like my emotions are also extreme. And one of the things,
*  uh, I concern myself with, uh, maybe this is philosophical and martial arts warrior
*  soldier type related stuff is like, I don't want anyone to be like, I don't want anyone to be like,
*  I don't want anyone. If I die tonight on the drive home, hopefully that doesn't happen.
*  I hope that no one is left questioning how I felt about them.
*  And people I don't like probably are not questioning that. And so the,
*  the thing that I've had to learn how to do later in life is to tell the people that you care about,
*  that you care about them. And, um, each thing can be equally off putting to the receiver of the message.
*  Each thing can be equally up putting to the receiver of the message.
*  When you're letting someone know how much you dislike them, that can be off putting to the
*  person receiving that message. And we tell someone how much you care about them. It can also be
*  off putting to the person, uh, depending on how they view their relationship with you,
*  but it's still important to get it out there. Like you shouldn't,
*  you shouldn't hold those things in because you're worried about how they'll be received
*  or if they'll come back at you.
*  So you're okay going all in on these.
*  Yeah.
*  Not afraid of commitment.
*  No, I'm not afraid of commitment. Anyone who says they're afraid of commitment is full of
*  shit. You know what they're afraid of? They're afraid of commitment with that person.
*  That's what they're afraid of. Like you don't know when someone knocks your,
*  your knocks you on your ass and they come into your life and you're flush with all these emotions,
*  you're not worried about, Oh, I don't really like commitment. No, because they've knocked
*  you on your ass. You want to be with them. You want those things that the two most alive
*  points in your life. I think people feel as the euphoria of a new relationship
*  and the law and then the loss when that love is gone,
*  you'll never feel more. I don't think then in those, those moments in your life.
*  See the nice thing about the loss is it lasts longer.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a Louis CK point that he makes, which is like, uh,
*  that, that like, uh, he, in his show, I think is a conversation with an older gentleman that says,
*  like, that's his favorite part of the relationship is that period between the loss of the relationship
*  and the real death, which is forgetting the person, but that period lasts the longest.
*  And that's the, like the most fulfilling, like missing the other person is as fulfilling as the
*  actual, like love the, the early infatuation, which is interesting. I also think of the Bukowski.
*  I returned to that. There's a little clip of him in an interview saying that, uh, love is a fog
*  that dissipates with the first light of reality or something like that. So basically emphasizing
*  that it's this very, very, very fleeting thing that it's a, it's a, it's a moment's thing.
*  And then it just fades and everything else is, uh, is something else. So love is only a temporary
*  thing, which is interesting. I think some people say that's cynical. I don't know. I don't know
*  what to think of it. I think it's important to understand that everything is fleeting when you
*  don't put effort into it. Almost everything will be fleeting. If you don't put effort into it,
*  most people will get fat and lazy. If you don't put effort into something, you're going to not be
*  good at, uh, playing guitar or playing bass. You've got to put effort into it. The same thing goes
*  for a relationship that the, the awesome part of it, that like love part that dies soon and early
*  on in a relationship because it's so good that we think we don't have to work at it, but you do,
*  you have to like keep doing the things and you got to keep things new and crisp and fresh. And
*  you know, when you, when you different people probably feel differently about this, but like,
*  I don't know, you walk around your girl and you start like farting and stuff. Like that's when it
*  all dies. That's when it dies. You know, we're all human beings. Well, you know, have, you know,
*  we're all here and our bodies work in the same way, but like you start to chip away at this like
*  beautiful thing when you, when you stop, when you buck conventional courtesy and, and things like
*  that. We'll take it for granted. Basically take it for granted. Yeah. I mean, that's the same thing
*  with life. Uh, it's like, it's the same. I'm a big fan of meditating on death that you could die
*  today in the same way you should meditate on like this relationship could end today. This connection
*  with another human could be, this is the last time you could, uh, you could be interacting.
*  And your, your chances of that increase when you take it for granted and you shit on people,
*  but when you work at it, the chances of that decrease, it's not, it's never going to be zero,
*  but it decreases. And when you do that, when you're the person and you're, you're trying to
*  maintain and you're trying to, you know, work at the relationship, you got to make sure that both
*  people are working at it. Otherwise you're just a fucking chump. Okay. Let's, uh, return back to
*  mixed martial arts. Let me ask the ridiculous question of, uh, who do you think are the top
*  three, maybe top five greatest fighters of all time?
*  It's so hard to compare fighters across generations. And maybe a one way to say it is
*  which metrics would you put on the table as to measure what a great fighter is?
*  There was a guy named Dioxipus
*  in the fourth century. And he was such a bad ass that in the Olympics and three 36 BC, no one even
*  showed up to fight him in the pancreas. Nobody even showed up because he was fucking everybody
*  up years later. He was retired and, uh, this crazy Macedonian dude came there at some dinner for,
*  you know, Alexander the great, everyone's chilling, drinking, you know, whatever they were drinking
*  out of their chalices. And this Macedonian dude came in and he was like, Oh, I'm going to go
*  chalices. And this Macedonian dude threatened him and challenged him. So Dioxipus said, yeah,
*  man, we'll throw it out. And, you know, they set the time and the place. Macedonian dude comes out
*  like body armor, spear, shield, all this other shit. Dioxipus came out absolutely naked with
*  a wooden club and took on this much younger guy, beat the living crap out of them and then put his
*  foot on his throat. Uh, and then didn't even kill him in the show of ultimate power for the time.
*  So I think- There's something about the guy being naked too is just extra demeaning.
*  Extra demeaning. Yeah. Okay. Can we rephrase the question then? Because those are clearly going to
*  be some probably forgotten warriors in history. Well, let's take it to like modern day mixed
*  martial arts in the UFC, perhaps. Well, just mixed martial arts there. Who do you think are the top
*  fighters of all time? What metrics would you consider in, in trying to answer this perhaps
*  unanswerable question? I think one of the things you want to think about is a, uh, uh, strength of
*  opponent at the time you fought them. So for example, fighting BJ Penn in his prime and beating him is
*  far different than beating BJ Penn last year. Right? So to say you have a victory over BJ Penn
*  is not the same given the time frame of when it happened, not to take anything away from anyone
*  who was beaten BJ Penn. Uh, just use that as an example of someone whose career went into a
*  different direction. Yes. I would say the guy who I think is probably the best that people are the
*  least familiar with would be Murillo Bustamante. And I think he was a guy who was one of the guys
*  with the first really good physical build for MMA, which I think is narrow from the chest to the
*  back and long shoulder to shoulder and kind of sinewy made out of steel cable. That was a guy
*  who could box. That was a guy who could wrestle. And that was a guy who had great jujitsu. I wasn't
*  great kick boxer, but at the time he didn't need it, fought everybody and gave everybody a run.
*  I think he's probably one of those guys who's got to be considered. Yeah. There's a few killers
*  that never cause like, why is he not in the discussion? Cause like, I think greatness
*  requires both the skill and the opportunity to meet each other. And when you talk about a fighter,
*  the other thing that really a good fighter needs to become great is a foil. Yeah. And so many
*  fighters don't have a foil. That's one of the biggest attractions. I think of early Mike Tyson's
*  career. He didn't have a foil. He had no one driving him. And by the time he did, by the time
*  he had a foil in Holyfield, his career was in a different place. He's one of the greats all the
*  time. He never really had a foil. So his greatness was in the unparalleled destruction of like nobody
*  as well. Not, you know, uh, of lesser opponents. Right. And so when people, uh, debate the,
*  you know, the level of greatness of Mike Tyson, that's one of the things they say, like he didn't
*  fight a lot of killers in their prime. I think you've obviously got to say in that conversation,
*  I have a really difficult time keeping George St. Pierre out of the conversation. Uh, only because
*  he was able to beat you with anything he could, he could outjab you. He could out wrestle you and
*  he could, he could submit you. The problem I have with Phaidor is his career also took a drastic
*  turn towards the end. And when he was fighting in pride, he was doing a lot more grappling.
*  And then he just started casting that overhand right at people. And his game kind of changed at
*  that point. Uh, you can't take anything away from his greatness, but at that time, the great heavy
*  weights were not really, uh, in fighting in pride and they didn't really exist yet. And by the time
*  he fought a really good one for Brescia over Doom, he did get submitted there. Does, does his later
*  performance color our, your and our perception of his greatness, like in general about fighters,
*  not mine, but I'm someone who's like intimately involved in the sport,
*  but it colors everyone else's same with Anderson Silva. Like I don't think Anderson's doesn't
*  want to fight in like seven years or something, or is it one like that's a guy who in his prime
*  was one of the best fighters. Is he in the top five for you? I think he's probably in the top
*  five. Yeah. Greater striker of all time or no in MMA and mixed martial arts and mixed martial arts.
*  That's a tough question. The greatest MMA striker, cause like the timing, the,
*  we're talking about foot sweeps, right? Who makes it look easier than Anderson Silva?
*  I think in an incredibly short sample of his prime, it's gotta be Anderson Silva. And I think you have
*  to consider discussing Liotta Machida for his unbelievable manipulation of distance, which is
*  something that people don't really talk too much about in terms of fighting, unless you're someone
*  in the sport. His use of distance and the ability to like what we call pop out, like make you miss
*  by one inch so that he could follow your fist back in as you retract it and then hit you over the top.
*  That's a thing of beauty. Anderson Silva, when he became a counter striker, when he got to his prime
*  in the UFC, that was a thing of beauty. That was a thing of beauty. So I think definitely those two
*  guys and Murillo Bustamante has got to be the third guy. There's just so many good guys now.
*  It's just- So where do you put in terms of metrics? You mentioned GSB and Anderson Silva,
*  I think they have a large number of defenses of a title. Is that important to you? Like this kind
*  of consistent domination? No, because it's easily manipulated by the people making money off the
*  fights. So there was a great quote one time when the UFC was coming to prominence and
*  Vince McMahon from the WWE, he said, you know, the difference between what we do and what the UFC does
*  is that when we have a superstar, I can make sure he stays on top until he's no longer a superstar
*  because we have predetermined results. The UFC can't do that because they're actually having fights.
*  Well, it's true and false. You can't do that, but you can give your superstars the most favorable
*  matchups to keep them on top for the longest. So people always talk about title defenses as if
*  the guy they're fighting, the challenger is always the person most deserving of the shot.
*  And it's just not true. So I don't put that much stock in it.
*  Is it possible to put a guy in consideration as one of the greats if all they had is one or two
*  amazing fights? I'll tell you like, and amazing could be a lot of different definitions. It could
*  be just a war. Like they never really reached the highest of excellences of domination, but
*  they've like this, we had this discussion about Kyle Bachniak, right? Yep. To me,
*  that's a perfect example. He had this famous fight against the beat. Magomed Sharapov,
*  where on one side you have an Anderson Silva type of fighter and ends to be like just a very good
*  striker. And then there's like the warrior on the Kyle side and just the fight, they created
*  something special together. It was fight of the night, whatever. But that fight was special
*  on that night because the two dance partners. You can have a great performance without being
*  a great fighter. Not saying neither of those guys is a great fighter, but to answer your first
*  question, I think that having one or two great performances does not necessarily mean that you
*  are great. I need a larger sample size. I have no idea what that is. I don't have any idea what that
*  is. And also, how much weight does toughness have when you're thinking about the criteria
*  when you define a great fighter? That's a good question and I don't have the answer to it.
*  I admire the underdog that rises to the occasion through brute force. They didn't bring the skill
*  set to the table that perhaps some of the greats have, but they rose to the occasion. There's
*  something about that. There's something about that. And so now we're more talking about the
*  internal attributes as opposed to the external physical attributes. And those are the things
*  I think that you cannot teach. Those things, you come in the door and you either have that or you
*  don't. I think, and we talk about this all the time, and this is one of the things where my mind
*  changes regularly. Like I'm what makes a fighter? Is it born or is it bred? And this week, I'm of
*  the opinion that it's in you. And maybe it's in you and you suppress it and people can tease it out
*  of you, but I don't think you can make someone who doesn't have that seed in there. I don't think you
*  can turn them into that great warrior with that level of grit and mental toughness. Now, when that
*  fight, when Kyle fights Zabit, it's a unique situation for both guys. It was kind of a later
*  replacement fight for Kyle. Zabit's star was on the rise and Kyle put the blueprint out there on
*  how to beat Zabit. Which is? Which is pressure him and try and drag him into the late rounds.
*  You notice that later on when Calvin Kader fought him, they wouldn't give him five rounds.
*  They wanted five rounds and Zabit's camp, from what I understand, would not agree to the five
*  round fight. Well, he didn't look right. So with Kyle, it was a three round fight.
*  Three round fight. And what did it want to decision?
*  It went to decision. Zabit won a decision clearly.
*  Did Kyle have a shot at winning the third round? I don't remember the exact score, but Kyle could
*  have won the third round had he done a couple things differently. But I do believe in the fourth
*  round, I think Kyle would have won a fourth round and I think maybe even won the fight if there
*  would have been a fifth round. And he was pressing forward,
*  like perhaps, you know, in a funny way that you could tell me I'm wrong, but it felt like
*  he wasn't emphasizing like head movement at that point. He went full Mike Tyson.
*  There was a point at which, so it's funny that you say that.
*  Which is a contradiction actually, because- Mike Tyson had great head movement.
*  I actually don't know exactly what I mean. Because he was in the pocket. I think he was trying to do
*  the movement. He was just in the pocket and pressing forward and like the fuck you attitude
*  of just like- That was a little bit later when Zabit's back was towards the cage.
*  Towards the end of the round. So we get that fight and I said to Kyle,
*  I was like, look, this kid has been training martial arts since he was three years old.
*  There's not an area where you're going to out technique him. And so we've got to now channel
*  some of that grit that we know you have. This is an opportunity to showcase it. And I don't know how
*  long I did it for, but because Kyle's much shorter than Zabit. So for a good long while,
*  while we were training for Zabit, I didn't even say anything. And I just had clips of Mike Tyson
*  training on the TV in the gym and the head movement. And I didn't even mention it. And then we started
*  to like get into it and talk about getting inside the length of the longer fighter and things like
*  that. And we kind of, which when some people train MMA, they say, okay, this guy's a really good
*  wrestler. Let's think about avoiding the wrestling or being a better wrestler. And I think that
*  when the difference in skill is so great, those are both the wrong answer.
*  If a guy who's a really good wrestler wants to take you down and you don't have a lot of
*  wrestling experience, he's probably going to get you down if he's got a good coach.
*  Right. So you have to deal with that to then say, I'm going to then learn in eight weeks,
*  how to wrestle better than a guy who's been wrestling since he was eight years old. There's
*  also a bad idea. So what we concentrated on for that camp and it worked beautifully was
*  not getting caught in chain wrestling. These are the takedowns you're going to get caught with.
*  This is how to not get caught with the next step while you're defending take down one,
*  because it's the chain of techniques that are going to get you fucked. Right. So we talked,
*  we did a ton of work on get ups and breaking the hands from the various takedowns. Like it's a
*  while ago now, so I don't remember exactly the techniques we worked on, but we concentrated on
*  defend the first takedown and stay out of the chain. Don't get chained into a bunch of wrestling
*  techniques because you will be out wrestled. And that was really successful. And then the third
*  round, it's a beat was tired and he was tired. He's a beat got tired. He cuts a tremendous amount
*  of weight. Like I can't see him staying at 145 forever when they start giving him five round
*  fights. I don't even know if he's had a five round fight yet and he may have, but I can't see him
*  staying down there. He's guys like six one. Yeah, guys. He's a, he's a giant of a guy. So
*  Kyle pressed forward there and he said, uh, he felt that there was no power left in the beats
*  hands. And so he felt fine. And I think part of it was he fed off the crowd as he moved forward
*  and, um, you know, saw that he wasn't taking a lot of damage. Like the punches weren't staying him.
*  He started walking right through them. It goes to your question of what makes a fighter was the
*  him walking forward like that something that you're born with or is that something you were
*  training? Is that, is that the Mike Tyson on TV? He's born with that. Kyle was born with that.
*  And the crowd I, I've been in Boston, no, it was in New York. He's in Brooklyn. I've been in a lot
*  of arenas for a lot of different sporting events. That's one of the loudest things I've ever heard
*  when he did that. I know I was going crazy. And, um, you ask about that being like taught or not,
*  Kyle is so much like that, that I have to try and tease some of that out of him.
*  Because he's also so very technical when he wants to be that the emotion and the fun of it
*  gets in the way of his technique and probably has cost them a couple of, uh, a couple of wins.
*  And so that's one of the things we work on with him right now. It's like staying within yourself,
*  being a professional, taking your time to download the information in round one,
*  and then starting your fight in round two. But the tension between those two things,
*  what makes, um, what on that day created one of the, in my opinion, one of the greatest fights
*  I've ever seen. Joe Rogan agrees. Yeah. It's one of the greatest fights I've certainly ever seen.
*  So like, I, it's funny that you as a coach, I can see the frustration of like,
*  like throwing away some of the strategy kind of thing. Like you seeing like being not happy that
*  there could be things that he could have done to win the fight. It's in retrospect. I think that at
*  that time we were playing with incredible house money. Like Kyle was a gigantic underdog in that
*  fight. Zabit was unstoppable. I think people were probably picking him to finish the fight in round
*  one. I think at that point, no one had ever gone the distance with Zabit and no one certainly had,
*  you know, put that kind of performance together. And I think Kyle, uh, Kyle put the blueprint out
*  there and in retrospect, when I look at the last round, yeah, there were things that could have
*  been done differently, but we're playing with house money at that point. Like, I mean, let it
*  fly. You get to a point where you've got it. You're down three rounds and there's 20 seconds left.
*  You got to move all your chips to the center of the table and you know, see what happens.
*  Do you remember what Joe Rogan said about it? I remember like he got one over. I think
*  I have trouble remembering because offline we talked about that fight and he's exceptionally
*  impressed by, I mean, Joe's from Boston. So it's like, I mean, there's a story there. Okay.
*  It sucks. Not you naturally want to romanticize. Like there's a Rocky versus like a Rocky four,
*  you're drawing it. I mean, um, similar, I suppose kind of chemistry,
*  Kyle's style represents the American ideal, right? The spirit. Yeah. I mean, he's from Gloucester.
*  It's like, you could have, you could have dragged him off the docks three hours before the fight and
*  said, Hey, you want to go fight? And he would have said, yes. Yeah. Oh man. That was a special
*  fight. But that's as per discussion of like greatest fighters of all time. I tend to believe
*  that that fight is more special than the, the champ, the championship belt defenses by George
*  San Piero. Like, you know, there's something to that. It's like Rocky, um, the Rocky one is,
*  is more special than like Rocky three. Right. So like it's the, that, the, the underdog or it's
*  whatever, like the dance partners, like going to war and like that moment. I mean, it's bigger,
*  it's bigger than any individual fighter. They create that and that I know it's not perhaps
*  good for a career. It's not good for like in terms of money, in terms of longevity, in terms of all
*  those kinds of things, but that's a special moment in the history of fighting that you both created.
*  I can remember like right after, like there was so much excitement in the air during the third round
*  and I remember being in the corner and like, I, I was so excited at the end of it that I had forgotten
*  what happened in the other two rounds. I didn't even know. And I looked to Sean when he, the other
*  corner man. And I think I said to him, did we win when you rewatch the fight? Clearly we didn't win
*  the fight. I mean, we lost the other rounds, but I got so caught up in that moment. And then I just
*  remember like, I was so in awe of his performance that like, I forgot what was going on. And I,
*  and it's so hard to not be a fan at that moment and to stay within yourself and try and like coach,
*  but then what the fuck you even coaching at that point? It's like, we're rumbling. We got
*  30 seconds. We're trying to win here. And I remember like the performance itself, I'm not a fan
*  of moral victories, but if ever there was going to be one, that was one. And when the fight was
*  over and I grabbed Kyle, like they hadn't even been to the center of the cage yet. And I just
*  hugged him and I said, you're my fucking hero. And I remember being very emotional about that,
*  that I was able to be a part of that. It feels wrong to say, but I was, I kind of avoided saying
*  it, but I think if I'm being honest with my feelings, this is a safe space for feeling.
*  Is I think it was the greatest mixed martial arts fight I've ever seen. And I don't think I'm being
*  biased. I was honestly thinking like, am I being biased? I honestly don't think so. I think that
*  was the greatest fighter. Like if you want to rank fights I've ever seen, I think to me, that was the
*  greatest fight I've ever seen. It certainly was a, uh, one of the greatest displays of like just
*  dogged effort from an underdog who was out experienced and probably outsized. But I mean,
*  like you just, Kyle's one of those kids, you're never going to tell him he's out of a fight.
*  He has something you can't teach. And I've seen tons of people with more physical attributes
*  and they're just mental midgets and they got a million dollar body and a 50 cent heart.
*  And, and, and Kyle is not that, and you can't teach it no matter what you do. But that was,
*  I would say like my career in combat sports, which spans, you know, if you want to go all the way
*  back to like wrestling, like that was one of probably the greatest experiences I've been a part
*  of. It's a bittersweet sport. She's a fickle mistress.
*  Yeah. I mean, the, the tragic aspect of that is, um, like, I guess Kyle lost, right? So like,
*  if you look at the record and all the kind of things, perhaps, um, like you look at the career,
*  maybe like as a financial, from a financial perspective, that perhaps is not, uh,
*  the greatest thing for Kyle's career or that, or in the, in the history of the UFC, perhaps it's not,
*  it's not, um, you know, like maybe many people didn't even watch that fight, but it was a special
*  moment that stands in the history. There's not many of these in, uh, in the history of fighting.
*  So, but at the end of the day, when you look at someone's career in the UFC, like
*  like, financially, there's a, you know, a handful of people that make real money.
*  Everybody else makes nothing. There's a handful of people that make real money.
*  So did that loss cost him in the, in the near term? Sure. But when you look back on your life,
*  you're not going to look back on that loss as something that derailed my life financially.
*  And I never recovered from it. That's not going to happen. Like the sad thing is,
*  unless you were a champion and you know, most, most people are going to be forgotten right
*  after they're gone. Most people will be forgotten. And if you're not forgotten,
*  certainly your, your accolades are going to be misrepresented. Either they're going to be inflated
*  or diminished one way or the other. So looking back on it, it's just so hard to, to quantify that,
*  but it's an experience. And like when you're in that moment and you're one of the people like
*  intimately involved in it, like the value of that experience supersedes any financial gain.
*  Where would you put Khabib in the discussion of the greatest of all time? So you recently,
*  we worked together, we watched the fight of him and Justin Gaethje and Khabib retired.
*  Would you put them up there as some of the, as one of the greatest or did he never truly find
*  his foil that like the great warrior that challenged him? And, and maybe do you want to,
*  do you think he's fully retired now? To answer the question about being fully retired,
*  I don't have any idea. I can't for a second pretend to, um,
*  think that I understand the way that people from that part of the world think and respect
*  their family and things like that to an American who says, Oh, I promised my mom, I wouldn't do it.
*  I mean, I promised my mom, I wouldn't do a lot of things. I went right out the fucking back door
*  and did them. But I think that that means something different to people in different parts of the
*  world. So I have no idea what kind of weight that carries. So I can't answer that. I can say
*  a lot of times when people think about great fighters, they think about the aspects that make
*  up MMA. Like they think of MMA as a pie and there are all these different pieces that make up for,
*  make up the pie. And how good is this piece and how good is this piece and how good is this piece?
*  When the fact of the matter is, is you only need one really, really, really good piece.
*  And the other pieces are complimentary pieces to get you to where you're the strongest.
*  And if you want to tell me that Khabib's not the greatest MMA fighter because he doesn't have
*  really slick striking, you can make that argument. But what I can tell you is Khabib has good enough
*  striking to get him to his grappling where he is clearly the best guy at 155 they've ever seen.
*  So does that make him the greatest fighter in that division or not? To your point about the foil,
*  they wanted Connor to be his foil and he just manhandled them. I mean, they wanted that to
*  happen. Did not happen. So there's a kind of argument to be made, which would kind of,
*  you get haters in this argument and you're going to be one of the haters because I know your,
*  how should I put it, lack of admiration for Conor McGregor. But, you know, what is it?
*  Football is a game of inches. There's a sense where, you know, that Conor, there's an argument
*  to be made that Conor wasn't exactly dominated, that he ended up being dominant. Meaning,
*  let me phrase it differently, is there's a lot of points in the fight that it could have a different
*  trajectory could have happened. So he wasn't so far from having a chance at winning that fight.
*  It's just the end. You can focus. Those are the most important moments
*  at the end. You've lost the most important moments. Right. But the road less taken,
*  it could have been, if he didn't lose those very important moments, he had a chance. So I'm saying
*  out of all the people that could be fought, it's arguable that Connor was up there of the people
*  that had a chance. Let me say this first. I love, I do love Khabib. I'm a huge Khabib.
*  Because I'm a grappler. First and foremost, because I'm also Russian. I love Khabib. Calm down.
*  But when, when, when Connor came on the scene, I loved Connor because I'm an Irish American and,
*  you know, I want to support him and things like that. And he was, he was good fun. He, he got to
*  be for my personal taste. He got to be too much of all the people could be, has fought. I would
*  never fight Connor again if I were him. And here's why. And I said this about the Diaz fight.
*  Nate Diaz, who was one of my favorite fighters has fought the exact same fight for 12 years.
*  Connor will switch something up to give himself an edge. And I believe that Connor would figure
*  something out in fight number two, I think, but I also thought that Gagey would give Khabib problems
*  where it wouldn't be a matter of I'm going to out wrestle Khabib or become better at
*  defending his wrestling takedowns. Connor would have figured out a way to not get wrestled.
*  I feel like he's constantly changing. He's constantly evolving. And whether or not people
*  realize it or not, I think Connor's one of the better overall athletes in MMA, just from looking
*  at his body and his movement and the way he shaped, he's got a very tiny waist. He's got really
*  pronounced glutes and shoulders. And I think he's for a, for real athlete, whereas a lot of guys in
*  MMA are not for real athletes. They're just good at one of the things that makes up MMA.
*  I understand what you're saying about if this happened, if that happened, but I mean, you could
*  say that about every single combat sports event ever. If Spinks' hook landed on Tyson, maybe that
*  fight didn't end the way that it did, but you know what? It didn't. You're absolutely right. But
*  if we could talk about just Connor McGregor for a second,
*  I can't wait to get your fan mail or hate mail. Speak to the innovation of Connor. I don't hear
*  very many people making this argument, but is it possible to make an argument that Connor McGregor
*  is one of the greatest fighters of all time? It's an interesting argument. And the problem,
*  the only problem with the argument is there's so much emotion on either side.
*  Yeah. I had a conversation, sorry to interrupt, with Yaron Brook, who is a philosopher,
*  objectivist, which is the philosophy of Ayn Rand. And the amount of emotion around that particular
*  human is fascinating to me. It's similar to the amount of emotion around Donald Trump. You can
*  think of different personalities, maybe Elon Musk. Those are the people that aren't willing to have
*  their mind changed. They're too emotionally attached to the argument. Yeah. But it's weird
*  that why do we, why some people inspire so much emotion and others don't. But Connor McGregor,
*  I feel like nobody's able to have a calm, like a fight analysis of the guy. Like look to me,
*  as just a fan of martial arts, like I studied judo, I love watching just hours of Olympic judo
*  and appreciating the art form. Like I forget the humans involved. Teddy Renair, who's a heavy
*  weight, probably the most dominant heavyweight in the history of judo, just studying his gripping,
*  just the art of it. And who cares if there's shit talking? Like to me, I put all of that aside and
*  just look at the art. And like what I really appreciate about Connor McGregor is his innovation,
*  like of movement of maybe it's romanticized. Maybe you can correct me. I'm just a
*  Cheeto eating fan of mixed martial arts. But like I seem to detect more innovation than almost any
*  other fighter that I've paid attention to in Connor McGregor. I think first to I'll answer in two
*  parts. I think, well, I'm not going to answer the first part. It's just a comment because you didn't
*  ask the question. What was the question? I don't even remember. It's about how Connor McGregor fans
*  are very emotional and Connor McGregor detractors are very emotional. I think fans become very
*  emotional. They become cheerleaders of someone like Connor McGregor or Donald Trump because
*  they see that person exhibiting the qualities that they themselves lack. And so they become
*  cheerleaders for that. And I think that for the most part, people who are detractors of
*  Connor McGregor's, they're not really Connor McGregor detractors. They're detractors of
*  Connor supporters. There's a beef that they have with the people in that bucket.
*  It's not really a problem. And that applies probably in our current political climate.
*  Donald Trump with the left and the right. It's more about like they actually don't like on the
*  others the caricature, the most extreme versions of what they see in the supporters of the other
*  side. Yeah, that's a good point. But I think the more interesting thing is the fighter himself.
*  Let's put the supporters aside. I would say that what some people know and some people don't know
*  is that Connor's base is in karate. And the karate style of Connor McGregor, Steven Thompson,
*  of Leota Machida, that type of distance management, a lot of times we think as
*  martial artists, we think that the sport version of the art we've chosen to pursue
*  somehow taints the authenticity and the effectiveness of it. But point karate is
*  what led to that in and out distance management style of Connor, of Leota, and of Steven Thompson.
*  They all kind of use it a little bit differently, but they use it very effectively, all three of
*  them. And that comes from a world of trying to kind of like step in, land contact on you for my
*  point, and then get back out before you can counter strike me. Right? And that's where that
*  comes from. Connor is blessed to have longer arms than someone his height probably normally has.
*  And his movement is just so fluid. He's so athletic with the hinges of his body, the knees and the hips
*  and the swivel of his body, which is also the hips and the shoulders. His movement, his distance,
*  and the way he sets people up for the straight left hand while you're circling away from it,
*  and he can still land it, which is what he did to Chad Mendes, hit him with a straight left while
*  he was circling away from it. That is something that is very beautiful to watch. And sometimes
*  people see the kicks and they see all the flashy snap kicks and the side kicks. All that stuff is
*  doing is setting people up for the left hand. It's all it's doing. It's you're corralling people,
*  you're funneling people, or you're leading the dance and you're bringing them to a spot where
*  you know you can land that left hand. And his ability to do that is masterful. People constantly
*  shit on his ability to grapple and because a couple of his losses have been to jujitsu guys
*  or grapplers, but they've been to really good guys. Anyone who's going to sit here and tell
*  me Connor McGregor is not a good grappler, go grapple him. Let me see you grapple him.
*  To that point, I'll also say a lot of people will use Connor McGregor's X guard sweep on Nate
*  Diaz as evidence to his high level grappling in that fight, to which I would also counter.
*  Nate Diaz didn't fight that off because he knew he was so much better at jujitsu off the bottom
*  that he didn't even care if he got swept. So is Connor McGregor innovative? Absolutely.
*  Is he one of the best fighters ever? It's tough to say because he's such a cash cow that he was
*  fed people. I firmly believe no one who put that Connor McGregor Khabib fight together
*  thought Khabib would win. Wow. I remember, so at that time it was not completely clear.
*  There was a myth of the great Khabib. It wasn't completely clear how good is he really.
*  So that's interesting. And it was unclear how good is Connor also.
*  Right. Because I think to me, maybe part of my admiration of Connor McGregor
*  is rooted in the fact that I thought there was no way he beats Jose Aldo. And I thought there's no,
*  definitely no way he beats Eddie Alvarez. And so when he did, I had to, my brain was like,
*  there's something broken. It was shut down on windows, like froze. We have to rethink this.
*  This is a special human. Now people who argue he's not even in the running of like top 20 is,
*  if you look at the number of defenses, for example, of his belt that he had very, very little.
*  But to me, I'm one of those people is back to our discussion of like,
*  do moments make great fighters? I think just being able to be Jose Aldo, and I would argue in his
*  prime, some people might disagree in this, in a way where he like figures out the puzzle,
*  gets in his head, the entirety of the picture. And then to be, I mean, Eddie Alvarez, would he
*  be considered a really good strong wrestler? Like, or not not strong wrestlers, strong striker and
*  wrestlers, the whole combination of it. And also what's the other wrestler he fought?
*  Chad Mendes.
*  Chad Mendes.
*  So let me comment on all those, if I may. So I was at the Chad Mendes fight live.
*  And there was a jujitsu tournament. We're out in Vegas. And so me and my best friend came out and
*  we got some tickets that night was supposed to be the first Aldo fight. Aldo got hurt like right
*  after I bought the tickets. They pulled Chad Mendes in. He was a little bit out of shape,
*  whatever. You still got to fight the fight. But I don't want to use that fight as evidence to
*  Conor's greatness because they pulled Chad Mendes and he was like hunting and drinking
*  beers in the woods and was a little out of shape. But if you want to talk about greatness,
*  like that surpasses your in-ring accomplishments, I was in the stands that night and
*  the people that came from Ireland to see Conor fight that night single-handedly set the market
*  for hotel room prices and airline tickets to Vegas that weekend. These motherfuckers were all
*  like Conor in the stands. They had wool suits on and big beards and the whole thing. I mean,
*  they probably were wearing pocket watches. I never saw more people trying to be someone else.
*  Never saw more people try to be someone else. I mean, there's a level of, is there a level
*  of greatness in that? I mean, I don't know how to parse all that out.
*  You're somebody who doesn't admire that. I love that in the following sense. I think
*  people don't seem to hold this belief at all. But to me, fighting is not just,
*  this isn't like a quiet street fight that nobody watches. This is also a spectacle.
*  This is also a story. There's a professional wrestling element to this. This is not,
*  like you think it's just about fighting. If it was just about fighting, you wouldn't, I mean,
*  there's a story to it, I guess, trying to get to it. And like greatness has to incorporate that.
*  People that criticize, again, I might be wrong on this, but I honestly think that
*  Conor McGregor, not nearly as much as Khabib, but he's a true martial artist.
*  I think he respects his opponents despite the talk. Maybe I'm misreading it, but it feels like
*  he is a storyteller, like a child son and type of like, he's constructed this image to play the
*  story. Like just the way he acts after the fight, the honor he shows to his opponents.
*  There's a real martial artist in there. And to dismiss the fact that the story of the fight is
*  part of it, because he doesn't just shit talk. This is what people don't seem to understand.
*  He's good at shit talking. Very good. And I'm with you on basically everything you said.
*  I think that there's greatness to that. And I think that he understands how to sell a fight
*  and I think what he did to Jose Aldo by getting in his head helped him win that fight.
*  He insulted Jose Aldo and his country so much that he knew Aldo was going to come forward right into
*  that left hook. Was that fight in Brazil, by the way? Do you remember? I don't recall. Because I
*  know he insulted all of Brazil, but I'm not sure if it was in Brazil. But when he tried to do that
*  to Khabib, you could tell that he just was not going to get in Khabib's head. Khabib was unflappable.
*  But there is definitely something great about how he moves people. The Irish are like,
*  I mean, Conor's walkout music, for people from Ireland of Irish descent, that shit is very deep.
*  It's a very emotional song. I was, to be honest, a little bit upset with Khabib
*  that he didn't rise. I admire that entire culture. But there's an aspect to where he could have risen
*  to the occasion of there's the same kind of depth of love of country that Russia has.
*  Is there in Dagestan?
*  Dagestan is a little weird in terms of like, but he could have, especially with Putin's support,
*  wear for a bit the full Russian hat of like, this is the great nation. Like rise above
*  the culture of Dagestan, which is a small town boy with the small town values of family and all
*  those kinds of things. There's a moment where you inspire entire nations. Like, the step up and be
*  the foil to the great Conor McGregor where also could be becomes the foil to like, both of them
*  are the foil to each other and become like, that fight was already a great fight, right? But it
*  could have been something historic. Ali versus Freyde. I mean, it could have been really historic.
*  And I would argue, I guess the biggest disappointment I have, and I understand it,
*  and I also honor it as a martial artist, but to, I'm disappointed that Khabib doesn't seem to
*  even consider the possibility of doing in Moscow fight number two.
*  So, and because that could be narrative wise, if they do it right,
*  as one of the, could be one of the greatest fights in history.
*  Yeah. I think in terms of Khabib and inspiring a country, is it possible that by staying true
*  to the values that he had his entire career and getting to the zenith of his art form
*  and still doing it in that humble way, isn't it possible that that inspires?
*  Yeah, 100%. So I should clarify that I think they're just hearing from people from
*  my fellow comrades. No, it's, they love that. They love that. But they...
*  There's also a brash beer chugging, shit talking thing that people really like about Connor.
*  And I do love that. But the beautiful narrative would have been the clash, the real clash of those
*  cultures. So Khabib chooses to live the culture by walking away. There's also like a clash of them,
*  sort of walking, not walking away from the fire, but walking into the fire of this brashness. It's
*  the sort of the cool collected calmness of the Dagestan people. It's like you were talking about
*  the Scythian brothers. So they just view it totally differently. And there are stereotypes
*  about the Irish where they're maybe potentially a louder, more boisterous culture. I haven't heard
*  of that. Yeah. And I mean, I thought they each played their part perfectly. And all those things
*  that you're describing could have happened. Maybe Khabib steps up and he carries the proverbial flag,
*  so to speak, for a nation of people and they go to battle. But the fight, if it plays out the same
*  way, is still the fight. And it was an okay fight. It wasn't a great fight. It was, you know,
*  the fight was okay. And I think that, again, I don't have any idea what Khabib's obligations
*  to his family are. I don't think either of those guys want for more money. To do another fight
*  is just a legacy thing. It's just about fulfilling some part of a legacy.
*  And I admire the possibility of a great legacy that is bigger than either of the fighters. I think
*  with Khabib, he's not as concerned about legacy. I think.
*  Right. Your promoter's dream, because you want the rematch. And the only thing that makes more money
*  than the rematch is the trilogy. You got to split the rematch. You hope Connor wins, and then you
*  had the trilogy fight. And now you're all in. Yeah. Yeah. I can't get into Khabib's head, but
*  I know Putin, just the entirety of it, especially at the time, especially if it was Trump as
*  president, if he was as president at the time, and Putin in Russia, and just knowing how masterful
*  Connor is at like, because Connor would be a different Connor. I think he would be a calmer
*  Connor. There would be a different, because you don't want to be over the top Connor with the
*  Russian people. Right. No. It's like, it's a dangerous ground. When Kyle fucks a beat,
*  that was the episode in the hotel in Brooklyn, when some of the Russian guys confronted
*  Artem, and then Connor came over. It's not, but the danger of that. I mean, there is the element of
*  real danger and the real, almost of war. It's, I don't know. It's.
*  It was like when, when, when Chael Sonnen was talking so much smack, maybe it was against
*  Vanderlei Silva. I don't know. And there's one of those fights where they just didn't think he was
*  going to make it out of Brazil. Yeah. Yeah. Americans don't get it. Yeah. People take some
*  of that shit in different parts of the world very, very seriously. Yeah. But that's what makes it
*  beautiful. That's, that's what makes a great story. And I think fighting is very much about
*  the stories, not just about the, the, the particular outcomes of a fighter, the skillset
*  matching or like the chess of the, of the fight. It's also about the story of the greater like
*  context of societies of warring. We're like warring cultures. We're still, we're still good. We're,
*  we're no longer can have great big hot wars between nations because of nuclear weapons.
*  This is our wars that we can have. And, you know, in some sense, I feel robbed of the great war that
*  could have happened. It doesn't mean there aren't lots of wars going on, but yeah, the big one is
*  not going to happen. There's too much of a balance of power with nuclear weapons and technology and
*  stuff, but it's not the end of war. No. Do you think there's always going to be war?
*  I think there'll always be war, especially in underdeveloped parts of the world.
*  Isn't there always underdeveloped relatively parts of the world?
*  Yeah. I mean, at some point though, you'd think, I mean, the way that, you know,
*  technology is expanding and we're bringing technology to weird parts of the world that you
*  wouldn't think of as technologically advanced, the way that the Chinese are inhabiting certain
*  areas for mining purposes and things like that. I think underdeveloped parts of the world will get
*  developed quickly. I just wonder like what the nature of that war might be. It could be cyber.
*  It could be all those kinds of things. I think in developed nations, it's going to be cyber.
*  I think that's probably the next phase of war, but I mean, I think you talk about parts of the
*  world like the Middle East and it's just still going to be warring tribal factions. We can't even
*  begin to understand what those people are fighting about over there. Yet everyone sitting in America
*  on their couch has an opinion. You can't even begin to understand it. I sure can't.
*  Yeah. It's back to the principles discussion when what's violated is much deeper than just kind of
*  anything we can even in a middle-class existence can even comprehend.
*  A lot of times American soldiers will go to war because that's what they're told to do. Maybe they
*  disagree with the orders and maybe they agree with the orders, but I get a sense that people
*  in the Middle East fighting all believe in what they're fighting for. It's not a thing where
*  they're told to go do it. I believe they really believe that what they're doing is the right thing
*  and they're defending some sort of principle. Are you generally optimistic about the future,
*  speaking of war of human civilization? Do you think we'll... People talk about the Fermi paradox
*  asking why haven't aliens visited us if you believe they haven't visited us.
*  One of the thoughts is that there's a great filter that intelligent civilization reach a point
*  where it destroys itself naturally. That's why we haven't seen them. They don't last very long.
*  There does seem to be a kind of... We seem to be advancing faster and faster and faster. We keep
*  developing more and more powerful ways of destroying ourselves in all kinds of ways,
*  not even just even to say nuclear weapons alone, but there's all kinds of new ways,
*  engineered pandemics, nanotechnology, AGI, all those kinds of things.
*  It seems to be that the argument that we are going to destroy ourselves in some kind of creative way
*  very shortly is not too crazy of an argument to make. Are you more optimistic or pessimistic
*  about the prospects of human civilization in maybe the 22nd century? Is it possible that your
*  generation is the last generation to be alive on earth? No, but I wouldn't say that five generations
*  from now that could be true. I guess I think of it really selfishly. I'm a big believer that
*  when your time here on earth is over, the overwhelmingly vast majority of people will
*  be forgotten within 12 calendar months. People with no family will be forgotten sooner.
*  I don't give a lot of thought to what will happen to earth or mankind when I'm gone.
*  I give more thought to maximizing my time here now. I want to do it in a way where I'm not overtly
*  hindering the future of civilization or humankind, but I'm definitely taking a me first approach to
*  how I live on earth. Do you have a philosophy behind why you have or don't have kids
*  on this topic? Because for many people when they have kids, there's a sense, it's almost like a
*  genetic sense or something like that, where all of a sudden you do start caring about what happens
*  five generations from now. I mean, I think I'm just too selfish. I mean, I'm that's, I think
*  that's the easy answer. I know that your whole life has to change. Your focus, everything shifts
*  and just don't want to do that. And also I think that there's a level of, I guess if I have to
*  really unpack it, there's probably a level of lack of hope in the future. I don't think the world
*  and humanity is going in the right direction. What does the right direction look like?
*  I think the right direction looks like people coming back together in a more impactful human
*  way in person, touching, feeling, talking face to face. So all the things you're describing is what
*  we had, as you mentioned before, when you were like a teenager. Yeah. So the state of the world,
*  but that's because your mind was formed then. It very well could be. It very well could be.
*  It's very possible that the virtual reality worlds that we'll create will be actually a much
*  higher level of existence. In fact, like now we're getting, we're moving slowly away from tribalism.
*  Perhaps you could argue the ideas of nations and we're going, we're moving into the realm of ideas
*  and it could be a higher form of existence where we're sort of
*  moving past the constraints of our meat vehicles into the space of our minds.
*  It depends what you value. Cause when you sit here and you talk about it, you know,
*  and you're talking about these things in these humongous levels, on these macro levels. And I
*  don't think a lot of people view it that way. I think a lot of people view it as like, what kind
*  of pizza am I getting tonight? Like it's a much different outlook and sure, the virtual world
*  that's on the horizon, I'm sure it's got benefits and will help people, but is it going to help the
*  things that you find valuable? Like, was it going to help commerce? Okay, sure. Is that the thing
*  you find the most valuable? Is it going to help communication? Well, it'll help disseminating
*  information. Is it going to help explain the information you're disseminating? Probably not.
*  Is it going to hinder interpersonal communication? Absolutely. And those are things I find valuable
*  interpersonal communication, talking to people like the, like, it saddens me when I go into a
*  restaurant and there's five year old kids who like, you know, slam it away on an iPad and can't make
*  eye contact with anybody or teenagers who don't say please and thank you when they order from the
*  waitress. Like that to me is wrong. That shit's wrong. And I don't know this for a fact, but I do
*  attribute that to, you know, using technology as a crutch when we're raising, raising kids.
*  Yeah. You know, I think those are, those are things that I find valuable. I tried to empathize. I mean,
*  I agree with you as a person who grew up in a certain age, but like prior to the internet,
*  I suppose, but, or at least solidified the early philosophies of the way I see the world prior to
*  the injury, uh, during the time of AOL, let's put it this way. Uh, uh, what was your aim screen name?
*  I never had one. Okay. Dude, I was the last person I knew to get a cell phone. I was so anti all that
*  stuff because I just felt like I didn't want to be a part of it. I did not want to be a part of it.
*  I joined the underground forum about MMA in 2000 or 2001 when I first started training. Um, I think
*  right at the tail end, I got a my space, but I didn't have any of that stuff and I didn't want
*  any of it. I don't know why. I just was, I was not into it. I felt like, like, what are the good
*  things that are going to come out of it? Oh, I'm going to, I'm going to get my package in two days
*  instead of four days. Does that make my life better? I try to, uh, I try to deeply empathize
*  with a lot of experiences of other people. And like one of the things I love, like the smell of
*  paper books and books in general. And early on, this is like five years ago, I just gave away all
*  my books and I said, you know, I'm really going to try to fall in love with the books in the same
*  way I did before, but now with a Kindle or not a Kindle, like paper white, whatever the e-book,
*  e-reader, e-reader. And, um, I'm still not there, but I've been kind of trying to fall in love with
*  that experience. And the same way I try to think like teenagers are really into TikTok now, like
*  making these short videos. I try to consider the possibility that their existence will be a much
*  happier one than I've had because of this kind of interaction. It's for my sort of skeptical
*  perspective. It's like the attention span is so short. They don't really deeply think or
*  deeply experience things. They construct, uh, a social layer that they present to the world
*  and they work on creating this social layer, like the presentation to the world much more than
*  really sitting alone with their thoughts and the sadnesses and their hopes and dreams and fears
*  and like working on the project that is their, their own, like actual person that exists in
*  this physical world, as opposed to working on the project of a particular social platform that they
*  show. But like perhaps that project, like who cares who you are in the physical space? Maybe
*  you, what you are is what your Instagram shows. That's the more important project to work on.
*  Well, what's reality is reality perception is reality, right? So how other people perceive this
*  constructed thing, that's their reality of you, but is it your reality? Like that? I mean, like we
*  said earlier, it's what, what you want, how you want people to see you is very rarely in line with
*  how you really are or how you see yourself. And I mean, I can remember being like a 13 year old kid
*  and like, when you go through a bunch of weird 13 year old kid shit, like sitting in my room,
*  like turning a red light on and listening to like a sad record and like, you know, trying to figure
*  out what's going on inside. Sometimes you like it, sometimes you don't like it, but I feel like those
*  experiences are lost on kids constantly connected to a phone and like, you know, I don't know what
*  the remedy for those situations is nowadays. Like, I don't know, do they make a TikTok video? Do they,
*  they blog about it? Do they, you know, make a video or
*  nobody blogs anymore, bro, whatever, man, or, or a video, a story about, oh, this is what happened
*  to me and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like, does that actually help them work it out? Or does it
*  just create more noise and more static on how to get to the root of the problem and learn about
*  themselves? I don't know what future social networks are exactly. I do know on a shallow
*  level does feel good when somebody clicks like on something. I think that is more of a drug than
*  an actual deep, long lasting fulfilling happiness, but perhaps there's a way to make a social
*  network that does lead to long lasting happiness. That's somehow detached from the physical meat
*  space. I don't know, but it feels like you want to give that a chance. Do you think when people are
*  liking things on social media, do you think there's just a group of people and overwhelming
*  majority of people that are going to like whatever you put out there, they're clicking like,
*  and then there's another section of people that just constantly scroll and like scrolling,
*  like and scrolling, like, like, do you think when you get a like on content, you put out that that
*  like perhaps came from someone who normally doesn't like your content, but like you've just
*  changed their mind on something or you you've turned them around on it. I tend to think that
*  when I get likes on social media, those are just the people that like all my shit, no matter what
*  I say. Like they probably don't even read it. Like I could, you know, put the most preposterous
*  thing up there and you're still going to get a handful of the same exact likes. That's interesting.
*  But I tend to the way I see likes, you're kind of, you said multiple things. I think in one sense,
*  you see social media as like a battleground of ideas and like, is it kind of indicated like the
*  best possible like, is an indicator of like, of the, of you winning over somebody on an idea and
*  they really appreciate that idea. That's the best possible. Like to me, a like is just two strangers
*  smiling at each other. Like, like a moment of like, like. I got you, bro. Yeah, I got you, bro. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Like fist bump, like, yeah, we're in this fucking thing together. This whole thing doesn't
*  make any sense, but we're in this together. And I, yeah, it's possible for likes to be that. I don't
*  think the actual clicking of a like, I think social media at its best might be that where it's like,
*  I got you, bro. And it's a large scale as opposed to kind of, uh, this weird, uh, like crazy pool
*  of dopamine where everyone's just obsessed with this likes and likes. And then the division drives
*  like more of this like weird anxious engagement. I think that's just the dark version of it in the
*  early days of social media. I think you called it a battleground of ideas, but I think social
*  media is nothing but a battleground of fragile egos. Well, but humans are fragile egos. I mean,
*  maybe, but I think the people, I think particularly on social media, they're the most fragile.
*  Like, would you be doing all the things you're doing? What would you be doing if you weren't,
*  um, if you weren't podcasting and posting the things you do on social media, what would you
*  be doing? You'd probably be much the same guy, right? But I think that on social media,
*  the fragile ego people, what you see on social media is not what they'd be doing without social
*  media. Does that make any sense? Like you're, you're probably, your mission is probably somewhat
*  congruent in your path. You're just utilizing social media. But I think a lot of people,
*  social media has changed their path and now they're doing something totally foreign to them.
*  And they're only able to do it maybe because of social media.
*  I think you're focusing on a particular moment in time of people in their less great moments,
*  like in their less great version of themselves. I think you're just focusing on the masses,
*  struggling to, uh, to become the best version of themselves. And then you, yeah, sure. For
*  stretches of time, whether it's days, weeks, or months, you could be a shady person on the
*  internet. I think you're focusing on that. And unfortunately, social media platforms
*  emphasize they love it when you're like that, when you're not doing great in your own,
*  in your own life, because it increases anxiety, increase engagement, makes you more susceptible
*  to an argument and then really get pulled into like conspiracy theories, all that kind of stuff.
*  But the other side works too. I think there's also the people who are on social media, like
*  fronting, like they're these positive figures and like, you know, go into the gym, like whatever
*  it is, the positivity that they spew out, but in real life, they're the most negative fucks you've
*  ever met in your life. And they're just so full of crap. And it's just people playing to an audience.
*  It's like you, like you said, like they, it's like a politician sometimes, like a politician wakes up
*  one day and they decide who's the group I can pander to the best to get the most likes equals
*  votes. And it's the same thing on social media. People wake up and whether it's conscious or not,
*  what's the group I can pander to the best to get the most likes? Is it the positivity motivated
*  crowd? Is it the woe is me crowd? Like, what is it? Who's going to give me the most likes?
*  That's what I'll do. I don't know how to argue against that. I guess it's, it's, uh,
*  it rings true what you're saying, but I just kind of refuse to believe it. I guess I'm pandering to
*  the optimistic crowd. Like I met with my marketing team and I just feel that, uh, uh, love has the,
*  the best, um, what do you call it? No, I don't know. There's a lot of people that accuse me
*  of being like exactly that, which is like, why are you always being positive? It's like, well,
*  cause I, I'd like to be that. Yeah, but I don't, I wouldn't consider you someone who panders.
*  No, but you know, it, I guess what I'm saying is like,
*  uh, it's easy to say that everyone is pandering, but like maybe they're just trying.
*  I do believe that social media platforms could encourage people when they're trying to be the
*  best version of themselves, whatever that is. It could be like Conor McGregor talking shit.
*  It could be just being positive. It could be actually creating cool things in this world,
*  putting out instructional videos for Jiu-Jitsu or like inspiring students to competition. I don't
*  know all those kinds of things, educational content. I think that people are trying. Like I,
*  I tend to believe that people want to be good. Like, like they want to be successful, whatever
*  that definition of success is. And they're kind of struggling to do that. And they're just awkward
*  at it at first. And like, it's easy to focus on the awkwardness and the stumbling around us. People
*  have that and they start shitting on each other. Like it's easy to kind of focus in on that. But
*  I think that's just like people, you know, white belts, there's more white belts in the world than
*  their black belts, but you gotta give them a chance to kind of grow. I think on social media,
*  if you put your stuff out there, whatever your stuff is, your content, your views or whatever,
*  you let the chips fall where they may. Like that's a different thing than being like, I'm gonna,
*  I'm gonna tweak what I normally might say and put it up this way because I want these people to like
*  it. And in terms, I also think I have a different viewpoint than you do on people wanting to be
*  successful. I actually don't think that many people want to be successful. I think people want to have
*  the appearance of wanting to be successful, but to be successful takes a shitload of work.
*  And most people don't want to put that work in. So they craft this persona of a person who's trying
*  really hard, but just can't catch the break or, you know, these motherfuckers with getting back on
*  my grind. You've never been on a grind. You've been on the couch. I so disagree with you. I get it. I
*  get it. You, you, that's your foil. You enjoyed that guy on the couch with the cheetah. That's,
*  that's your motivation. Just own it. Be like, don't be like back on the ground, back on the couch.
*  Yeah. Well, you, you, you're like David Goggins, who was like talking shit to the one guy with the
*  eating Cheetos and in, in so doing inspires millions to like, to actually pursue their success. I get
*  it. But I just think that most people really do want to be successful and are like, are trying to
*  work hard and they keep failing. Uh, so I mean, but why is it, why is it continuing? I'm sorry to
*  interrupt you, but like, let's take a person who's overweight. Do you not think that person wants
*  to be skinny? Of course they want to be skinny. They just don't want it enough to put the pizza
*  or the pie down and go to the gym. They want it, but they want it to be easy. Of course they want
*  to be skinny. Well, everyone wants it to be easy. And of course people, people want to be successful,
*  but do they want it enough to do the work? I don't think they do. I think the easy thing to do is to,
*  to create a, uh, uh, an outward facing persona of the person who really wants it.
*  And you get the same reward from a lot of people as the person who actually is successful. Very few
*  people differentiate from the person who's found success and the, and the person who's showing you
*  how they're trying to get success on social media. People see that as the same. I see, I see you're
*  going after the marketing dollar that represents the, uh, the people that want to work hard. Yeah.
*  I like it. Uh, you, uh, started a podcast recently. Hell yeah.
*  Called which people probably from this conversation can, I guess we didn't really
*  talk about politics much or the fact that you're a business owner or the fact that you're a red
*  blooded American and love this country. Uh, uh, America, we didn't really talk about that,
*  but from the name of the podcast, they can probably infer it. And the name is please allow me.
*  Good name. Uh, what have you learned from doing this podcast? What's your hope of doing this
*  podcast for people should definitely listen to it. You have a few episodes out. You're damn good at
*  it, which is very interesting. I'm sure you'll evolve and change, but so this is like the early
*  days. I'm curious to see where it goes, but what, like, what's your thinking around it as a, as an
*  intellectual, putting your thoughts out into the world. I think that one of the things that COVID
*  did, um, when we were all kind of in lockdown was as a business owner, it made me take stock of
*  what's the future of brick and mortar businesses. And I've always been reluctant to be an online
*  presence in any way, just cause it's not my thing because I believe that I'm a force of nature and
*  people need to experience me. Right. And, uh, the, the few characters that Twitter has or faces,
*  enough to experience the force of nature. There's John Clark. Right. I want you to feel physically
*  uncomfortable around me. I've just three hours of me being physically uncomfortable. I'm scared for
*  my life. Uh, and so I thought that that would be one of the ways in which I could increase. Like I,
*  I came to the conclusion that with the lockdown and potential future lockdowns, you know, uh,
*  in order to pay my mortgage and you know, my bar tab and my grub hubs out of control, that I would
*  need to find ancillary ways to door dash slash Lex. Uh, you don't want to use grub hub, grub hub
*  sucks. They actually do store dash. No, I'm just kidding. Just walk to your local, uh, food or
*  seven 11. Yeah. And get, and get the food. Don't you can order seven 11 from door dash or from
*  post code Lex. Okay. I'm sorry. Um, but anyway, I thought it was like, Oh, I should probably
*  increase a little bit my online, uh, presence and what would be a way to do that. That would be
*  fun for me and entertaining. And I thought, well, uh, a lot of people, yourself included that I know
*  have done some podcasts and I find, uh, that inspiring and I'm fortunate enough to know a
*  bunch of cool motherfuckers that, you know, I can talk to about a lot of, uh, a wide range of topics.
*  Then there is, sorry to drop in. There's an aspect to which podcasting does capture the force of
*  nature better in, in the digital form, podcasting captures the force of nature of a human being
*  better than other mediums perhaps. Yeah, definitely. There's that. I just felt like,
*  you know, you know, when it's midnight and you're in the bar and you get the sense that, you know,
*  the bar is going to close in 90 minutes and you think, you know, not enough people have seen me
*  yet and maybe we should go to another bar so more people can see me. I feel like podcasting is like,
*  is like that for me. Not enough people have heard my thoughts and I feel like
*  my mom raised me to be a giver. She didn't want me to be selfish and I have these thoughts that I
*  think that I think it'd be a waste if you didn't give it to the world. People seem to really enjoy
*  them. Yeah. And while, while I've probably been on my best behavior today on this episode of the
*  podcast. So if you want the, uh, the uncensored unfiltered, uh, the full spectrum that the force
*  of nature, this John Clark, you go to, you go, you go to the podcast, you funny enough,
*  I think you're drinking throughout most of the podcasts. Yeah. Tequila. So they only last like
*  an hour because you seem to like, uh, I'm guessing that you just lose it one hour. Like it's like
*  Cinderella turns into a frog or whatever. One of the things I'm learning is, um,
*  sometimes you have great conversations when you're drunk and sometimes you don't. Like I was,
*  I went into it with the right drunk edit sober mentality.
*  Yes. Hemingway. Hemingway. Yes. But turns out that, uh, sometimes you don't have that much
*  to edit when you're super shit faced. And so, uh, I've been scaling that back a little bit.
*  What do you mean exactly by that? Like where does it go wrong when you're drunk? I'm curious about
*  that. Cause, uh, it gets, you, especially when you have a personal relationship with the person that
*  you're talking to, rather than trying to put some ideas on display for other people to hear and
*  maybe talk about, you wind up just having like a conversation with your bro about inside jokes and
*  things like that. And it's like, it's not that interesting. No one wants to like watch, you know,
*  go to a bar and watch two people at the sitting there getting drunk and talking to each other is
*  different than listening to, uh, like strong discourse. Yes. One interesting thing as a fan
*  of Joe Rogan, I'm a fan of, I've been a fan of Joe Rogan for a long time and he has his friends
*  over a lot. Right. And there, there's a aspect to those three, four or five hour conversations
*  that I really enjoy. There's a magic to those. I think he taught the world that those kinds of
*  long form conversations can work. The, what you forget is Joe Rogan is a comedian. His friends
*  are also celebrities. Like they know what it's like to be on the mic. They know there is a
*  challenge to actually having your friends on a microphone. Like they've never, this is the first
*  time they've been on a microphone and that's actually what you've been doing, which is a very
*  interesting experiment. And, uh, you find that some are more awkward than others. Like they're
*  trying to find like, what do I do with this kind of thing? Why, why do you not talk to strangers?
*  Why did you go with people that you're actually know? So the simple answer is the people that I
*  selected are both interesting and I thought would be good at talking. But then I noticed the thing
*  you just mentioned and my buddy Paul did the first one and Paul's a wild man. And if you went out
*  with Paul, he can talk about a bazillion topics to a certain, to, to, to a significant, uh, level
*  of depth, right? And he's got a good understanding and he's got a unique perspective on a lot of
*  things. Um, and I think he was the first guy invited on my podcast and it was almost like
*  he was on a little bit less than natural about it. And then by the time he loosened up with some
*  drinks, he was, it just, we were all shit faced. There's a, there's a face shift that
*  totally. Yeah, totally. And so he's going to come back on and he'll be more comfortable with it. And,
*  uh, and it'll probably be awesome cause he's a great person to talk to. Um, I had my friend
*  Dave on who's a restaurateur and a musician that that one will be released pretty soon.
*  But yesterday I had a guy on who you might really enjoy listening to who's a friend of mine. His
*  name's Mark Clem. He's an endurance athlete and he's been compared. He's been called the white Dave
*  Goggins. And, um, he talks about like those comparisons and what he hates about it and the
*  various events and stuff. And he's just a guy who's just always kind of like natural. And like,
*  I knew he'd be great to get on the podcast. And, um, so I started with friends who I thought could
*  handle it and who also are just really interesting people. And, uh, and I, I did it so that I could
*  also establish a level of comfort because it was a new thing for me. And they, I knew that they
*  wouldn't really give a shit what I was doing and be like, Hey, this is cool. I'm going over JC's
*  house. We're gonna drink some tequila and talk shit. There's just going to be a microphone there
*  this time. I mean, it's amazing what you're doing, the freedom of it. I mean, you're not currently
*  doing any advertisements or any of that kind of stuff. He's just exploring your voice. This is
*  one of the mediums that you're just trying it out. My 11 subscribers know what I'm about.
*  Your 11 subscribers is in the double digits. Uh, for both you and I, do you have advice
*  for me as a podcaster and for yourself as a podcast? Like if you, if you were to think like
*  you're going to do say, I mean, who knows, but say you do a thousand more episodes, right? Like
*  imagine a world where that, that your life continues in that direction. That this is like
*  a little parallel to like, for me, this thing is like a little side hobby, but it's also one that's
*  deeply fulfilling. Um, so not just from a business perspective, which is not the way I think about
*  it. I just think of from a life human perspective, it's, uh, I probably wouldn't have this kind of
*  conversation with you off mic like this long, this deep, this attentive, there's something really
*  fulfilling about these conversations. So what advice would you have for me? What advice do you
*  have for yourself? Or have you not introspected this that deeply? I have a lot. I have advice.
*  I think the first advice I would give to you is I think you should have me on more often.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's first. And second is go on your podcast and have a conversation.
*  Well, I would say, I would say you come on my podcast when you're ready.
*  Yeah. When you feel like the product that I'm putting out, uh, would benefit from your presence
*  and vice versa. Not, not as a, not as a favor to a bro, but at the right time.
*  I do sense actually, it's an interesting, there's a dance to it, which is, uh, like Joe, I recently
*  did like Joe Rogan had a conversation with me on this podcast. There's a very specific kind of thing
*  where you're, you're helping each other out. Yeah. But the timing on that has to be right.
*  Right. You know, like, uh, if that makes any sense, you're like supporting each other.
*  It's it doesn't make sense. It doesn't, it doesn't make a difference. You would think
*  right. Cause it's, it's just people talking. It doesn't matter what microphones,
*  but it changes things. It does. And there's an order to the guests that I've had on.
*  And the next guest that I'll have on will be, uh, a friend we have in common. And we'll be talking
*  about teaching and how to teach different styles of teaching and what you're teaching,
*  all these other things. Your mind saying who? Sean Fisher. And, um, I think there's an order to,
*  it's not scientific, but it's based on my gut. Is it astrologically based? Uh,
*  he means that scientific your, your guts. So you have a sense, uh, like Joe Rogan, for example,
*  tries to do left, right. He tries to alternate like this, this gut feeling of like these bins
*  of people. And he tries to alternate worldviews. That's interesting. Like he kind of, so he doesn't
*  feel like it, like it's shake, it constantly shakes him. It's more about him, like constantly pulls
*  him in multiple directions about like how he sees the world. And that keeps him balanced.
*  That keeps the conversation kind of exciting. That's interesting. I did it in a way where
*  I knew Paul was going to be wild and we might get a little out of control and like have some technical
*  hiccups along the way. And then my friend Jake, who's a CEO of a pharmaceutical company,
*  that was very timely because, uh, you know, he was able to speak to vaccines and it was kind of
*  scientific flavored. Yeah. And what I learned listening back on that is like, I learned it for
*  myself about, uh, I wasn't asking the next level questions, uh, to really draw out great answers.
*  And part of it is, uh, I, you're, you're simultaneously hanging out with a bro,
*  but also I was trying to learn something and I didn't learn what I wanted to learn.
*  And that's my fault because I didn't ask the questions. He's an expert in that field. He
*  doesn't know that I'm an absolute dipshit when it comes to that stuff. And so I didn't do a good
*  job. And if I don't know what that means, the thing I was trying to tease out of him, no one
*  who was going to listen is going to learn that either. So I learned that. Um, then I had the one
*  with soap on, which I thought was, was pretty good. Um, as a wrestler is also a farmer,
*  a social worker and kind of humble and thoughtful, thoughtful guy, like slower.
*  It's not a wild man. That kind of thing. Not a wild man in the sense that I'm wild,
*  but he does preach this, this philosophy of being more wild, like being in touch with nature,
*  nature, that, that, that kind of, right, right. And then my buddy, Dave, he came on, um, you know,
*  because I love music and I wanted to talk a lot about music and he's one of the most
*  knowledgeable people about music that I know. And he's got a restaurant coming up. And, uh, I thought
*  my buddy, Mark Clem being an endurance athlete, like when you hear some of the things, I didn't
*  even know these things existed that this fucking kid did. He's out of his mind. And, you know,
*  I think Sean and I will have probably the most intellectual conversation that I'll have had on
*  my podcast to date. And so there's a little bit of alternating there, but, um, you know,
*  I did it that way. Uh, so that there's a gut feeling behind. Oh, so that what is there,
*  where are you going? Do you know where you're going? Uh, I, I don't have a destination, but I want to,
*  I want to see it to its end, whether that's, uh, it gets somewhere of its own volition
*  or it takes on a new life at some point. And then I know how to drive it where it needs to go.
*  Um, I think the advice I have for both of us is, um, I think I need to,
*  no, I don't think so. I think for you, I see an inner turmoil. I see a storm that bruising you
*  because I feel like there's a concern for what you're saying. And is it going to get you,
*  is it going to lead to a negative feelings towards you or the thing that you're doing?
*  And I feel like we're different people and I have such an easier time saying fuck off to everybody.
*  And that's a liberating thing, but it also can keep, can keep me from achieving the thing that
*  I want to achieve because I'm so flippant with opinions that I don't listen to them and let them
*  direct me when they should. There's a balance. Let me push back on that. I think you, you believe
*  that about yourself and nevertheless, your social media presence indicates. Otherwise, if I were to
*  be very harsh, you're like one of the mentally strongest character wise people I know. And yet
*  on social media, you don't put your face to the world. So you, like one of the reasons you sense
*  the fear in me, which exists, I of course want to let go of it is because I put my face on like my,
*  my name on things. And so when I say something stupid, it, it hurts when people did say like,
*  look, that guy said something stupid. And so there's a fear of saying something stupid in all of his
*  different forms. Uh, like of being my lesser self. It's the same feeling I have in competition of
*  like of losing, not just losing, losing doesn't matter. It's embarrassing myself. I like losing,
*  being the lesser version of myself. And when you put yourself out there in a full way, I think you,
*  I would venture to say you're also, cause you like said, you, you don't, you wouldn't give
*  yourself that advice. I feel like you're also afraid of standing behind some of the ideas.
*  Cause right now you're doing guerrilla warfare. You're, you're free to, to, uh, to be, uh, to say
*  things, to speak your mind from the sidelines. But the moment you're standing and like when people
*  can throw shit at you, I feel like, uh, you haven't faced that fire yet. You've been like avoiding
*  that fire. I'm not sure. Maybe I'm projecting. No, to a degree you're right. I think like a big
*  thing for me was putting like, uh, ads on for like our, our jujitsu online, uh, like, um, curriculum.
*  That was a big thing, uh, for me, because for several reasons, like in the climate of everyone
*  under the sun having a, you know, a jujitsu tutorial online and social media, not social
*  media necessarily, but forums specifically that, uh, critique and shit the bed. One thing I have
*  not done that I've thought about doing, and probably you're right in your analysis of it is
*  I've not gone the way that I do see you on things like Reddit and say, Hey Reddit, I'm doing this.
*  Like I could easily go to Reddit and say, Hey Reddit, uh, uh, I got this website up. Here's a,
*  here's a sample video, whatever the fuck people do on there. But yeah, you're right. I haven't done
*  that. And part of it might be because I, I, I know also if I get suckered in for one second into the
*  negativity, I'm going to become an online warrior and I don't want to be that person. So yeah,
*  you're probably self aware about that. I mean, one of the things I've early on decided is like,
*  I'm just going to be, I've always really enjoyed being positive. So I'm going to make sure I stay
*  that way. And when there's negativity, it's like, I'm not just ignoring it. I'm literally just
*  returning it with positivity. I like, no, I probably am the same way as you. Most people are
*  with, with egos you get, you want to become the warrior against the negativity. And, uh, like,
*  like many wars, there's no winning. There's no winning that war online, especially on the
*  internet. And, uh, so in that sense, that's, that's been a journey to try to, to face the fire of the
*  negativity. And it's not actually that bad. It sounds like very dramatic. There's not many people
*  that are negative, but it's like when you put advertisements, so you put your face on an
*  instructional or something like that, it just, there's an aspect to it, which you're being a
*  salesman, you're being a gimmicky thing. It just feels wrong. And people will point out,
*  look, that guy's a fraud, like it's fake. Look, he's trying, but those people are going to be
*  out there. And if you're like trying to do your best, trying to be authentic and not trying to
*  like be a, uh, a snake oil salesman and being like the shady kind of salesman, um, I think they keep
*  you honest. They keep you honest, the most authentic self and podcasting is like the best
*  medium because you're being real. Those one hour plus that you put out there, that's like real John.
*  That's not a, like people, people fall in love with that. And that's the beautiful aspect of
*  podcasting is there's no long form doesn't give any possibility for you not to be authentic.
*  Right. And that's why it's a magical medium. The, the tough thing is you're not, you know,
*  popularity takes time, popularity. And so like you should, shouldn't be doing it for that reason.
*  And I don't, it's not the thing that really, uh, drives me. Yeah. Is there three books,
*  technical fiction, philosophical that had an impact on you? Like, is there books that you kind of
*  returned to that you enjoy and they were had, you know, they're defined profound some way?
*  I would say like probably the thing I read is in one of Emerson's essays that I read at a,
*  you know, point in my life where I needed that type of thing. And, uh, I read self-reliance and,
*  you know, he's got a ton of good essays, but I thought self-reliance was probably the most
*  impactful to me. Um, you know, I've read later in life, like a handful of, you know, existential
*  authors and they're all great, but at the time, a lot of it has to do with timing.
*  And when I read self-reliance and it was about the individual, uh, that was really good and made,
*  it was impactful. There's also a book called, uh, Jonathan Livingston Siegel by Richard, uh,
*  Richard Bach, I think. And, um, it's kind of along the same lines. It's about this Siegel who,
*  you know, wants to break conformity and learn to fly and do all these other great things. And so
*  it's a very short read. So if people are interested in that, that's good. Uh,
*  the book, which I was lucky enough to read before the movie ever even came out,
*  which is just a pleasure of mine. It was American Psycho. Uh, just from a writing standpoint,
*  I found that the writing was, was awesome. Uh, Brett Easton Ellis, who's the author of that and
*  several other books who have like intertwining characters, uh, he's a New England prep school
*  guy. And so a lot of like the stories and a lot of the, the visuals, uh, rang true for me.
*  And anyone who can write four pages of prose on like a Huey Lewis album, I mean, kudos to you.
*  And I also would say no one will do this, but I would at some point read as much of one of the
*  big three religious texts as possible. It really gives you perspective. There are so many overlapping
*  stories in the, in, in of religious texts. And then the way that they're written gives you a
*  unique perspective on different people, uh, throughout the world. And, you know, if you're
*  a Roman Catholic, maybe don't read the Bible, read one of the other texts. And that would be
*  an interesting take, but I'm embarrassed to say that first of all, I've never read the Bible,
*  which is embarrassing to say it's like I read a bunch of stuff about the Bible, not the Bible
*  itself and the same, not equating them, but I haven't read Marx directly. I haven't read
*  Mein Kampf by Hitler directly. And it feels like sometimes, cause you think like it's better to
*  read stuff about the books, but ultimately you want, because like the analysis will be better
*  in the texts that followed it, but there's value to actually reading like the actual words. Uh,
*  I, yeah, there's this power in the words that, uh, there's a reason why, like the Bible
*  is one of the most impactful books ever. You know, it's, it's in, it's in those words and it's a
*  value to return to those words. The communist manifesto is truly frightening if you read it in,
*  in like modern context. It's worth reading. Yeah. Worth reading. So is Mein Kampf, not obviously,
*  well, uh, it's not obvious, but it is not very well written. Uh, but all the ideas that led to
*  the evil that is Hitler are all in there, which is, uh, fascinating to think about because probably
*  some of the world leaders at the time should have probably read the books. He outlined everything
*  he's going to do. You've mentioned, uh, offline, you mentioned an Emerson quote that I really like.
*  So let's try to end on this powerful quote. It's easy in the world to live after the world's
*  opinion. It's easy in solitude to live after your own. The great man is who in the midst of the world
*  keeps with perfect sweetness, the independence of solitude. What does this quote mean to you?
*  It's kind of, uh, reinforces the idea that you're here to live your life and that even when people
*  are trying to
*  influence you or comment on the decisions that you make for your life, you should have the strength
*  to stick by living your life the way you want to live it. That there's one immutable truth for you
*  and it doesn't apply to everyone. And so people who, um, people who frown upon or judge the way
*  that you live because it's not air quotes conventional, uh, their opinion should not be
*  something that impacts the choices that you make. You're in a relationship now. Yeah. Is that deeply
*  meaningful or is it, are you ultimately still alone? Is this, are you still just a man in the cold of
*  the, of the life that is suffering? No, I'm a man who's warm, nestled in a bosom. I don't think
*  there's a better way to end a John. Uh, uh, you're a friend, you're my coach. I'm sure we'll talk
*  many more times in the future. Thanks for wasting all your time with me today. Thanks brother.
