# Matthew Cox: FBI Most Wanted Con Man - $55 Million in Bank Fraud | Lex Fridman Podcast #409
**Lex Fridman:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMYvGf7BA9o)
*  She found like $40,000 in cash in my freezer one night.
*  So she's like, what is going on?
*  You know?
*  And so we have this conversation and I tell her, look, people are looking for me.
*  Who?
*  Law enforcement.
*  Which ones?
*  All of them.
*  You know, she's like, that doesn't even, for what I go mostly bank fraud.
*  And she's like, well, how are they not finding you?
*  I mean, everybody, you know, people know you like, you know, your general contractor,
*  which I met four months before this guy, six months before this one, two months
*  before, you know, she's like, so-and-so, so-and-so, so, and I'm like, right, right.
*  Well, I said, well, she's like, I mean, they've got your name, they've got your,
*  I go, well, that's identity theft.
*  And she was like, what do you mean?
*  I said, well, my name's not, you know, my name's not, it's not Joseph Carter.
*  And what is your, what is your name?
*  I go, look, you know, it's, it's, you don't need, don't even worry about it.
*  The following is a conversation with Matthew Cox, a con man recently released
*  from federal prison where he served 13 years for bank fraud, mortgage fraud,
*  identity theft, passport fraud, and other charges.
*  He has admitted guilt to all of it.
*  He has written true crime stories of many of his fellow prisoners.
*  And now he continues this work by interviewing criminals about their crimes
*  on his YouTube channel that I recommend called Inside True Crime.
*  Exploring the mind of a criminal is exploring human nature at the extremes,
*  often in its most raw and illuminating form.
*  And that is something I definitely want to do with this podcast, to understand
*  the human mind and everything it is capable of.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it.
*  Please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now to your friends, here's Matthew Cox.
*  What was the first crime you committed?
*  The first mortgage I ever did.
*  A mortgage is me borrowing money from a bank to buy a house.
*  Yeah.
*  How can you find a way to commit crime in this?
*  How can you do fraud in this space?
*  It's, it's very difficult.
*  For the average guy to commit fraud because there's so many safeguards set up.
*  Um, you know, if you were to go in and say, um, I make $300,000 a year.
*  Okay.
*  Well, we want your W-2s.
*  We want your pay stubs.
*  We're going to call your employer.
*  We're going to check to make sure your employer, how long they've been
*  incorporated, we're going to check to make sure they're registered.
*  We're going to, it's like, ah, your whole plan fell apart, you know, because
*  the average guy can't do that.
*  He can't even come up with the, with the pay stub and W-2.
*  So the average person, you know, or I'm going to put down this much money,
*  but you're going to borrow that money from the seller, you know, okay.
*  Well, then they start asking for bank statements.
*  Where does the money come from?
*  How long has it been in your bank?
*  Like you can't even have it put in your bank for a day, get a letter.
*  You know, it's got to have been there for 90 days or 60 days, depending on the bank.
*  And, and so there's all these ways for the average person.
*  It's very difficult to commit fraud.
*  The average guy that works at Walmart and makes $60,000 a year, and he's been
*  there for five years and he saved his deposit.
*  Like it's a very, that's really the guy that those transactions are set up for.
*  To borrow a mortgage from Bank of America.
*  That's the guy they're looking for.
*  So to commit fraud in this space, you have to misrepresent some aspect of your
*  identity of how much you're worth, how much money you have, this kind of stuff.
*  Right.
*  You have to be able to lie to the bank.
*  Anytime you lie to the bank, you've committed fraud.
*  And it's funny when I was doing it, I would say, ah, it's in the gray area.
*  There's no gray area.
*  You're either lying in some capacity or you're not.
*  So it's, it, for instance, the very first loan I did, I, I whited out, um, my
*  borrower had been 30 days late on her, uh, on her rent.
*  So they're really looking at the last two years.
*  So when, when you go into the bank and that most of what they're
*  asking is it is a two year window.
*  They're saying, how long have you been on their job?
*  They care about two years and how long have you been at your, um, at your residency?
*  They're looking for two years.
*  Now you could be at three places in two years.
*  That's fine.
*  As long as you consistent consistently paid for two years.
*  Well, she had been in an apartment complex, but she'd been 30 days late.
*  Now she caught it up, but she was late bank and the bank doesn't want to
*  lend you money if, if you've been 30 days late.
*  So I was a broker and I whited out the 30 day late.
*  I just got rid of it.
*  And my manager is the person that told me to do it.
*  She said, it'll be fine.
*  And she was right.
*  It was, what did it feel like?
*  So that was the first fraudulent action you committed.
*  Yeah.
*  I, I mean, I, you know, I, I was, I was worried, you know, I was.
*  So, you know, I sweated bullets for four or five days, you know, but I mean,
*  I, I was concerned and I don't know that I was concerned that I had broken the
*  law, I was concerned because I was behind on my, on my truck payment.
*  I was behind on my mortgage.
*  Like I had banked on being a mortgage broker and I'd gone deep, deep behind
*  on all my bills to do this.
*  So in the last minute, when this loan isn't going to close and I have to
*  commit fraud to make that happen.
*  And the idea, my fear was they were going to figure it out and maybe I'd get fired.
*  You know, I didn't think I was going to go to jail because my manager assured me
*  you're not going to jail, like they'll, you'll get fired at best.
*  So my concern was they were going to catch it and I get fired and I wouldn't get paid.
*  Like I needed that money so bad.
*  So maybe paint the picture here.
*  Where were you working?
*  Who was the manager?
*  The manager was, it's funny because I, I don't think I ever really mentioned this.
*  Her name was Gretchen Zayas.
*  She eventually, I don't mind saying it, but she eventually ended up going to jail for fraud.
*  Her name was Gretchen Zayas and she was a manager.
*  I was working for a company called Eagle Lending and it was in Tampa.
*  And I, this was like my first month.
*  So my very first deal, three or four weeks into it, into that first month.
*  And I walk in, I put the file in front of my manager.
*  She looks through everything, you know, oh, great.
*  Good.
*  Good.
*  And put this one piece of paper over here and sat there.
*  And then when she was done, I said, uh, what's, what's going on?
*  She is perfect files.
*  Perfect.
*  She goes, but your bar was 30 days late on her rent.
*  And she said that that's it's done.
*  She's like, that's a deal killer.
*  And I was like, oh my gosh, you know, what do I do?
*  And I remember she pulled out a thing, a white out and the white out, not
*  the sticks, but the one she started going, and I was like, what she was, if I was you.
*  And she handed, she said, I white it out, make a copy, stick it back in the file.
*  She said, it'll be fine.
*  And I went, I was like, that's fraud.
*  I could go to jail.
*  And she goes, and she was like, they're never going to catch it.
*  She said, look, we do stuff.
*  I do stuff all the time.
*  She said, they're not going to catch it.
*  And nobody's calling the FBI.
*  She was the worst case that worst case scenario.
*  If underwriting catches it, then they'll fire you.
*  That's it.
*  Nobody's calling.
*  You're not going to jail.
*  And I was, you know, I trusted her.
*  I was like, okay.
*  And so I, I did what she said.
*  I stuck it in the file.
*  And I mean, like I said, for four or five days, I was like, oh my God, I'm so scared.
*  How old were you at this point?
*  Probably 29.
*  I think it was 29.
*  You know, like I had gone to college and so many things had not worked out.
*  You know, I got a degree in fine arts.
*  It's not, it's not a, there's not a lot of people looking for anyone with a fine arts
*  degree and, uh, you know, I tried my, I tried to be a, uh, tried to be a, an
*  insurance adjuster, try that for about a year, year and a half that didn't work out.
*  Uh, ended up, ended up working construction for a few years.
*  And, you know, so finally the girl I was dating said, you gotta be a mortgage broker.
*  You know, she's just had just started as a mortgage in the mortgage industry.
*  And she was like, you have to do this.
*  Like you were born to do this.
*  This is perfect for you.
*  What did she see in you?
*  She said, it's just your salesman.
*  And I was like, cause I was like, you know, I barely balanced my checkbook.
*  Like, I don't know, I don't know anything about numbers.
*  And she's like, it has nothing to do with that.
*  It's sales.
*  It's putting together deals.
*  You know, you're good at that.
*  You're good at negotiating.
*  You're, you know, you're a natural sales salesman.
*  And I figured I'd, I need to try something.
*  So what aspect of mortgages is sales and deal making and what aspects require
*  the charisma that you clearly have?
*  Well, one, you've got, you have clients that have lots of options.
*  They can go to bank of America.
*  They can go to Sun trust.
*  They can go to chase.
*  They have options.
*  If they have perfect credit, I ended up working for a company that was a sub
*  prime lender and those people didn't have a lot of options by some, honestly,
*  by the time they got to that, to Eagle lending, their options were over.
*  So what ended up ends up happening is you're negotiating with sellers.
*  You know, you would think that a lot of the stuff that in that industry, that
*  real estate agents should do, you know, the brokers end up doing because real
*  estate agents are, are used to, you meet them at the house or they take you to
*  several houses, they, you know, they, they open the door, they walk around.
*  They write up a contract that's legit, a legit contract and you already, you're
*  already pre-approved everything works out, but sub prime, that's not the case.
*  You got borrowers with horrific job history.
*  They don't have enough of the down payment.
*  They can't, maybe they have the down payment, but they don't have the closing
*  costs, so you have to go to the real estate agent and say, listen, I need you
*  to raise the purchase price and have the seller pay the closing costs, which is
*  legal, but that's not to a degree, but that's not how they wrote the contract.
*  So now you're having to get them to rewrite the contract or you're having,
*  you're, you know, there's little things you're trying to do.
*  And the more, the more deals you get done and the more you deal with certain real
*  estate agents, the more you start to realize that they're, you know, you know,
*  which ones are completely above board and which ones are willing to twist the rules.
*  And a lot of it works on personal relationships.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  For some reason, people tend to like me and trust me.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know why it's, it's, it hasn't worked out for so many people, but people
*  naturally seem to trust me.
*  And so if I say, Hey, I can close the loan, but you got to do this.
*  It'll be cool.
*  Don't worry.
*  We do it all the time.
*  It's like my third loan.
*  And, you know, I've been doing this for years and they go, okay.
*  And then they raise the purchase price.
*  They add some money.
*  They have the seller of the house, give the borrower some money.
*  They stick it in the bank or they put it in the, in escrow at the closing company.
*  I, now you're starting to massage deals.
*  What was the second time you committed a crime?
*  So what, how did it start to evolve from the whiteout?
*  Well, I mean, when that went through, you know, I, I think a normal person probably
*  would have said, wow, that was a one time thing got away with it.
*  I'm good.
*  But for me, it just emboldened me.
*  Like I just got a check for like, I don't know what it was, 25, $3,500.
*  I was thrilled.
*  And by that time I was already working on another deal, but that guy, he made, I
*  forget something like he had made like, let's say $45,000 the year before in his W2.
*  If you based on his, based on his current track record or his year to date of his
*  pay stub, he made just enough money.
*  But if you factored in last year's W2, he was shy.
*  So if I change that 45,000 to 51,000, then he could, the loan closes.
*  I get a check for 3,500 bucks.
*  He gets into a house.
*  I'm doing him a favor.
*  You know, I'm doing God's work.
*  So I fix it.
*  It, I kicked back.
*  I'm terrified a little bit, you know, worried about it.
*  Sure enough, it closes four or five days later.
*  They call me.
*  He's ready to close a week later.
*  We close.
*  I get a check.
*  Next guy that comes in.
*  I mean, I got very, very quickly.
*  I was concerned.
*  Do you have a house?
*  Do you have a deal?
*  Is it ready?
*  I can get you.
*  I could get you done.
*  Now, if you were in bankruptcy or something, there's some things you just, you'd pull
*  their credit and you just couldn't help them if they were, if they had a 550
*  credit score or something and no job.
*  I mean, you know, they had to be within reason, but very quickly it was changing W2s,
*  changing pay subs, changing appraisals, um, you know, fixing.
*  Verify, like I said, verification of rent.
*  So it evolved very quickly for me.
*  And you're essentially helping people.
*  That's what I told myself, giving him a chance.
*  People that have been really struggling financially in life.
*  So you've been telling yourself that this is, you're doing a good, good thing for people.
*  I told myself that right up until that those loans were solid and I was helping
*  those people out right up until I went to prison and, and I was in prison and I
*  had to write the government asked me to write an ethics and fraud course for, to
*  help teach the nation's mortgage brokers.
*  Um, you know, all loan officers and brokers have to take, I think it's nine
*  hours of continuing education every single year, and I was approached to
*  write the ethics course.
*  And it was about that time and about the same period of time I was writing, uh,
*  writing a book, my book and that kind of, you started reflecting on what I had done.
*  You know, and the truth is like, and this is a horrible thing to say.
*  Cause the first time I ever heard somebody say this, I remember thinking,
*  Oh, that's a horrible thing to say.
*  Some people should not own a house.
*  They shouldn't be allowed to borrow.
*  They're not in a position financially, you know, and, and there were, there were
*  many occasions where I put someone in a house that they 100% swore they could
*  afford.
*  It was, I was helping them.
*  I told myself I was helping them.
*  And a year and a half later, they're going into foreclosure.
*  They're stuffed on the corner.
*  They don't know where to go.
*  And the truth is, is that I'm not smarter than the actuaries that came up with
*  those underwriting guidelines.
*  So in this whole process, how are you making money?
*  You taking a percentage.
*  Broker fee.
*  Yeah.
*  I charge a broker fee or you charge yield spread.
*  So yield spread is let's say the interest rate is 8% interest.
*  If I charge them 25 basis points over the 8%, so I charged them eight and a quarter,
*  you know, 8.25, then I get 1% of the loan back as a fee.
*  So if I charge them eight and a half percent, I get two points back.
*  So if it's a hundred thousand dollar piece of property and the bank says your
*  interest rate is going to be 8% and I tell you 8.5 and I'm charging you a $3,500
*  broker fee, now I'm making $5,500.
*  So on even a hundred thousand dollar loan, you could make a nice chunk of change.
*  I mean, it's.
*  So how much gray area is here?
*  You said that there really isn't when you're lying or not, but I mean, you're
*  it feels like there is.
*  Well, every time I changed something, it wasn't gray area.
*  I just committed, I just committed fraud at this level.
*  You're either, you either meet the guidelines or someone has massaged it in
*  such a way that they've committed fraud.
*  That's it.
*  And there's, there's, there's tons of ways where you can commit fraud and.
*  They just can't figure it out.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Like, I mean, I've, you've committed fraud and it's like, they've looked at the
*  entire, they look at all the documents and they double check everything and they
*  know there's fraud in here and they just can't find it.
*  It just because they can't find it.
*  Doesn't mean exactly.
*  Doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.
*  As part of this, you did a lot of fascinating things.
*  One of the things you did, you talked about creating synthetic people, meaning,
*  creating fake identities.
*  What does, what does it take to do that?
*  To do that?
*  Well, so your credit profile is made up of your, you know, your, your, your
*  app, your name, date of birth, your address, and you know, your social security
*  number, and you know, those are the kind of, you know, and then there's other
*  things where you work, that sort of thing.
*  But what people don't realize is there's so many people out there that think that
*  the credit bureaus already know who you are.
*  Right.
*  But the truth is the first time the credit bureau has ever heard about you
*  was when you told them the first time you applied for a credit card, you, they
*  created a credit profile at that moment.
*  Prior to that, they had no idea.
*  So the first time you apply, you give them your, your full name, date of birth,
*  social security number, and your address.
*  And they create a credit profile and they say, Hey, no record found of this person.
*  He has no credit.
*  Nothing probably got denied.
*  Well, what I realized through the course of, cause eventually I ended up leaving
*  that one company and I opened my own mortgage company.
*  When I opened that mortgage company, I was, I was on the inside.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Like I wasn't, I wasn't just a broker that was sitting out with everybody else
*  and would periodically come in and ask questions or would call underwriting and,
*  but really didn't understand what was happening and what exactly what the
*  underwriting guidelines were.
*  Now I was actually talking to the underwriters and you're, you're talking
*  to the, to the owners of the lending institutions and the banks, and you're
*  talking to all of the account executives.
*  And now it wasn't just Eagle lending.
*  I was talking to, there were 40 different account executives coming in on a weekly
*  basis, trying to get us to sign up with their lender and they're on the inside
*  telling you coming in, showing you programs and saying, look, if your borrower is,
*  you know, self-employed, we don't ask for this or this.
*  We just ask for them to say they're self-employed.
*  Like liar loans, you've heard the term liar loans.
*  Okay.
*  No doc loans where they don't ask for any documentation.
*  If he's got over like, let's say a 700 credit score and he says he's been a
*  plumber and he works for himself, then he's got over a 700 credit score.
*  He just has to say he's worked for himself for over two years and they don't ask
*  him, they don't ask for any documentation.
*  He's got the money in the bank.
*  He's got a 700 credit score.
*  Says he's been on the job for two years.
*  He's self-employed.
*  We're going to raise his insurer rate by 1%.
*  And he's got, you know, that's it.
*  He's got the loan.
*  So, but you start to, you start to know how things work because I hired a bunch of
*  brokers to work underneath me and when they would get caught, I would get the
*  phone call.
*  So I get the phone call from the owner of a bank or a lending Institute, you
*  know, a lender and that lender says, Hey, Matt, we got a problem.
*  I'm like, what's up?
*  He's like, it's like, listen, we, we, we have a problem.
*  I'm like, what's up?
*  He's like, it's like, listen, we, we caught a fake W2.
*  I'm like, what do you, what do you mean?
*  Yeah.
*  You're, you're a broker.
*  So-and-so sent us a file and this person had, there's two fake W2s and we're
*  assuming the pay subs are fake.
*  And I'm like, are you serious?
*  Well, how did you even catch that?
*  And they go, Oh, well, here's what we did.
*  We checked with sunbiz.com, you know, sunbiz.gov, which is the Secretary of
*  States website that registers corporations.
*  And we checked and the tax ID number didn't match.
*  And now I know every W2 has to have a matching tax ID number for whatever
*  corporation issued it.
*  So there's a sequence of checks they do to detect fraud and different
*  documents like W2s, right?
*  And then you're slowly learning slowly.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  What's the process for detecting?
*  I mean, I had a pretty good understanding anyway.
*  Yeah.
*  But so I'm starting to learn that.
*  So I'm putting these things together and I remember one time I had a woman come in
*  and she came in and she had perfect credit.
*  She had like 750 credit scores.
*  I mean, it was perfect.
*  And she came in and one of the brokers came in and said, Hey man, he's like,
*  can I show you something?
*  I was like, yeah, what's up?
*  And he goes, look, he said, I've got this, this woman's W2s here.
*  I said, okay.
*  I looked at him and he goes, here's your credit report.
*  And he goes, here's the application.
*  This is the, this is the social security number.
*  I went, all right.
*  And he said, this is the social security number on the W2.
*  And I went, okay.
*  Keep in mind, you go to get a car loan or credit card.
*  They never asked for these things.
*  So, and he was like, I'm really shocked.
*  He even noticed it.
*  I probably might not have even caught it, but he was, they were different.
*  And I went, really?
*  And he goes, yeah.
*  He said, um, so I did, you know, she just brought them in, you know, she's here.
*  I was like, Oh, bring her in here.
*  So she came in, sat down and said, listen, here's what we just found.
*  And she was like, Oh, okay.
*  You know what?
*  I don't want the loan.
*  I, I just, I go, no, no, no, no.
*  I said, listen, you're getting the loan.
*  You got a 750 credit score.
*  Like, I don't care what we have to do.
*  We're getting you the loan.
*  I just want to know what's going on.
*  How are, how did you, how did you get 750 credit scores under this social security
*  number when clearly this is your real social security number, you've been
*  working for this company for 10 years.
*  And your credit profile says it's only like three years old.
*  And I was like, what happened?
*  And what she told me she did was she had been, she went through a divorce.
*  She had been married for 10 years, used her husband's, I mean, his
*  surname for 10 years, so she has no credit under her maiden name.
*  But when they got divorced, she switched to her maiden name.
*  Um, because when she pulled, tried to get anything in her, in her, um,
*  husband's surname, it was denied bad credit.
*  So he had bad credit, their credit went bad.
*  So he switched to her, she switched to her name and a friend told her if she
*  needed to get her electric or anything turned on, she could use her name and use
*  her daughter's or son's social security number, which was like a four year old kid.
*  So she used that and it went through.
*  She had to put a deposit down, but it went through at least wasn't denied.
*  So that went through, then she went and she applied for an apartment with that.
*  Sure enough, it went through.
*  She had no credit, but they said, you don't have bad credit.
*  So she said, once she moved into the apartment, she then started getting
*  these pre-approved credit cards.
*  So she, she goes, but I knew I had applied there using my son's social
*  security number, let's say.
*  So she started filling those out and sure enough, she got a credit card
*  and then she got two and then she got a pre-approval from Ford motor credit.
*  She went and got herself a new car, got approved.
*  She'd been making the payments ever since.
*  She has 750 credit scores.
*  She thought she'd try her hand at buying a house in his name
*  and his social security number.
*  And we caught it and she got a house in that name.
*  We closed it.
*  I just was like, wow, like this is great.
*  Can I ask you a question about that?
*  Because it seems like she's able to pay for everything.
*  Right.
*  So while this is highly illegal, is it unethical?
*  Is it like, it's, it's unethical in that it's messing with the system
*  on which a lot of people rely, but it feels like there's some aspect of the
*  system that's broken in that it doesn't give people like her a second chance.
*  She could have claimed bankruptcy.
*  And then two years later, listen, two years out of bankruptcy, you can go into
*  bank of America and get a conventional mortgage, assuming you have perfect
*  credit outside the bankruptcy.
*  You have the down payment.
*  You make enough money.
*  There's a whole bunch of, you know, a bunch of, uh, underwriting
*  guidelines you have to meet, but that's possible.
*  But you're right.
*  For instance, she wasn't getting an apartment using with her bad credit.
*  She wasn't getting her utilities turned on.
*  She wasn't getting any of those things done.
*  So getting your light back on track is just harder.
*  It's extremely hard.
*  So there's a temptation to take the shortcut and the
*  shortcut is often going to be illegal.
*  Right.
*  And she stumbled into it, but she basically explained it to me.
*  And I mean, I don't think she had walked out of the, of my brokerage office
*  before I went and I just started making up names and I think I went, I went
*  into our file cabinet and grabbed some people's, uh, 10 forties, which we had,
*  you know, their tax returns and looked up children's social security numbers
*  and just grabbed some random kids, social security numbers and their
*  name and went and pulled them and sure.
*  And, you know, but I changed their date of birth to be an adult, pulled it.
*  And sure enough, it came up.
*  No file found, you know, it didn't say fraud alert or fraud or anything.
*  They didn't say mismatch this mismatch.
*  That didn't say anything.
*  It just said, you know, no file found.
*  Well, then we went and we pulled applied for a couple of credit cards.
*  Using a child social security number.
*  And then we went and pulled our own credit report and sure enough, it
*  didn't say no, no file found.
*  It just said that there had been two inquiries applying for credit cards.
*  So I was like, wow, like that's a credit profile.
*  So that turns into me going to social security and calling or calling social
*  security and trying to get them to issue me social security numbers to adults
*  that had never had a social security number issued to them.
*  I need to get social security number to give me a clean social security number.
*  But I called up and of course, you know, I'm a novice.
*  I don't really know what I'm doing.
*  So I'm caught, call up and I say, Hey, yeah, I was, I'm a.
*  Never had a social security number issue.
*  And they were like, how old are you?
*  I was like, I'm 31 years old, you know, and they were, yeah, that's not possible.
*  Do you have a driver's license?
*  Uh, yeah.
*  You have a bank account?
*  Yeah.
*  You have a social security number.
*  Uh, bring your driver's license in and we'll, we'll pull it up.
*  Okay.
*  Well, that's not going to happen.
*  Hang up.
*  Call back.
*  Hi.
*  Um, my son is seven years old or three years old and he, he never had a social
*  security number issued.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Was he born in a hospital?
*  Yes.
*  Well, he has one.
*  He has one.
*  Go ahead and, uh, get your son come in here.
*  No, I'm not doing that.
*  Hang up.
*  Call back.
*  So I called back probably 10 times and eventually, uh, someone said, I kept
*  altering it kept altering what I was saying to, I got to the point where I was saying.
*  My son was born with a midwife, not in the hospital.
*  And the pediatrician told us that we needed to go, we need to get social
*  security to issue a social security number.
*  And they would say, well, he should have issued it, but that does happen sometimes.
*  So bring your son in and we'll, you know, you fill out paperwork.
*  We'll have one issued.
*  You know, first we'll check to see he never had one issued.
*  And if he hasn't, we'll issue one.
*  And so then it turned into my son is out of the country and I need this.
*  And then that turned into, oh, I'm sorry.
*  Well, how old is he?
*  I was like, um, you know, he's three.
*  And they go, well, I'm sorry.
*  If he's over the age of 12 months old, he has to come in, hang up the phone, call back.
*  My son is 10 months old.
*  He's out of the country, born with a midwife, never had a social security number.
*  And then they go, oh, okay.
*  That's fine.
*  Just get his birth certificate and a shot, his shot record, and you can come in,
*  fill out the paperwork.
*  We'll issue you a social security number.
*  And that's what I did.
*  So I figured out how to create a birth certificate.
*  You know, I ordered the security paper, you know, when, uh, where you make a copy,
*  it says, you know, void if copied.
*  So I ordered, had to order a bunch of that.
*  And I went online and figured out how to make a fake birth certificate.
*  It was great too.
*  Cause like the County actually, they give you a blank form and then they actually
*  show you what it looks like filled out.
*  Like a handwritten one filled out.
*  So I knew if he was born this day, he got these shots, um, two months later,
*  he got these shots six months later.
*  He got these shots.
*  So I just filled it out.
*  I even had to order a, a seal.
*  So you have to have a seal that says like Hillsborough County vital statistics or
*  Richland County vital statistics or something.
*  And I couldn't get anybody to make that.
*  So I changed it to like Richland County office of virtual, um, records.
*  And then I took like 220 grit sandpaper and, and, and hit it over and over and
*  over again to wear it down.
*  And then I state, you know, I did the embossment on the, on the corner.
*  And, you know, I printed it on the security paper, embossed it.
*  Nobody looks at those things.
*  You can see Richland County, you know, you could, you could kind of see that.
*  And that really, they just grab it and they go like this.
*  This is what you realize after you, when I started getting, started getting,
*  uh, driver's licenses issued by, uh, by the state DMV, right?
*  The state, I figured out eventually it was easier to just go into the DMV and
*  have them give me a driver's license than actually make one.
*  So, but you notice they would just grab the thing.
*  They feel the form and go, okay.
*  Like they don't even look at it.
*  So, which is upsetting if you put as much work into these documents as I am for
*  them to go, okay, yeah, that's good.
*  Sit over there.
*  I felt like going like, Hey bro, like take a look at this.
*  This is artwork.
*  Yeah.
*  But they're looking for the low hanging fruit of crappy fraud.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  This stuff was right there.
*  So, okay.
*  So, so birth certificate gets you a social security number.
*  So it's, it's interesting because you've also, you've done a lot of different
*  approaches to, um, creating synthetic people, this homeless people involved.
*  So sometimes it's grounded in real people or real names.
*  And then you're like, some part is fake, some part is real sometimes.
*  And sometimes it's completely all fake.
*  Right.
*  Cause now I have the name, I have the social security numbering.
*  What's great is they mail you.
*  What's even better is you get, then you get to pick whatever name you want, you
*  know, cause when you pick your child's name, he doesn't even have to have your
*  last name, you pick any name.
*  So I would pick a name and I'd just say, Oh, my wife's last name is this.
*  If it, they questioned it, which they never did.
*  But you know, I've got a social security number and then I would go apply for
*  credit cards and I'd get denied, of course, but they would all offer me a secure
*  credit card.
*  So I, I then fill out the secured credit card and I send them, send the bank the
*  money and they would give me a secured credit card for $500, $300, a thousand,
*  whatever it was.
*  And then once you start making the payments, I pulled the credit and a credit
*  profile shows up saying that this 31 year old man with the social security
*  number that I know was issued, you know, a couple months ago has three, three
*  credit cards.
*  They don't even say secure.
*  They just say there's like this credit card is $500.
*  It was issued by bank of America.
*  This one was issued by capital one.
*  This one was, so I've got three of them, but I had no credit scores.
*  So at that point I kind of kicked back and waited.
*  I just kept making payments and I remember thinking to myself, I'll bet you
*  they know that the credit bureaus don't generate credit scores for at least a
*  year.
*  And I was like, God, this is going to be a year long process.
*  And while that was happening, I started other, I was starting other ones because
*  I figured at least in a year I'll have a bunch of these secure, you know, these,
*  um, we call them like phantom borrowers, but now they call them synthetic
*  identities.
*  So at least I would have these synthetic identities and maybe I'd do something
*  with them.
*  But what happened was at six months I went and I randomly pulled the guy's
*  credit, you know, the person's credit and they had 705 credit scores, 705, 701,
*  695.
*  I was like, Oh my God, you only needed a six 20 to borrow, to get a 95% loan from
*  the bank.
*  So I was like, Oh my God, this is, this is amazing.
*  Sure enough, a month later, the other ones I had started all of them, bam,
*  bam, bam.
*  So what do you do with a phantom borrower?
*  Like what, how do you make money on this?
*  So I think most people, if you were just like a scam or a fraudster, you would
*  probably just get credit cards and maybe build up that history or maybe try and
*  borrow a personal loan, which is limited.
*  You know, it's personal loans are used to be, you used to be, you could go to
*  an FDIC insured bank, which borrows money.
*  Those, you know, the personal loans they lend out at the max $15,000, you
*  know, so you could do that.
*  So you can go through this whole process of creating a fake identity, getting a
*  card, paying it off, building up credit, and then you get $15,000 at the end.
*  Right.
*  You get 15, maybe, you know, if you want to keep making the payments, you know, if
*  you could wait a year, you could probably get 15,000, maybe you could maybe get
*  20, 30,000 and a bunch of little smaller ones, you know, you get 7,500.
*  Cause I did, I did, there was a $7,500 from Citibank, you know, $5,500 from
*  American general.
*  So you maybe get what?
*  25,000, you know, maybe 30,000 in personal loans.
*  Maybe you can, you could, you could then apply for, you can maybe get another
*  20 or 30,000 in regular credit cards, you know, 10,000 here, 8,000, 5,000.
*  And then you go to the lower department store cards and you go to home depot,
*  you get a thousand, you get 500.
*  So it ends up being, maybe you can get 50, 60,000.
*  Maybe if you really good, you could get up to 80 or a hundred thousand dollars
*  in credit cards and personal loans.
*  If you really knew what you were doing, but per person, per identity, per identity.
*  But I had the ability to, to leverage that perfect, those perfect credit
*  profiles against properties.
*  And I mean, ultimately that's what I ended up doing.
*  And so each one of those identities was worth, you know, a few million.
*  Can you explain how that works?
*  So to leverage them against property.
*  So how does that work with the mortgage?
*  So what I did eventually, I mean, this was like is down the road, but.
*  You know, I mean, at this point when things are just, my whole life had kind
*  of gone off the rails, I was on federal probation.
*  And so what I did decide what I was going to do was start running a scam,
*  a much larger scam.
*  And what I was going to do was I was going to start flipping properties, right?
*  Like buy houses cheap, fix them up and sell them.
*  There's an area of Tampa called Ebor city.
*  So I was going to start flipping houses in Ebor city.
*  And, you know, I thought, okay, I can, I can buy these houses for, you could buy
*  a really crappy house at that time for 50, $60,000, let's say 50.
*  And then you could put $25,000 into it in renovations.
*  You could renovate it for 25 and maybe you could get an appraisal for a hundred.
*  So I thought what I could do is I can.
*  I can buy these houses, renovate them and sell them to regular people.
*  But I also had been working on the synthetic identities.
*  And then I thought, well, or I could just sell them to synthetic identities.
*  And then I wouldn't have to dump 25,000 into it.
*  Right.
*  And these guys are perfect.
*  They have perfect credit.
*  I can provide W2s and pay stubs because by this point, I'm manufacturing
*  businesses.
*  So I've got, I've got, I've incorporated businesses.
*  I've got websites for the businesses, W2s, pay stubs.
*  So these guys have, these guys look perfect.
*  So I figured I'll buy these properties for 50,000 sell to these guys for a hundred.
*  Maybe I'll pocket 40 or 50,000.
*  I don't really have to do anything, but that seems short-sighted.
*  So I thought what'd be even better is that if I did a little bit of renovations
*  and then I sold it for much higher, maybe I put 10,000 into it, maybe I put
*  10,000 clean up the outside of it.
*  Cause these guys don't care what the inside of the property looks like.
*  You know, they, they're not, they don't exist.
*  So, and then I, but I can't, how am I going to get an appraisal for a hundred
*  thousand dollars?
*  Well, do you know how appraisals work?
*  Okay.
*  So the bank sends it an appraiser out or at that time you could provide an
*  appraisal, they can review it.
*  So they'll do what's called a desktop review.
*  They review it.
*  They review it on, on the computer and they never go out to the property or
*  they send someone out.
*  They call that, you know, it's like a field review.
*  They send someone out and they just look at the house.
*  They don't go in it though.
*  So I have to clean out the clean up the outside of the house.
*  So what I did was, but the problem is, is if your house is, you're trying to
*  sell that house for let's say 200,000, the other houses, they have to pick
*  three comparable sales and they're going to sell it for a hundred thousand.
*  Three comparable sales in the area that are also going to support a $200,000
*  sales price.
*  Well, there's no other house is selling for 200,000 near this house.
*  So I thought if I want to get these things appraised for 200, 250,000, I
*  have to have comparable sales and that appraisal is going to be reviewed.
*  So what I did was I started, I went out and I bought this house for 50,000 and
*  I recorded the sale at 200,000.
*  So when you buy a house for a hundred thousand dollars, you pay $700 in doc
*  stamps, but if you pay the extra, an extra 700 bucks, the sale shows up for
*  200,000.
*  I'm buying these things for 50, so I'm paying $350 and I'm just paying
*  an extra $1,050.
*  So it ends up being $1,400, but the sale shows up at 200,000 on a house that's a
*  crack house I bought for $50,000.
*  Now I go, I trim the trees, we mow the yard, we clean up the porch, we put a
*  porch rail on maybe, we paint it real nice, we black out all the windows, you
*  can't see inside, but from the curb it looks great.
*  And I get an appraisal, so I do that with that house, I do that with another
*  house, all within a mile.
*  So I buy four houses knowing I could use the, there's a subject and three
*  comparables for all of them.
*  So the first thing I did is I bought four houses for 50,000, 60,000, 40,000
*  and I recorded the values at 210, 200, 190.
*  So I get an appraiser to come out there, he appraises it, he says, of course, he
*  says it's horrible, but there's comparables here.
*  Now, of course, it is in bad shape and he says it's in bad shape, but I go
*  ahead and I correct all that.
*  So I correct it.
*  So now if you review the appraisal and you're in California, or even if you
*  drive your car down, the appraiser comes to the house and looks at it from the
*  street, it looks fine.
*  But the truth is I've got $60,000 into this property and you're appraising it
*  for 200,000.
*  So the bank's rated, they're not going to lend 200,000, but they'll lend
*  190,000.
*  So the bank is ready to lend this synthetic borrower $190,000 on a house
*  that I have 60,000 in.
*  So I walk, so I schedule a closing and we close on the house and I walk away
*  with $60,000.
*  You know, and the thing is like, the problem was, is by the time I got to
*  this point, I knew so many people in the industry.
*  I, nobody had to really at that point show up, although I've had people show
*  up for the synthetic identities and sign for them, almost all the closings,
*  nobody ever showed up.
*  I just showed up and said to the title agency and said, hey, my borrower, he's
*  at work right now.
*  He can't make it.
*  Can I just take the file and I'll have him sign all the documents at his work
*  and I'll bring them back.
*  He's like an hour and a half away from here.
*  I'll be back in two or three hours.
*  They're like, oh, wow, man, Matt, thank you so much.
*  And they would give it to me and I'd go sit in the parking lot and I'd sign all
*  the documents.
*  I wait an hour or two and I'd come back in and say, here you go.
*  How are we able to keep all this in your mind?
*  Because you have to not slip up in any of these conversations.
*  It's pretty easy for me to keep them everything in the correct category.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Like it's, I'm not great at a lot of things, but this I was very good at.
*  There's these phantom people that exist and they were becoming real people in
*  your mind.
*  Isn't like you're able to tell good stories with those people, right?
*  Because if you're talking to the appraiser, if you're talking to everybody
*  involved.
*  Well, keep in mind, the appraiser almost never meets the borrower.
*  Never.
*  Not even almost like 99.99% of the time, they never meet him.
*  But you have to talk about them.
*  I guess what I'm asking is you're able to converse fluently about these
*  synthetic identities.
*  Yeah, they all had different jobs.
*  All the jobs were basically, they were all on the job for five years.
*  They were all, a lot of it was.
*  There's a template.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But, yeah, listen, all matter of fact, almost every one of them had the same
*  birthdate, you know?
*  Because I, you know, who knows?
*  Sometimes there's, so, yeah, it wasn't difficult.
*  And keep in mind, a lot of the brokers barely ever meet the borrower.
*  They call in on the phone, but it didn't matter anyway, because I'm walking in
*  saying, I got a slam dunk deal for you.
*  And they're like, oh, wow, Matt, you got the W-2s, the pay stubs.
*  You've got all the, you got all their rental history.
*  You have everything done.
*  It's perfect.
*  Thank you so much.
*  They're happy to do it.
*  Hey, I print up the docs and I'll have them go sign it.
*  Great.
*  Wow.
*  Thank you.
*  I mean, they didn't already know about it.
*  Almost everybody involved in this by the time I was done was involved.
*  There was probably 15 or 20 people that all knew what was going on.
*  The full of it.
*  They knew the full depth of it.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe not 100% everything, but they definitely knew this is fraud.
*  And they were still going along with it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Keep in mind that even when I give you an example, one of my,
*  you know, let's say, and this happened with almost all of them was he would buy five houses.
*  So the guy bought what happens, the basic design was I buy the houses.
*  I record the values higher and this person buys all five houses, refinances them.
*  He ends up borrowing a little bit over a million dollars in his name.
*  Then of course, then I go and I get personal loans from several banks.
*  I get credit cards.
*  I run up all of his credit cards.
*  By this point, I've got 10, $20,000 worth of credit cards in the guy's name.
*  So the guys are all worth like a million million and change.
*  Well, once I stopped paying, you start getting letters from the collection companies,
*  right?
*  From the banks, you know, and then they sell them off.
*  So after about three months, you're getting tons of letters.
*  What I would do is I would get a lot of letters from the bank.
*  What I would do is I would take my borrower's name.
*  I would go online and I would find, or I go in the newspaper and I would find,
*  I would find an article about, let's say like a 12 car pileup, you know, so there's,
*  you know, a huge accident on I-4.
*  It's very dangerous.
*  So there's a 12 car pileup and someone in the accident was life flighted to Tampa General
*  Hospital.
*  I would cut and paste that article and I would just insert my borrower's name into the article
*  saying that, you know, Brandon Green was life flighted to Tampa General Hospital is
*  currently in critical condition.
*  I would then print that article out on newsprint and then make a copy of the, cut it up,
*  make a copy of the newsprint, highlight his name.
*  And I would write a letter from Brandon Green's fictional sister to the collection companies
*  saying several months ago, my brother was in a horrible car accident.
*  He is currently, they've got the article, they have the highlighted name.
*  He clearly was in this accident.
*  He is currently in a coma and the doctors say, even if he wakes up from the coma,
*  he will never work again.
*  That, you know, so you might as well just foreclose on stop writing those letters and
*  take the houses back.
*  And that's all they're looking for is a reason.
*  At this point, even if they look into Brandon Green, they can't figure out if he's a real
*  person or not because he's got a social security number.
*  He's got, and everything went bad at the same time.
*  He's got multiple rental properties or his primary residence.
*  All of his credit cards went bad.
*  Everything went bad.
*  We have an excuse.
*  We have a letter.
*  That happens.
*  People get divorced.
*  They lose their job.
*  They get in accidents.
*  It's reasonable.
*  When they look into it, it all looks legitimate.
*  Even if they ordered another appraisal.
*  By this point, it's not four comparable sales or three or four comparable sales.
*  By this point, it's like 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 because I kept making more and more
*  of these guys.
*  What was your, just almost like a tangent, what's your thinking process?
*  There's a lot of cleverness going on here.
*  So like the car pile up as a solution, newspaper, you mail it.
*  Are you sitting there alone and thinking through this?
*  How do you come up with that idea?
*  It's a very interesting, a very clever, innovative idea.
*  At first, I thought about making a fake death certificate.
*  He died, but I thought, I don't know.
*  Like what if, you know, like some of these places had like, you know,
*  primary mortgage insurance, like what if the primary mortgage insurance,
*  like what if they try and claim because he was dead or like, I don't know.
*  I don't know that side.
*  So I'm like, I don't want to do that.
*  I want to do something that's semi-verifiable and third party.
*  It's like a third party telling you this is what happened.
*  I thought, well, like the newspaper, you know, and you know, where do I claim bankruptcy?
*  And I've done that.
*  I've gone and got the bankruptcy forms, right?
*  You can go to the bankruptcy court and they'll give you forms to mail to all of your creditors
*  and you mail them.
*  They stop contacting.
*  They wait to be located by or notified by the bankruptcy court.
*  But my fear there is, you know, nobody's ever going to notify them.
*  Like I'm not going through bankruptcy for one of these guys.
*  So it was like, this is a better bet than just writing a letter saying,
*  I'm going through a divorce.
*  My wife's keeping those houses.
*  That's her problem.
*  You know, you could do, there's lots of things you could do,
*  but to me, this was they're not going to try and how do you, how do you shut it down?
*  Without him dying?
*  How do you shut that down?
*  This is how you shut it down.
*  He's in a coma.
*  He'll never work again.
*  He was in a car accident.
*  Here's the proof.
*  He can't even write you.
*  I'm his sister.
*  I wrote you the letter.
*  It's a one-time letter that seems to tie up all the, exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  You know, I don't know exactly how that, you know, what sparked that is as much as
*  there were so many other avenues that I could have gone that I was, I just didn't know.
*  But you were thinking through all those different avenues.
*  Yeah.
*  Are you mostly thinking alone?
*  I mean, you know, I had guys that I was bouncing ideas, ideas off of.
*  There were other guys that were involved in the scam.
*  You know, everybody, I think that scam ended up making like the FBI said,
*  I think it was like 11 and a half million or something.
*  And, and, you know, but, but there were so many other people that were involved in that scam that
*  were, you know, this guy's getting 50, this guy's getting 20, you know, 17,000, 20,000, 25,000.
*  And, you know, the whole, we're just doing it constantly.
*  And so the bank would foreclose on that property.
*  They take it back.
*  They put it back on the MLS.
*  They put it back on the MLS for 100, for 200,000.
*  It wouldn't sell.
*  Then they drop it to, you know, 150 wouldn't sell.
*  Then they drop it to 125, 130 wouldn't sell.
*  They drop it to 90 and somebody buy it for like 90.
*  It wasn't worth 90.
*  But by that point, that whole area had, we'd done so many houses at that point.
*  The whole area shot up and the, the FBI said we did 109 houses.
*  I don't think that's true, but we, we, when I ended up leaving Tampa, after that scam falls
*  apart and the FBI shows up, Forbes came out with an article, whatever, six months later.
*  And they said that the Ybor City zip code was one of the top 20 fastest
*  growing appraising areas in the country.
*  And, you know, everybody was like, oh, that's mad because this place is a dump.
*  Like this is a horrible place.
*  Like this is, and I remember one time I had talked to a guy, you know, years later and
*  he was like, oh, all the comparable sales have dried up.
*  Like when you left, they were just nothing even close to 200,000.
*  You mentioned right before telling the story of this elaborate scam that you were on federal
*  probation.
*  How did that happen?
*  So I mentioned that I own the mortgage company.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  So I had started a mortgage company.
*  I had maybe a dozen guys working for me and, and there was fraud, you know, like I would
*  say it wasn't all fraud, but whatever 60, 70% of it was fraud that was going in there.
*  And from the outside of that, that business, it looked very legitimate.
*  You know, we were an FHA approved lender.
*  We were a VA approved lender.
*  We did conventional probably signed up with 40 or 50 subprime lenders.
*  But, but there was a considerable amount of fraud and, you know, it kept getting, you
*  know, it became a game, right?
*  You know, it, you start, you start, I started getting just more and more creative.
*  Like, like I said, every time I would get away with something, like you become emboldened
*  by it.
*  It's like, nice.
*  You know, like, Hey, the underwriters looking for this and looking for this.
*  And you sit there and go, man, so that she's, you know, that's what am I going to do?
*  What am I, you know, what we could do?
*  We could create, create our own bank.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Here's what we're going to do.
*  We're going to go on.
*  Like, how do they know if this bank exists?
*  These people are in California or they're in New York.
*  Like they don't know.
*  So what we're going to do is we're going to go online and keep in mind, this is 2000,
*  you know, this is 2000.
*  2001, like this is the internet's in its infancy still.
*  Right.
*  So we figure out, I remember GoDaddy, I think had just come up with a site where you could
*  build your own website.
*  Like, how cool is that?
*  So I go online with a buddy of mine and we create something called the Bank of Ebor.
*  You know, we cut and pasted things that we like from other banks and we got a 1-800
*  number you could call or a 1-8-6 number, whatever it was.
*  And you could call it and it would go to a voicemail.
*  And so we set up this bank and then I ended up making bank statements, which by this point,
*  I already had been making bank statements to, to prove someone has their down payment.
*  Cause a lot of times people, they have good enough credit to borrow 95% or 90%, but they
*  don't have their down payment.
*  So we'd raise the purchase price high enough to cover their five or 10% down payment.
*  And we would bring their down payment for them, or we'd have the owner of the house
*  bring the down payment for them.
*  And then we would have a check cut out of the closing statement to a construction company
*  that I owned and we get our money back.
*  So they get into the house for a hundred percent financing or 110%.
*  Some of them turned into 130.
*  We want to pay off their car, give them an incentive to sign, and then we get our money
*  back.
*  And then we get an incentive to sign.
*  They don't have, still don't have the money to buy it.
*  So we're doing all kinds of insane things.
*  Well, at some point, remember Gretchen Zayas, my, my old manager.
*  Yeah, the original.
*  Yes.
*  OG.
*  She came and worked for me for a short period of time.
*  And then she and her husband went and opened their own mortgage company, which you should
*  fraudulent from the get go because it was called creative financing.
*  It was with that create CFM creative finance.
*  No creative creative was in the name.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Creative was in the name.
*  So it's really on the nose.
*  So she, she's doing very well.
*  And we became very close by the way, where we go on vacation, went to Puerto Rico together.
*  I got married at the time I got, I was married.
*  Our kids play together.
*  We babysit.
*  We go to each other's parties.
*  We're close.
*  We're good friends.
*  And she's got her own mortgage company.
*  She calls me up periodically and asked me, Hey, can you make a W2 or Hey, can you make
*  me a pay stub?
*  Sure.
*  No problem.
*  We're friends.
*  That's what fraudulent friends do.
*  So, you know, if I needed somebody to verify rent or verify somebody's rental history or
*  employment, she had cell phones.
*  She would answer that sort of thing for me.
*  Well, what ends up happening is, she gets in trouble.
*  She starts doing fraudulent loans for some guys, you know, and these guys are doing what's
*  called a cash back scam.
*  So they're, they're getting like a half a million dollar loan on a house that's worth
*  $300,000.
*  So they're getting out, they're buying the house for whatever, $600,000.
*  It's really only worth $300,000, $350,000.
*  But she happened to be in an area where she could get it, the appraisal jacked up.
*  So they, they buy the house.
*  They get two, $300,000 back.
*  And it's, it's a, it's a straw man's scam, right?
*  It's a cash back, straw man's scam.
*  So this is a real person that's buying the house.
*  He's got perfect credit, but he's willing, he's willing to let to rent, to rent, to
*  ruin his credit, to get a couple hundred thousand in his pocket.
*  So he never has any intentions.
*  So it's not a synthetic identity.
*  It's not a stolen identity.
*  It's a straw man.
*  He's a fake kind of a, not a fake person, but he's just a straw man.
*  He's a stand-in.
*  So he stands in, he signs a paperwork, he buys, buys the house.
*  They end up getting two, $300,000.
*  Well, this guy buys like five houses.
*  So it's a cut to $3 million.
*  They've lost five, $600, $700,000.
*  And these guys never even make the first payment.
*  They just let them go in a foreclosure.
*  So the bank immediately investigates and realizes this is fraud.
*  So the FBI comes in, they grab Pete and Gretchen.
*  She has to hire an attorney, of course.
*  And she doesn't get thrown in jail or anything.
*  They just come to their office and they, they tell them they're investigating them.
*  They know what's going on and they, they want to talk to, they're like, well, look,
*  we want to talk to you and you're going to be indicted.
*  Okay.
*  So she comes to me.
*  Well, actually Pete came to me and said, look, man, can you refinance our house and
*  get a $75,000 out to pay our attorney?
*  I said, no problem.
*  Um, Gretchen gives me W2s, pay subs, fake.
*  The whole thing's fake.
*  I get her, I refinance.
*  I get a second mortgage on her house, $75,000.
*  They pay their attorney.
*  Their attorney immediately says, you need to wear a wire on this guy.
*  Like he just got you $75,000.
*  You know, I don't know how you got $75,000.
*  The attorney knows something's wrong because the attorney's like, they just,
*  your whole mortgage company was just shut down.
*  There's no way you could borrow $75,000.
*  So he's like, this, this guy's doing fraudulent stuff.
*  And she says, yes, of course he is.
*  And he says, you need to work with the FBI, wear a wire against this guy.
*  So she calls me one day and says, listen, I got to talk to you.
*  The FBI is asking questions about you.
*  I go, what?
*  And she goes, yeah.
*  I was like, um, meet me at the pizza place down the street.
*  So don't come into my office because everybody knows she's been indicted.
*  Like everybody in her office quit when the FBI, the FBI shows up and gives you a business
*  card and announces they're the FBI.
*  Everybody quits.
*  So I said, do not have, do not, don't, don't come here because they already know they're
*  already concerned.
*  So I go and I meet her and Pete and we sit down at the, uh, at a restaurant,
*  you know, a little pizzeria and I sit down and she starts telling me that the FBI is
*  asking questions about me.
*  I'm like, well, what are you talking about?
*  Like, what are they asking?
*  And she goes, look, they came in, they took all our files and like, I was like, I don't
*  know any of this.
*  I'm like, when did this happen?
*  She's like, yeah, they have a couple of weeks ago and they, they, and they have
*  some of your files.
*  Cause I had closed several loans for my wife at the time.
*  We were buying rental properties.
*  My wife didn't have a job, so there, there it's all fraud, but I couldn't close.
*  I could not close those loans in at my mortgage company because I own the property.
*  So I'm selling those properties.
*  I bought properties, renovated them and sold them to my wife to get around something
*  called seasoning.
*  Seasoning says you have to wait six months to a year to refinance at the market value.
*  Otherwise you want to refinance, that's fine, but you have to refinance at the price.
*  You purchase the property at, but I bought these properties for 80 or a hundred thousand
*  renovated them, sold them for two, 300,000 to my, my wife, who got a very,
*  didn't even get a big mortgage.
*  We were just trying to kind of get around a, a, a guideline.
*  So, but my wife was not working and I provided W-2s and pay stubs.
*  So when she says all this, she says, yeah, they're looking at, at the loans you gave
*  me at, at your wife's loans.
*  And I went, oh my God.
*  I said, well, you didn't tell them that the W-2s were fake.
*  Did you?
*  You didn't tell them the pay stubs were fake.
*  Did you?
*  You didn't tell them that the down payments were, you didn't tell them that we were
*  married.
*  Did you?
*  I mean, just absolutely buried myself.
*  And as I'm telling her this, I was like, okay, I, I, I was like, I, I,
*  I kind of caught myself and I'm okay.
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
*  Look, okay.
*  Here's what you're going to tell them.
*  You're going to tell them you never met her.
*  She called on the phone.
*  Like I start trying to devise a plan that will answer their questions without
*  getting my wife in trouble or them in trouble.
*  And if nobody cooperates, the whole thing should shut down.
*  You know, they, it doesn't go anywhere.
*  There's no way there's nowhere for them to go.
*  If everybody just kind of stonewalls them.
*  So as I'm saying all this, Gretchen says, Matt, we can't lie to the FBI.
*  And I go, what are you talking about?
*  You're already lying to the FBI.
*  I mean, you, you, you know, you, you've been lying to the FBI.
*  I mean, I just refinance your house.
*  And before I can really say anything, Pete jumps up, her husband stands up and
*  he says, we've never lied to the FBI.
*  We may not have told them everything, but we've never lied.
*  And I thought like, what, what, who, like, who are you talking to?
*  Who are you talking to?
*  Like, I know that's not true.
*  So you're not saying that for my benefit.
*  So I was just, I kind of look at them and I'm like, what?
*  And I just, I remember looking down and this may mean nothing,
*  but both of their cell phones were right next to me.
*  Right.
*  And I remember they were probably just wearing wires, but I just remember
*  thinking those cell phones are microphones.
*  They probably weren't, but I remember thinking, oh, wow.
*  And I just, I looked at it and I went, wow.
*  And I said, well, I hope you're going to get something for this.
*  She immediately starts crying and she says, Matt, I'm sorry.
*  I have a kid.
*  I can't go to jail.
*  You have kids at that point?
*  Yeah.
*  I like, I have a kid, like I have a kid and I was like, wow.
*  I, wow.
*  What have you learned about friendship from that?
*  Like loyalty.
*  Oh yeah.
*  This is no, there's, that's a, that's it's sweet.
*  That must've hurt.
*  It's cute.
*  I mean, I love the idea of it.
*  You don't think that?
*  No, I'll tell you why.
*  So I go back to my, I go back to my office.
*  I remember I told her, I said, tell the FBI agent to call me on the phone.
*  Do not come in my office.
*  So I go back.
*  I'm still trying to figure out how to weather this.
*  Right.
*  I go back, I sit down, phone rings.
*  My secretary comes in and says, hey, agent, I'll never forget the guy's name.
*  Agent Scott Gale with the FBI.
*  And I was like, okay, he is on the phone and she's standing there.
*  I was like, close the door.
*  Get out and close.
*  She's like, so get on the phone.
*  He asked me if I'll come down.
*  I said, yeah, absolutely.
*  Let's schedule it for next Tuesday.
*  I put it off four or five days.
*  I go to my brother-in-law immediately who's a, who's a lawyer.
*  And he says, oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't really tell him exactly what's going on, but I tell him this is what's happening
*  kind of, and I'm, I may be in trouble.
*  I need a, I need a federal defense attorney.
*  I don't even know what a federal defense, I don't even know the difference, but he said
*  you need a federal defense attorney.
*  It's the FBI.
*  So he, we go on a couple, we meet a couple lawyers.
*  I ended up getting a lawyer.
*  I gave him like 75 grand.
*  And he started to have me convinced.
*  Initially he had me convinced I was probably going to go to jail for a few years, but really
*  that's what they kind of do to justify you giving them $75,000.
*  Right.
*  And then, but the more I thought about it, you know, and, and read, he gave me the guidelines
*  that, that supposedly I had, I had, you know, the fraud that I had committed and what the
*  guy and the guidelines that oversaw that.
*  And I read it and I was like, I'm not really in trouble here because I'm looking at a felony,
*  but I'm not going to go to jail because there was no potential for the bank to lend to lose money.
*  So, because I bought the house with like a hard money loan and then I renovated it with
*  my own cash.
*  And when I sold it, it appraised at 250,000.
*  My, my ex-wife borrowed like 180.
*  So there's plenty of equity.
*  If the whole thing had gone into foreclosure, they still would have got their money back.
*  And to be honest, by the time all this happened, there was only like three of the three properties.
*  It was like five, but we'd already sold a few.
*  And at this point, we had just sold another two.
*  There's like one or two properties left.
*  So we're selling at that moment.
*  We were selling them.
*  So I was like, no, I kind of argue with them, but then he wanted 75 grand.
*  I gave him 75 grand.
*  And then he comes back and he says, good news.
*  There was no potential fraud.
*  So I can get you three years.
*  Now, here's the thing.
*  Here's, here's what I always kind of look back at.
*  When I first got, went into his office, he said, he said, listen, you haven't been indicted yet.
*  I spoke with the FBI.
*  I spoke with the U S attorney.
*  They believe and they've been told.
*  And he said, look, they didn't tell me exactly what they have, but they said with the,
*  the evidence that they have on you based on two confidential informants,
*  that it's, you cannot go to trial.
*  And I was like, right.
*  Of course I knew that.
*  And I was like, okay.
*  He said, but he said, you haven't been indicted yet.
*  And they are fairly certain that you're running a mill, right?
*  A fraud mill over there.
*  And then you guys are churning out fraudulent loans.
*  Now they can't come in.
*  They can't come and raid your office and do anything about it yet.
*  Because so far they only have you.
*  But here's what I'm saying is that he said, I can keep you from being indicted.
*  It's called pretrial is a pretrial intervention where we go in.
*  And what we'll do, what we'll do is you go, you work, you go in, talk to the FBI.
*  You go grab a bunch of your mortgage brokers, most egregious files, grab them,
*  bring those files to the FBI, go work with the FBI.
*  They will indict them and you will not be indicted.
*  And I said, which I kick myself to this day.
*  I said, absolutely not.
*  I'm not going to snitch on them.
*  I'm not going to cooperate.
*  I'm not going to, you know, I'd seen the Godfather.
*  You're not supposed to cooperate.
*  You're supposed to be loyal.
*  I'm not going to do any of that.
*  And, you know, and so I say all of this where, you know, looking back, like I would have,
*  if I could go back in time, I would have gone into our weekly meeting with a dolly.
*  And I would have walked in front of everybody and scooped up two or three
*  of the file cabinets and put them in the back of a truck and said, listen, you guys are going to be
*  talking to the FBI soon.
*  I suggest you get attorneys and I would have driven off.
*  But I didn't.
*  I thought, no, be loyal.
*  You know, don't do that.
*  And what happened was when the other thing falls apart, right, when the next scam falls apart,
*  every one of these people go to the FBI.
*  Like they're not even coming to them.
*  These guys are going to the FBI with lawyers.
*  I want to cooperate.
*  I want to tell you what Cox did.
*  I want to help.
*  I want to.
*  And I'm thinking like, I never had to get indicted to begin with.
*  So you think that most of these people from your experience are going to sacrifice all integrity.
*  That's a funny way.
*  Sacrifice.
*  Applies to this, but that's right.
*  They're going to sacrifice friendships and loyalty for just to save their own ass.
*  Yeah.
*  That I only had one person that did not talk to the FBI.
*  I had one person that every time the FBI or the Secret Service went to that person's door,
*  she said, don't come to my house again.
*  I don't have anything to say about Matt.
*  I have nothing to do with any of this.
*  Talk to my lawyer.
*  This happened over and over again.
*  And that's my ex-wife.
*  She's a gangster.
*  So are there people in this world you trusted or you still trust?
*  I, you know, the problem is eventually I cooperate.
*  And at the time I didn't want to cooperate.
*  I didn't believe in cooperation, but after seeing how many people cooperate
*  and the way the system is set up, I think that my understanding of loyalty
*  is vastly more realistic now.
*  And I think that if you're committing crime, if you're absolutely like the things I did,
*  I did a bunch of scumbag things, you know, I mean, I'm not killing people,
*  but I'm doing scumbag things.
*  I'm lying, cheating, stealing that I'm a thief.
*  You know, you boil down to it.
*  That's what I am.
*  So you can't go around behaving like a scumbag, dealing with scumbags,
*  and then expect those same scumbags to suddenly abide by some kind of a street code
*  and not roll over on you.
*  You know, and it does happen, but it's like in the 90 percentile of people that cooperate.
*  90 something percent.
*  And people cooperate when they're not even looking at any real time.
*  So if you're looking at 30 years, and especially after going to prison,
*  and especially after going to prison, you go to prison and it's like,
*  this guy's a standup guy over here.
*  He got 30 years.
*  He could have cooperated against all of his co-defendants, but he didn't.
*  Nobody comes to see him.
*  His wife divorced him.
*  You know, his kids ended up in foster care.
*  His, you know, his friends are cleaning out his house.
*  Nobody puts money on his books.
*  Nobody comes to see him.
*  Nobody answers his phone.
*  Nothing.
*  He took 30 years.
*  Most of those guys turned around.
*  They end up getting indicted for other things.
*  Years later, they cooperate.
*  And the best thing this guy's got going for him is that he can walk around and say,
*  well, he's a standup guy.
*  That guy is going to the same halfway house as me.
*  He's probably he's going to do 30 years where I'm going to do 10.
*  Standup guy, meaning he never snitched.
*  Right.
*  So everybody's seeing this example and saying, well, I'm going to snitch then.
*  But it sounds like what people are doing is they're signaling, virtue signaling.
*  Like there are they would never snitch and actually do secretly.
*  I mean, what is it?
*  I remember I talked to one of the COs at the prison one time and he said,
*  he said, I said, shit, I said 50% of the guys here snitched.
*  He goes, it's more than that.
*  He said, but listen, he is 100% of them are lying about it.
*  He said, so there's nobody here that's going to tell you they snitched.
*  Nobody.
*  So there's guys, tons of tons of them that cooperate.
*  If 80, 90% of of defendants cooperate, you know, you start doing the math.
*  And if you ask 10 guys in prison, all of them say, I didn't, I didn't cooperate.
*  I didn't cooperate.
*  I didn't cooperate.
*  Like, okay, you ask 100.
*  I didn't cooperate.
*  Nobody's going to say I cooperated.
*  Does that break your heart a little bit that people backstab each other like this?
*  It does.
*  It does, but you know what?
*  I have such a low opinion of people.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like I don't expect it's not that I don't like people is that I just don't expect anything of
*  them.
*  You know, I don't expect you to look out for me.
*  You know, there was a time when I did, I thought I look out for you.
*  You should look out for me, but I just don't expect that anymore.
*  See, but I think humanity flourishes because there is a lot of people out there that
*  do the thing that is difficult to do in terms of integrity.
*  That may be, but these, these aren't people with integrity.
*  These are criminals.
*  If these were decent human beings and all of them will tell you, well, why'd you do that?
*  Oh, you know, I was a drug addict or I needed the money.
*  Well, if you were, if you were a decent human being, you would have gotten off the drugs.
*  You would have gone and gotten three jobs.
*  You can work 80 hours a week.
*  I've done it.
*  You can work 84, 85, 80, 90 hours a week.
*  You can do that.
*  Oh, I did it for my kids.
*  No, you're lazy.
*  You could have worked three jobs for your kids.
*  Instead, you decided to sell methamphetamine.
*  Well, I was, I was addicted.
*  You could have gotten off me.
*  It wasn't important.
*  It was the easy way out.
*  You're not someone with integrity.
*  So for you to sit there and say, hey, I'm going to act like a scumbag, but now I got
*  caught or you got caught and I don't want you to tell on me.
*  Well, you're a guy that robs banks.
*  You stick guns in people's faces.
*  You kidnap people.
*  You torture people.
*  You sell drugs.
*  You're not, you're not a moral, ethical person, but you want, you want everybody
*  else to hold up to some ethical code while, while you're robbing grandma.
*  That's not right.
*  Like, you know, so, you know, I, I get, I get the whole Omar to a code, you know, and
*  there was a, there was a time when I was delusional enough to believe that.
*  But, you know, after you go, after going through it, no, and after going through
*  it multiple times, no, I have to really think about that.
*  And I deeply appreciate your honesty on this.
*  Okay.
*  So I think, I mean, there's all kinds of criminals in this world and they all
*  have all kinds of stories and your story is one of, I don't know if it came from
*  desperation versus a love of this kind of game, right?
*  Like it, it wasn't part of it, an attraction to the, the creative aspect of this, of
*  breaking the rules when nobody else can, and you figure out a way to do it.
*  I think, I think initially it was, I needed the money.
*  Like that's the first thing, you know, you say, oh, okay.
*  Well, I need, and if you ask most guys, oh, well, man, I needed the money.
*  You need the money.
*  But, and then I definitely needed the money.
*  But then you get $50,000 in your bank and then you get a hundred and then it's 200
*  and then it's half a million and then it's a million.
*  And what the hell are you still committing fraud for?
*  You've got half a million or a million dollars in the bank or worth of real estate,
*  or you've, you're making five, $10,000 a month just in rental income.
*  Why are you still committing fraud?
*  So it turned, I think it morphs into the creativity in part for me.
*  And two, it was a chance for me to prove to everybody how smart I was.
*  You know, I mean, it was done out of desperation initially, and then it just turned into pure
*  narcissistic arrogance.
*  Look at me, look at how I can do things that nobody else can do.
*  Look how smart I am.
*  I just walked into Bank of America, handed them seven documents that were all fraudulent
*  and they cut me a check for $250,000.
*  Like, wow, I'm amazing.
*  And guess what?
*  They're never going to get their check and they won't know even know where to start to
*  try and find the person because they're looking for a phantom.
*  So, you know, and you feel great.
*  I felt great.
*  I used to say, I felt like James Bond.
*  I felt like 007.
*  It was amazing.
*  And, you know, and it did it.
*  It feeded my need to feel important, you know, even if it was, even if that was a lie,
*  because all that success was just a lie.
*  Well, no, you're good at it.
*  It was good at it, but it was, it's not.
*  It was illegal.
*  Like I'm Elon Musk, you know what I'm saying?
*  Like there's, it's not like you're an exception.
*  I'm an exceptional human.
*  I'm an exceptional human being at a horrific thing at committing fraud.
*  Well, the question is how many people are getting hurt because
*  Initially, the thing is initially nobody got hurt.
*  That's the thing.
*  Nobody ever lost any money directly.
*  Like I didn't go and say, give me $50,000 and I ran off with your money.
*  Like I wasn't doing that and that was a great justification.
*  But at some point, and we'll get into that, you know, I take off on the run
*  and people do lose money.
*  I didn't take that money directly.
*  And for some reason in my, you know, sick mind or whatever the case may be,
*  that seems like a distinction to me that makes me feel okay.
*  Is that I never said, give me 300, give me $10,000 and I ran off with it.
*  But I put people in a position where I damaged the credit or damaged the,
*  the title to their house and they had to go get a lawyer to fix that.
*  You know, and, and so that they had to go pay a lawyer $10,000.
*  So I absolutely caused that person that I stood to me.
*  It's a, you're a victim and I owe you that money.
*  And it was a shitty thing to do because even at the time I was like,
*  oh, they'll make a couple of phone calls.
*  It'll be fine.
*  It wasn't fine.
*  And if I had really put any thought into it all, I would have known it.
*  It's going to, it's going to really affect these people.
*  And those people had done nothing wrong with the exception of trusting me.
*  They rented me their house or they own or finance their house.
*  They made the mistake of bumping into me and now they owe $10,000, $20,000.
*  You know, and I'm sure a ton of anguish.
*  So what happened when you were caught that first time?
*  So I was caught, I got three years probation.
*  You know, I took the probation.
*  Does that involve?
*  Initially it was, it was such a slap on the hand on the wrist.
*  Were you allowed to still practice?
*  No.
*  Okay.
*  So I wasn't, I had to, I couldn't own the mortgage company anymore.
*  That was a good question.
*  Cause like you would think, you know, wouldn't it be great if I could keep on going?
*  But what they said was, you know, you, you have to forfeit your,
*  your brokerage, your brokerage license and your brokerage business license.
*  And what I did was I, I transferred my brokerage business license to
*  a guy that essentially bought my business.
*  They allowed me to work as a consultant in the mortgage industry, you know,
*  cause they went, you know, they go, my, my lawyer goes to the judge and says,
*  what else can he do?
*  So, and so I have a,
*  a friend named Dave Walker.
*  He was a CPA.
*  He came in and he bought my business and he paid me like $9,000 a month.
*  And that covered my bills.
*  My wife and I got divorced.
*  So she's my ex-wife and I, I don't know what to do.
*  Right?
*  Like I don't, I'm, I could, you know, and I was saying, you know, I could have like,
*  you know, do you look back and it's like, I could have claimed bankruptcy.
*  Um, I could have moved into my parents' spare room, you know, something like that.
*  But, you know, cause I had, I had, I lost everything in my divorce.
*  I had huge child support payment.
*  You know, not that that has anything to do like with my, my ex-wife, like I absolutely
*  signed up for that.
*  Like I wanted to pay that.
*  But it was, it was, it was a chunk of change, you know?
*  So we're talking about a couple thousand dollars a month for, you know, for child support.
*  She got all of the apartments that we had, we had about a million, million and a half
*  dollars worth of apartments, which isn't a lot now, but that's probably a five or six
*  million dollars now.
*  So she got all the apartments.
*  So she got everything.
*  So now I'm sitting here like, I got, I can't be a mortgage broker.
*  I can get my $9,000, but I have to help this guy run this company, train people,
*  do that sort of thing.
*  So what I decided to do was I was going to start flipping houses.
*  Legitimately or not?
*  Well, initially I thought about doing it legitimately, right?
*  But at the same time, I was also in the middle of figuring out how to make these
*  synthetic identities.
*  So I'm making the payments every month.
*  Remember two months in three months, no, no credit scores, no credit scores, no
*  credit scores.
*  And I'm also saying, I'm going to go, I'm going to start buying houses, renovate
*  them, sell them.
*  So to the, the truth is we actually renovated probably one house completely.
*  I remember it was on 26th street.
*  We renovated the house completely.
*  I'm not saying in the inside.
*  Yeah.
*  Outside, inside it's done.
*  It's good.
*  Okay.
*  Great.
*  Me and this guy, actually Dave, Dave Walker, the guy that bought my business.
*  So we renovated and it just so happens at the same time, I go to pull credit one
*  day and wow, 700 plus credit scores.
*  And I went, we don't have to sell this thing at all.
*  Like we just, we just, I can sell it and put it in this guy's name
*  and let him refinance it.
*  And so that's what we did.
*  We ended up, I ended up selling it to this synthetic identity.
*  Do you remember the first synthetic identity, the name?
*  The first one was a Joel Cologne.
*  And then I started getting creative because the ones after that I started naming.
*  So I had like Joel Cologne and an Alan Duncan, but then I, I, do you remember
*  the movie Reservoir Dogs?
*  So I started naming the characters after guys in the Reservoir Dogs.
*  So I had a, I had a James Red, you know, I had a, like a Michael White, Lee Black.
*  I had a William Blue, David Silver, Brandon Green.
*  So then I start developing these guys.
*  Now I thought, oh, forget those, those normal names.
*  I'm going with these, with the Reservoir Dogs.
*  And I thought it was so cute too.
*  You think in retrospect, those.
*  It was so stupid.
*  That was just, it's just, there's so many things, so many mistakes I made.
*  I mean, within the fraud, there are mistakes I made, but you know, other than just the
*  overall committing fraud, but it was just like, I thought it was so cute.
*  And then, you know, you get in front of the judge and the judge is hearing about the Reservoir
*  Dogs and Mr. Green and Mr. Black, Mr. White, Mr. This, Mr. That.
*  And he's looking at me just like, you jackass.
*  Like, and you know, what am I saying?
*  I'm like, yeah, I thought that was cute.
*  You know, but nothing's cute.
*  So, you know, plus I'm making fake banks.
*  What's the purpose of the fake banks?
*  Well, sometimes you have to have your down payment in the bank, right?
*  So you have to, they have to, they want three months worth of bank statements to see that,
*  hey, he's got his $50,000 in the bank.
*  And then the more, the more properties you buy, they want to start to want to see what's
*  called reserves.
*  They want to make sure that you can pay all your mortgage payments.
*  If this guy loses his job, can this guy maintain all these mortgage payments for the next six
*  months?
*  And so they do that and they think you're going to go, you know, oh, no, he can't do
*  it.
*  They go, well, then we won't lend it.
*  Well, when they do that to me, I go, of course I do.
*  Of course he's got it.
*  Let me send you over the bank statements.
*  Oh, you want to call the bank?
*  Call them.
*  So there's a phone number, there's a website.
*  Yes, you can call.
*  We'll get on there.
*  I'll do the whole, you know, and hold on.
*  Okay.
*  What's the name again?
*  Do you have the account number?
*  Hold on.
*  You wait a little bit.
*  You come out.
*  Okay.
*  I got to hear.
*  I can't tell you the exact amount right now, but what is the, what was this balance last
*  month in the data?
*  Oh, yep.
*  That's it.
*  Exactly.
*  Okay.
*  Thank you.
*  Click.
*  Would you do different voices or would you be?
*  No, I've done different voices or I just have somebody else do it.
*  You know, Gretchen would have done it or, um, or one of the brokers, Susan would have
*  done one of the brokers that worked for me or, you know, Kelly or Johnny moon.
*  I have so many guys and you know, they just get on the phone.
*  They do it because they're all doing something fraud and we're all working together.
*  So, Hey, I need you to call this guy.
*  I need to call this guy and verify this and say, Oh, I'm at the bank.
*  Okay.
*  I'm at the bank.
*  Okay.
*  Cool.
*  And they call back.
*  And does this feel like an organized system or was it more improv just like
*  dealing with the different situations?
*  The government would definitely say it was organized.
*  I always say it was, you know, you're a bunch of, you're just a bunch of guys, you know,
*  you know, it's, you're joking around with everybody and you're, you're helping each
*  other and it's not like everybody's, you know, kicking up the Tommy, you know?
*  So, so, and then all these new puzzles come up and you figure out ways to, right.
*  You go in and you say, Hey, I've got, I've got this loan.
*  I need to get this loan.
*  If this guy's trying to buy this house and I need a loan that looks like this,
*  where can we go?
*  And by the way, they cannot, they cannot order a copy of his tax returns.
*  So you don't want to have to sign what's called a 4506.
*  So they're like, Oh, okay, listen, so and so has got a program that, you know,
*  you go back and forth, but you have to have this much in reserves, but you got the bank.
*  Yeah, I got the bank.
*  I could do that.
*  You know, so you're, you go in and you throw it out there to five or six guys and you're
*  going to come up with an answer.
*  So you're on probation here just to self-reflect.
*  Did you start doing this while on probation because of the money or because it gave you meaning?
*  God, you know, I mean, part, a big part of that.
*  The reason is I did not want to move back in with my parents and I didn't want my father
*  to see me struggling and I didn't want him to, it was my success.
*  He had no idea.
*  My success had been the first time he'd ever really been proud of me.
*  Does that mean financial success?
*  Yes.
*  At which point, what was the first time you told them you did something?
*  He was like, you could sense him being proud.
*  Oh, when I became a mortgage broker, when I, when I became a mortgage broker and I went
*  to work for the company and we're talking about within a week, I got a client three
*  days later.
*  I got a client a week later, got a client two days later, got a client.
*  Like I closed four loans my first month and my dad was like, well, well, how much money
*  are you going to make?
*  And I'm like, oh, I'm charging this much this I got a point on the back.
*  I got this boom.
*  I'm thinking I'm going to walk home after taxes like 10, 11,000.
*  Jesus, God almighty.
*  You know, are you sure?
*  Well, we'll see.
*  Don't start counting your chickens before that, you know, and then, you know, two,
*  whatever, three weeks later, four weeks later, you know, boom, I got a check.
*  It's like $9,000 or something or, and then, you know, the next month it's 12 and the next
*  month it's 16 and then they make me a manager and, you know, um, it just,
*  He didn't know any of it was illegitimate.
*  No, he thinks, he thinks my son, he's brilliant.
*  You know, he's great.
*  He's wonderful.
*  I had, you know, was certainly not proud of me prior to that.
*  Um, but you know, my dad was athletic.
*  He was extremely bright.
*  I mean, brilliant.
*  And I was a kid who had to be put into special schools, who barely graduated high school,
*  who ended up going to college and getting a degree in fine arts because I was never
*  going to be able to get a degree in business.
*  It wasn't going to happen.
*  So when I graduated college, I remember with the degree in fine arts, he said,
*  the best you'll, the best thing you could do with that is maybe you could draw
*  caricatures at Disney world.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Which wasn't a compliment by any, it wasn't like, Hey, you could draw.
*  Um, so yeah, he, you know, and then I turned around and I tried to go to work for state
*  farm insurance, which is who he worked for.
*  He worked for them for like 40 something years and I failed the aptitude test.
*  So then I went and worked for another insurance company and I was an insurance adjuster,
*  but I couldn't keep up with the workload.
*  Then I ended up working construction.
*  I'm still barely paying my bills.
*  You know, that's basically where my dad felt like that's, that's, you know, he was polite
*  to me, you know, we were, we were, you know, cordial, but yeah, I wasn't, I think he felt
*  he deserved a better kid.
*  So when you, when you started doing mortgages, that's when he was like,
*  he was like, this kid's got something I'm driving.
*  I'm driving a new, I got it just pulled in in a new car and I got it.
*  I just bought a house that was, you know, four or five blocks away from his house,
*  from where I grew up, from where he lives, you know, lived at that time, you know,
*  six blocks away from where my sister's married to her lawyer husband.
*  Like I'm doing pretty good.
*  And then within three months we bought, you know, we're my new wife.
*  We buy a, um, a quadplex and then we're buying a triplex and another quadplex and a 10 unit
*  and a duplex and another duplex and a quad and it's like, what the hell's going on?
*  This guy is blowing up.
*  He's going on vacation here and vacation here.
*  And you know, so he, you know, and so when, when, when the FBI comes in and they indict me
*  and I take the three years probation, like, I mean, the, probably the worst thing in the world,
*  you know, other than going to prison would have been just having to just sell everything and go
*  move in and start over and sell used cars.
*  Not that there's anything wrong with selling used cars, but I just felt like, you know,
*  I just didn't want to disappoint him any more than I already had.
*  So I thought I'm going to flip houses and then I'll start maybe a development company.
*  So I'll buy some vacant lots and all this and that the problem is these houses on mine for 50,000.
*  If I fix them up and sell them, maybe I make 20, 25,000 and then you got to find a qualified
*  borrower. It's very hard to find a qualified borrower that wants to live in Ybor City back then.
*  I still think it's rough, but those same houses are going for three and 400,000.
*  So, you know, I'm buying houses. I got to, I got to get qualified borrowers.
*  I've do all the renovations.
*  It's, it's a nightmare, you know?
*  And if I, you know, looking back, it's like, okay, well, then you got to bite the bullet.
*  It's just what you have to do. I didn't want to do that.
*  I didn't want to do it, whether it was laziness or I don't know, you know, I just thought I'm
*  good at this. I'm going to run. I'm just going to start running a scam.
*  I'm going to figure out how to drive the prices up, buy the houses for 50, record them at 200,000,
*  and then have these synthetic identities, buy all the properties, refinance them,
*  pull out the cash, make six months worth of payments, let them all go into foreclosure.
*  And that really, really started working well, very well.
*  I had one time where I had a guy, it was James Red, the synthetic identity was James Red,
*  and he had bought two or three houses.
*  And there was somebody at the office who was friends of somebody
*  who knew the title company where we were closing the loans.
*  And he called that her, her name was Mary and said, Mary, this guy, James Red, like Cox is doing
*  something shady. James Red doesn't even exist. She goes and looks at the file, her last couple files,
*  and she realizes, of course, obviously, like this guy never showed up.
*  She remembers Cox picked up the files, like, and he's saying he doesn't exist.
*  So she freaks out. She calls the mortgage broker, mortgage broker calls me, mortgage broker calls me
*  up and says, listen, Mary said she's not closing the next loan unless James Red shows up.
*  And I went, wow, that's a, that's a tough one.
*  And she's like, okay, so what do you want to do? Do you want to go to another title company?
*  Like we're supposed to close in like three days, two, three days.
*  I said, well, I mean, he's going to have to show up then. I said, I'll figure it out.
*  Like, like, give me a couple of days, give me, let me figure this out.
*  And she's like, okay, well, I don't know how that's going to happen. He doesn't exist.
*  Just keep in mind at this point, I don't need IDs. I don't need a real ID.
*  I mean, I can, I figured out how to kind of make a real ID, right? Like I could make one.
*  I could take sandpaper and sand off the information on a regular ID.
*  And then I would print the, the corrected information in reverse on a piece of
*  transparency. And I would glue it over there and you could still see the holograms and stuff.
*  It actually worked pretty good. I don't know if the cops not going to,
*  it's not going to pass mustard with a cop, but somebody at the bank,
*  like I was able to go in and I would open a bank account with it. Well, so
*  one of the things I had done when I was closing these loans was I would go online and I would pick,
*  you have to pick a photo of somebody, right? To put on the, on the driver's license, right?
*  So I'm not making a fake ID for all these guys because I don't need a fake ID for all these guys,
*  not with my picture on it, but I needed a fake, I need, I need a copy of an ID,
*  but I need a picture. Where do I get the picture? So I go to Hillsborough County's
*  arrest website and I would find people that I knew that had been arrested. And so I found a guy
*  named Eric Tamargo who had been arrested. He had like, I don't know what it was,
*  the DUI or domestic violence. I forget what it was, but there was a picture of him.
*  So I print out the picture, I cut it up, I paste it onto a driver's license and I make a copy of it,
*  you know, for, for James Redd. That's what I'd been giving the title people. When I would close,
*  I'd sign all the documents and I'd leave them that copy so that it looked like they made a copy
*  for, of the, of it. And then they would notarize all the documents, even though they'd never seen
*  this person. They have a copy of his driver's license, everything's signed, Cox said he signed
*  it. It's good, notarized. Here's your check. So what I do is I think, let me see if I can get
*  Eric to do this. He's been, I knew he'd been in prison before. So I call up Eric and I remember
*  one of my buddies like, he's never going to do this. And I was like, I think he will. I think
*  he will. So that's how, and that's really that, that kind of like, you think, what do you think?
*  No, let me try. Let me call him. I don't know, bro. Like that's the kind of conversations you're
*  having. Like, but really looking back, I would love to hear the opener, a few sentences that
*  you have with him. I got, I can tell you exactly what I said, cause it's burned in my mind.
*  He comes in. So what Eric was doing at that time, he was actually working for us. He worked for
*  somebody else, but periodically we would, you know, we'd buy a house and we'd call him up.
*  We'd say, Hey, can you, you and your boss, can you guys come over and trim the trees of this house,
*  trim all the trees, take all the crap in the yard, clean it up. They go, yeah, sure. No problem.
*  Cause that's what he did. It works for like a handyman service. So they would come and they
*  clean it up and they do that. So I say, can you come over? And he was like, yeah. So he comes to
*  the office, whatever, a few hours later and he comes in the conference room. I said, Hey,
*  Eric, what's going on? And he says, uh, he says, Hey, you know, how's it going? I said, yeah. I said,
*  listen, I said, I'm going to tell you something. I need a favor. He's like, okay, cool. He's like,
*  what is it? I said, you know, all these houses we've been having you go and clean up. He's like,
*  yeah, we had that. You had, you painted that one house. You did this. Yeah. I know. I know.
*  Right. So here's what we've been doing. I've been buying these houses for $50,000 recording
*  for 200. And then I have these fake people buy them and I explained, I just lay it out for him.
*  And he's like, wow, that's he's like, that's fucking bro. That's ingenious, man. That's some,
*  that's smart. Like, wow. And you know, I was like, okay. I said, yeah, I know that's great.
*  So here's the thing. I said, the title company who's been closing some of these loans and we
*  have a closing in a couple of days, she wants this guy, James read to show up.
*  And I need someone to show up as James read. And he goes, wow. He goes, who are you going to get
*  to do that? And I was just thinking, just like, you're not understanding. I'm not confiding in
*  you because I need a friend, you know? So, and I looked at, I said, well, I was thinking you might
*  do it. He was like, that's a big favor. I said, it is a big thing. I could be in a lot of trouble.
*  I said, I know. And he goes, well, wait a minute. He was, I can't go. He said, you have to give
*  these people a driver's license. You said the driver's licenses, you were, you were using mug
*  shots. She's, you said she's closed a couple of these. She already, she's seen this guy's picture.
*  And I go, she has seen this picture. I said, the thing is for James read, I pulled the mug shot
*  offline of you when you were arrested a couple of years ago. And he jumps up and he goes,
*  you motherfucker. And I go, oh, I said, Eric, I said, wait a minute. I said, hold on, hold on.
*  I said, listen, I said, I only did that because I knew if it came down to this moment,
*  you were the only person that I knew that could pull this off, that'd have the balls to walk in
*  and do it. And he sat there and he went, yeah, you're right. You're right. And I mean, I, I,
*  bro, I don't, I couldn't believe he felt it. Listen, this guy would beat the breaks off me.
*  He was, he's like five, 10, five, 11. He's boxed. He's a big guy. So, you know, it's like,
*  I've weathered that part of the storm and he sat there and he was right. Right. And he goes, well,
*  I'm not doing it for free. I'm not doing it for nothing. I said, no, bro, of course not. I mean,
*  what, you know, what are you like, you're making a lot of money. I said, well, keep in mind a lot
*  of that money goes back in the prop property. It's not like we're walking away with, you know,
*  I think I said like tens of thousands. We're really walking away with hundreds of thousands.
*  It's not like we're walking away with a bunch of money or, you know, it's, you know, we gotta put
*  it by that. We gotta buy more properties where I keep it going. We gotta make the payments.
*  No, I know. But still I could get in a lot of trouble. I said, I understand, bro.
*  I go, well, what do you want? And I remember thinking if he asked for more than like 10 or
*  15,000, like I'll just, I'll do it myself. We'll just change title companies and we'll go and I'll
*  do it myself. And he sat there and he went, I want $500. And I went $500. Listen, I almost started
*  laughing. I mean, I was like, I put my hand over my, I was like $500. It's, it's, it's going to
*  take you 30 minutes. And he's like, he's like, I don't care, bro. I get in a lot of trouble.
*  I was like, oh, well, yeah, I'm not paying you now. You got to sign first. And he's like, oh,
*  you know, I'll sign. I'll sign. I know you're good for it. I know you're right. He did for 500 bucks.
*  I made a fake ID for him. He goes in to the place. He signs James Redd.
*  Comes out. What was funny about that was when we walked into the title company,
*  we're sitting in the, in the lobby and Mary comes walking out. She looks at me. She goes,
*  Mr. Crocs, I don't know why you're here. She goes, I told Kelly that was the broker. She goes,
*  I told the broker that I'm not closing the loan unless, unless James Redd shows up.
*  And Eric stands up on cue and he goes, I'm James Redd. And she was like,
*  and she goes, hold on a second. She runs in the back, comes back with a file, opens it up,
*  looks at the picture and she's like, oh, I'm, I'm so sorry. Give me five minutes. I'll, I'll,
*  I've got the file. I prints up the docs. He goes in signs. And when we're there,
*  she's passing out the checks. 5,000 here, 25,000 here, 35,000 here, 7,000 here, 6,000 here.
*  So he sees all these checks and I'm like, Oh, I, I got that. I, and then the construction company,
*  no, no, no, I have that. I'm, I'll take care of that. I'll take care of that. So I get all the
*  checks and I leave. We go sit in my Audi and he sits down and he's like, bro, there's a lot of
*  money. There's a lot of that money goes back into the properties, Eric. And he's like, I still, bro.
*  And I said, um, and I counted out 500 bucks, but listen, a week later we had another closing.
*  So I, he comes in, I said, Hey bro, he's, Hey, what's going on? And I said, uh, I need you to do
*  the James Red thing. He was, yeah, I've been thinking about that. I did that way too cheap.
*  I said, I get it, man. Well, how much do you want? What do you want? And I'm thinking if it's,
*  if it's more than 10 or 15, I'll do it myself. And he sits there and he goes,
*  I want a thousand dollars. I got a thousand dollars. Oh my God. So, uh, I gave him a thousand
*  dollars and he did another one. And, uh, but by that point it was like five or six, we'd done five
*  or six with that guy. And after five or six plus the credit cards, plus, you know, all the other
*  things, like their credit scores start dropping. You know, if it was 700 now it's down to like
*  600 and at 600, you couldn't really borrow enough to make it worth it. So I got, I have other people
*  in the wings waiting. So, um, you know, we would just, we'd go out and I'd run up the credit cards
*  and, and pull them as much money, pull all the money out of the, out of the banks and close the
*  accounts and then stop paying. And you said a lot of people knew. So he was one of the people that
*  he was one of the people. Why do you think nobody said anything? Well, I mean, I think everybody was
*  making money. The appraiser at that time, I had an appraiser. Eventually I ordered the appraisal
*  software and I just start doing the appraisal myself. Like why give this guy 500 bucks? Um,
*  so- So you were doing the appraisal yourself. How's that possible? How's that? Is there a check
*  against it? Is there- There is. It's funny. Nobody ever questions that. You actually have to have a
*  license to get the appraisal software. So I get an appraisers that we're working with. I get her license
*  and I, I, I, uh, create a, um, an email address as her. Uh, so it was a synthetic appraiser. Right.
*  It was a real person, but I ended up ordering the appraisal software by, by, um, emailing,
*  uh, it was called Alamo, Alamo appraisal software. So, uh, I ended up emailing them as her and they
*  go, well, we can't give you, we can't sell you the software unless we, we need a copy of your
*  license. Boom, here's your license. So I sent her the, I send, uh, then the license and then
*  we paid for it with a credit card. You know, you could go get like a green dot card. You go put
*  500 bucks on it or a thousand. The software was like 1500 bucks or something. So you pick him
*  like back then, you know, it was a long time ago. So 1500 bucks, they mail it to us and now I've got
*  the software. So now I can, you know, I can do the appraisals myself. What stops you from appraising
*  it? Not for 200,000, but even more. There's no comparable sales. So no matter what you sent to
*  the bank, they're going to look at it. Like they're going to have a, their appraiser is going to do a
*  desktop review. He's going to go online. He's going to check to make sure all the appraised,
*  all of the comparable sales are sold for what you said they sold for are the same square footage.
*  We're built what the pictures look like, where, how far they are. They use them to double check
*  everything. But you know, he's some guy who's on salary and he does, you know, whatever, 40 or 50
*  of these a day or something. It doesn't take them long. And so it's cheaper that way where we pay
*  for the appraiser, the whole thing. Got it. So everybody's getting paid. Right. And so at this
*  point I'm doing that, right? You know, and I'm getting caught periodically. Can you give an
*  example? What do you mean getting caught? I'm living in Tampa Heights, which is right next to
*  Ybor City in Tampa. Right. So this is all, these are all like little suburbs of Tampa and they're
*  all built back in the 1920s, right? 1890s, 1910, 1920. So I've, I've bought this eight unit building.
*  I renovated it into a triplex. I mean, I'm driving an Audi. I'm dating a woman that I should not have
*  been dating. I mean, I don't know what she was thinking. So I'm, you know, I'm going on
*  vacations. Like everything, life's good. So, but every once in a while, you know, like we're,
*  you know, where things happen, you get a phone call. Hey, this is what just happened. And I,
*  one time I got a phone call from same broker, Kelly. Kelly called me up and said, listen,
*  we got a problem. This was, I want to say this was Alan Duncan. This was one of the first ones
*  that I had done. Right. We used him, but, and so he, so she calls me up and says, listen,
*  Alan Duncan never made his first mortgage payment. And I had a friend of mine or one of my
*  co-defendants. When we closed on that loan, we both got checks for whatever, 40 or 50 grand. Keep
*  mind, we're also buying some of this money is going into a business account. We're buying
*  property whereby, so it's not like I'm pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars or even, you
*  know, even 20 or $30,000 on every closing. I'm more like I'm getting 25, 10, 20, and this guy's
*  getting 10 and this guy's getting 15. And then we're taking 60 and we're putting it into the
*  business account. We're buying a bunch of vacant lots or we're building some new houses. So we're
*  trying to kind of take all this and turn it into a development company.
*  But we still have to pay our bills. So, you know, my buddy's got to go to, he's got to go to
*  Amsterdam at least for two weeks, you know, he's from Belgium. That's, you apparently have to do
*  that at least once a year. So he, he was, so when I gave him his check, the check, I said, look,
*  you're going to make the pay. Here's like 20 grand or 15 grand, but you've got to make the
*  payments on this thing for the next six months. He was no problem. I said, okay.
*  So she calls me up a month and a half later and says, hey, Alan Duncan did not,
*  did not make his first payment. And I went, oh, oh my God. And I, I, and he was actually renting
*  the apartment downstairs for me. So I run downstairs and I opened the door and I go, bro, I'm like,
*  did you make Duncan's payment? And he turns around and he's like, is it due? And I was like, oh my
*  God. So I run back, you know, I grabbed the phone. I'm like, he didn't make it. He didn't make it.
*  She's like, okay, well, here's what's happening. The account executive is calling. They've got the
*  file and it was called Southstar bank. Southstar bank has it. They're reviewed it. They've already
*  been ordering documents. They, they, they're saying that this guy, they're sitting, there's a
*  problem. They are, it's, it's, it's falling apart. Like the whole thing's falling. They, they know
*  something's wrong, but they don't know exactly what it's just something suspicious. She didn't
*  tell me that on the phone. Like she, she's saying there's something wrong. They're freaking out.
*  Cause the account executive didn't really know. She just got a phone call saying, Hey, have you
*  ever met this, this broker? Did she meet the guy? Who is the guy? He hasn't paid. We're calling the
*  cell. Nobody's answering. And really most of this was, was my buddy Rudy's fault. He's just not doing
*  any of this stuff. He, any of the things he's supposed to be doing. So we go to the office and
*  I call Southstar bank. Uh, I get the secretary and I said, look, I need to talk to whatever the guy,
*  the big guy was. It was one of them was like the president and one was like the somebody else.
*  Anyway, vice president. So I said, I need to talk to so-and-so, the vice president. And she says,
*  I'm sorry, he's in a business meeting. I said, well, listen, tell him this is Alan Duncan.
*  Like, you need to go tell him is Alan Duncan's on the phone right now. I'm assure you he wants to
*  talk to me. And she's like, all right, hold on. And I mean like 20 seconds later, you know, speaker
*  phone. Hey, Mr. Uh, Mr. Duncan, uh, this is so-and-so and, uh, you know, I'm here with the, uh,
*  with our lawyer and the president of the bank and our head of fraud. We were just discussing you.
*  I was like, okay. Um, I understand that you guys are, uh, I haven't made my first payment. I said,
*  it actually came back in the mail. I had the wrong address. That was completely my fault.
*  And I apologize. I said, but I can get your cashier's check today. I will overnight it.
*  No problem. Uh, hope that's going to be okay. I stayed. They said, way, we're way past that
*  way past that. I said, okay. Um, well, what's, what's the issue? And they were like, I mean,
*  look, to be honest, I don't think I'm talking to Alan Duncan. I don't think there is an Alan Duncan.
*  He's like, I mean, your social security number was issued a couple of years ago. Um, the, we
*  called the bank. Um, and, and this was why we had gone with like South or Sun trust bank, right? So
*  it was a real bank. So it wasn't our normal bank. And they called, they don't, they don't have any
*  record of you. And I was like, well, I've never been happy with Southstar bank there. If you know,
*  it sounds like a banking error. Um, and they're, and they're like, yeah, I don't think this isn't
*  cute. He says, I don't think I'm talking to Alan Duncan right now. Right. And you were
*  terrified, terrified. I'm, but you have to be playing it cool. I guess. I mean, I know what am
*  I going to say? No, you're talking to Matt Cox. Like, I can't say that. Like I'm just gotta keep
*  running with it. Just like, okay, well look, you know, and he's like, you know, we called the DMV
*  this, you know, they don't have a list for you in the, in the, you know, in their website. Uh,
*  we think that the, uh, you know, we don't think you exist. You know, we're still waiting for a
*  phone call back from who, so and so and so and so. And I'm just like, oh my God. And I said, um,
*  have you called, have you called the authorities yet? And they were like, no, we haven't, but once
*  we put our file together, we will. And then the head of the fraud department, they said, oh,
*  by the way, Mr. I forget his name, but the head of the fraud department,
*  worked for the FBI for like 10 years or something or 12 years. And I, and I, so I mean, I'm just
*  like, and by the way, the appra, uh, the broker is there and my buddy Rudy is there. And I mean,
*  they're, he's pacing the room. She's in tears, crying like there. And I'm like, okay, well,
*  fellas, I say, where's this headed? Where's this going? What are we doing? And, and they, so they're,
*  they're kind of chuckling and joking about it. And I remember being like, thinking, what's the
*  deal? Like it's weird. And I said, look, why don't I just, let me just pay you back. They said,
*  ah, we'll, we'll, we'll get the money. We're not worried about it. I said, you don't seem worried
*  about the money, about getting any of them the money back. Like don't, why don't you just let me,
*  I'll cut you a check. I can get you the money back. Like what are I owed him? Like 150 or
*  something. I forget exactly. It was nothing. Like I owe you 150,000. Let me cut your check for 150,000.
*  And they were like, no, no, you know, that's a, we'll get the money back when we foreclosed on the
*  property. And that's when I was like, oh, they think the property is worth like $195,000 or
*  something. And I went, oh, I said, I understand. Okay. I said, do you have the appraisal in front
*  of you? And they were like, yeah. And I said, open it up. I said, take a look at comp number one.
*  That's owned by a guy named Lee Black. Comp number two, you know, is owned by, you know,
*  whatever David silver or whatever the names were. And I'm like, you know, like black, silver, red.
*  I said, I am all those people. And I said, let me tell you what I've done. And I tell them just
*  laid out. Boom, boom, boom, boom. I said, so you can call the FBI, but you're not going to get all
*  your money back or you can let me give you your money back. And we can let this, we let sleeping
*  dogs lie. The whole thing goes away. I apologize. You know, I had every intention of making all the
*  payments. It's a glitch. You caught me. No, my bad. And so these guys are all just like, oh my God.
*  Like now they're, they put me on hold. They're looking through the file. They come back. And I
*  remember at some point we go back, forth, back, forth. And finally they come back and they said,
*  listen, you sell the money. I said, yeah. Well, first they come back. They threatened me. Oh,
*  well, when the F we give us to the FBI, you're, I said, that's not true. I said, the money was
*  deposited into a bank account. It has since been moved. The bank account bank account has been
*  closed. It's been removed in cash. That money is gone. You will never see that money. I will be
*  cutting you. If I pay you back at all, that'll be from another account. And so the FBI agent
*  ends up saying he's right. Even if we caught him red handed, the likelihood that any of these funds
*  will be ever be recouped is zero. Like there's almost no money's ever recouped. And so we end
*  up, they put me on hold again. They come back and they go, how quickly can you get us a cashier's
*  check? And I go like that day I go get them a cashier's check overnight. The cashier's check.
*  They never called the FBI. They never did anything. Now at that point we actually ditched that whole
*  that James or Alan Duncan. I remember at that point we went to the mall, ran up all the credit
*  cards and just threw everything away and walked away because it was shot. You know, that whole,
*  that guy was shot. I think we borrowed whatever $800,000 or $900,000 in his name.
*  With the banks, it's really, really all about the money.
*  Listen, when I go on the run, I got one where I was caught so red handed. It's insane how bad it was.
*  And listen, that's nothing. I got caught by Washington Mutual one time. I was caught by
*  Washington Mutual where we had done six owner occupied duplexes. So if you say you're going to
*  live in a house, you can get about 95% financing. But if it's an investment property, you got to
*  put down 20%. You get about 80% financing. So a buddy of mine who was a sheriff's deputy,
*  we had his wife buy, I'm going to say six owner occupied duplexes saying she lived in every single
*  one of them. Well, you can't own or occupy six dwellings. Like that's fraud. Now granted,
*  her W-2s and pay stubs were correct, but she didn't put the down payments down. Even the down
*  payments we didn't put down. We actually got cash back. But months later, they called a lawyer from
*  Washington Mutual, ends up calling the mortgage broker and saying that they ended up with two
*  of the owner occupied duplexes because Washington Mutual had a credit line extended to one of the
*  lenders who'd lend the money. So it actually was Washington Mutual. So it was a couple months later
*  when they went to sell it and they package them together and sell them. They realized we have the
*  same customer with two duplexes side by side, both owner occupied. This is fraud. So she comes in,
*  she tells me, oh my gosh, this lawyer's on the phone. This is what happened. I'm like, oh, wow,
*  this is horrible. I end up getting on the phone with him. We have a conversation and I'm like,
*  you know, he's like, look, you know, this is a big deal. We could call the FBI. I'm like, look,
*  who knows who was involved in this? Maybe somebody on your side was involved. Maybe somebody on my
*  side. I don't know what my mortgage broker did. I'll deal with her on my own. Why don't you just
*  let us refinance the properties? Not only did we talk him into allowing us to refinance the properties,
*  he gave us a reduced balance of what we owed him because we couldn't borrow enough to pay him off.
*  So they took like a $20,000 hit just to refinance those properties. Never called the FBI,
*  never did anything. It was absolutely fraud. I had a broker one time we got caught with over
*  a million dollars in loans that he had done that were fraudulent. Pinnacle Bancorp, which was out
*  of Chicago, the owner called me and he was like, look, your mortgage broker did this. Like there
*  was a bunch of canceled checks. They were fake canceled checks. So they looked like they had
*  run through the bank for somebody's rent, but they hadn't. Does that make sense? Like you pay your
*  rent, they deposit it, it goes to the bank and they've got all the numbers and everything.
*  Well, I had a bunch that were blank that all you had to do was fill out your borrowers information
*  and then you cut and pasted his name and his address at the upper left-hand corner. You make
*  a copy of it. It looks like canceled checks. We had 24 of them. Well, one of my brokers was using
*  them for all of his files. Like even if the person really had a rental history, he didn't want to
*  order it. He just did this. It was easier. It's faster. Yeah. Yeah. Just wow. So they catch a
*  million dollars worth of loans. They called me up and then they caught another million dollars,
*  but they had already sold them to household bank. So while I'm on the phone with the owner,
*  his name is Gary and we're talking, he's like, look, this is what we found. This is this. This
*  is what happened. And I remember I said, Gary, at the end of this conversation, if you think I'm
*  cutting you a check for a million dollars, I said, I just don't have it. They don't have it.
*  This is when I owned the mortgage company. And he says, no, I'm asking you for your
*  word that if any of these come back on us, they're in Florida, they're in your area.
*  You'll help us get rid of the properties. You'll we'll foreclose. We're going to have to resell
*  them. I don't want to be flying down there. Just help us get rid of them. I said, absolutely. Of
*  course. No problem. I said, what about the, I said, well, what are you going to do with them? He
*  was, well, they're going to be a part of a package, like a $3 million package. We're selling to
*  household bank. The other ones they had caught had already been sold. The ethical thing to do
*  is to contact household banks, say we will buy those back. We're going to take care of it.
*  It's not what happened. In fact, Gary flew down a couple of weeks later, took me and several of the
*  brokers, not that broker, but several of the brokers out to dinner, had a few drinks, and he
*  openly admitted, he's like, look, I don't care if all the loans have fraud in them, as long as they
*  don't come back on me. That's what I'm concerned about. Cause there's a clawback clause for one
*  year. He's like, so if they can perform for one year, I don't care. That was it.
*  How many people in the industry do you think are operating like this?
*  And by like this, I mean in the aforementioned gray area.
*  I would say there's probably after like the, like after the 2008 financial crisis,
*  I would say it cleaned up considerably, but I would say at this point it's just as bad as it ever
*  was. And keep in mind, a lot of the loans that caused the problems were like, they called them
*  liar loans or no qualification, no quality loans, right? No income. Well, those loans, they exist
*  again. There are subprime companies that are doing that again. I don't think they call them
*  subprime anymore. They call them, so they got some other name. Yeah, they rebranded a little bit,
*  but it's happening all over again. It just seems the whole real estate
*  slash banking system is very prone to this kind of corruption. I mean, but how can you fix it?
*  Like if a lot of the things they fixed, a lot of the manipulation they fixed, but if you tighten it
*  too much, then the average person can't get a loan. And the thing is some of these loans,
*  sometimes changing a W-2, should that person have gotten into that house? No, he shouldn't have.
*  He didn't qualify, but he makes all of his payments. So it's like, is it a fraudulent loan? Yeah,
*  but it performs. So I think that I would say that I forget what the FBI statistic was. It was like
*  20% or 30% prior to the financial crisis. It was like 20 or 30% of like bank loans they were
*  saying that contained some kind of fraud, even if it was just a lie. If you want to cut 30% out of
*  the, that's a ton. That's a ton. So you're on probation and you're doing these,
*  you're almost getting caught. You're almost getting caught and you're doing these really
*  large scale scams. How does it get to the point where you're on the run?
*  So I'm doing multiple scams, right? So it's not just that I'm doing the scams with the
*  Reservoir Dog scams, right? I'm not just doing those guys. I'm also creating
*  other identities because I've got other people that are involved. They want to do a scam.
*  So this chick I was dating, she wanted to run a scam. So I set up a scam. It's semi-complicated,
*  but the bottom line is she ends up stealing a real person. We steal a real person's identity.
*  I have a real person's identity. We get a driver's license in her name, open up some bank accounts,
*  go rent a piece of property in her name. And I transfer the deed or the deed from the property
*  out of the real owner's name. I transfer it into her stolen identity. We then refinance the house
*  like three or four times. And so she starts going to these different closings and she's,
*  her name is Allison and she's pretending to be a Puerto Rican woman named Rosie De Perez.
*  Allison has brown hair and blue eyes. Rosie De Perez clearly doesn't. So Allison, when we make
*  the ID, she dyes her hair black, curls it a little bit and gets the pictures taken of herself.
*  But before she goes to the first closing to get a check for like $100,000,
*  we've got like three of these scheduled. She changes her hair color. She dyes it back like
*  a dirty blonde and she goes to the first closing and she gets a check. She checks for $100,000,
*  let's say. I don't know what it was like, 95 or 105, whatever, roughly $100,000. She gets a check
*  at the closing. They give it to her. We then go to the next closing. Well, at the next closing,
*  the title person has her sign all the documents, but she's looking at her like something's not
*  right. Looks at her ID, makes a copy of the ID, looks at it and says, this doesn't look like you.
*  And she's like, you know, you don't look Hispanic. And she's like, I'm half Hispanic.
*  I'm half Hispanic. And she's like, you don't, but keep in mind the photograph was her.
*  So she's saying this doesn't look like you, but it's her. Granted, she had the curly hair a little
*  bit, but that's it. So Allison is like, it's me. And she's like, look, I'm not going to cut you,
*  I'm not going to give you the check. I'm going to let you sign the documents. You know, we can get
*  the check. I'll let you know. So she goes, gets in my car. She said, yeah, listen, there's a problem.
*  So we're driving down the road. She explains it to me. I realized, you know, okay, that's done.
*  It's over. We're not going back. She's like, what about the other closing? No, no, no more closings.
*  We're done. And, and I, you know, and it was probably more of a yell, screaming and yelling,
*  like, what the hell did you do? Why I told you not to change your hair. Why would you change
*  your hair? Like that, when she came in, like the day before and I was like, what did you do?
*  What did you do? And she's like, I changed my hair. What's the big deal? It's still me.
*  Sure enough. You know, and that's like, it's not that I knew that that was going to happen,
*  but why tempt fate? How'd you meet Alison? Like, she was a mortgage broker. Okay. And I had done
*  some fraudulent. She needed, she worked for another mortgage company. Sorry. She worked for another
*  mortgage company. She couldn't get a loan closed. The owner of that mortgage company called me and
*  said, look, we got a loan. We need it closed. And I said, great. And I, when guys would call me,
*  I'd say, great, I'll come pick it up. I'll give you a $300 or a $500 referral fee. No, no,
*  it's a couple hundred thousand dollars. We want to close it. Well, if you then close it.
*  Well, I can't close it. We need a W-2 or we need this. We need that. We can't figure out how to do
*  it. So I go over there and typically I convince them to just give it to me. It's not going to close.
*  She was, she was, she was, you'd have to see this chick. She was gorgeous.
*  She was gorgeous. Very flirtatious. Made me feel like I was thin and handsome. So, um,
*  like she gets whatever she wants. Um, so I'm like, okay, look, here's what you do. And I explained
*  to her, do this, do this, do this, send it here. It'll close. And she, we closed it. Well, then she
*  starts calling me, right? Hey, how's it going? We go to lunch. Next thing you know, we start sleeping
*  together. She realizes what's happening. She says, I want to, I want in on this. So now we do the
*  closings. We're on our way. I say, look, that check's dead. What she was, what about the other,
*  the other one? I go, no, no, it's all dead. We're walking away. Now that was easy for me to say,
*  because for me, I had money. She's going through a divorce. She's broke. You know, like none of
*  this did I take into consideration at the time, by the way, to me, it's like, nah, that's dead.
*  We're done. Uh, we'll start over again. Well, and she's to her in her mind, she was about to make
*  we were getting probably that was a million dollar scam. She was about to end up getting,
*  you know, whatever it was, half or one third of half a million dollars in the next week.
*  Now she's got nothing. So, um, she says, look, let's at least cash this one.
*  And I had a buddy named Travis Hayes who had been, you know, we actually were,
*  we've been friends since high school. We were like best friends, right? Really close friends
*  in high school. We were still close. Travis was running a scan, a scam. This one with hers was in
*  Clearwater. His was in Orlando. So I'm all, I'm getting on all over the state at this point.
*  Right. So he's running an Orlando scam. That's already yielded half a million, maybe more.
*  He's still pulling. We're still refinancing properties, right? So he's about to close on
*  another half a million dollars worth of properties. He's got a bank account that's open. She says,
*  let's give it to Travis, have him deposit it in his account. He's already pulled out like 300,000
*  out of the account. And she's like, shouldn't be a problem. I was like, um, no, no, no. And she's,
*  let me call him. She calls him. I think I called him and I explained the situation. He's, do you
*  think it's okay? And I said, no, I don't think it's okay. I don't think it's okay at all. And he's
*  like, no, it's not a big deal. Um, just give me the, give me the check. So I give him the check.
*  He goes, he deposits the check. They say they're going to hold it till it clears. You know, that
*  was kind of a thing back then. Um, it takes, I don't know. I don't know how long it took, five
*  days, six days, whatever it was, he was supposed to go back and it would have cleared and he would
*  have been able to start pulling money out. And so I call him one day cause Allison's bugging me. So
*  I call him and I go, Hey, where are you at? He goes, I'm actually on my way to Orlando.
*  And I said, Oh, okay. So you let Allison know I'm not getting any money. He said the bank manager
*  called and said that because the check was over a hundred thousand dollars, they have to witness me
*  endorsing the back of the check or they had to see my something. Right. And for me to come in,
*  I'm like, Whoa, I said something's wrong. Something's wrong. Don't go to the bank. Um,
*  what do you think's wrong? I think of the cops are waiting for you. That's what I think's wrong.
*  And he goes, no, the cops aren't, he goes, man, I'm in the parking lot right now. I just pulled
*  in the parking lot. There's no cops. I'm like, they're not going to be in squat cars. Like,
*  then he's like, no, he said, it's fine. You're overreacting bro. And I'll never forget what he
*  said. He said, you're shaking like a little girl, bro. Calm down. I got this. I'm cool with the
*  manager. Like the manager, like because you've chopped it up with the manager, he's going to
*  let your fraudulent check go through. So he walks in, the cops are in there. They locked the door.
*  This told me later, you know, they closed the door, locked it. The cops are in there. They grab him
*  and they bring him downtown. He didn't say anything. He won't say anything. That's not true,
*  by the way. Um, but he's so he is where he told me he wouldn't say anything. I told him I'm not
*  talking to you coppers. Oh, he told you, but he actually did. He actually did talk to him. So, um,
*  he, what he ends up doing, what ends up happening is we can't get in touch with him.
*  Yeah. So we're calling and calling, calling. And then finally I decide, you know what? I'm not
*  going to call his cell phone anymore. I'm going to call the name of the person he was, um, the
*  synthetic identities number, right? So I go and I call the synthetic identities number. I call and
*  I say somebody answers and I go, Hey, is so-and-so there? And he said, and it's a gruff
*  authoritarian voice, you know, it's, this is law and for any, and he's like, no, who's this?
*  And he's, and he's like, no, who's this? He has no, he has no, this is officer. So-and-so who's
*  this? And I go, I was like, Oh, this is Lee black. I said, he said, he was, how do you know? So-and-so
*  I was like, Oh, no, no click. And I just hung up and I called for like a payphone. So I turned
*  around and I said, he got arrested. And then later on that night, he showed up on the, the county
*  website, you know, the, the arrest website showing he had been arrested.
*  And the next day he calls me and he asked me to get them out of jail. Like, Hey, I, you gotta go.
*  So I have to give his brother-in-law money. You know, we get them out on jail. He actually got
*  out for bailing. Yeah. He got out for like nothing. And here's where I should have known,
*  like he was cooperating. It went from like $300,000 bond down to like $10,000. So it's a thousand
*  bucks. So right then I didn't know it at the time, but obviously that means we're going to let him
*  out of jail where he's cooperating. So they let them out of jail. I go and I get them a lawyer,
*  a state, this was state by the way, it wasn't federal. So I get them a lawyer for like $15,000.
*  I, he comes, you know, he comes here, of course he tells me, look, they asked me a bunch of
*  questions. I told them that, you know, I, that he, you know, he made up some story about there's an,
*  he's working with another guy, but he doesn't know the guy's name. He made up a name. Like there's a
*  whole, he has this whole kind of thing where he tells them about me, but not me. And he's like,
*  and then, you know, the, the numbers, none of the numbers led anywhere. So they all lead to cell
*  phones that are only being used for those scams. So it's a dead alley or blind alley. And I'm like,
*  okay, okay. And I mean, I'm paying him like he's coming in, man, I, my truck's no good. I need
*  another truck. I buy him another truck. Hey man, my, the electric's going to get turned off and I
*  don't have, I'm sorry. I need a thousand dollars. Of course. Here's a thousand dollars. I don't know
*  what I was, I'm embarrassed. You had to ask, here's a thousand, you know, a week later, you know,
*  he needs 2000 for this, a thousand for this, 2000 for this. He wants to start a tree trimming
*  company. He needs to buy a tree trimmer. How much are those? 5,000 of course, that's fine. 10. So
*  I give him another 25,000 starts like a tree trimming business, which he runs to this day.
*  Okay. What I don't know is that, you know, the whole time he's actually working with a task
*  force that's been put together. This is state at this point. It's a state task force, because
*  there's multiple counties involved at this point. And it wasn't hard for him to explain like this,
*  this is, this comes back to reservoir dogs. I got a much, all he had to say to the officers was,
*  listen, you got to let me go. I can't do any prison time. I'm going to tell you about a much,
*  much bigger scam. And they go, okay, well, how can you prove that scam? Pull up Hillsborough County,
*  Hillsborough County's tax appraiser website. Okay. Look up the name James Red. Look, all of these
*  were bought six months ago. Six months later, they're all in foreclosure. Pull up Lee Black.
*  All of these were bought. Look, six months later, all of them are foreclosure. Hey, pull up James
*  Red. You pull up Brandon Green. Pull up. So all of these are going in foreclosure. I mean, it's,
*  so it's like, you know, that what I thought was so cute, not cute, it was just stupid. And so he,
*  very quickly, they put together a task force. He's working with them on the task force. And
*  we're still buying houses, flipping houses, doing everything. Cause I'm, I believe him, I believe
*  he's not, you know, he's saying, look, if I have to go to jail for, you know, a year or so, like,
*  you know, and he's also paying, you know, he hasn't paid them back yet, but he, but we're saying he
*  can pay them back. Like, it's like, look, if we get to the point, you know, when we get to that point,
*  like we'll pay them back. Um, but we haven't paid them back yet. Cause we have no way to show where
*  that money came from. We can always go to like one of his relatives and give, give his dad 40 grand,
*  give his mom 20 grand, you know, that kind of stuff and start putting money that way.
*  And all that money was taken out in cash too. So we could always show up with a chunk in cash
*  regardless. You know, it's still in the process. And I think that we're still in the process and
*  it could be six months or a year away because it's a slow thing. I've already been through the
*  process my first time when I got in trouble and it was a year, but from the time that I was
*  spoken to until I pled guilty and was sentenced. So, um, I'm not concerned about it. Well,
*  that's happening. We're still flipping properties. And one day
*  I have a buddy named Steve Sutton. Remember the sheriff's deputy and keep in mind, it's funny
*  because like I've done bad loans for police officers, sheriffs, um, lawyers, doctors,
*  like, you know, across to everybody across these aren't like all, you know, guys that, you know,
*  these aren't all like, you know, construction workers or guys that work in your mechanics
*  or something. These are like the legitimate, these are legitimate people that have credit
*  problems or whatever the case may be. So one day I'm sitting at work and, and
*  I'd been getting phone calls for the prior week from people at title companies saying, hey, Matt,
*  wanted to let you know, we just had some subpoenas served on several of your files.
*  And I'm concerned like that had me concerned. Then a guy named Jeff Testerman starts making
*  phone calls. Jeff Testerman is a reporter for the St. Petersburg times. He's calling
*  people saying, Hey, um, I know, notice that you sold a piece of property to Lee Black. Have you ever
*  met Mr. Black? He seems like, and they're like just hanging up on him or saying, no, I don't know what
*  you're talking about. I'm not sure what that guy's name was. Let me call you back. I'm getting phone
*  calls from people. So I know something's up with the newspaper. Now. Now I know something's being
*  looked at, but nobody's really talking. I know that there are subpoenas being, um, being served.
*  And I'm nervous, you know, I'm very concerned. And then one day I'm in my office and the sheriff's
*  deputy walks in Steve Sutton in his uniform too, which everybody always stiffened, you know, when
*  he would walk in. So he walks in, I go, Steve, I said, what's going on in his head. And usually
*  he's jolly and laughs and stuff. And he goes, and he says, uh, I got to talk to you outside.
*  I was like, okay. I walk outside. What's up? And he says, uh, I used to date this girl. She's
*  like the Tampa police department or something. Right. I was like, okay. He said, she showed up
*  at my house this morning at like six o'clock in the morning. I went, okay. He said, she said that
*  she's been working on a task force. And he said, apparently one of your buddies got arrested in
*  Orlando. Uh, they're investigating some other thing in Clearwater. Uh, they're investigating
*  a ton of properties here in, in, uh, Ebor Tampa Heights. And I mean, there's like a hundred
*  properties involved and my name came up because you've sold some properties to me,
*  which I had. And he's like, so she came to me and said, look, your buddy Cox, he said, and I go,
*  I was like, okay. He goes, he said, well, the task force is on you. And she said to stop talking to
*  you because they're going to come arrest you in a couple of days. They just handed over the task
*  force findings to the, to the FBI and the FBI is going to come arrest you in a couple of days.
*  And she said not to talk to you because, and because you're, you're going to cooperate
*  and because all white collar guys cooperate. So she thinks you're going to cooperate and,
*  and not to talk to you because she's afraid you're going to get me hemmed up. And she said just to
*  walk away. And he was like, so I thought you should know. And I was like, okay. And he said,
*  what are you going to do? I said, oh, you know, I don't know. Um, well, first he said, what,
*  what should I do? And I go, tell them, tell them that I arranged all the loans for you.
*  You came in, you signed the paperwork. I filled out all the documents. You signed the paperwork.
*  You, you know, I arranged everything. I'm like, you're not a mortgage broker. You don't know if
*  this is legit. Like you sign, you have perfect credit. You signed the paperwork. You walked away
*  with a check for 30,000. You don't know. And he was like, cause he did it because he had a job.
*  He was a sheriff's deputy. Like I'm not a, you know, I went in, I applied, I applied for a loan
*  at a bank. They said, if we can buy, you can buy the house and we'll give you $30,000. So of course
*  I'm going to do that. You know, that's not going to happen, but he doesn't know he's, and I said,
*  just tell them, yeah, I'll tell them you'll cooperate. Like, absolutely. Um, he's, what are
*  you going to do? I said, me, I said, I'm, I'm leaving, bro. I'm leaving. I said, I can't, I
*  can't stay here. I can't go to prison. Like I was just sentenced. I'm on federal probation right now.
*  Like the judge isn't going to be cool with me getting popped again. Like, I mean, he,
*  I can't do it. Can't do it. I said, I'm leaving. Can't go to prison. I'm adorable, bro. Like,
*  you know, I can't, I saw Shawshank redemption. I know what's going to happen. I can't, yeah,
*  I can't do that. That's not going to happen. Like I can't, you know, I can't, I'm not going to
*  defend myself against a guy who's six foot three and tatted up. No. So, and you know, and I can't,
*  I'm not going, I'm no benefit to a gang. Like I'm not, I'm a nonviolent, you know,
*  soft white collar criminal. So I was just like, uh, I was like, yeah, I'm leaving, bro. I'm leaving.
*  So I actually went home. Well, actually I was able to, I started cutting checks to people, right?
*  So I cut checks to, uh, Allison, to Johnny, to like everybody I could think of here's 5,000,
*  here's 7,000, here's 8,000, here's six, here's nine, and had them go into all these different
*  bank accounts, pulling out cash. But this is like a Thursday at four o'clock. So the next day they
*  show up with cash, write some more checks. They go again. I get about 80 grand in cash. That's all
*  I can get. Um, I, I, I go home that night. I start packing my bags and I was dating this,
*  this chick named, uh, Rebecca Halk. We've been dating about a month and she shows up at my house.
*  You know, I hadn't returned her phone calls all day and apparently we're supposed to go out and
*  I'd forgotten about it. I had bigger issues. And so I'm packing a couple of duffel bags and she
*  walks in and she's like, what's going on? I'm like, um, I'm leaving. Where are you going? I thought
*  we were supposed to go out at such and go do something tonight. I'm like, I'm leaving. It's
*  over. And, and she says, what happened? I tell her what happened. This is what happened. She's
*  like, Oh my God. Like she had no idea. She had no idea about anything you were doing. No, I barely
*  knew her. Like, I mean, she's coming over two, three times a week for a month. Like I've, you know,
*  this isn't love. This isn't, you know, this is a booty call. That's all it is. Like we're hanging
*  out, we're having sex and that's it. I don't even know you. So she suddenly just begs
*  to come with me. You got to bring me with you. You have to this, you have to that. I'm like,
*  what are you talking about? Like you've got a, you've got a son. You have your mom lives here.
*  You're and she's just in tears and crying. And she suddenly said, and this is what's so funny
*  about it is that she had just moved from Vegas to, to, um, St. Petersburg to work at the dog
*  track, to work for a company that owned the drug track, right? The casino interest or a,
*  yeah, like a gambling company. And, uh, she said, you don't even know why I'm here.
*  I was like, okay, why are you here? She said, I'm here because I was working for a law firm
*  that worked for the, the, um, casino company that I worked for. She said, I got caught
*  embezzling nothing. It was like 10 or $15,000 from my boss
*  because she had a gambling habit. And she said, he didn't call the police because we were sleeping
*  together and he was afraid his wife would find out. She said, so instead he banished me here to
*  St. Pete. My son just came to live with me. He's been caught sneaking out, uh, because he, her,
*  the father had raised him. He'd only been living with her since she got to Florida. And she's like,
*  I was about, I was going to send him back. He's failing school. He's smoking pot. He'd been caught
*  sneaking out after curfew. I'm like, okay, I don't know any of this. She's like, he was going back
*  in December. No, no, no, he was going back after the school year, which would have been like May.
*  Okay. And I'm like, so where before five minutes earlier, I thought she was this sweet secretary,
*  sweet, innocent secretary. And she's like, you know, I've been married three times. I am a gambler.
*  I've blamed bankruptcy. I'm sleeping with my old boss. I got like, you know, she went from this,
*  you know, thieving adulteress, you know, and I thought these are all really beneficial to my,
*  you know, my future plans. Yeah. You know, and I shouldn't have at that moment, you know, I was so
*  just flipped out and concerned and up and leaving your life and everything, you know, behind.
*  That's a, that's terrifying. And, you know, and, and so now you're alone in a strange place.
*  Is that the first time you've done something like that, like leave to go on the road?
*  Yes. So I never just up and moved and keep in mind now I can't call home. I can't like I'm,
*  I'm leaving. There are things that I feel like get you caught and every, you know,
*  I've watched tons of these TV shows and you know, there are certain things that get you caught.
*  And, you know, one of them is keeping in contact with anybody in your old life. So I'm thinking
*  that's, that's not going to happen. Like I'm not, I'm not contacting anybody. I'm leaving.
*  And that's it. That didn't really happen. I kept in touch. I called my mom every once in a while, but
*  I was like, okay, that's cool. Did the loneliness of that hit you early on or no?
*  Like as you're packing? I never did. Well,
*  you're leaving your life. I mean, there's a, it feels like a fundamental transition.
*  Oh, listen. I mean, not just that, like I'm leaving my, my son, I have a son
*  and I'm, you know, I was, I was leaving everything. I was just terrified of going,
*  going to prison and you know, I mean, I don't know, it was just, it was just so stupid. It
*  was just arrogance. And, you know, I should have stayed like I made things so much worse,
*  but I also thought I'm smart. I can, I can figure this out. Like I can change my identity,
*  blend in, I'll be fine. Aren't you already like, people know what your face looks like.
*  They do. They do. But I, one of the first things I did was I got plastic surgery.
*  What, what kind of plastic surgery? I've got, I've got a nose job. I got
*  what they call a mini facelift. They go in through your back of your ears and they suck
*  out all the fat in your neck. Does that change appearance much?
*  A little bit. I got, I was balding. I got a two hair transplants, you know, two hair grafts. So
*  the hair in my head, this is my hair, it's my hair, but it's from back here. So there's,
*  they cut it here and they, I appreciate it. So they re-implanted it there, you know,
*  got liposuction, just some, you know, other stuff and, you know, got my teeth done, that sort of
*  thing, you know. So, you know, and I, that was kind of like my plan. I'll go, I'll take off. I
*  got 80 grand. I'll steal some more money, you know, but I, I let her come with me and we ran up all
*  my credit cards over the next few days, packed up the car, traded in my, my Audi and got like an Audi,
*  I don't know, was it like an A6 or like a Ford or like a big Ford or whatever it was, got that and
*  drove straight to Atlanta. And so I wrote a letter to my parents before I left, just explaining,
*  this is what's happening. I'm leaving, I'm done. I'm not going to prison. Love you. Sorry. Sorry.
*  Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm, I know I'm a disappointment. Sorry. Bam. So I take off, go to Atlanta,
*  when we went to Atlanta, I already had the name of a guy named Scott Cugno that I'd done alone for.
*  So I had his, his, you know, his, his vital information, right? Like I have his name,
*  date of birth, social security number, mother's maiden name and where he was born. One day we were
*  having a conversation and I just slowly pried all that out of my head. And I was like,
*  slowly pried all that out of him. Right? Like I already, we'd done a loan form. Sorry. I had his
*  name, date of birth, social security number, but I need to steal his identity. I need to know where
*  he was born and his mother's maiden name. So through the course of a conversation, I just
*  pried, you know, Hey, you know, Cugno is that, you know, what is that? Is that like Irish? Is it?
*  No, it's such and such. What's your mom's name? Oh, such and such. Oh, okay. Yeah. You know,
*  we were born here. You're born in, in where, why aren't you from? Oh man, I was born here. I was
*  born in such and such Hillsborough County. You know, like I, so it was no big deal.
*  We get to Atlanta. I make a fake ID for both of us, but keep in mind, I don't, I don't have,
*  like I don't have a driver's license. I do, but they're, they're fake. Like I can't give this to
*  a, to a cop. Can't give a driver's license that says David Freeman. What's David's residence?
*  Florida or is this Georgia? No, this is Florida, but it was just a made up name. I'd gone to like
*  high school with a kid named David Freeman. So I had an ID, but I can't give that to a cop.
*  Like that's enough to get like rent a place or do something. So we go, go to Atlanta, make an ID,
*  set it up, make some business cards, set up a couple of websites, set up some,
*  get an HQ, which is that like a, it's a company that will, you can do virtual, you can rent
*  offices and they'll answer your phone for like a hundred bucks a month and they'll afford them. So
*  it seems like you have an office still. They, you know, they give you a phone number that you call
*  up and they say, you know, hi, United Southern bank, you know, and they'll answer the phone and
*  forward messages. So we get one of those, make a business card for, for Becky. She rents a house
*  from a guy named Michael Shanahan. So we rent Michael Shanahan's house. It's like $200,000,
*  $200,000 house in Alpharetta. And I then go to Alabama. Wait, I then order
*  Scott Cugno's birth certificate, social security card.
*  I think I registered to vote and hit his name and I, and we, I made a lease agreement in his name.
*  And I think that's all I needed. And then I went to Alabama and got a driver's license in his name.
*  So I went into DMV, give them all these documents and which are almost all of them are real, except
*  for the lease. They said, sit over there. I sit over there. I sit down, boom, 20 minutes later,
*  I have a driver's license. It's, you know, it's $20 something. It was nothing. So I get the
*  driver's license. Now I'm driving this. I'm still driving a car that an Audi that is in the name of
*  Matt Cox. So I parked that. I then go get social security to issue me a social security number in
*  the name Scott Cugno. And I then turn around and I go and I get a loan. You put down 20, 30%.
*  There's all these first time or first time buyers 30% down rent, get like a Honda or something.
*  So now we're living in a house. We've got some furniture, bedroom furniture, and I go downtown.
*  I pulled a title to this guy, Michael Shanahan's house. And I go downtown and I satisfy the loan
*  on his house. So he had two loans with Bank of America. And so I create two satisfaction of loans
*  from Bank of America. So Michael Shanahan owns a house in the name Michael Shanahan. He has one
*  mortgage with Bank of America and a second one. When you pay your mortgage off, the way public
*  records knows it's paid off is they mail public records a satisfaction of mortgage. It's a one
*  page document and it's notarized. So I filled out two. I created two of them. I just ordered,
*  you can do research. So when I went downtown, I researched Bank of America satisfaction of
*  mortgages and thousands show up. So I just grab a couple of them. Now I know what the basic template
*  is. And they're all different by the way. So it's not like you even have to be that close,
*  but whatever. I mimicked some of them. I had a notary stamp, not hard to get. You go into three
*  different office depots and you say, hey, I need a notary stamp. And you give them the information
*  and you come back four days or whatever, a week later and they give it to you.
*  So I've got these notary stamps. So I notarize the satisfactions. I go downtown, I file them,
*  boom, the mortgages are gone. Keep in mind Bank of America, he's still paying the mortgages. They
*  don't know that they've been satisfied in public records. They're not notified. So those are gone,
*  but it takes about a month or two for it to show up. Atlanta was that far behind.
*  They was Fulton County and they were just way behind. So we just kind of have to
*  dick around for a while, right? So we're going on little vacations. We're going to New Orleans.
*  We're going to different places as Scott Cugno driving a car as Scott Cugno.
*  We opened up several bank accounts. We have multiple bank accounts. And then we end up
*  going to Vegas and we do go to Vegas, but what happened was we're driving around. And I remember
*  thinking, telling her, I was like, you know, this is a problem. We have to get real IDs,
*  real driver's licenses. I mean, this is real, but this is a real person too. And he may stumble
*  across it. And so what I did was I started running ads in magazines saying, home loans
*  available, good credit, bad credit, no problem. Call now government loans, you know, government,
*  VA, FHA, finding, you know, whatever, call this number. So people start calling
*  and I'm getting their information. One of the guys I got was Michael Eckert. Yeah, I remember
*  Michael Eckert, poor Michael Eckert. I actually legally changed his name to Michael Johnson at
*  one point, but at this point it was just Michael Eckert. So I don't, I wanted to see, you know,
*  I'm bored. I want to see what the process is, how much does it cost? Is this possible? Let me see if
*  I can change this guy's name. It was 1500 bucks. I changed it. Without him ever showing up anywhere.
*  So you can think of it. Well, I have a driver's license in his name. Right. I am him. So he did
*  show up. He showed up at the lawyer's office. He, so, you know, right. So I'm, so I do that. I'm
*  living in the house and we're driving along one day and I'm saying, we gotta get real.
*  Like these people that are calling like that, one guy, I get his information, but during the course
*  of taking the application and I'm asking like these, these government survey questions at the
*  very end, there's like 20 questions and I'm rambling them off. And at some point he was like,
*  he said he volunteered. Like I didn't know, I never even asked anybody about criminal history. And
*  he just, he ended up saying something. Well, I do have a felony. Does that matter? I mean, he's like,
*  he was, I mean, it was a DUI. I've had a couple of DUIs, but I got my license back. And that was
*  part of the reason he had bad credit. And it was like, okay. No, no, it doesn't matter. Don't worry.
*  I'm thinking, you're not getting along. So this is, I'm just taking your, I'm just stealing from you,
*  stealing your information. So I get all this information. I'm gathering it. And so one of the
*  things I said to Becky while we were sitting at this stoplight is I'm like, we got to get real
*  people's real information. And I said, like, for instance, I said, what if I steal somebody's
*  identity? I get a driver's license in his name, four states from where he lives and he gets a DUI.
*  I could get pulled over two years later and get arrested for a DUI that he got in Florida. And
*  she's like, well, what do you, what do you, what are you thinking? Are you thinking like, like
*  criminals or are you thinking like, like prisoners, like mental patients? Like, and I went, I mean,
*  I don't, and I looked over and there was a homeless guy holding a sign. And I went like that guy.
*  And I never forget. She goes, she's the hobo. Like, I don't know who calls them hobos. And she's like
*  the hobo. I said, yes, that guy. I said, hold on, pulled over to a subway, got out. She went inside
*  to get subway. I walk across the street, pulled out like 20 bucks. And I said, Hey bro, can I ask
*  you some quick questions real quick? He's like, uh, yeah, what's up? And I go, here's 20 bucks. I said,
*  listen, um, I said, when was the last time you were gainfully employed? He's like, ah,
*  10 years. I'm like, oh, okay. Uh, do you have a criminal record? He's like, ah, I've been arrested
*  in misdemeanors, like, you know, vagrancy. And he named off some things, you know, drunk in public,
*  whatever. And I was like, are you on probation? He was like, I can't, I can't, I can't do probation.
*  They don't give us probation. They keep us for 90 days. They release us. Like the, the judge knows
*  I can't do, I'm not going to show up for a probation. I'm like, okay. Uh, do you have a driver's license?
*  He's like, maybe. I don't think so. I think it's just like, was it skip DUI? He's like, no, I think
*  it's just expired. Did you have a driver's license with you? He's like, no, I got nothing. I'm like,
*  okay. Well, you know, he told me he lived in like a tent in the woods. And, and so I gave him like
*  another 20 bucks, asked him a few more questions. And, uh, and then, oh, and I remember in the middle
*  of it, he said, he goes, are you taking a survey or something? And I went, I remember thinking, I,
*  nothing, I go, I kind of chuckled. I go, you get a lot of surveyors out here like that. And he goes,
*  yeah, sometimes. And I was like, really? He goes, yeah. He said like the, um, uh, he said people from
*  like, you know, halfway houses and, uh, what do you say, uh, um, social workers and stuff, they'll
*  come out and they'll, you know, they'll pass out stuff and they'll ask us questions and stuff. And
*  I'm like, oh, okay. And I was like, I thought that's good to know. So I go back, I get grabbed Becky
*  and she's like, oh, she's like, did you give him money? I said, give him like 40 or 60 bucks or
*  something. Forget what he's you're like, that's a lot of waste of money. I thought it was good.
*  That was money well spent. I said, that guy's perfect. I said, that guy is he's got everything.
*  He has no way to be contacted. He has no documentation on him. I said, he's, he's not
*  going to drive a car. He's not going to get into UI. He has an expired license. I just have to get
*  his license reinstated and I can be him. So I went home. I typed up a, what I called a federal
*  statistical survey form and I made a little thing. I mean, I went online, I mean, I'm always filling
*  out federal documents as a mortgage broker. So it looked identical. I mean, I had like this little,
*  like the, the recycle symbol and it was like, you know, federal form 17, oh 17, you know.
*  And so I print out these forms. I get a, go by a clip board. I make a little, a salvation army ID.
*  I pin it on me and I go out and I start, um, doing surveys. I start surveying homeless, homeless people.
*  Don't judge me, bro. I was in a bad spot. I was in a bad spot. I see the judgment. I see the judgment.
*  Let's make, let's maintain civility here. Like stay neutral, stay neutral. So these homeless guys,
*  I mean, they have, uh, they have a social security number. They have a birth certificate, I guess.
*  I mean, they're a real person, right? They're real person. They're just not using their real
*  person. Yeah. They're not actively engaging with the economic system, the financial system.
*  They're not, they're not employed. They don't have housing, all that. They don't, they don't file taxes.
*  They don't. So I, one of the questions I even asked the guy at the end, one of the last questions I said,
*  do you believe that you will be gainfully employed within the next two years?
*  Everyone of them said, no, no, no. So, you know, it was like, okay, they're not even,
*  they're not even trying. And they all had alcohol problems. Or honestly, the few of them I talked
*  to, like was pretty clear. I mean, it takes literally five minutes, less than five minutes
*  to fill out the form. And I filled it out for them, of course. Um, but even filling it out and that
*  brief, just asking questions back and forth, half of them, you could tell you've got some mental
*  illness. Like something's not right with you. Like these aren't guys that are going to go out and get,
*  are going to get jobs. They're not cleaning up. So they were perfect for my purposes, as horrible as
*  I know that sounds. So you feel bad about this little small tangent? No. Do I feel bad about it?
*  The homeless people in society are really, it's a difficult life. Like dealing with mental illness,
*  dealing with drug addiction, all that kind of stuff. I mean, being in prison and then the kind
*  of people that are in prison that, you know, are, are going to be homeless or have been homeless or
*  the mental illness that I've dealt with in halfway houses and even doing this.
*  I don't know what you do with these people. I don't even know that you house them. You can't
*  necessarily even house them together. You know, they, they cause such problems. Like,
*  I don't know what the solution is other than just kind of keeping them fed maybe and keep them away
*  from normal people, you know, so they don't cause crime or whatever. I don't know about housing them
*  in one area. That seems like a mistake. Like there is absolutely no good solution to that problem.
*  None. Because it's not like, Hey, if we gave you a house, so we gave you job training and we gave
*  you this, okay, you might get 5%, 10, but most of them are on the street because they've just
*  messed up over and over and over again. And they just kind of gave up. But, you know, I guess we
*  still have to remember that they're human beings. I mean, we mentioned off Mike, soft white underbelly.
*  He highlights the humanity of people who've had a real difficult life. He does it well.
*  He's Mark Lada is amazing. He's amazing. And one of the things he had said was like, these are,
*  he was like, these are real people. And he's like, their stories, he's like, they have stories and
*  they need, you know, but if you also talk to Mark, he'll tell you, you can't just, you can't give him
*  money. You can't like, you can't like, he's tried every time he's reached out and tried to help these
*  guys, put them in apartments, fed them, got them back on their feet. Within six months, they're
*  back on the street. I mean, it just happens over and over and over again. I mean, I think the amount
*  of money that would have to be dumped into correcting that problem, I don't know. I mean,
*  you can say, well, yeah, but just, you know, you should do it because it's the right thing to do.
*  I don't know who's paying for it. It's complicated, but for your purpose,
*  they have a social security number. They got 20 bucks. They seem very happy. There you are
*  with a clipboard taking survey. Right. Took a survey, went home, ordered their,
*  and they, you know, of course they give me everything, name, date of birth, social security
*  number, mother's maiden name, where they were born. Have they ever been in the armed services? Have
*  they ever had a passport issued? What states have they had identification in? Have they ever been
*  arrested? They were been on probation. Have they ever claimed social security disability, SSI?
*  I mean, I had like 17 questions and it absolutely answered everything. What high school did you go
*  to? Because high school transcripts are great for documentation. A lot of times they'll ask you for
*  high school, you know, can you get us a copy of your high school transcripts? Like that's a good
*  now. And I'm a big believer in overkill. So, I mean, I ordered a ton of stuff. If I needed
*  three things to get a driver's license in your name, right. You know, I'd come in with like six,
*  because what you do is you get in front of the guy at the DMV and you kind of fumble through like,
*  I got this. What else do you need? You know, I know exactly what you need, but you know, they'll be
*  like, oh, was that high school transfer? Yeah, I'll take that. And, oh, voter's registration card.
*  Give me that. Yeah, that's perfect. You're good. Sit down right over there. That's it.
*  Who is, by the way, lurking in the shadows trying to catch you? You mentioned FBI, secret service.
*  You mentioned, I think I've heard you mentioned US Marshals, which is interesting.
*  Cops in general, the police CIA, I guess CIA is international only FBI is internal. Yeah. Okay.
*  Well, so who is when you're doing this, who are you afraid of? So by the time I've gotten to
*  Atlanta within four or five days, the FBI raided my office. I guess I kind of missed that back in
*  Florida, back in Florida. When I left and drove to Atlanta and left, remember the FBI was going to
*  show up a few days later. They were going to arrest me. And they did. They did. They showed up,
*  like I left on a Sunday night or something, because for some reason in my stupid thought,
*  I thought, well, they won't arrest me on the weekend. Like they don't work on the weekends.
*  So they came on like a, whatever it was, like a Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday,
*  like within a few days they come in the office, they raid it, they're looking for me,
*  but I'm gone. Nobody knows where I am. And so now I'm surveying the homeless guys and I turn around
*  and I'm ordering their documents. And as their documents are showing up,
*  you know, I'm going to different states and getting IDs. So I'm going to Florida.
*  So over the course of this whole thing, I've had 27 driver's licenses in like seven different states.
*  I've had two dozen passports, because if you're going to get the driver's license in the guy's
*  name, you might as well get, or an ID even, you might as well get a passport. Because a passport's
*  not difficult to get. They don't fingerprint you. You know, all they're doing is saying,
*  this is your ID and where you're born here. And then they run a check. And if it comes back or
*  it doesn't. And back then you could do it expedited and I'd have it in like two weeks. Like now it
*  takes like 90 days or 60 to 90 days to get one. And if you have multiple ideas for a single identity,
*  that's more proof. Right. So wait, what number did you say? How many, how many IDs, how many
*  identities? So I had, well, I've had over 50 identities, but I've had 27 driver's licenses
*  issued from state DMVs, Department of Motor Vehicles. Like legitimately. Legitimately.
*  I walked into the DMV, said, hi, my name's Michael Eckert. And I just moved here about three weeks
*  ago, four weeks ago. Here's my lease. And here I lost my driver's license, bro. Like I don't know
*  what I did with it. I don't know what happened. I don't know. And they're like, it's all right.
*  What do you have? Do you have, I need a proof of residency. Well, I have my lease. Oh, okay.
*  I need a primary. Okay. Here's my birth certificate. Okay. And I need a secondary. Here's
*  my social security card. But I also registered, you know, I registered to vote. My girlfriend made
*  me vote immediately. And she said, I would need that. Oh, yeah, that's perfect. You're good. I don't
*  even need that. Okay, great. Stand over there. Pay that person. They call your number. 275, you know,
*  45 minutes later you go, you pay your 25 bucks. You stand in front of the screen. They take a
*  picture. You got a driver's license. You walk out. It's still warm. It's beautiful. It smells like
*  hot plastic. It's amazing. And so I, I'm opening up different, different bank accounts in these guys'
*  names. And just about- What do you, what do you mostly do with identities? You're opening up
*  different bank accounts. Right now. Are you doing credit, starting to establish credit or no?
*  Some of them. Like I might order, I might order a secured credit card. So I can't get credit,
*  you know, I'm building their credit. Like it's not helping me in any way. I'm just sending out $500
*  to get a capital one card or a American, I'm sorry, a Bank of America secured credit card,
*  whatever. So I'm building their credits, but not all of them, only a few because I'm collecting,
*  although I'm collecting them, I'm also going to be moving soon. I'm only here to get a few
*  hundred thousand dollars and move. I need some kind of a base. So I don't want to start getting
*  credit cards and building up a history in Atlanta in anybody's name, but I am getting
*  driver's licenses in other States. So I've been like North Carolina, South Carolina.
*  What's the primary method of income here when you move to a place, South Carolina,
*  how do you make a hundred thousand at this time? Oh, well, I mean, right now I'm living in this
*  guy's house and I satisfied his loans. The house was worth 200,000. So what happens is one day we
*  go and we check public records. Remember I told you it takes months for it to show up and it shows
*  up. He's got no mortgages on the house. So now I turn around and I make a fake ID in the name,
*  Michael Shanahan, and I'm living in his house, but I have no credit, right? There's no credit.
*  So I've got the ID, I've got a social security number and I order some secured credit cards in
*  his name. So if you pull that credit profile, it shows up saying he's got some credit cards,
*  but they're only a month or two old. So I can't go to like Bank of America. I mean, I could,
*  but I needed to get the money as quick as possible. Like I want to get out of Atlanta.
*  So, and at this point, by the way, there's multiple articles showing up in Tampa. So the
*  St. Petersburg Times is writing multiple articles about me. With your face. With my picture. Yeah.
*  But it's honestly, it's pre, I mean, not pre-internet, but it's post-internet,
*  but it's in its infancy. Like nobody's, it's not huge. And honestly, it's a local newspaper
*  in Tampa. It's not that big of a deal. Like I'm not concerned about that so much at this point.
*  What I'm concerned about is getting a chunk of money and just moving on and kind of reestablishing
*  ourselves in a better way where we're not living in a building that we're going to
*  be committing fraud in with our house. So, but I'm living in this place. I make a fake ID
*  and the name Michael Shanahan and I call up three secured, or sorry, three hard money lenders.
*  A hard money lender is a guy that lends his own money or other investors' money on property.
*  Kind of like a bank, but he's lending his own money so he doesn't have to really meet
*  banking requirements. And he can charge a much higher interest rate. These guys are charging
*  12, 13% interest, simple interest, and they're only lending you a much lower percentage of the
*  value of your home. So they're not lending you 90% of the value. They're lending you 65%, 60%.
*  So I call three of these guys. They all come out to the house at different times
*  and each one of them says, I'll lend you 100,000 or it's like 150,000, 150,000. Like they all lend
*  roughly 150,000. So we schedule three separate closings. None of them know about the other
*  person. So what I do is I close one loan on let's say Monday and then one on Tuesday and then one on
*  whatever, Wednesday or Thursday or, or that may have all been the same day to be honest,
*  but I don't remember. The point is I go to three separate title companies or real estate attorneys
*  and we close and I get checks for, you know, after costs and everything, the total ends up
*  being roughly 400,000. So I've got 400,000. Becky and I run another scam in Tallahassee, Florida,
*  and we get like 50 grand. And plus the 80s dwindled down to close to nothing because we had
*  gone on several vacations. We went to like Bermuda and I think we went to Jamaica.
*  We actually stayed at the Ritz in, in Jamaica. So it was very nice.
*  You and Becky. So Becky turned out to be pretty good in terms of scams on the road.
*  No, she was useless. She was, she was horrible. And she just spent money all the time. And by the,
*  what I realized too very quickly is she's bipolar. So she's bipolar and she's
*  absolutely insane. She smokes pot all the time. Did that matter for you personally or did it
*  actually affect the how good you were able to do these particular scams? It was that she was the
*  type of person that would start an argument at one o'clock in the morning and scream at the top of
*  her lungs and get the cops called. Okay. So I can't have the police called. I can't get taken downtown
*  and fingerprinted. I can't have the police showing up. I don't know who's really looking.
*  We haven't had plastic surgery at this point. We're still pulling money together. So.
*  Oh, Becky. Yeah. Becky's a problem. And at some point I actually, so we send her to like a
*  psychiatrist and they, they give her, they put her on Zoloft. She takes it for like a month or two
*  and then she stops taking it. She's, she thought she was all better. Like you're not all better.
*  So can you give me a timeline here? How long are you able to be on the road here successfully?
*  Three years. Three years. This is me. This is the first few. Three years. Well, so. Three years.
*  What happens is we, I, we get that little chunk of money. We put it deposited in these bank accounts
*  and we start pulling out cash. Which works out fine because we got a bunch of accounts and we're
*  pulling out little amounts, 7,000, 5,000, 8,000. And, you know, I would cash checks against her
*  accounts and they would call her to verify, oh, is there someone here trying to cash a check for
*  $9,000? You know, can you verify the payee? And they go, oh yeah, that's Scott Cugno. Oh,
*  okay. Thank you. And they cash the check, you know, these are new accounts. And they're like,
*  oh, okay. Thank you. And they cash the check, you know, these are new accounts. So it looks odd,
*  but you know, we're always, I opened the account. So what ends up happening is
*  we're cashing them. And I remember getting really frustrated because it was just taking forever.
*  And I had gone into a bank one time and, you know, they have banks where they cash,
*  they actually cash like large checks. Like if you go into Bank of America and you try and cash a
*  check for $15,000 or $25,000, they probably won't do it. They'll tell you we don't have that much
*  cash on hand. We don't this, we don't that. They have certain banks that do that. So they told me
*  where one of those was. I went there. I had a check for like 29,000 that had been cut on a closing
*  for Michael Shanahan. Remember I refinanced Michael Shanahan's and then I've got a check
*  I've got a check for 29,000 that was issued to Scott Cugno. So I'm sitting in the bank. I go in
*  there. I say, I need to cash this. And she says, you're going to talk to the manager. I go, okay.
*  She says, go sit down over there. I go sit down in the little glass cubicle. He comes over and he
*  says, I see you're trying to cash this check. And I was like, right. He goes, why don't you just
*  deposit in your own bank? And I went, my bank account, my bank is a credit union or something.
*  And it's in like Florida. Like they'll hold this thing for like two weeks. Like I need the money
*  now. I have people I need to pay. He's like, well, I'm not sure. And I was like, well, it's fine.
*  It's a cashier check. Like it's good. And he goes, no, it's good. It's good. You have the money. And
*  he's like, yeah, we have the money. He said, it's just odd. Hold on. He goes back in the back and
*  he comes back and he says, where'd you get the check? Cashier's check. I said, it was a cashier's
*  check. It was drawn off of a closing for somebody's property that I were doing. The company I work for,
*  we're putting on an addition on. Okay. That makes sense. Comes back and why do you need cash?
*  And I was like, I'm cashing guys' checks that work for the company. Like there's a lot of these guys
*  that are like Mexican guys. They give them a check. They go to a check cashing company or they get
*  charged five, 10%. So I cashed them. I'm like, I don't under like what the check's good, right?
*  Like my, and he's like, yeah, we're just trying to verify some stuff. And he went,
*  yeah, hold on. And he leaves again. And I remember my cell phone rang
*  and I pick up the phone is Becky. She's like, what are you doing? What's taking so long? I go,
*  ah, the guy's being a jerk. You don't want to give me the money. Oh, she's like, oh my God,
*  get out of the bank, get out of the bank. And I went, I can't get out of the bank. The guy's got
*  my ID. He's got my credit card, my ID and the check for 29,000. Like he's going to call the police
*  if I just jump up and run. And I go, don't, don't call me again. I'll let you know. It'll be fine.
*  Hang up the phone. She calls back. Same conversation. I'm bouncing on the walls. I'm like,
*  I'm going crazy. It'll be fine. Hang up the phone. He comes back out and he goes, he said,
*  I said, Hey, so what's, what's taking so long? And he goes, um, we're trying to get in touch with,
*  with Michael Shanahan to verify the check. That was not good for me. Like I'm thinking,
*  right, right. Okay. Okay. And he walks away. The phone rings. Becky, what's, what's going on?
*  I go, he's, they're trying to get ahold of Michael Shanahan. She goes, Oh my God. Oh my God.
*  And I'm like, Oh my God. And I remember thinking I should, I shouldn't let her get the keys.
*  There's a good chance I run out of this place and she does. She's not there.
*  But by the way, when you're sitting there, you're who? Scott, you're Scott.
*  I'm Scott Cugno. And then the other guy, Michael Shanahan. Right. They're saying
*  they're trying to get in touch with Michael Shanahan. So then the phone rings. My phone
*  cell rings again. I look and it's not Becky's not Becky. So I pick up the phone. I go, hello.
*  And she says, hi, this is Kim. Is it from SunTrust Bank? Is this Michael Shanahan?
*  So I'm like, yes, it is Michael Shanahan. And she says, there's a guy here. He's trying to
*  cash a check. It's very large. Could you verify the payee? And I go, sure. It's Scott Cugno.
*  He's trying. I said, I believe the amount's $29,000. And she goes, that's right. Thank you
*  very much. I appreciate it. I said, okay. I said, hey, by the way, how'd you get my number?
*  This is my cell number. And she's like, oh, I'm sorry. We called the title company.
*  And the title company gave us your phone number. Well, I closed those loans. That's my cell. That's
*  why if they looked in any other way, I would have, they could have gotten in touch with the real
*  Michael Shanahan. So I was like, oh, okay. Hang up the phone. You're sitting, you answered the phone
*  from the bank while sitting in the bank as Scott Cugno. As Scott pretending to be my, so I just,
*  right. So I just verified the check myself. As Matthew pretending to be Scott, as pretending
*  to be Michael. Right. Yeah. So I wait there terrified still. They come out about two minutes
*  later, the manager comes out plus a woman. I'm assuming maybe that was Kim. She never said
*  anything. And she walks out and she says, and he counts out the money twice, 29,000, 29,000.
*  And I stand up and I, I mean, just like, I'm like shoving the money in my pockets. Like I'm trying
*  to get out of there so quick. I'm like, Hey, I'm like, okay, cool. Um, like I'm thinking this whole
*  thing is, you know, feels bad and I'm getting up and I'm so, um, I'm starting to walk out of the
*  bank and he goes, he said, um, excuse me, Mr. Cugno. And I said, yes, sir. I turn around and
*  he goes, I'd like you to know, like you to know that I feel very apprehensive about this transaction.
*  And I go, really? What is it exactly? He goes, I can't put my finger on it. And I go, it'll come
*  to you. And I turn around and I just bolt right out of there. And to keep in mind a week or so
*  later, the secret service shows up. Did you cash a check for $29,000? So, um, what's so funny is
*  like that was one of the last checks we cashed. So we ended up with like 400,000. Was there a
*  connection between the secret service and this guy? No, the apprehension. So the FBI is looking
*  for me at kind of in Tampa. Yeah. And they've put out a, a fugitive warrant for me, which is
*  how the U S marshals got involved. So it's U S marshals tracked down fugitives. Yes. Federal
*  fugitives. They tracked down, but everybody's after you. You're on every list. Right. I'm on
*  the FBI's most wanted list. At that point, the secret service got involved once I leave Atlanta.
*  So when Becky and I pack up our bags and we leave Atlanta, the secret service got involved
*  because of identity theft, um, you know, banking identity theft, the secret service doesn't just do
*  counterfeiting and protect the president. They also protect the financial infrastructure of
*  the United States and they especially have jurisdiction when identity theft is involved.
*  So identity theft plus bank fraud there. That's when they, they move. Yeah. That's it. That's
*  their, their, um, their territory. So they don't marshals are just fugitives. U S marshals,
*  just fugitives. They don't do any, they're all kind of work. Okay. But they're all kind of working
*  together. Yeah. Yeah. The, you know, like the U S marshals are like, let's say an arm of all of the
*  various law enforcement agencies, federal agencies, not the States. The States have their own fugitive
*  task forces or fugitive. So when you leave Atlanta, basically everybody's after you.
*  Everybody's after me. Did you know this at that time or did you sentence it? No, I mean, now we're,
*  every day you're looking up, you're looking your name up every day. Like I'm not,
*  cause I'm just trying to get a bunch of money and just blend in. Right.
*  Things were not as interconnected at that time as they are now, but they're starting to get
*  interconnected. But of course I have no idea how much I barely go on the internet for anything,
*  you know, dating. That's the only thing on the internet. You know, I'd never been on Facebook
*  at this point on Facebook is even up. It's been even out yet. This is 2006.
*  Still, were you trying to stay low? Yeah, I am. I'm not a flashy person. Like I'm not driving,
*  you know, like I didn't go out and buy a red Lamborghini. You know, I'm driving,
*  I'm driving 40, $50,000 cars. You know, I've had some sports cars, 70, 80, you know, maybe that's
*  $150,000 sports car now, but it's still not flashy. It's not like it's bright red or yellow. I mean,
*  these are, it's always something, you know, nondescript. And I'm living in areas that
*  these cars are everywhere. You know, I go to NAP. So I ended up going to Charlotte, North Carolina.
*  We rent an apartment. We decided to run a scam in, in South Carolina. So I go to Columbia,
*  South Carolina. And in between this period of time, we go to Las Vegas. And I,
*  when we go to Los, we go to Las Vegas to drop off a bunch of money to, uh, Becky's
*  son's father, who's taking care of her son. We drop off some money there.
*  We go and we start. And while we're there, it's like, Hey, there's homeless people here. So we,
*  so you're always, you know, usually I don't feel bad telling these stories. You make me feel bad.
*  I'm sorry. My judgment is showing. No, uh, but you have to be collecting identities, I guess,
*  to be constantly creating new identities. So I got my survey forms. So I go and, you know,
*  we go out and we're taking, I'm taking surveys and I end up going up to this guy.
*  There's like two or three guys that are standing on like a bench or sitting on next to a bench
*  or something. And I see them and I walk up and they got one guy gets up and he comes over. He's
*  like, Hey, what do you need? And I went, um, I'm taking surveys for the Salvation Army to determine
*  where we place our next homeless facility. And the guy goes, Oh, I'm not interested. And they
*  always said that. And I said, it pays 20 bucks cash right now. It'll take you five minutes.
*  And they're like, what? You're $20 cash right now. I was like, yeah, I show them the cash.
*  And they go, okay, yeah, yeah. What do you need? Name, date of birth, social security number.
*  So when I get to, um, criminal record, the guy, he says criminal record, he's like, yeah, I've been
*  arrested. He's I've been arrested like three, four times for prost. He said for a prostitution.
*  He said, um, but they're like misdemeanors. And I went, okay. Um, and it was like, okay, well,
*  prostitution to me, women get charged with prostitution, you know, men get pro charged
*  with solicitation. I went prostitution and he goes, and he went, he said, yeah, yeah. He said,
*  I offered to blow an undercover cop for 20 bucks. He said, I thought that's what I thought you were
*  coming up here for. And I was like, I was like, no, no, bro. I said, uh, okay. And he's like,
*  yeah. He said, uh, you know, he goes, he goes, I mean, he said, I mean, a girl's got to do what
*  a girl's got to do, you know, and he made some comment or something. I was like, okay. So I jot
*  down the rest of it. We're good. I give him 20 bucks. I get in my car. I leave, uh, we get back to
*  North Carolina. I ordered all of his documents. His name was Gary Sullivan.
*  I then go to South Carolina. When I go to South Carolina, I get a real estate agent. We drive
*  around for a day. We look at like five or six houses. I put five contract, five owner,
*  owner financing contracts on five different houses. So I get him. He writes up five contracts. All of
*  them are asking for owner financing. I'll put down 10%. I want owner financing. Two of them end up
*  coming back and saying, yes, we'll do it. I have two closings. One of them is a house that's worth
*  like 225,000. I put down 25 grand. Another one's a 110,000. I put down 11,000. So I buy these two
*  houses. I then satisfy the loans to on both the houses. Everything seems like it's going okay.
*  Although Becky's a lunatic at this point, she's, she's had so many, she, she won't take her
*  medication. She's had so many outbursts, uh, that, and we've had, by this time we've had plastic
*  surgery, like she's gotten plastic surgery. She's gotten a boob job. She's gotten lipo suction. I
*  mean, all kinds of stuff. So look way different, like appearance changes or thinner, better looking,
*  you know, just tightened everything up. I guess, you know, she was in her, she'd had a,
*  she'd had a kid and she was 30, 33, 34. I don't know how she was 20, 32, 33, I don't know, roughly
*  my age. So yeah, I thought she looked, you know, she lost like 15 pounds. Like she was not because
*  of the surgery, but just in general, we're not, we're just working out. We're going mountain
*  climbing. We're, you know, riding bikes. We're doing, you know, there's frauds, not a full-time
*  job. So, you know, we have plenty of time. So we're, we're goofing off and, uh, but she's also
*  a lunatic. You know, she's getting the cops called. She's able to go out and she's able to stay stoned
*  24 hours a day. She's, she's going out with friends, drinking. I never leave the house,
*  you know, even to this day, I really barely ever leave the house. I'm very much a homebody kind
*  of person. So like the, the idea that I'm able to make my living doing YouTube and I'd never have
*  to leave my house. I love that. I don't ever go anywhere except for the gym and back home. That's
*  it. So what happens is, uh, I've actually moved her out of the, of my apartment. Like I had an
*  apartment downtown, 30 story building, actually move her into another apartment. She's that much
*  of a lunatic. We can't even be in the same place. Multiple times I've tried to leave her. She's
*  called me up and begged me to come back. It's horrible. So I ended up buying a couple of houses
*  in Columbia, South Carolina. I satisfy the loans on the houses. I've got an ID, not a driver's
*  license, but an ID in the name of Gary Lee Sullivan. And I refinance or I refinance those houses
*  because keep in mind they were owner financing, but they also had mortgages. So there's something
*  called a wraparound mortgage. So these guys did wraparound mortgages. So let's say you buy a house
*  for 200,000, $250,000 and the bank lends you 200,000 and then you own or finance the house to me.
*  So we do a, I give you 50 grand down, but I'm not, I'm not able to get a loan from the bank
*  to pay off your mortgage. So what we do is you do a wraparound mortgage. So I'll pay you your
*  mortgage and you pay the bank. So there is a second mortgage on the property, but it's called
*  a wrap. It's a wrap. It's wrapped around that you're first. That's legal. Yeah. So I wouldn't lie to
*  you. So it's, so there's, these have wraparound mortgages. So you're always selling and you're
*  good at it. So I go, I satisfy the loans, the owner finance loans, the wraparound mortgages, and I,
*  I satisfy the loans. They're the original loans that these people took out on their own mortgages.
*  One of them, by the way, I sat, you know, you have to sign as the president of the bank,
*  right? So I sign it as C Montgomery burns, which is the aging tycoon in the, the guy that owns a
*  power plant and the Simpsons TV show. So I signed that and I notarize it, which I thought was cute.
*  I actually wanted to sign all of them cartoon characters and Becky was screaming her head off
*  and wouldn't let me do it. Right? Like I wanted to do all the Simpsons, right? But she wouldn't let
*  me do it. She's screaming and hollering. So I ended up, you know, see, nobody knows who C Montgomery
*  burns is. So I sign it, notarize it. All of those are satisfied. I then go to the multiple banks
*  and I refinance, start refinancing all these, these properties multiple times. So I'm applying
*  for these loans and I'm getting the loans and I'm closing. So I've got like five or six loans
*  on this one house. So house is like 225,000. I think it was like 230, whatever. I, I, I get,
*  I borrow like four or five loans on that house. So I borrowed like $190,000, like five times.
*  So I've got like $800,000. And then I borrow another three or 400,000 on the other house,
*  the one, the smaller one, right? So it ends up being like $1.3 million. It's actually like
*  1.5 million. It was more, but what happened with that was, so keep in mind, I, you can only open
*  up so many bank accounts in your name. You can go to bank of America, they'll open one. Then you go
*  to SunTrust, they'll open one. They're going to ask, they might even ask you, did you, did you
*  open another bank account today? Cause every time you do it, there's an inquiry into something called
*  check systems or AccuCheck. And so then they go, so then by the time you go to the third bank,
*  they'll say, listen, something's not right. You've got multiple inquiries.
*  You know, if you go to whatever mercantile bank, there might be, they might go, okay,
*  we're going to open one. They're going to need an explanation, but you're not, you're not opening
*  more than three by the third one. They're like, absolutely not. Something's wrong.
*  So, you know, I've got multiple identities, but I can only open up so many, so many banks.
*  The other problem is that these, these checks, they'll only give you so much money on a refi,
*  usually after a hundred thousand dollars. They only want to let you walk away with,
*  let's say a hundred thousand dollars. So one of the things I did was I would,
*  I would typically record another mortgage and have them pay that mortgage off.
*  So I had to open, I opened a corporation to do that. So I could then turn around and go open
*  corporate bank accounts because now it's not going off. My information is going off the corporation.
*  So I can open up multiple corporate bank accounts. These corporations are fake or real?
*  No, no. I went to a real corporate bank attorney and had him open them. I gave him whatever,
*  gave him like $1,500, $2,000. And he opened up a corporation for me, Gary Sullivan. And I then
*  turned around and I went and opened up multiple bank accounts in that, in those, that corporation's
*  name. How are you keeping track of all this? Cause I don't need this. So I'm, is it in your head
*  or do you have good organization? No, no, no, no. I have every single identity has its own file
*  with, with, you know, plastic inlays, sleeves for their passports. That's nice and organized.
*  It's super organized. You open this, I'm Gary now. Right. That's exactly what it is. Like you kind of
*  go over boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. You sit in your car for a minute, you put it down, you walk in.
*  Well, what happens is it went up to like 1.5 million and I'm pulling money out of the bank.
*  And then one day I got a phone call on Gary Sullivan's cell phone. The guy, it's a lawyer.
*  They call up. He says, Hey, I'm lawyer with Washington mutual. We have an issue.
*  I said, what's that? He says, we got a phone call from the title company. One of the title companies
*  that I was attempting to refinance up one of the piece of property with notice that I,
*  they had been sent, they'd been sent a document that showed that I had purchased the property.
*  And I said, I purchased it cash and I, the documents that I purchased it cash.
*  And they got that. And there was actually a mortgage on the property. And so somehow or another,
*  they, they connected it and they called Washington mutual. And they said, look, there's an issue.
*  There's a fraught. We have a fraudulent document here. And he was like, he said, so we went and we
*  looked and it turns out that we pulled public records and that there is a mortgage in front of
*  us, several mortgages in front of us. So there's like three or four mortgages in front of us.
*  So there's like three or four mortgages in front of me, Washington mutual, you owe us.
*  And it wasn't that much. It was like a hundred, a hundred, it was like, like a hundred grand, right?
*  Like 95 or a hundred. And I said, uh, okay. And he said, so there's an issue here. You've got a few
*  mortgages in front of us and we're supposed to be a first mortgage. And we're not supposed to be two
*  mortgages behind or three. And I was like, okay, sounds like, uh, sounds like an error, not a big
*  deal. Um, have you contacted law enforcement? He said, no, I haven't. I was hoping we could
*  rectify this some other way. I said, you know what? I think we can, I'm going to have my lawyer call
*  you back. I'm going to go to his place right now. Give me about two hours. No problem. I immediately
*  run, jump in my car, head towards South Carolina, call my corporate lawyer, tell them, look, I need
*  to talk to you. Here's what's going on. I explain it to him. He doesn't really understand. He says,
*  this sounds pretty complicated. I have a, my bit, my wall partner is a criminal defense attorney.
*  I'm going to have, I'm going to set up a meeting right now with all of us. Okay. I get there 45
*  minutes later, I walk in the door, I sit down. He says, what happened? I said, they said, you know,
*  Gary, this is, this is, it doesn't sound right. What's what do you, what happened? I said, okay,
*  so listen, bought this house. I bought it cash. I then refinanced it. I didn't buy it cash,
*  but I told him, I bought it cash. I refinanced it like four or five times within a day or two
*  of each other. And they were like, how was that even possible? I was like, well, I went to different
*  title companies and I explained how I do it. I said, Washington mutual just found out that they're
*  in like second position or third position. And, or I said, but they're probably, they may be in
*  fourth position. You know, they mail these things in, so you never know. And he was like, oh my God,
*  he's like, that's a, what do you want to do? I said, I want you to contact them and agree
*  for them to not contact the authorities provided we pay them. I paid them off. He said, do you
*  have the money? I said, I do have the money. I can go get the money right now. He calls the lawyer.
*  They, this is back when faxes, right? So they fax some documents back and forth. They make,
*  they do a couple emails back and forth and they have a conversation. I remember the lawyer started
*  arguing cause he wanted to charge me like yield spread and fees and stuff. And I was like, I was
*  like, what are you talking about? Like, I'll pay it. Like, so it ends up being a little over a
*  hundred thousand and I'm like, that's it. So he's like, okay. And so he says, okay, that sounds good.
*  And so he said, okay, all you have to do is go get the check. And he said, bring it to a Washington
*  mutual branch, tell them to call. I said, I'm not going into Washington mutual branch, bro.
*  I'll bring you the check. So he calls him back. He's not doing that. And he's like, okay, I'm not,
*  I'll bring it here. You guys take care. He said, no problem. Okay. Hang up the phone.
*  And he turns to me and he says, okay, well, we have a problem. He said, we still have the
*  problem of these other mortgages. And I went, right. And he said, and he goes, okay, well,
*  I said, they don't know anything. He said, I know, but Gary, he said, what if they find out? I said,
*  they find out that they're like in second and third and fourth place. He's like, right. I said,
*  I leave town. Anyway, they, they, so they both laugh. They Gary, you can't just leave town.
*  They, they have, they have a copy of your driver's license. They have your social security number.
*  They have your birth certificate. I said, they'll find you. It's the FBI. And I go, you're assuming
*  I'm Gary Sullivan. Wow. You tell them. And he, they listened, they looked at me and they went.
*  And I, and I remember he said, he goes, we'll, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
*  I said, it's right. My immediate problem is getting rid of these people. And he goes, right,
*  right. So I go get the check, bring it back, give it to them. Never called the FBI.
*  Can't believe you got away with the, with the, with the Washington mutual. Oh, no, this is,
*  these are all really close calls. It seems like you know, this is the close call. I have two more
*  close calls that my hands sweat thinking about it. I walk in, I walk into Wachovia.
*  I just opened this account two months ago. So it's a new account. So whenever I would go in there,
*  I'd say, Hey, I need a $7,000, $6,000, anything over $3,000. They had to call to get permission,
*  right? Like author authorization. So she was like, okay, I gotta go call. I said, no problem.
*  So she, the, the girl walks in the back, sitting there waiting, all of a sudden,
*  a massive person reaches over my hand and grabs my wrist. And somebody grabs it from the other one,
*  and they pull my hands behind my back. These are two of possibly the largest law enforcement
*  officers I've ever seen in my entire life. And they're massive. And they, they handcuff me and
*  they say, you're Mr. Sullivan, you're being detained. We're taking you into custody and,
*  you know, putting you, we're holding you until a detective gets here.
*  Who are these guys? Is this the US Marshals or is this cops or what?
*  These are sheriff's deputies. Sheriff's deputies.
*  And as they walk me in the right, as they walk me in the back, they're calling me Mr. Sullivan.
*  They sit me down. And by now I'm, you know, the Secret Service are looking for me. They're calling
*  me, well, they were calling us John and Jane Doe, but now they figured out who we were.
*  And so now I'm on the Secret Service's most wanted list. I'm not like number one at that,
*  right? Like I probably was, but I, I, we just found out I was on like,
*  on that list. So it's, it's getting bad. So they sit me down and I'm waiting. And I remember
*  thinking that the FBI was coming. You know, I don't really know at that point, I couldn't
*  tell you the difference between everybody. And then five minutes go by and, you know,
*  I'm sitting there going, what is going on? Do you guys have any idea what's going there?
*  Like, we don't know. We're just grunts. We just do what we're told. So suddenly this guy walks in.
*  He's probably in his early thirties. Maybe he walks in gray suit. I think he looks like he's FBI.
*  He says, Hey, I'm a detective with the, uh, I want to say Richland County, you know, whatever
*  sheriff's department or police department, whatever. And I was like, oh, okay. And he says, yeah,
*  listen, we've got an issue. Wachovia Wachovia wants this. They want us to arrest you. He said
*  that they they're saying that you've got three mortgages on, on your house. And I go, is that
*  illegal? And he looked at me and he went, you know, to be honest, I don't know. And I, I,
*  I distinctly remember thinking I'm walking out of here. All I have to do is convince this guy.
*  I haven't done anything wrong. He's already said he doesn't know. So he gets on the phone with the
*  head of Wachovia's fraud department and he's telling it saying this guy is running what's
*  called a shotgunning scam, which is absolutely right. And so what is the shotgun? It's where
*  you're you, you close on so many loans simultaneously. They can't catch it. Anyway,
*  they, they start going back and forth and he's on the phone and he's like, um, why did you close
*  three loans? And I said, I, you know, why are you pulling? What I said, it's not illegal. I have a
*  first mortgage, a second mortgage and a home equity line of credit. That's perfectly legal.
*  And he goes, and you could hear the guy, yes, they're all first mortgages. And I said, I read
*  every one of those documents. Not one of them said they were first mortgages and they don't.
*  First mortgages don't say their first mortgages. It's the placement of the mortgage placement of
*  the lien that determines is their first, second or third. So it's possible that I wouldn't have
*  known it certainly that I could have read those documents and not known. And he's like, that's
*  not true. And he's screaming. And so I go, yeah, listen. And he said, well, you're taking out all
*  cash. Why are you taking out all cash? I said, well, I mean, I don't know if this sounds, I don't
*  know. This might be illegal. I said, I don't know. I said, I mean, I work for, for a, I work for
*  a labor company, labor on demand. I pull out my business card. You can call. So I'm like,
*  I work for labor on demand. And I said, we, we hire a lot of guys that like, they don't have
*  banking out. So the company pays them. And then I'll usually I'll pull out money and I'll, I'll
*  cash their checks because they get charged like 10% of these check cashing companies. And I feel bad.
*  I know the checks are good. So I just deposit them. I mean, I don't think that I said, but I don't,
*  I don't know if that's illegal. I don't think that's illegal. Like if, if, and he's like, no, no,
*  that's fine. It's that's, that's a decent thing to do. It's not, that's fine. I'm like, oh, okay.
*  So we're, so he's talking to the guy and you know, Wachovia screaming, hollering. He says,
*  he's doing that. You know, he's going back and forth, back and forth. So we're going back and
*  forth back. And I'm just derailing everything this guy says. And at one point he says, he's screaming,
*  he's committing fraud. We want him arrested. And he's like, I don't know what to charge him with.
*  And he's like, you know, he, he's saying these aren't, you know, how did you, you know, how did
*  you, he's like, Hey, look, how did you even do this? I go, look, I didn't do this. I said,
*  I came to Wachovia. I met with a loan officer. I said, I need a first mortgage. I need to pull
*  out like a hundred thousand dollars. I want to start buying houses. He says, that's right. You
*  own another house here too. Don't you? I said, I do. I said, I'm, we're putting a new roof on it.
*  We're going to build an addition. We're putting in a pool. I'm buying one right down the street
*  from that one. I said, so I'm, I'm obviously I'm pulling out money. I said, so I told money to
*  a hundred thousand dollars. They said, that's fine. We get, they said they could only get me
*  a hundred thousand dollars out for something about Fannie Mae guidelines, which is true.
*  And I, and I said, so then she said, I can get you, I can send you to a friend of mine who's a
*  loan officer. She can get you a second mortgage, which she did. I said, then I told her she could
*  only get me a hundred thousand or so, 190,000 in the out. And she said, you should get an equity
*  line of credit if you're going to be doing like, you know, renovating properties. So she sent me
*  to somebody and they got me an equity line of credit. I said, I said, you know, I haven't
*  committed fraud. I said, I wouldn't know how to commit fraud. If you told me, I said, what sounds
*  more reasonable, a guy that works for a labor company ripped off a bunch of banks for over
*  half a million dollars. I said, or some loan officers got together and did something illegal.
*  I said, there's a problem at the bank. And he says, I think you've got a problem at the bank.
*  And this guy goes nuts. And while he's screaming, he needs to be arrested. This is fraud.
*  My loan officers have not done anything illegal. They wouldn't do that. He says, look at his ID.
*  His ID is fake. His ID starts with zero, zero, zero. South Carolina IDs start with zero, zero,
*  this guy's in California. He has no idea. So when he says that, he, the detective looks at my ID and
*  he goes, listen, he said, this is a real ID. I ran this guy through NCIC. He said, this is Gary Sullivan.
*  And I looked at him, I go, now I'm not Gary Sullivan. I go, come on, bro, what are we doing here?
*  And he goes, I know Gary, I know. And he says, I'm going to take him downtown. I'm going to
*  talk to my whatever lieutenant, whoever captain, and I'm going to fill out a police report and I'll
*  let you know. And he hangs up. I get up, they've taken the handcuffs off. I stand up. As we're
*  walking out with the detectives, as we're all kind of walking out, he goes, hey, you have an ID. Do
*  you have a driver's license? And I went, um, I do, but it's in like Nevada. And he goes, oh,
*  that's right. He goes, you're from Vegas. And he looks at the two deputies and they all kind of
*  grin. And I think he ran me through NCIC, which means he ran a statewide criminal database,
*  which means he thinks I've been arrested three times for prostitution in Vegas.
*  Ah, right.
*  I listen, I'm humiliated. I was just like, and the grin told me and I was just like,
*  oh man. And so one of the cops goes, uh, here, give me the ID, takes the ID. He goes, I'll check
*  and see, cause I have to follow him back in my car. So he goes, and by the way, my car is,
*  is in the name Michael Eckert. So Michael Eckert, he doesn't have a photograph of Michael Eckert.
*  Right.
*  Because you can't pull up photographs from other States. So he doesn't have a photograph,
*  but he knows that's not my car. And he asked me, whose car are you driving? I said, oh,
*  that's my boss, Michael Eckert. I said that's my boss. And he goes, oh, Michael Eckert. I said,
*  yeah, exactly. And he's like, and I'm like, oh my God. So I'm thinking he knows Michael Eckert,
*  knows it's registered in North Carolina, knows the address, which is where I was currently living.
*  That's a problem. So the police officer or the, um, sorry, deputy grabs the ID,
*  walks outside, comes back. I have no idea if this homeless guy has a driver's license in Nevada.
*  I don't know. He had nothing on him. He comes back and he goes, he is, does he have a valid license?
*  He goes, yeah, it's valid. And he hands it to him or he hands me the ID and he says, uh, he said,
*  he goes, is valid. And he looked at me and he goes, yeah, well, he said, it says he's like,
*  he says he's five foot 11, like it was like five, 10, five 11. I'm clearly not five, 10 or five 11.
*  And they all look at me and I go fellas with a good pair of shoes like that. And they all go,
*  follow us, Gary. I follow them back to the police station. Becky is calling me on the phone,
*  screaming her head off. Now I'd always told Becky, if I ever get arrested,
*  immediately go get me a lawyer. The lawyer will be able to get me out on bond because it'll,
*  I'll be arrested for something stupid. I said, it'll be something like trying to cash a check,
*  you know, a fake check or a, you know, use of somebody said it won't be the, all my IDs are
*  real. So it won't be for, for a fake ID. So my ID won't be in question. And most, most police
*  departments and sheriffs at that time did not run your fingerprints through APHIS. So they didn't,
*  cause they charge them for that. So they don't, they don't typically do it unless your identity
*  is in question. Mine wouldn't be, I have a valid driver's license or a valid ID in that state.
*  So I go back, she's screaming, she's like, oh my God, you don't understand. I just checked the,
*  I just checked the, just checked the internet, the website. You are number one on the secret
*  services most wanted list. And I was like, I got bigger problems right now. They just held me in
*  the bank. I'm following them right now. And she was like, yeah, get on the, get on the interstate,
*  go, go. I cannot go. The detectives in front of me, the cops are behind me. They're escorting me
*  to the police. Listen, she's like, oh my God, run, run. I go, look, not a NASCAR driver. Like I'm
*  driving, it's a sports car, but it's not going to outrun a radio or a helicopter. Like I have not,
*  that's not going to happen. I know it looks, it seems nice. I'm not that guy. So I was like,
*  I can't, I said, look, you don't understand. I was in handcuffs 30 minutes ago. I just talked my way
*  out of them. I'm going to get out of this. And I, and I said, the worst that happens is I'll be
*  arrested as Gary Sullivan. You can get me a police, you can get me a, an attorney. He can get me out.
*  And she goes, I'm not getting you an attorney. I'm not getting you out on bond. I'm not risking
*  everything I've got for you because she has all the money. We've got seven, $800,000 at this point.
*  So, oh, and by the way, she's not even in North Carolina at this point. She's relocated to
*  Houston, Texas, because when this scam broke, fell apart, we were going to move to Texas.
*  So we were already moving there. So, but by the way, just a small tangent, where do you store
*  money in situations like this? That, like, when you talk about $800,000, do you have to keep moving
*  accounts to make sure it's not accessible by FBI? Well, there's about six or $700,000 in accounts,
*  but keep in mind, I'm getting it out in cash. Like there's no Bitcoin. There's no, none of that stuff
*  exists. So my, you know, I probably should have bought diamonds or bought gold or bought, like,
*  I don't know any of that. All I could think of is go in slowly, be patient. Don't drain the accounts,
*  fluctuate them. Like I was writing, getting cashier's checks from one account to another.
*  So the balances were doing this, you know, they weren't just going, they were doing this.
*  And then one day, boom, they're gone. So we got out like, whatever, we got, we've gotten out like
*  six or $700,000. There's still like six or $700,000 in the bank, but I'm not going back. I'm done.
*  I actually, to be honest with you, so, well, look, I go in, so I go into the police station,
*  and what first she says, if you go in the police station, I'm done. If you get arrested, you're
*  done. I said, well, then I better not get arrested. I hang up the phone, the cop standing behind my
*  car, get out. I go in the police station. I walk in, I fill out the police report. He tells me,
*  I got to talk to my captain real quick. Can you wait? He couldn't leave me in his cubicle. He
*  was, can you wait in the hallway? I can't leave you in the queue. I said, no, no problem. So I go and
*  I wait in the hallway, in the hallway are a whole wall full of, on the corkboard,
*  wanted posters, black and white, black and white, black, you know, car thief, you know, rapist,
*  murderer, secret services, most wanted. And I'm on the, on my face is right there. I'm like,
*  holy Jesus. And, you know, everything in me told me, run, bro, just fucking haul ash right now,
*  just go, you've, you've your luck's run out. Not that I even thought it was, there were so many,
*  I didn't think he was going to see it, but it just, everything in me just said, run. The problem is,
*  if you've ever been a police, into a police station, you're not getting out of it.
*  You understand that there's a lot of cops. Well, not just that, but they buzz you in.
*  Yeah. You get in the elevator, you have to punch in a code, you have to punch in a code to get back
*  out of the elevator. You have to punch in a code to get into the next door. There's like, I mean,
*  it was, it's impossible. Like I'm never, I'm not going to get in the elevator.
*  So guy comes back up to the cop comes back up. He said, Hey, Gary, appreciate it. No problem.
*  My captain said, we're good. We're going to wait for a phone call from the, no, the district
*  attorney called already. They're looking into it. I'm going to go ahead and let you go.
*  I go downstairs. He walks me out to my car. He said, look,
*  do me a favor. He's like, we do have some serious questions at this point. Like the district
*  attorney said, there's, there's some, something is up. He said, I said, not with me. And he said,
*  well, just do me a favor. He goes, don't, don't leave town. I said, bro, I own two houses here.
*  I'm not going anywhere. I said, I'm telling you right now, I said, Wachovia, they, they fucked up.
*  And he's like, I believe you. I believe you. He said, I worry. He said, whatever. He's like,
*  I hope you, I hope they were right. I'm sure you're right. Okay. So I get in my car. I leave,
*  I go to two more banks, pull out more money. But at one point I go into a bank and like
*  two of the cashiers practically slam into each other, trying to get to the phone. And I could
*  tell something's up. Like, no, no, no, no, no, something's up. So I back, I get my car back out.
*  One of them even kind of runs out, looks tag number, you know? So I drive, I get in the
*  interstate. I go, you know, Becky, of course she's, you know, I'm sorry. I love you. I would have
*  never done that. I was just scared. I understand. I go, Becky sounds like a handful. Oh my God,
*  bro. So I go all the way back to Charlotte. I pack up my apartment. I drive all the way to
*  Houston with my entire apartment packed up, by the way, in a U-Haul. Like the next day,
*  the next morning we pack, she's got people there packing it up, movers. We pack it up. I drive the
*  U-Haul all the way to Houston. It takes a couple of days. I unload it into, we have some guys
*  unload it into a, into a storage unit because I'm going to stay with Becky until I find my own
*  apartment. As we're driving around the neighborhood, super nice. She's living in like whatever,
*  like that 20th floor or something of some huge high rise, great apartment. We drive by and I go,
*  stop the car. And I want to get out on it. It's one of those cone things where there's flyers for the
*  house, for a house. I jump out and I get the flyer and, and she's like, what are you doing? I go,
*  I just want to, you know, I just look at the flyer and she says, I don't want to do a scam here. I
*  want to live here. This place is nice. I love it here. And I went, right. I understand. I said,
*  I'm not going to, I said, no, but I have a fine, an apartment. And she is, oh, you just, I'm just
*  so disgusting. You can't stand to spend even a couple of weeks with me. You just, and she goes
*  just ballistic. She's screaming at the top of her lungs and I know she's going to get me caught.
*  She's never going to get me out. Right. She's already told me that. So we go back to the
*  apartment. We go upstairs. I was so scared of this chick, bro. I was so scared. I remember I was going
*  up in the elevator and this girl gets on this clearly a stripper. I mean, drop dead, just,
*  but wearing stripper clothes. And I'm staring and as soon as she got on, Becky gave me that
*  with a face and I'm like this, I'm like staring in the corner and never look at the girl. And I
*  remember we get off the elevator, it opens. I bolt off it. Becky bolts off this and I off the
*  elevator. And I remember she squeals, I bet you just love to fuck that tramp. And the girl,
*  as the elevator doors are closing, she goes, Hey, I thought that was funny. So I go to the apartment.
*  We, we have a screaming match kind of tell her I want to split up the money. She tells me she's
*  not going to give me split the money. Why? Because she said, you can go somewhere else and do this
*  again. You'll have a million dollars in six months. You know, I have to live off this money.
*  Did she threaten you? Oh, she threatened the, it was funny too, because the conversation back
*  and forth, I remember saying, no, I want to happen. And she goes, and she said, I'll give
*  you $10,000. I said, you're out of your mind. I said, I said, I'm telling right now you come up
*  with something reasonable. I'll take all of it. And she said, what did she say? I said, I'll take
*  all of it. She's in what escape in that you haul. They're going to choose the cops are going to be
*  looking for in five minutes. And I went, I just remember thinking, Oh, wow. And keep in mind,
*  all of my IDs, everything are in the storage unit that she has a key to. Like I'm not getting those.
*  It's over. Yeah. I got an ID right now that says my name is Michael Eckert. Yeah. I am driving.
*  I got, I'm driving a U-Haul van. Yeah. Sounds like she has a lot of negotiation leverage. Right. So
*  we start arguing back and forth and she says a hundred thousand dollars. I'll give you a hundred
*  thousand. I said, I'll take it. She counted out, uh, counts out the a hundred thousand later. When
*  I recounted, it wasn't even a hundred. It was like 98,000. That's fine. That's fine. So, um,
*  but you know, we've got them all marked, you know, 2000, 5,000, 6,000. She's like,
*  2005,000. That's 12. That's it. She ends up, um, stiffen me. That's fine. It's not my money.
*  So I, I take it. I end up, you know, I take it. I leave. And as I'm leaving, she'd always called me
*  before on the phone and begged and pleaded and cried. I messed up. Please give me a chance. I'm
*  sorry. I'm I'll take my medication. I'm sorry. I thought it was better. I thought it was okay.
*  And I remember walking out. I put my cell phone on the counter and just walked out,
*  went downstairs, got in the truck and drove. Um, and, uh, drove when I got to
*  Louisiana, I stopped at Baton Rouge and got a, I mean, at some point I stopped and I got like,
*  I think I got a room or something. At one point I know I stopped.
*  So you drove without a plan essentially. I drove back to
*  Charlotte to get my car. Got it. So I can't be driving. I can drive. Yeah, right. So I stopped
*  at Baton Rouge at one point and got a cell phone, you know, like a burner phone, like a Verizon
*  Virgin mobile or something. Uh, one of those little phones. So I bought one.
*  I call a few people at home, back home, called my mom. Um, she's in tears, crying. My dad's
*  yelling in the background. I call, uh, what's your mom, just a small attention. What did your mom and
*  dad say? Anything stand out to you? My dad, you know, you know, well, I hope you're happy.
*  You know, your mother, every time someone mentions your name, your mother cries,
*  which is funny to me. Cause like growing up, like he was never concerned about her crying,
*  you know? So it was like, since when did you care? You know? And I just, so I mean, my dad, like,
*  he's an alcoholic, you know, he's been sober for two years, a month and a half drunk, drunken,
*  binge or drinking, sorry, drinking binge, and then sober for six months and then did it again.
*  And then sober, you know, just went back and forth and, uh, in and out of, uh, alcohol,
*  you know, drug programs. Uh, but like I said, it worked for state farm and state farm, he was a top
*  selling manager. And so what they would do is they, they put them into a 30 day program. And,
*  and I mean, like a, like he has to stay there and they had, they were the only ones that had that
*  kind of control. Cause they're like, you're going to do this and you're going to pass it or we're
*  firing you. You know, he, he made a lot of money and he made a lot of money for state farm and he
*  hired, he hired and trained a ton of agents and he had one of the top performing agencies.
*  So he was worth a lot to them. And, uh, but so I, I end up, what ends up happening is I'm driving
*  through, I get that phone that I was telling you about and I call, so I call, talk to my mom.
*  She's, you know, she's crying. She's like, I love you so much. You know, I just want to make sure
*  you're, you're safe. I ended up calling a Susan Barker, which was one of the brokers that worked
*  for me at the time, call her and I say, Hey, what's going on? How's it? She's like, Oh, Matt,
*  you know, what's going on? FBI is everywhere. Like they're there. They've been talking to everybody.
*  They, you know, and this has been, it's like a year and a half at this point. And she's like,
*  it's not, you know, they're, they come around every once in a while. Everybody's gone in,
*  everybody's cooperating. Everybody's talking. Everybody's blaming you. Um, including her.
*  And, uh, and so as we're talking, she said, look, I've, I've the main FBI agent on the case.
*  She told me if I ever spoke with you to have you call her and I was like, yeah, I'm good.
*  So she was, her name is Candace and she, she wants you to call her. She was at least caller
*  for God's sakes. Maybe you could just turn yourself in. Maybe, maybe you can negotiate
*  just like a couple of years, like a, cause they're, if they're not going to catch you,
*  then, then maybe turn yourself in. Maybe it'll help at least hear her out. And I was like, okay,
*  all right, you're right. Hang up the phone. I call Candace. She picks up the phone. I go,
*  Hey, uh, she goes, who's this? And I go, this is Matt Cox. And she goes, Hey, hello, Mr. Cox.
*  How are you? And I go, I'm doing okay. How's it going? I understand. You want to talk to me.
*  She says, I do. I said, what can I do for you? She says, you can turn yourself in. I go,
*  well, that's not going to happen. I said, what else do you need? And she said, I think that you
*  should think about turning yourself in. I said, why? Well, what am I looking at? She says, well,
*  that's not how it works. The way it works is you turn yourself in and you know, we take that in
*  consideration. I said, no, no, no, no. I said, that's not good enough. I said, I'm not, I'm not
*  stupid enough to turn myself in and hope for the best. So she says, um, well, let's talk about this.
*  And I said, well, what am I looking at? And she says, I don't really know. I can't, you know,
*  really, I can't tell you that. And she's, I said, well, well, then we don't really have anything to
*  talk about. She goes, well, wait a second. She said, let me, hold on, let me call the US attorney.
*  Maybe we can work something out. So she calls the US. She, so I said, okay, I'll call you back.
*  And she said,
*  well, give me your phone number. I'll call you. And I went, no, no, no. I said, I'll, um,
*  I'll call you. I said, I'm going to hang up the phone. I'm going to turn the phone off. I said,
*  for all I know, you're triangulating this phone call right now or something, you know?
*  And she says, Oh, give me a break. She says, you're not that important.
*  And I remember thinking, who do you think you are? Like, like she, like, right? Like you're,
*  you're just some little fraudster guy running around, you know, like you're not a terrorist,
*  you know? And I almost,
*  I almost was like, Oh, okay. Here's my number, which she probably already had,
*  but I almost was like, Oh, okay. I'll wait for your call and left my phone. I said, no,
*  you know what? I said, I'm going to hang up the phone. I'm going to turn it off. Anyway,
*  I'll call you back. She's all right. Whatever. I hang up. I turn off the phone. It turns out,
*  I found out later when I ordered the freedom of information act, she actually immediately called
*  the US marshals and they immediately called, took the phone number and tracked back the phone
*  and immediately had two marshals from Baton Rouge or go immediately to the place where I had been.
*  Damn. Oh, listen. Yeah. I mean, they were fast. Yeah. She's, she's good too. Not just that. I,
*  I made the initial calls sitting there in that, where I went and bought the phone. It was like a
*  gas station. There was also like a subway station. I had ordered like a subway. I was eating a subway,
*  playing on my computer, program the phone and making phone calls. So by the time I talked to her
*  and they're, they're driving. I, by that point I walked and gotten into the vehicle, my vehicle,
*  and I leave, but you know, who knows? I don't know if they showed up 30 minutes late. I don't
*  know. Like I could have hung out like, Oh, I'm just going to finish my food. Could have shown up. So
*  I go, I call her back an hour or two later. She says, listen, you know, the first time he wasn't
*  hadn't gotten back with her. Then he did. Then he came back. He said seven years. She's got to turn
*  himself in here. So, okay. Seven years. That's, that seems like a lot. And I was like seven years
*  and that's seven years for, for, I was, and I kept saying, is that seven years for everything?
*  And she goes, yeah, that's for everything. I was like, that's everything. Like everything in that
*  happened, like in Atlanta, like in some stuff that you don't know about. She said, look, what's
*  important is you turn yourself in in Tampa. And I was like, okay, well I'm closer to Atlanta.
*  Why wouldn't I turn myself in in Atlanta? And she's like, look, you know, you don't want to do
*  that. You don't want to do that. Well, cause that would have been the secret service would have
*  gotten the credit if I'd walked in there. Right. So, you know, and I don't know anything about
*  rivalries and how they work at that time. I do now, but so we go back and forth, back and forth.
*  And I continually ask her, does that include Atlanta and everything? And at some point I
*  realized like, oh, she's just not answering. And so finally I said, listen, you keep dodging this
*  question. And she said, all I can speak for is Tampa. So if you come back to Tampa
*  and you cooperate against everyone seven years,
*  and she's telling me she wants me to cooperate against my ex-wife. And I'm like, I'm not going
*  to do that. I said, my ex-wife didn't do anything. She doesn't know anything. She didn't do anything.
*  She's never, you know, that's not what I heard. And then she's going on and on.
*  And I was like, no, no. I was like, oh wow. I was like, so that's just for,
*  and she's like, that's right. I said, all right, we're done. She's no, wait, I can call the Atlanta
*  US attorney. I said, no lady, I wouldn't believe you if you told me water was wet.
*  I don't trust you. And I hung up the phone, threw it out the window and I ended up going to Charlotte,
*  drop off the U-Haul van, go to my, I know I never did, I probably brought it back to the
*  dealer. It's not like I vetted, I brought it back. So I bring it back. I go to my old apartment in
*  downtown Charlotte and I remember thinking I would be okay. And I know by this point
*  that they knew Michael Eckert's name. They had the address in Charlotte. So I know they,
*  by this point it's been five, six days. So I know they've tracked him back there.
*  So I figured if I could get my car, I'm fine. So I go into the apartment complex and it,
*  you know, it's like five, it's one of those four or five, six story apartment, you know, those are
*  parking things that stack up. So I go into this, you know, underground, it's not underground,
*  but whatever this parking garage thing. So I go in, I'm on like the third floor or something. I
*  look at my car, you know, and I get in my car. And I remember as soon as I drove out of the
*  parking garage, I was like, I'm good. So I can go ahead and pull over and I'm like,
*  so I can go ahead and pull across the street and stop at Starbucks. So I stop at Starbucks.
*  I walk into Starbucks, I order a Starbucks, I'm standing there waiting for the barista.
*  I look over and it's two people from the apartment complex staring at me.
*  That's why I'm like, and there's they're whispering and pointing and I remember
*  thinking this is like the fifth of the month. I hadn't paid my rent and been there. So I thought
*  it makes sense. Maybe they like I'm picturing an eviction notice or a three day notice on my door
*  or something. And I'm like, okay. And then one of them bolts out the back, the woman,
*  there's a guy and a girl, the woman runs out the back. He's standing there staring at me.
*  I get my, my, my, my Venti vanilla latte. All right. I get my little, I get my frou frou drink.
*  Yeah. So I got my frou frou drink. I walk out, I get into the car. He follows me, get in the car.
*  I set everything up. I put my seatbelt on. I'm okay. He's standing there staring at me.
*  I, you know, I'm thinking something's wrong, like what's up. And all of, and I checked to see
*  there's no traffic. I'm good. I'm about to, about to leave. And he starts screaming. He's right here.
*  He's right here. I look in the rear view mirror. There's two guys running towards the back of my
*  car. I punch it and I take off. Sounds dramatic. Wasn't that dramatic. I'd already, there was no
*  cars. I knew there was no cars already pulling out. You know, it wasn't like a TJ hooker where
*  I jumped over the slit across the, the hood and slow, you know, they didn't catch the car and hang
*  on the back, but you know, I, so they're running and I boom hit it. Did you spill the coffee or
*  no. Cause it was one of those little things. It was actually nice, but you're making it sound
*  like you were pretty calm. Once you're panicking here and it was terrified. Yeah. Terrified. So
*  you're under, under fear. You're still operate. Yeah, I operate. Like I, it's funny you say that
*  because the, the secret service, when they talk to these guys, they, all the people that they spoke
*  with said the same thing over and over again. The guy was a professional. He never seemed upset. He
*  never seemed agitated. He always, he was never in a hurry. Yeah. He, you know, like,
*  but most of the time I, I wasn't because I, you know, it wasn't until the police got involved or
*  should the law and federal law enforcement got involved that I, I started really, you know,
*  getting anxious. So at that point I dry, I take off, I drive about a mile down the road. Who were
*  the two guys by the way? Was it, I thought it was FBI. I ordered the freedom of information act when
*  I got to prison at some point, you know, in the future and it was, it was us marshals.
*  Right. So it sounds pretty dramatic to me. You guys, marshals running towards your car. You pull,
*  I mean, I mean, you know, but it's all right. It's hard not to tell it like it's dramatic.
*  I understand. But it was, there's not much traffic. It was okay. Yeah. It's not like their,
*  you know, their fingers were at the back of the car they're holding on, you know, but it was,
*  yeah, if I had waited an extra 20 seconds, yeah, they would have been on my car. They would have
*  been right there at the door. Did you consider giving up there or no? No, all I could think of
*  was haul. Listen, my instinct is get out, is go, go, go, go, go, go. You're already on the run.
*  I'm already in trouble. It's not like they're going to be, they're going to,
*  it's, they're going to add anything. Although to be honest, you know, it only got worse because
*  at that point, actually at that point I drive down the road. I stop at a homeless facility. I survey
*  three guys. I'm a mile down the road. Like looking back on, I think, what were you thinking? But there
*  were three, three homeless guys that were in their early thirties and they were, they were all
*  Caucasian. That's hard to find. So trust me, I've looked, spent hours before track of finding these
*  guys. So that's like the golden thing you're looking for is white guys in their thirties.
*  Right. Cause that's why I was in my thirties. That I wasn't an old man like I am now. So I,
*  surveyed them. I drive straight to Nashville, get to Nashville,
*  drive through an area called a green Hills.
*  Well, I first like, when I got to Nashville, I stayed the night and the next day I went into,
*  I'm going to say UPS store. It was actually a Kinko's there used to be something. They used
*  to be called Kinko's, but I go in and remember Kinko's. Oh yeah. They got bought by FedEx. I
*  feel like, Oh, is it FedEx? Okay. Then it was a FedEx store. So I go in there and you give them
*  like 50 bucks or something or 20 bucks or something. They'd give you like a hundred business
*  cards. So I get a, I go get a burn, a phone number, a burner phone. I go in there, I make up,
*  Oh, I call and get a phone number from HQ, the local HQ. I come up with a name,
*  manufactured funding group. I've got two phone numbers. I get business cards made with the name.
*  One of the guys named that I surveyed was, his actual name was Joseph Marion Carter Jr. I went
*  by Carter. So I get business cards made at Joseph Carter. I then drive through green Hills. It took
*  them like an hour to get the card. So I'm driving through green Hills. I'm planning on going to an
*  apartment, but I'm still, I don't have an idea. I don't have anything like I'm wondering how,
*  what am I going to do? How am I going to get a place to stay? I'm going to stay in a hotel.
*  Like, what am I doing? I'm using an ID that the cops are looking for. So as I'm driving,
*  trying to find this big apartment complex, there's a guy putting a sign in the front yard of like a
*  townhouse because several townhouses. And I probably in his sixties, I pull in, jump out of the car and
*  I said, Hey, is that this for rent? He said, yes, it is. I said, Oh, okay. Yeah. Can I see it? Sure.
*  I go in, check it out, come back downstairs. It's perfect. I said, listen, I, you know, I work for a
*  company, you know, manufactured funding group, boom, hand thing. I said, I, I've been in, in Europe
*  for the last, I forget what I said. I said, England, I some little town outside of London
*  and whatever Dexter, you know, London for the past five years. I don't really have any,
*  any credit, but I said, I can put down a double the security deposit or whatever you need. Here's
*  my business card. He looked at me and he looked at my car and he goes, you look like an honest
*  young man. He said, I'll, I'll take the first month's rent and a deposit. And he said, now
*  go get a lease right now. And I said, okay. And I said, Oh, okay. Filled out a lease right then
*  gave me the keys. Like nice, like very trusting in, in, in that town.
*  Well, yeah, but there must've been also something about you or you're just,
*  I mean, I don't, got a nice car. I know what you're going to get a lot of comments that say white
*  privilege, but I think the charisma has something to do with it. Well, I, so he gave, I appreciate
*  that. So he gave me the keys. Listen, I ordered all of, all of Joseph Carter's vital information,
*  right? Like all of his birth certificates, social security card, everything that night from like a
*  Kinko's or some of the, I forget where, but from one of these places, I went online. You could go
*  online back then, right? Like there wasn't wifi everywhere. So I ordered the stuff. It shows up a
*  couple of days later. I take that information. I go and I get a driver's license. We're gonna
*  about within like seven or eight days. I've got a driver's license in his name. I get in that car,
*  Michael Eckert's car. I drive it all the way back to Nashville. I leave it in long-term parking,
*  get on a plane, fly back to Nashville, go in and buy myself a brand new car. It was a brand new,
*  it was a couple of years old, but from like CarMax, within two weeks, I am completely 100% set up.
*  I start dating for three, four months. That gets really boring. And, uh, where, where again?
*  Nashville, he says Nashville. Okay, got it. So I started dating a bunch of chicks and then I end
*  up meeting this one girl. By the way, are you lonely here? Cause you're on the run. Listen,
*  I'm telling you right now, being on the run was the best part of my life. Really? Everybody,
*  you know how all these guys say, it was horrible. And I was always so concerned and looking over my
*  shoulder and it wasn't, I wasn't. Keep in mind, I've gotten, I've gotten five or six traffic tickets
*  while on the run. I went to traffic school as someone else. I got so many traffic tickets in
*  his name. I went to traffic school as him. Like if I got pulled over, like I'm not concerned.
*  So your confidence just was over the top here. And I'm driving, driving a vehicle in the name
*  of the driver's license that I have that was issued by that state, full coverage insurance.
*  I'm not an idiot. I'm not driving around a stolen car with a broken tail light and a body in the
*  trunk. Like I'm covered. Like I'm not concerned about the local cops. Uh, plus you're going to
*  Starbucks, sipping your coffee and driving away from a US marshal. Right, right. That was,
*  you could start believing that it's impossible to catch you. That is exactly what it is. It's,
*  every time I just kept getting more and more emboldened, more and more cocky, arrogant,
*  like they're not going to catch, I'm too good, you know, which is great until they catch you.
*  And so I, I meet a girl named Amanda Gardner. Well, what I ended up doing is
*  let's keep in mind, I've only got a hundred thousand or so. So I go and I start buying houses in
*  the area in this area called JC Napier next to it's just close to downtown. And I buy these
*  houses and I start record, I buy them for like 60, 70,000 and I record the sales at 210, 190,
*  one two two Oh five, that sort of thing. Same thing. And I refinance the house as I start pulling
*  out money. I meet this girl, Amanda Gardner. She, we hit it off within a few months. She's moved in
*  to, we move into a house in that area. I renovate a house. We move in there. I borrow
*  three and a half million dollars and I'm buying houses. Now I'm buying houses, recording the value.
*  I started all over, you know, I borrow like whatever, three and a half million dollars.
*  I meet Amanda, we move in together. We're, we're, we're buying.
*  Do you tell her, do you tell her?
*  She kind of, you know, what she knew was that, you know, it's, it's, it's odd, right? I have no
*  photographs. Everything I own is brand new. She's like, you don't, there's nothing in this house
*  that's more than four months old. So six months old, you have no photographs.
*  You have no internet presence. You have no, you know, it's every stick of clothing is brand new.
*  You don't have old pairs of jeans.
*  Do you tell her stories about the past of any, like, is there a fabricated?
*  Initially, there was a fabricated version that I owned, I owned a mortgage company.
*  My typical story was like, I owned a mortgage company and I got bought out by household bank.
*  Started doing very well. I got bought out by household bank. I have a no non-compete clause.
*  I got, you know, I ended up with like half a million dollars after paying off all my bills
*  and just decided to kind of travel around the U.S. and now I'm here. I'm gonna start renovating houses.
*  But that, you know, you don't call home. Nobody calls you. Your family doesn't call you.
*  You tell stories about your mom, your dad, your brother, your sister, friends.
*  I don't know any of these friends, never seen any of these friends. They never call you.
*  They never, you know, it's just like, it's like, ah, shit.
*  So at some point I basically just said to her, look,
*  I'm, listen, at one point I had to have a check cut. I refinanced the house, right?
*  And I had like, I want to say, I'm going to say something like it might've been 30,000,
*  let's say 20,000. I had a $20,000 check cut to Amanda Gardner because you have to have these
*  checks. You can't have them cut to me. So I would say, Hey, there's a second mortgage on there.
*  And I provide a second mortgage or I provide, you know, I provide different things. And I knew
*  I need names of people to cut these things too. So I had a check cut for whatever.
*  So I remember we're at dinner one night. This is before she really knows who I am.
*  And I said, Hey, I said, Oh, and she was, Oh, did you had a refi? She's how'd that thing go?
*  You're refinancing. I went, Oh, thank God you said that. Boom. I said, I need to deposit this.
*  Give it a check for 20,000. She's like, um, I can, I can, I can go tomorrow and I can deposit it.
*  And I, um, and I'm like, no, no, I'm like, look, it's fine. Just deposit. So I can get,
*  as soon as it clears, I'll, I'll get you a cashier's check. Um, I was like, no,
*  just deposit it and keep it in your bank. It's fine. So she's like, what is going on? You know?
*  So we have this conversation and I tell her, look, people are looking for me. Who? Law enforcement.
*  Which ones? All of them. You know, she's like, that doesn't even, for what? I go,
*  mostly bank fraud. And she's like, well, how are they not finding you? I mean, everybody,
*  you know, people know you like, you know, your general contractor, which I met four months before
*  this guy, six months before this one, two months before, you know, she's like, so-and-so, so-and-so,
*  so, and I'm like, right, right. Well, I said, well, she's like, I mean, they've got your name.
*  They've got your, I go, well, that's identity theft. And she was like, what do you mean? I said,
*  well, my name's not, you know, my name's not, it's not Joseph Carter. And what is your,
*  what is your name? I go, look, you know, it's, it's, you don't need, don't even worry about it.
*  This is what's happening. This is where I'm at. This has been months into the relationship. I mean,
*  this is, or I'd say maybe a month or two in, but, you know, she was just too inquisitive. And,
*  oh, I know what it was. She found like $40,000 in cash in my freezer one night. That was another
*  thing that happened. She went to get a popsicle and she opened up the flip to get a popsicle.
*  And she opened the wrong one and there was all cash. And she was like, like, you know, I had the
*  other day, you know, in this conversation, the other day I opened up the popsicle box and there's
*  cash. And I'm like, so I kind of explain it, but I had a feeling she's not going to, she's going to
*  be okay with this, you know? So she was okay. She was okay with it. I mean, to me, that's just a
*  fascinating conversation to have. Like it was a great conversation because oftentimes in relationships,
*  you learn about each other and you find out new things. And here you find out. That's a doozy.
*  Yeah, it's a good one to find out. The name you're using is not your real name.
*  And the Secret Service, the FBI and everybody else are looking for you.
*  Yeah. And you're like, to be honest, you're not a violent criminal. So it's like,
*  and I, you know, you know, but she didn't know my name. Like she was like, she,
*  and I told her, I said, look, if you start digging, if you find out my name, like I'll leave,
*  like there's certain things that catch you staying in contact with people that you know,
*  that's how you get caught. You know, going back to see people, that's how you get caught, you know,
*  telling people who you are, that's how you get caught. And I was like, so I'm Joseph Carter.
*  Everything's fine. And she was like, okay, you know, and keep in mind too, this girl, do you,
*  oh, your car's broken or your car's not doing well, take it and trade it in. We'll go get you
*  another car. We'll go get you, you know, an infinity, you know, FX or whatever, you know,
*  a $55,000, $60,000 vehicle. She's driving the equivalent of a beat up old Nova. You know,
*  I mean, it's, you want to go on vacation? We'll go on vacation. You want to do this? You want to do
*  that. So, you know, we're buying houses. I, I'm, we're, we're renovating houses. We're, we're
*  building brand new houses. We're buying lots. Like she's like in the middle of this, like,
*  holy Jesus, there's hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank and our bank account.
*  Her bank account. I open up a corporation in her name. She's opening up bank accounts. She's got
*  web, there's websites. It's, it's a lot. And while this is happening,
*  we start seeing a friend of hers. So this other girl comes in the picture, her name's Trina and
*  um, Trina is, um, semi-lesbian. So.
*  Is this like a sexual thing or actual relationship?
*  No, it's no, it's more like, uh, she's coming over a couple of times a week.
*  So we've got a ton of tons going on. Uh, and
*  and.
*  I put this, so while this is happening, I, I end up coming out in like several magazines. So I'm
*  thinking this whole thing's dying down, but it's not dying down because now I just got caught and
*  handcuffed in a bank, walked out of the police station, outran marshals. Although then that part,
*  the Marshall thing never was never in the papers, but, um, the getting caught and handcuffed in the
*  bank, when that hit the papers, that's everywhere, bro. That's huge. You know, suddenly Chicago
*  tribunes running a series of fugitives. Um, I'm in Bloomberg business week. They run an article,
*  article called, you know, sharks in the housing pool. Uh, then you've got a fortune magazine
*  comes out with a thing because by now, guess what? Becky's been caught. Oh, Becky. Becky,
*  is she in Houston or whatever in Houston got caught and did she, but gangster, bro.
*  Like the way she, here's the thing. Hey, hey, there you go. No. Oh no. She told on me immediately.
*  Oh, she did. Oh no. It's fine. She did the right thing. So here's what's funny about that.
*  I don't know about that. She, here's what she says. Loyalty is everything in this world. My friend,
*  did that, you and I disagree on. I just took off. I just took off still on her and left her with,
*  with, listen, with like six or like five or $600,000 is what I left her with. It's not,
*  it's not all about money, Matthew. It's also about just like, you know, ride or die.
*  There's a meaning to that. I'm sorry. Go ahead. So she told us, she said everything. Well, here's
*  what, when I say gangster, when she gets caught, yeah. Um, they come in, she's in the middle of
*  beauty school. She's paid for beauty school. She's going through beauty school. She's going to open
*  like a salon or something. So she's in there cutting hair in a class, you know, on a mannequin
*  and all of a sudden like five or six secret service agents come in guns drawn, screaming,
*  get on the ground, get on the ground. She said, everybody dropped the ground. She said,
*  I'm sitting there with scissors going, you know, they grab her, they handcuff her, they bring her
*  in and the whole time. Now at that point she was Rebecca or she was, her name was Rebecca Hickey.
*  She went by Becca. She was, so she's Rebecca Hickey, which is, you know, it's, she's got a
*  Texas driver's license, the whole thing. And they're screaming at her and they, she, they put her
*  in the car and they're driving the whole way. She was literally the guy, the secret service agent told
*  me 45 minutes. She's telling us you're losing your job, bro. You're losing. I mean, he's, he's like,
*  I couldn't believe it. Like we've, we've got pictures of her. We're like, this is you. She's like,
*  that's not me. Are you insane? Look at that chubby little thing. Yeah. Would not budge till they
*  actually put her hand on the scanner and she goes, okay. I'm, I'm Rebecca Hauk. What do you need?
*  They're like, where's Matt Cox? She's, I have no idea. That fucker left me like a year ago. So,
*  so, but she contributed to the story to the legend that's already growing. Oh,
*  because she was interviewed by a fortune magazine and it was horrendous. The article is horrendous.
*  He was abusive. He, he's a Don Juan that, that forced me to fall in love with him,
*  commit mortgage fraud, and then took all the money and left. By the way, they found like 40
*  or 50 grand on her and maybe another 30 or 40 in her bank account and no other money.
*  Yeah. Where's the other money? So anyway, and she was, by the way, she got caught. She was
*  in communication with her family. It was, so she's talking to her mom. That's when she got
*  caught ultimately. And her mother through multiple conversations, one conversation being,
*  mom, I'm doing fine. I can't tell you where I am, you know, exactly. But I, I'm in Houston,
*  Texas. I'm fine. Next one, six months later, I enrolled in beauty school, Houston, Texas beauty
*  school. How many are there? Yeah. And her mom bipolar. I just want to see my daughter. Yeah.
*  I'm going to call the secret service. Yep. I'm doing the right thing. Yeah. And honestly,
*  she is doing the right thing. So, um, so you're getting more and more famous nationally. Right.
*  So I've got all these houses. You, you, you're, you're having three, similar to Amanda and Trina.
*  And, and what ends up happening is we ended up going on, you know, and listen, Amanda and I,
*  we've gone on, we've gone to Greece, Italy, um, Croatia, uh, we're, we're, we've gone,
*  we're going on multiple, just multiple trips. And when we had just gotten back from like a 10 day
*  cruise of the Greek Isles and there's, we get home and Amanda goes online and there's a blog
*  about Dateline, about their, one of their new specials called the thief of hearts.
*  And that's me. Apparently I'm the thief of hearts and I'm apparently going around and I'm,
*  and it's based on, you know, Rebecca's, you know, Becky's story that I'm wooing women to commit
*  fraud, stealing all the money and then leaving them to hold the bag. Well, they interviewed her,
*  they're interviewing multiple people, multiple in my, uh, in my case, they put together this,
*  they're putting together an episode, it's going to be released in a few, in a month or so.
*  So I'm terrified. I have, at this point, I've been on the run three years and I'm like,
*  I mean, there's lots of things I could care less about. Fortune, I don't know anybody that reads
*  Fortune. Bloomberg, come on, I hang out with, I'm hanging out with contractors and laborers and,
*  you know, I'm not hanging out with these guys. So, you know, local news, who cares, you know,
*  even, even local news channels, you know, I don't care, but Dateline, there weren't 400 channels
*  back then, you know, so Dateline comes out, even if you don't see it the first time, they're going
*  to rerun it in three months or six months or five years, 10 years from now, they might rerun it
*  again. My face is going to be on it. So I could be perfectly fine five years from now. And one day,
*  the barista that I go to every other day, looks at Dateline and goes, oh my God, that's Mr. Johnson
*  or that's Mr. Thomas or whatever. So the point is, is that I was like, I gotta go, I can't stay here,
*  I gotta get out of the country. So I was going to go to, well, we really started doing research and
*  Amanda ended up saying Australia. Australia at the time, I don't know how it is now, but at the time,
*  if you went to Australia with like, it's like a hundred thousand dollars and a business plan,
*  you could become a permanent resident alien. You, you, you can't vote, but you can buy property,
*  you can open a business, but you can't get a job. And they didn't require a fingerprints. So there's
*  no criminal background check. Now, if you wanted to be a citizen, you have to get an FBI criminal
*  background check. Like I got, no, I'm good. So I was like, wow, I can go there and start a business
*  and I'm going to start show up with a couple million. So what we do is we start refinancing
*  houses. We'll start pulling out money as quick as we can. I'm asking guys, laborers, guys that I
*  work with, my general contractor, my real estate agent, hey man, can you cash this check for six
*  grand? Can you cash, nobody says no, everybody, yeah, no problem, no problem. A few guys like,
*  yeah, man, if you could be 10%, yeah, I'll give you 10%. So that's happening. We're pulling out cash.
*  One day, Amanda gives Trina a bunch of checks and asks her to cash them.
*  That sparks a conversation that like what it was happening. She confides in, by this point, by the
*  way, Amanda knows who I am. So by this point, she's actually came across the letter that I wrote to
*  my parents when I left Tampa. So she's figured out who I am. She tells Trina his name's Matt Cox,
*  dateline's coming out. We're going to, we're leaving. We got to get a bunch of cash.
*  And Trina goes, okay, I'll cash the checks. What she does instead is she calls the secret service.
*  They watch my house for three days. I come home one day. They pull the cars up
*  and they arrest me. So, you know, it's a little bit longer than that, but that's shorter. That's
*  a short version of me getting arrested. And, you know, it probably skipped over a whole bunch of-
*  So simple because you've gotten away with much more complex situations.
*  It's women, man. It's women.
*  They also are the thing that make life worthwhile.
*  Listen, God bless Trina. She did the right thing. Honestly, based on-
*  There you go. Back to the right thing.
*  But I mean, based on what she saw, based on what the secret service told her
*  and what the articles that she's reading, I'm a bad guy. I mean, I'm a bad guy in general,
*  right? So I don't deserve loyalty. I don't think so. I'm ripping people off and she's thinking
*  that her friend is in danger. You know, the FBI is saying, I have a weapon. He's dangerous.
*  He's got a weapon. You know, we believe he's armed and dangerous. When I was in Florida,
*  I had a concealed weapons permit, but I had gotten rid of both my guns when I was placed on probation.
*  I've never had one since. I've never touched a gun since. But they use that to say, you know,
*  they said, oh, he had a concealed weapon permit. Okay. Well, then he's armed and dangerous.
*  Like there's these little things and think they're telling her, read this article. Look,
*  he forces girls to fall in love with them. That's what he's going to do your friend.
*  So she negotiated. Also, I think she got 10,000, which is embarrassing. I'm ashamed that she got
*  $10,000 and said everything. Yeah. And told them this is where he is. His name is Joseph Carter.
*  You know, he's, uh, you know, this is where he is. They watch it. They grab me. They rest me.
*  They bring me downtown. You know, what did you feel like when you got, it didn't feel good,
*  bro. It was bad. It was a bad day. It was a bad day. First of all, Casino Royale was coming out
*  on Friday. It was the first Daniel Craig as James Bond. Yeah. And the whole week I'd been telling
*  Amanda, I'm going to go see Casino Royale. She'd go, okay, well on Saturday we're going to go to
*  the festival. I go, that's fine. But on Friday, Christina, and she's like, right, because in a
*  way, and then she's like, okay, by the way, on Thursday, I thought we could go to dinner. That's
*  fine. But on Friday, Casino Royale. And when they put the handcuffs on you, when the first thing I
*  thought of, I'm not going to fucking sit to see, cause I'm not going to get to see it. Not going
*  to say, and I saw it about about five, six years later. And when on the institutions, a movie
*  channel, you know, it's nice. It's not the same, but yeah. So I, they, they bring me to Nashville.
*  Then they transport me to all over the place. I go on, you know, Con Air, they fly me to Oklahoma.
*  They fly me to Atlanta. Then I go to Atlanta. I'm placed in the U S Marshall's holdover.
*  I get assigned an attorney, go in front of the judge,
*  plead not guilty, meet with my attorney. You always plead not guilty, you know, whenever you
*  face people say, can you believe that he pled not guilty? This is the first thing you, nobody walks
*  in and pleads guilty. You plead not guilty while you kind of figure out what you're going to do.
*  So I plead not guilty. There's no bond. Obviously I've got, they caught me when they caught me. I
*  had four or five passports. So that's no good. They, they charged me with, you know, bank fraud,
*  conspiracy, commit bank fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, passport fraud, conspiracy, or what was
*  the aggravated identity theft, money laundering, use of a fraudulent passport, you know, and there's
*  like, you know, 30 counts of this, 20 counts of this, 20, but none of that matters. Like even
*  if you just took the, dropped all the counts, the one count and stacked them, it's like 150 something
*  years. So everything, everything they could. And that's how they always say, you're looking at
*  150,000, you know, and your lawyers, they're like, this, you're not looking at that. You're looking at
*  54 years. That's no better. That's no better. So, yeah, so my lawyer comes in and sees me one day,
*  you know, like our first meeting and I, she says, you know, I'm Millie, Millie Dunn. And
*  she says, listen, I've looked at everything. For first, they say, you're responsible for,
*  it's like 25 or 20 or 30, 25 or $26 million in loss. And I'm like, that's, I've never,
*  that's not true. That's not true. And I was like, you know, not even, I said, not even potential
*  law. There's just no way. I mean, it's not a way. And then they come back. She comes back and she
*  says, well, they're saying 19 million. Now it's not possible. I didn't know. So when the FBI is
*  saying like 40 million, they're saying 11.5 in, in Tampa plus 40 million for the mortgage company.
*  So that it ends up being like, plus what I stole on the run, it ends up being like 55 million,
*  but she gets them to drop like the 40. Like that's, that's, that's his brokers. That's this,
*  that's that drop it. And they're like, he's so done. It doesn't matter. They dropped that. So it
*  ends up, it ends up being like 15 million. And then it's down to what is he? Oh, they said 9.5.
*  And I got it down to like 6 million. So, you know, which, you know, I'm good for. So, what ends up
*  happening is they've charged me with all these things. And, and she's like, okay, you know,
*  you're like, you can, you can plead guilty and you can go with the sentencing guidelines,
*  which is going to be like, she's like, I mean, it depends. She said it might be whatever, 54 years.
*  She's, but if they run them, you know, concurrent or consecutive, depending on which one they do,
*  she said it most likely it ends up being like 30 years, you know, it's like, that's not good.
*  That's not good. So we kind of go back and forth, back and forth and figure out, try and figure out
*  where I'm, what I'm looking at. Now, as we go through the whole thing, we end up, she ends up
*  with, she ends up saying, you know, she knocks off a bunch of stuff that they're saying I did,
*  you know, enhancements. Cause you'll have a base level of, let's say, level eight, you know,
*  that should be, that should be maybe a few years, but then they start adding on enhancements, you
*  know. Did he, what did, what he do was sophisticated? Yes. Okay. Three levels for sophisticated means.
*  Were there more than how many victims? Were there more than 50 victims? Yes. Okay. That's
*  six more levels. Okay. Did he change the jurisdiction to evade detection? Yes. That's
*  four more levels. Okay. Did he, they start adding, boom, boom. And when you start adding up all those
*  levels, plus your criminal history, and I have a big criminal history because I was already on
*  federal probation and I committed a new crime on federal probation. So that was another enhancement.
*  And this, you know, this case, so I'm in like a category, like category two or three. So they
*  come back and they're saying, I forget, it's like 20, well, they don't come back right away, but
*  she ends up saying, you're probably looking at 14 years. Okay. That's reasonable. That's reasonable.
*  And so she's saying, so we get the, when we get the PSI back, we eventually get what's called a
*  pre-sentence report. They're saying 26 years, but they really said 32 years. And I argued,
*  and we got it down to 26 years and four months. That's what it is. It's 316 months. That's how
*  they do it in months. It doesn't sting that much. I guess she's saying months. Yeah. So she says to
*  me, Millie sits down with me and she says, listen, you got to cooperate. And I was like, okay. And
*  she said, because you're, you're, you're guilty, you're extremely guilty. She's like, you can't go
*  to trial. And she said, so you need to cooperate. I was like, well, what do I get if a cooperate?
*  She's the way it works is you cooperate and you hope for the best. And I was like, are you serious?
*  You tell them everything, you know, and you hope for the best. And she's like, the part of the
*  problem is she said, everybody in Tampa's cooperated. Rebecca has cooperated. Everyone across the board
*  is cooperating. There's nobody that hasn't cooperated. By the way, when you say cooperating,
*  you mean they're an informant they told, they said, AKA snitch. Right. They came in, they sat
*  down with their lawyer and they said, this is what he did. He did this. He did that. They showed them
*  documents. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's my signature. I didn't know what that was. You know, they,
*  everything was my fault. They didn't do anything. It was all me. So they've all cooperated and they
*  haven't been charged. They've been indicted. They're all named as unnamed co-conspirators on
*  my indictment. So I've got like 12 people, even there's like probably 20 people that are involved,
*  but there's like 12 of them that are, so I've got all these names, you know, uh, KBDLCY,
*  you know, it's like, I know who that is. Like I know who DW that's Dave Walker. I know who,
*  you know, I know who these people are. And so there's just a list of, there's like 12 of them,
*  you know, plus me. Uh, so. And some of, some of them walked in and said, I'm guilty. I just
*  want to be plead guilty. Uh, the, the, the girl, uh, Allison, she walked in, said, I, I'm, I'm too,
*  I'm tired of waiting for you to come get me. Walked in with her lawyer and said, I just want
*  to plead guilty. And, and they sentenced her and she went to jail. She got like 36 months or 30 months.
*  She called the prison that she went to the low security. It was a female prison at the
*  time, female camp called the camp and asked her if she could come by for a tour before she went.
*  And they went, excuse me. She said, well, I'm going to be there for about two years.
*  So I'd like to come in as like a tour I can take. Cause I like to know where I'm going
*  and what it's going to be like, how I should prepare. And they just started laughing. They
*  said, there's no tour, sweetie. We'll give you the tour when you get here.
*  You gotta love that. Like, yeah, I mean, I thought I was, I didn't think, I thought I wasn't
*  prepared. So, uh, Becky, Becky got 70 months, but when I got caught and when I was sentenced,
*  they reduced it to like 30 or no 40 to 40 months. They reduced because she co-cooperated that term.
*  Right. Do you want to say snitch or well, there must be, I mean, snitch is too harsh of a word,
*  but yeah, the ratted, I mean, you're saying, I don't know. We can get there. We'll get there.
*  All right. All right. So where did the sentencing end up?
*  So I should say first on the cooperation subject, my lawyer wanted me to cooperate.
*  And by this point I realized like, you don't have a choice, you know, no, that's, that's not true.
*  I could have been a gangster. Yeah. I don't need to be an expert in this case. Like a standup guy.
*  I could have said, I'll just take it. Give me 54 years, go fuck yourself. I'm not going to snitch
*  on nobody. And I know you look at me and you think tough guy. I'm not a tough guy at all.
*  I'm not doing 50 some odd years. Like I'm not doing it. I don't want to do 30 years.
*  Uh, you know, I was hoping for, you know, I knew it wasn't possible, but I would have
*  satisfied for another slap on the hand. Like I got the first time it really thought I deserved,
*  honestly, when you, if someone, my lawyer asked me, what do you really think you deserve? And I
*  thought I deserve 10 years, you know, I deserve 10 years, but so she said, look, they want to talk
*  to you. So the FBI, well, first of the secret service flies in, they come in and they interview
*  me. Who's more terrifying FBI secret service? You know, the secret service was so overwhelmingly
*  professional. The FBI and really only the one of the FBI agents that interviewed me,
*  I don't know how he's an agent. I don't know. He was just ineffective, incompetent.
*  Oh, so it's a competence issue. The other one was Candice. Oh, you met her. Of course I did.
*  Of course. She's 5'11", wearing three inch heels. She's a giant and in impeccable shape,
*  attractive, one of the angriest human beings I've ever met. And every FBI agent that I've met since
*  then that knows her and I mentioned, they all say, oh, what did you think of her? And I'm like,
*  what, why? And I was like, kind of aggressively, yeah, yeah, yeah, she's a bulldog. She's, I mean,
*  all of them are like, yeah, yeah, she's, she's something else. Like secret service is a little
*  bit more like very personal, very, you know, it's their job. It's like, hey, this is just my job.
*  They're polite, professional, you know, that's it. So it's just, this is just, this is my nine to five.
*  So, but they, they, they come and they fly in and they meet with me for three, four days.
*  One of the, one of the funny things is that when I first, first sat down with them,
*  the one guy's name was Dan, like Braz, Brazanskowski or something. So he, he sits down,
*  he says, look, before we get started, we need to talk about something. And I said, well, he said,
*  we know you've hidden money. And we, you know, I was like, what? And he goes, you know, we,
*  we know you've got money hidden. I said, I don't have any money hidden. What are you talking about?
*  My lawyer is like, do we need to talk? I'm like, no, no, no, no, I don't have nothing. I gave you
*  everything. All the accounts, you got everything. And he's like, you're looking at an obstruction
*  charge at this point. I was like, I don't have anything. And he says, we know you have money.
*  We know you have money in different IDs, different identities, names. And I go,
*  what are you talking about? And he pulls out a bank statement and he slaps it on the counter.
*  And he goes, you've got money in Southern Exchange Bank. You've got $190,000 in Southern Exchange
*  Bank. And I look at it and I went, it was in the name Walter Holcomb. And I went, did you call the
*  bank? He says, yeah, we called the bank. I went, okay. Did anybody call you back? And they go,
*  we've left several messages. I said, did you go to the bank website? He goes, yeah, I went to the
*  website. I said, what'd you think? And he went, what do you mean? All right, it was a bank website.
*  I said, yeah, but it was professional, right? It was like a professional website. And he goes,
*  it's a bank website. And I go, yeah, but it was well done. And he goes, oh God. And I go, yeah,
*  convincing. And I went, I go, it's all an illusion. And I said, the bank doesn't exist. It's a fake
*  bank. I made the bank, made it when I was in, not even in Tampa. I think I'd gotten to Nashville
*  when I made it. And I was like, yeah, it's an illusion. The bank statements, he's like,
*  they're color bank statements. I'm like, yeah, well, no shit. So, you know, there's no, I said,
*  a matter of fact, I said, who did you leave? I haven't paid for the service in months. And
*  he turned around and he called it and it went, you know, it was disconnected. And I was like,
*  how do you not know that's a bank? Well, it turns out there was a Southern Exchange Bank
*  and I'd use their bank routing number. And so, I mean, I always thought that was funny that they
*  it's like, well, I remember it really for a split second there, I was kind of like really embarrassed
*  that they caught me. I was like, I can't believe this. You're the Secret Service. Anyway, I talked
*  to them. I, you know, there's, there's really, as far as the Secret Service is concerned, there's
*  just not much I can tell them. Just, you know, like it was me, Becky's already told them
*  everything. Amanda's already told them everything. It's not hard to track. And when they raided my
*  house, they've got boxes and boxes. So, it's laid out. We still, it took forever. Like, I still went
*  through everything. I explained how I got the driver's licenses, how I made the bank statements,
*  how I made the birth certificates, how I, the whole social engineering of figuring out how to,
*  what these little loopholes are. It's like seven days total with these guys. So,
*  You mean like, like questions? Yeah, it was like they questioned me for all day and then they take
*  me back to the Marshall's Holdover. And then the next morning I wake up and they chain me up again
*  and bring me back. What's that like? What's that process of questioning like? Are they, I mean,
*  you're somebody who is exceptionally good at conversation. You're charismatic as part of the
*  games you played. Are they good at conversation? I mean, they're, you know, the problem is they're
*  not there to shoot the shit. You see what I'm saying? Like they have an agenda. But they have
*  to use their words to get information out of you. Aren't they trying to manipulate you? I'm not,
*  I'm not holding anything back. Okay. It's not like I'm sparing Jim. You know, trust me,
*  Jim's got to go. I mean, you're looking at, you're there 20 some odd years, but Jim can do five,
*  Bill can do some, Tom can do six. I don't even like, I don't even like Jerry. Jerry can do 20,
*  you know, so I'm, I'm, I'm ready, I'm ready to cut everybody's throat.
*  But you're not guaranteed that you're not, you're getting anything for that.
*  Right. And all my time I've seen one, one time where an inmate got a guarantee to have his
*  sentence reduced and it was signed by the head of the FBI was Robert Mueller gave it to him to have
*  a conversation with him. That's the only time I've ever seen that document. Okay. So a lot of days
*  with both the secret service and the FBI. So FBI was a Candice was irritated, didn't like me.
*  And I remember when I, she took the cuffs off, I was like rubbing my wrist. She goes, your wrist
*  hurt. And I go, yeah. And she goes, get used to it. And she was just an asshole. Yeah. Just all
*  around. Not that she didn't have a right to be, but everybody else was professional, you know? So
*  okay. So we, we, you know, we, we, we talked for three or four days with the FBI and,
*  you know, they asked a ton of questions. They brought a ton of, they brought documents
*  so it's like, Hey, who signed this? You know, it's like, Oh, that's not, that's not my signature.
*  That's so-and-so signature or I signed that I signed that I signed that that's so-and-so
*  where'd this check go? Who is this? Oh, that's so-and-so, you know, you're looking over everything.
*  One of the things they wanted to know about was, which I never talked about it because it seems
*  so minor is I bribed the politician. I got him elected because we got him elected to the
*  city council so he could vote to get our, our, the lots. We bought like a hundred vacant lots
*  in Ybor city and I wanted them all, they were all single family. We wanted them zone multifamily.
*  And so we bribed him and got him elected. That doesn't seem minor. It's not as sexy as the rest
*  of the stuff. That's pretty, I mean, so that's a whole nother thing. Like, I mean, you know,
*  so what happened is when they got all of the bank accounts, they see all these checks going to
*  Kevin White. And so they're like, why did James Red donate $500 to Kevin White? Why did Brandon
*  Green donate? Why did Alan Duncan donate? Why did, and you know, so I had explained to him,
*  oh yeah, well he was, we wanted him to be city councilman. So we paid, you know, gave him a bunch
*  of money so he could run the ads, so he could get elected. So he could then get all of our stuff.
*  But because he never did, you know, I took off on the run before he was able to do that.
*  And then he ended up getting not long, too, too long after that. He ended up about five,
*  six years later, he ended up getting indicted for bribery, but not mine on somebody else's case.
*  Can I take a small tangent here and ask how many politicians do you think
*  commit crimes or a little bit or a lot criminals?
*  I mean, I think there's some ways that are, you know, they're seemingly legal.
*  The aforementioned gray area.
*  Well, that's not gray. Like this guy was, like at one point I couldn't find anybody to write
*  $500 checks anymore. So I just gave him cash. Like I'm just handing him $7,000, $8,000,
*  and cash. So, but, you know, I think most of them have legal ways to make ungodly amounts of money
*  for, you know, influence. You know, but is it legal? No, it's their politicians,
*  they've made it so that it's not illegal. If you really sat down and explained it to someone,
*  you know, the average person would say that that's not right. That's, oh, no, no, that's legal.
*  So, okay. So at the end of these few days, what was the sentencing like?
*  Yeah, I end up, I go to sentencing, I get my PSI back and it's 32 years to life. And,
*  and so we argue about it with the prosecutor just before sentencing and they get it down to
*  26 years, four months. And then Millie says, listen, don't worry. Because I'm trying to backpedal
*  at this point. I'm like, I might as well go to trial. If I lost at trial, I couldn't get more
*  than 30. You can't, well, more than 32 years. Because you can't get life. 32 was the max. It's
*  just a mistake. He said 32 years to life. You can't get life. So it was like, the most I can get is
*  32 years. So I was like, I'll go to trial. Might as well go to trial and see if I can get them to
*  reduce some of these enhancements. She insists that she can get the enhancements knocked down.
*  And if you read, they actually read the enhancements, some of the enhancements,
*  they didn't apply to me. So she goes and, and you know, I believed her and I think she, she made a
*  valid argument. We get to, we go to sentencing, my mom's there, she's crying. My dad's there.
*  He's looks at, he's looking at me like he's disgusted. And crowd, there's a whole bunch of
*  reporters, like the whole place is packed. And I plead guilty. Millie gets up, my lawyer gets up
*  and she argues these enhancements. And every single time, you know, the judge is like,
*  I disagree. You know, overruled. And it's like, boom, five more years. You know, bam,
*  six more years. Bam. Because if she had won the enhancement, she argued I would have got 14 years.
*  Now, keep in mind too, prior to this, a month or two prior to this, the U.S. attorney had called
*  Millie and said, look, Dateline, Dateline had already come out, by the way. Remember,
*  I was worried about Dateline coming out. Well, it had come out, but they wanted to do a followup
*  because it came out like a month or two after I got arrested. And they were saying, hey,
*  we want to recut it with interviews with him. Well, Gail McKenzie wants, that's the U.S. attorney,
*  she wants me to do that. And she says, I'll consider that substantial assistance. Now,
*  when you cooperate with the government, they consider it substantial assistance. That's what
*  they call it. So I cooperate with you, it's substantial assistance. She says, if he's
*  interviewed by Dateline, we'll consider it substantial assistance. And Millie says,
*  you have to do it. By the way, what's the idea behind that, that they like, you serve as a warning
*  for others or something like that? Yeah, exactly. It's a, he, you know, you become a cautionary tale,
*  like don't let this happen to you. So I go and I'm interviewed by Dateline. Keith Morris or
*  whatever his name is, you know, that guy, Mr. Cox, you know, that guy. So he comes and he,
*  he interviews me. Becky's interviewed. I'm interviewed. Amanda's interviewed. Like
*  Allison is interviewed. Like everybody, the secret service agent, I think is interviewed,
*  like everybody, prosecutors interviewed. You know, it's funny at the time I would have, I was,
*  when I watched it, I was like, that's not true. That's not true. And that, and it honestly,
*  it's like 99% true. It's like looking back on it, you know, I'm, I'm like, you know, like my Audi
*  TT wasn't blue. It was silver. You know, it's just stupid, but anyway, so I'm interviewed by them and
*  they recut it and they air the video. So I, you said this was substantial assistance. And then the
*  other thing is I was interviewed by the FBI and the secret service. Now my, my lawyer calls the
*  prosecutor the night before sentencing and says, look, he was interviewed by Dateline and he was
*  interviewed by the secret service and the FBI. And if you do that, you said you'd reduce his sentence.
*  You'd consider it substantial assistance and you would reduce his sentence. What are you going to
*  ask for his sentence to be tomorrow at sentencing? And she said, we did consider it substantial
*  assistance and it's just not enough. What do you mean? Nobody was arrested. Yes. But what about
*  Dateline Millie? I don't know what to tell you. It just wasn't enough. We considered it. We,
*  we considered it. We will consider it. And they did consider it. So, yeah, that's like the best.
*  You have to really, you know, the meaning of words is so important. I'm going to use that at some
*  point. I'll consider it. I'll consider it. I considered it. And still feel the same. She's,
*  so she calls me, I'm, I'm crushed. And she's like, but look, you know, they're still investigating.
*  They're going to make these arrests. And so when you get a sentence reduction at sentencing,
*  it's called a 5k one. When you get a sentence reduction after sentencing, it's called a rule
*  35. So she said, we'll file a rule 35 as soon as the arrests are made. Okay. So I go to sentencing
*  and Millie says, you're going to get 14 years. I'm going to argue these enhancements. She argues
*  in the enhancements. She loses the enhancements. Not that she's not an amazing attorney. She's an
*  amazing attorney. The judge wanted to hammer me. He hammered me. You know, Millie was a great
*  attorney. She was always polite to me. And by the way, to this day, we'll answer my phone call. Like
*  most, most public defenders, you call them now, you call them after your sentence. They don't
*  answer your call. Great person. Thank you Millie. I didn't give her anything to work with. You know,
*  it's like, I'm overwhelmingly guilty. It's like, there's no defense. So I ended up getting sentenced
*  26 years. Um, it's a lot of years. I would like to tell you that they, they, when they gave me
*  the time, you know, that I was stoic and I stood there and I, I took it in, you know, but the truth
*  is I cried like a baby, like a small child. Like you've never seen anyone cry like this in your life.
*  I was just, how did I get 26? How, what did I do to get 26 years? Like murderers, rapists.
*  I've met guys that kidnapped guys that got 15.
*  26. So yeah, I, I, were you scared? I mean, you know, does a pope wear a funny hat? Like,
*  of course I was scared, terrified. Yeah. I mean, you know, but I kept telling myself,
*  ah, they're going to reduce the sentence. They'll reduce it. They'll reduce it. They'll reduce it.
*  Like, okay, okay, okay. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Um, you know, but it wasn't
*  okay. I, I got, I got moved to Coleman, the Coleman complex in Coleman, Florida, the federal
*  correctional Coleman complex in Coleman, Florida, which is the largest complex in the nation,
*  a federal complex in the nation. There's a, there's a, at that time there was a,
*  a camp, which was a female camp. There was a medium security, a low security prison
*  for men, a medium security prison and two penitentiaries. And so I get moved to the
*  medium. Now I'm moved to the medium, not because like that's where like real criminals go, right?
*  Like I'm, I'm a soft white boy. Like I'm no danger to anybody. Like I, I, I hurt,
*  I hurt someone's feelings once, but other than that, I'm, I'm, I'm not a pro. I'm not going to
*  be a problem, but if you have more than 20 years to serve, you have to go to a medium. So even
*  though my security level said this guy should be in a camp, I had 20 years. So if you have,
*  you can't go to a camp till you have less than 10. So as soon as I am given 26 years and, and
*  26 years, they, they knock off three, but you still have three years to get below 20. So they
*  go to the medium. So I go to the medium and their guys getting stabbed the very first day people
*  are being stabbed. I get locked into, you go to my cell, meet my celly, they scream lockdown,
*  somebody got stabbed in the rec yard. I remember I asked that my celly, which I met 20 minutes
*  earlier, I was like, what's, you know, he's like, Hey, we've got to get in the cell. I was like,
*  what's going on? He, somebody got stabbed in the yard. I go, somebody just got killed.
*  And he goes, nah, they just stabbed him up a little bit. And I thought you're in a place where they
*  say stabbed him up a little bit. Like you're not prepared for this, bro. You got to get out of
*  here. So anyway, I go to the medium. I'm there. Like, what was the first day and night? I already
*  had been locked up in the county and their county jails where they call them US, their US marshal,
*  their holdovers, but they're really county jails. They just keep you with the, with the federal guys.
*  So I'm not mixed in with like hobos and you know, people like that. Like I'm mixed in with the
*  federal people. It's already felt like a, like a prison. Yeah. It's, it's a prison. I mean, it's,
*  it's jail, but it's a prison and unless you've been locked up, you don't really know the difference.
*  So it's, it's a jail, a jail suck. Jails are much worse. The whole time I was locked up in these,
*  in the jails waiting to be sentenced, guys were like, I just want to get sentenced to go,
*  go to prison, bro. And I was like, why does everybody keep saying that?
*  Like prisons worse than this, right? I saw Shaul Shaul shank. It's horrible. And they're like,
*  bro, prison, listen, prison, I can walk the rec yard. I could go to the movie room, watch movies.
*  I'll listen within right after count for this four o'clock count. They count everybody at four.
*  So they are like, right after count, I'm going to go to commissary. Somebody's going to buy me an
*  ice cream. I'm going to be eating an ice cream, walking on the rec yard the first day. Like,
*  and I'm, you know, it's been months and months and months that I've been locked up in this
*  County jail. And I'm thinking, I want to go to prison. Like, that sounds nice. I'd love,
*  I'd like an ice cream. Yeah. But there was a stabbing in the first day.
*  Everybody kept telling me I was going to go to a camp. You're going to go to a camp. You're
*  going to go to a low, you know, and honestly, I was very quickly. I was walking on the rec yard.
*  I was, you know, so I was at the medium. I got there, you know, it's, it's a real prison with
*  the doors, bam. And they can open the little tray thing and feed you out of the tray. And there's a
*  stainless steel toilet and sink. And, you know, they have that in the County too, but, you know,
*  it's exactly what you think of prison as being, but it feels like a fundamentally different
*  experience. It's 26 years and the door locks and yeah. So yeah, I have a celly.
*  And, but I'm also, they sent me to a prison where guys have tons of guys have 30, 40, 50 years,
*  you know, life sentences. There's, there's gangsters there. There's, there's murderers,
*  there's serial killers, there's, you know, really bad guys. There's, you know, there's guys that are,
*  you know, trying to take advantage of guys. Right. You know, like sexually. Yeah. But by the time I
*  got there, I'd hurl the, you know, how you can get yourself in trouble, you know, how you can like,
*  don't go in somebody else's cell. You don't know the guy. You're not 100% sure. Do not go in his
*  cell. Don't even go near his cell. Don't go into places where people can close a door behind you,
*  or they can trap you in an area. Don't, you know, there's all these things that I've been told
*  not to do again for sexual reasons, right? Because I'm, I'm a small guy in prison. Yeah. You know,
*  yeah, it's a problem. It's a problem. This. Yeah. It's bad. It's all bad. Well, it's good in the
*  outside world, but bad in, you know, yeah. My fear was there to make me shave my head to make sure
*  that the mop wig fits correctly. But there's certain things that I always hate to say this,
*  but I mean, this is the simplest way to say it is that if you get stabbed in prison, you had it
*  coming. You did something. They're not running around just stabbing people. You did something.
*  You, and the things that get you hurt is you argue over the TV. What channel you want to watch. You
*  got 50, 80 guys watching one TV. Don't argue about it. Like it's not, it's not worth it.
*  Borrowing things that and not returning them. That's a problem. Running up debts. That's a
*  big problem. You know, gambling, gossiping, you know, those are the problems. Those things get
*  you hurt. Not being polite, be respectful. I'm super respectful. So I was respectful
*  very quickly when I got to Coleman, there are continuing education courses. One of the courses
*  is residential real estate. The guy that was running the residential real estate didn't want
*  to do it anymore because he was doing legal work and it just was taking too much time.
*  So he came to me and said, listen, you just got here. You got a real estate background.
*  Like nobody else does. Can you take over this class? And I was like, I'm sure. So I looked at
*  his curriculum. I kind of rewrote it a little bit and I started teaching the residential real estate
*  class. And at one point I was teaching two classes like a semester or a quarter.
*  And these guys loved it. Like everybody, they all think they're going to get out and flip houses.
*  So I started, you know, from the fundamentals, I talked about credit, how to borrow, how hard
*  money lenders, different types of bar, like everything. And you know, guys are walking.
*  It's the first time in my life. This was funny. Not that I think I was really ever in a position
*  for this to happen. This was really odd though. Probably the second or third class when guys are
*  leaving and I'm having to check them off the roll. Multiple guys are stopping and saying, yo bro,
*  putting their hand out and shaking my hand and going good class was a good class, bro.
*  Then I have guys coming to me telling me, Hey, what are you teaching these guys? What do you mean?
*  They go, he goes, my cell is telling me he's going to get out and make millions. I'm taking
*  Cox's real estate class. I'm telling you, I can do this. I'm going to be a millionaire.
*  And it's like this flipping houses. Like this is not, but the truth is if you know, it is the
*  flipping houses was what I basically told these guys, especially the drug dealers, right?
*  So you're a drug dealer and you were raised in the projects and you're going back to the projects.
*  Like this is, this is the one industry or, you know, that you will thrive at because you're a
*  hustler. You're not afraid. A 45 year old divorced white woman is not going into the hood knocking on
*  doors to try and flip houses, but you will. And you know, everybody in the neighborhood and you'll
*  knock on those doors and you'll hustle and you'll, you've been told no before and you don't care.
*  You're not scared. You're not this. And there's tons of money to be made in lower income areas.
*  And so I, and then when I go through the whole thing and how you can leverage,
*  you know, leverage your credit to borrow money, to get into the property and rent,
*  do the renovations with very little money down. And I do the whole thing.
*  These guys, like they loved it. So I was, and what that did for me was two things. One, if you got to
*  the class, 40 guys show up for the class and I say, look, if you don't want to go, you don't
*  want to be here. You just want it. Cause you're, your counselor's making you get a certificate.
*  You don't want to be here. That's fine. Bring me two coffees and like two creamers from commissary
*  and I'll fill out all your paperwork and you'll pass. You'll get a certificate. I don't have to
*  see you again. I have full of coffee and creamer because at least 10 or 10 or 15 didn't want to be
*  there. The other guys seriously wanted to be there and I don't want those guys to be there
*  anyway. They're going to be a problem. So the other guys are serious about it. And some of these guys
*  sat through the class two, three, four times. Some of these guys got out and sent me money.
*  So, uh, you know, which is like a huge sign of respect, you know, by the way, uh,
*  cause they don't owe me anything, but I did that and I taught GED, uh, because, you know,
*  you have to do something for, for money. And, you know, I met some, some, I met a bunch of cool guys
*  and I was hanging out and I was doing well. And after about three years, they, they transferred me
*  to the low security prison. At this point, like the, the FBI starts showing up,
*  asking me questions. They asked me questions about the politician I bribed, you know,
*  asked me questions about him. Statute of limitations was up and they were trying to tie him into,
*  uh, the bank fraud because his name was Kevin White. And one of my guys name was Michael Kevin
*  White. And so they were trying to tie him in, you know, did you, did he know about it? Cause if he
*  knew about it, statute of limitations is 10 years. We could, no, he didn't know. Um,
*  should have thrown him in there. But anyway, cause like a couple of years later, he gets
*  indicted. He ends up going to jail anyway. And it could have decreased your sentence.
*  Yeah. Listen, listen, stop, stop. Um, listen. Oh my God. I got all my judgment out after the,
*  the homeless conversation. Listen, it's only going to get worse. I mean, I, I really appreciate your
*  honesty and your insight about like, about snitching, honestly, that I have a sense that,
*  that there's a, um, at least a desire for loyalty in the world. I wouldn't that be nice. Did you
*  ever feel in danger and, and medium or low? It's funny. I had more problems at the, probably at
*  the low than I did the medium, but at the medium, the only thing that happened was
*  an article came out in the newspaper when I was at the medium, it came out and said,
*  cause they're, you know, they're still investigating things.
*  So this article comes out and I'm on the front page of the St. Petersburg times. It was about
*  the politician, big article. And in the article, it says they interviewed Milley, my lawyer. And
*  she says, well, when Mr. Cox was being interviewed by the FBI, one of the first things they wanted to
*  know about was this politician. So she just said, Mr. Cox was being interviewed by the FBI.
*  So I immediately get taken into custody and they put me in the, in the shoe, the hole, right? For
*  my own protection. And I'm there for like 45 days. And then after 45 days, they're like, Cox, what do
*  you want us to do? You want us to ship you? I was like, no, put me back on the compound.
*  I'm like, half the guys here cooperated. And he goes, yeah, it's more than half. He said, but
*  this is, this is the guy from SIS, which is like their internal security. So that's when he told
*  you that it's actually much higher percentage. Right. But he goes, but 90%, he said, but a
*  hundred percent of them are lying about it. He said, you just came out in the newspaper. I go,
*  man, I'm not concerned. If he's, you are concerned, you got to come immediately to the lieutenant's
*  office and tell us we'll ship you. I said, okay. I get out there. People are giving me like the
*  looking at me and what's up, you know, but I don't have a lot of friends anyway.
*  And I come there to make friends. And so at one point, this one guy comes to me, I'm walking the
*  yard, probably two days later, after I get on back on the compound, I'm walking guy comes to me. He
*  has a goatee and he's got a, it comes down here and he's got a skull, like a little skull thing he
*  had made whittled out of wood or something. And, you know, definitely looks scary. But so I'm
*  walking and he stopped and he goes, Hey Cox, I've never talked to these guys. I'd been there for a
*  year or so and never talked to any of these guys. They're all like bikers and you know,
*  Aryan brotherhood. And so, you know, I'm like, yeah, what's up? He said, Bubba, Bubba is their
*  leader. He goes, Bubba told me to tell you not to walk the yard. He don't want to see you out in the
*  yard. And I went, okay. I said, well, I'm going to walk the yard tonight. I said, and if I get the
*  shit kicked out of me, then I get the shit kicked out of me. Did you talk back to a guy with a,
*  with a wooden skull hanging off his beard? I did, but you know what? It was right in front of the
*  guard shack. And so there was guards in the guard shack, you know, they're 20 feet away. Really?
*  You weren't scared? I mean, I think I just got numb. Like I'm not stupid, but I'm all, I'm walking
*  around. I'm, you know, I was scared from the moment I got there on, if that makes sense. So
*  you get to a point where you're just numb and you're waiting for it, especially when I got out of
*  the shoe, got out of the shoe. I went straight to my cell, laid down a couple of minutes later,
*  it was locked down. They closed the doors. I wake up the next morning. I go to chow.
*  I go to my job. Like it starts all over again. So I was, I had a very packed routine. So I didn't
*  spend there, although there's guys everywhere and I'm, I'm thinking at some point I might just be
*  walking around. A guy might walk up and just smash me in the head, but it didn't happen.
*  And it's not the guys aren't getting stabbed, but they've got it coming. I didn't tell on anybody
*  here. I didn't do anything. It's not that on other yards I might not have gotten smashed,
*  but I didn't get smashed. And I'd been there a while and I taught the real estate class and
*  everybody wanted to take real estate. So I think that insulated me to a degree. I also had made a
*  few friends there and I think they were probably also kind of putting out the words like bro, cut
*  this guy a break. So I'm walking across and I tell the guy, I said, look, man, I said, you know,
*  and I wasn't rude to him. He wasn't even rude to me. Really. He said, don't walk the yard anymore,
*  Bubba. I didn't want you to walk in there. I said, well, listen, I'm going to go to chow.
*  And then I'm going to go out there tonight and walk the yard. And if I get smashed, I get smashed.
*  I go because I got 26 years and I cannot walk around for the next 26 years, not going on the
*  yard. I said, so I'm going to be there. And then that happens. And that happens. And he looked at
*  me and he goes, man, I don't give a fuck what you do is that's what Bubba told me to tell you.
*  He said, I told you anyway, because I don't give a shit what you do. And he walked off.
*  I went out there that night with a buddy of mine named Zach, a guy named John Gordon, with my
*  cousin and a couple of his buddies. We walked the track for about an hour. Bubba and a group of his
*  guys stood there and looked at us. And as we walked, probably closest we got to was 30 or 40 feet.
*  That went on for 30 minutes and then they kind of broke up and went their separate ways. And
*  you know, there was a couple of times where I would go to the chow hall
*  and I would go and I'd be sitting at a table and Bubba would walk up and tell the other guys at
*  the table. I want to let you guys know you're he didn't even call me a snitch. He said, you're
*  sitting with a cooperating witness. He said, he said, that's how you want to roll. He said,
*  you ain't going to be rolling with us if there's any trouble. And then they all kind of looked at
*  me and they got, got up, got their plate and they moved off. He didn't tell me to move
*  and he could have walked up and said, this is a snitch motherfucker. He didn't do that.
*  Bubba was very respectful. So as respectful as you can be. Whatever you want to say about Bubba,
*  he was a respectful man. You ever talked to him directly? Never had a conversation with him.
*  So that went on. But I mean, not when I say that one, I mean, literally like that's a couple of
*  times he said the same thing to a guy in line. One time guy came up to me later and said, look,
*  man, I'm sorry, man. He was standing next to me in line. Bubba said something to him. He went
*  like 10 or 15 people back and stood in line. Later on, he came up to me and said, man, I'm sorry,
*  bro. But you know, I said, bro, I said, look, I get it. We're not friends. Don't worry about it.
*  And here's the thing. At some point there, I got, I ended up getting, well, the FBI started showing
*  up there at the, at the prison questioning me about my files in, in Tampa, the room of the 12
*  guys that were indicted. They show up and they start asking me about it. And so they're still
*  kind of working it. Well, at the same time, I ended up getting moved to the low security prison.
*  I get the low security prison. They show up over and over again, but at some point they come to me
*  and they say, look, we went to the U S attorney. We presented everything we have. We have it. We,
*  I have enough for an investor. I have enough for, to indict all of these guys. I think it was
*  whittled down to maybe eight instead of 12. And they said, look, the entire economy is melting down.
*  At this point, these are, some of these are four or five years old.
*  We don't, we, we've got banks that are melting down right now. We got, we got a hundred, 200,
*  300 million, 500, half a billion dollar banks that we're investigating. We don't have time to deal
*  with this. We're not going to, and we're not going to indict those people. So they get away.
*  The agent I was working with her name was Leslie Nelson. Very nice person. She came, actually
*  didn't have to do this, came to the prison to tell me this is what happened. And when she'd first
*  come to see me, I told her, listen, I want to do all this, but no matter what happens, I need you
*  to write me a letter. If they don't, and if they don't indict these people, I need you to write me
*  a letter that I can present to the U S attorney on my behalf that I did everything I could.
*  And she was, I'll do that. It, but that's not going to happen. We're going to get the indictments.
*  Everything. I was okay. So of course a year later, she shows up after nothing happens and they've
*  dropped the case. She shows up and she tells me what happened and he's not going to do it.
*  I was, I go, do you remember that you, she was like, I got the letter right now.
*  Gave me the letter. She was like, that's it. Great letter. You know, it says, you know, Mr. Cox has
*  worked, you know, blah, blah, blah. He's done this. This is great. And even said, you know,
*  he deserves a reduction in my opinion, blah, blah, blah. So, but there's no, there's nobody,
*  nobody was arrested. So I call my public defender. I call Millie. I explain it to her and,
*  you know, she starts, you know, she starts crying and she's sorry. And well, what are we going to
*  do? Well, there's nothing you can do. Your, your time barred, like you have one year to file a 2255,
*  which is to say that you're a lawyer is ineffective or that the court has made a mistake in some way.
*  And it had been over a year. It had been years. It'd been like four years. And she's like, yeah,
*  I mean, you're just, there's nothing you can do. And she's in tears. And I kind of feel like I'm
*  done at that point. I'm done. And what I do is I start writing a book, right? I write a memoir,
*  my memoir, and, and this is not a shameless plug for my memoir, by the way, which is amazing.
*  But, uh, so what happens is I actually, I actually write it, you know, I write it and then I have to
*  rewrite it, right? Cause I don't really know what I'm doing, you know, and I'd been reading
*  true crime and that sort of thing. And I've always liked true crime. I get a literary agent,
*  comes to see me, tells me I have to rewrite some stuff. We rewrite it.
*  As I'm finishing up my memoir, there's a guy that comes on the compound
*  and his name is Ephraim Devereaux. Ephraim Devereaux and his business partner, a guy named
*  David Pacows were selling munitions, AK-47 rounds, really tons of munitions, but they got in trouble
*  with the this and they were selling them to the U S government for the Afghani security forces.
*  And there had been an article in Rolling Stone magazine about him and I'd read it and somebody
*  points them out and says, Hey, that's that guy. And I went up to him and said, Hey bro, you just
*  got here. He's like, yeah. I said, look, if you want to write a memoir or anything, I'm finishing
*  my memoir. I can always help you. I can help you write an outline. You can get a professional
*  writer, whatever is you need help. He's like, yeah, all right. Ephraim Devereaux was played by
*  Jonah Hill in the movie, War Dogs. So a few months later, he comes to me and says, you know,
*  Hey, they sold the movie rights. I was like, Oh, wow, that's great. And I'm like, and you don't
*  want to write a memoir. And he's like, yeah, man, it was sold to the guys from the hangover movie.
*  And I was like, so the guys from the hangover movie are going to make a movie about you.
*  I said, you understand they're going to call it like, dude, where's my hand grenade?
*  And you're going to be Spicoli from Fast Time at Ridgemont High. Like you're going to be a joke
*  all because you don't want to write a memoir and get your version out there. And he was like,
*  Holy shit. So I ended up writing an outline for him. We worked together and then he asked that,
*  can I read your book? I was like, sure. And I give it to him and he reads it and he comes back and
*  he said, bro, this is the best thing I've ever read in my life. And to be honest, I later found
*  out he'd read about three books in his entire life, but still was very, it was very nice.
*  So he asked me if I'll write his book. I write his book. We work out a deal and
*  we do that. And I'm saying all this because I basically settle in. I'm done. I'm going to do
*  26 years. By the way, just in a small tangent, how did you know you'd be good at writing?
*  I'd kind of written a manuscript prior to even taking off on the run. I used to listen to
*  John Grisham books. I'd listen to them in the car. Like I liked John Grisham books and I'd
*  actually written a manuscript about a mortgage broker. He writes about lawyers and it's like,
*  being a lawyer is not exciting. If you can make that sound exciting, I can make being a mortgage
*  broker. And I wrote a book, put it at my desk and the FBI found it and they said,
*  oh, it's a blueprint to the fraud that he's going to commit. It wasn't. Stop. It's as much,
*  that character was as much me as John Grisham's characters are him.
*  But it's still kind of interesting that it is John Grisham didn't.
*  Right. I mean, if John Grisham did something similar to what one of the-
*  I saw a quote somewhere that the criminal is a true artist and the detective is
*  merely a critic, something like that. Does that resonate with you?
*  I'll have to look that up.
*  So you already knew you could write?
*  Well, I knew I liked it, but yeah, I think I got better and better at it. I mean,
*  as you're writing and they had creative writing classes in prison at the Low.
*  You know, the Low was a much different breed of animal, you know, like it, you know, it was,
*  you could very easily get hurt. You could get hurt either place, but
*  there were guys that have life sentences that had been working out for 20 years and were just
*  super angry, you know, at the medium. And if you got hurt at the medium, it was probably really
*  go bad. As opposed to you get hurt at the Low, it's more like a fist fight in high school.
*  So with knives. So anyway, I saw I'm there, I'm writing, I'm doing that. And there was a guy on
*  the compound that came on the compound about that same time. His name was Frank Amadeo.
*  Frank Amadeo is a rapid cycling bipolar with features of schizophrenia.
*  Rapid cycling bipolar with features of schizophrenia.
*  Rapid cycling.
*  It's just constant, right? And so there are moments in his manic state where he, his
*  reoccurring psychosis, I guess, is that he believes, and since he was in his early teens,
*  has believed that he is preordained by God to be emperor of the world. He's a lawyer, disbarred,
*  stole close to $200 million from the federal government. They gave him 22 years and they sent
*  him to Coleman. But it doesn't, this is the part I love. The delusions don't affect his legal work.
*  This doesn't say a ton for legal community, but-
*  How do you know he's delusional? I'm just asking questions.
*  Yeah, he's, he's, trust me. I mean, it's not me. It's like the transcripts, the lawyers,
*  the doctors, the, you know, there's a ton of, a ton. And then if you saw him in action,
*  you'd be like, oh wow. You know, he'd be completely normal. He would be having a
*  completely normal conversation and somebody would say something and he was, he'd go,
*  that makes me so angry. I, I, I can't, I'm not going to let them do that. When my legions
*  march on Washington, we are going to burn the constitution and the president will kneel at my
*  feet. And he goes,
*  I'm going to need your transcripts. I'm going to need a 2255 form. We're going to file up.
*  And it would just, and everybody would sit there and be like, okay, Frank, I'll get this and I'll
*  get- it was insane. It was the most insane. He was basically running a medium-sized law firm from
*  inside of the prison. He was training people. He taught the, he taught the,
*  the legal research class and was training people on how to do legal research in prison,
*  how to put together motions, how to fight, fight their cases, how to do the research,
*  how to type them up, everything. He's teaching, he's teaching a law. It's like a law school,
*  right? Like he's teaching these guys. He, he, listen, they made such a mistake locking this guy up.
*  So he's a great lawyer.
*  Listen, it's going to get worse. It's going to get worse because here's what happens is at this
*  point, I don't talk to him for probably a year or so, because everybody's saying he's crazy,
*  you know, and he's, and for like a year he gets there, he's drooling out of the side of his mouth.
*  They got him on a ton of medication. It takes him about a year to get them to take him off the
*  medication. So he gets them to take them off the medication. And then he starts kind of stabilizing
*  his mood by drinking Pepsi. I know it's crazy. I know it's crazy. I know how I see you. I see
*  you looking at me like this guy's delusional. I know. It works, but whatever works. So at some
*  point, one of my buddies comes to me and says, look, you got to go talk to Frank. Well, here's
*  the other thing over the course of a year or two that he's starts doing legal work for guys. He
*  starts just taking on guys' cases. I'll do the motion. I'll do your legal work. I'll do this,
*  keeps them busy. But suddenly you start hearing people get released.
*  You know, Jimmy just got 10 years knocked off his sentence. He's going to halfway house next month.
*  You know, Tom got an immediate release. Frank's walking people up to R&D, shaking their hands.
*  Guys are walking up to him in tears, crying. And so, you know, crazy or not, what choice do I have?
*  I called three different lawyers on the street and said, this is what happened. What can I do?
*  What can I do? They told me to do this and this and this. And I worked with them. And then they
*  decided not to proceed. And what can I do? And they said, you're hit, bro. There's nothing you
*  can do. You cannot in the middle, in the 11th circuit, you cannot force them to file a reduction
*  on your behalf. You cannot do it. It's impossible. You're hit. You're done. It's over. I'd love to
*  take your money, Mr. Cox, but it's not going to happen. I can't. I'm just going to take your money.
*  You're going to lose. Three different lawyers. I talked to TI's lawyer, told me, bro, it's not
*  going to happen. It's over. So my buddy says, go talk to Frank. I said, well, why wouldn't I?
*  I got nothing else to lose. So I go talk to Frank. He actually has a little manic moment. That little
*  thing that I just showed you, that's exactly what he said the first time I talked to him.
*  Based on your case.
*  Yes. I won't let this happen. He's like, I'm going to need your transcripts. I'm going to need to
*  get this. I need to see your indictment. I'm going to need your percentage report. I'm going to need
*  it's like, okay. And I turned to my buddy. He's like, bro, I know, I know what you're thinking.
*  It's fine. I'm fucking crazy. And he's like, I understand. Let just what choice do you have?
*  I was like, fuck. So Frank files a 2255 motion on my behalf stating that I'm not time barred
*  that Millie was. We filed it against Millie stating that she was ineffective, right? That
*  she didn't understand the law. She had me plead to something because she thought I could get a
*  reduction simply for doing Dateline. Oh, by the way, when I was in the medium, the government
*  came to me and asked me to be interviewed by American greed. I do that. I'm interviewed.
*  They get me on the phone. They talked to me, everything. The prosecutor wants me to do it.
*  She's re-interviewed. Everybody's re-interviewed. It airs. Millie goes to the government and says,
*  look, reduce the sentence. They go, no, Millie, it's not enough. Then they come to me and they
*  ask me to write an ethics and fraud course. I write an ethics and fraud course. The guy I
*  write the course with, he flies up to Atlanta. He talks with, I think he drove up, but he goes
*  up to Atlanta. He talks with a US attorney, talks to Millie. She insists if he does this,
*  I will reduce his sentence. I will definitely consider this. Definitely consider. Yeah,
*  definitely consider. And then we do it. It's being used all over the nation.
*  Not enough. Consider it. So that's where, at this point, I go to Frank. I tell Frank what's happening.
*  Frank says, yeah, this is, he was, every time they asked you to do something, it reset the time bar.
*  You have a year from that time to file a 2255. Now he insists that that was a viable argument.
*  Nobody else does. But he said, I'm not going to let them do this. I'm going to take care of this.
*  I'm going to get your sentence reduced. Okay. Emperor. Okay, Emperor. So he was a character.
*  Anyway, he, so he files a 2255. The government comes back. They say he's time barred. Frank comes
*  back. He, you know, they answer his motion. He files a retort. They file, you know, it just goes
*  back and forth. It's going for six months to a year. And at some point I go to mail call and,
*  you know, they call my name and they hand me this thing and I open it up and it says,
*  the government's filed a motion for a stay so that they can, they want the court to appoint me a lawyer
*  and to discuss filing a rule 35, reducing my sentence. And I, you know, I, I'm like, I read it,
*  but I couldn't even understand like, well, we don't understand. So, I mean, I rushed to go find Frank.
*  I showed it to Frank and he says, he says, yeah, they're staying it. They're going to send you a
*  lawyer and you're going to negotiate for how much they're going to reduce your sentence. He says,
*  he says, perfect. So they fly this woman down. Her name was Esther Panitch.
*  She flies down. We come to the visitation room. They bring me there, the lawyer's room, whatever
*  they call it. And so we're sitting there and I remember we're talking and she says, listen,
*  your, your motion, your 2255 is written well, but honestly, you don't have much of a prayer.
*  And they're offering you a one level reduction, which is 30 months. And I went,
*  oh, that's, that's not enough. And she said, well, I don't know what to tell you. She said,
*  they're willing to bring you back. And I was like, well, you know, I mean, I don't know,
*  I got to talk to Frank. Frank said, I deserve this many levels and we're going back for,
*  she's, who's Frank? And I go, Frank's the guy that's doing all my legal work. She goes,
*  he didn't write all this. And I was like, no, she is who wrote it. And I explained it to her.
*  And she's like, he's an inmate. And I was like, yeah. And then she's, why is he here? And I tell
*  her, well, cause he's, she stole a bunch of money from the federal government because he's trying
*  to take over the world. So I tell her that whole thing. And she's like, you're letting a,
*  a mentally incompetent, you know, person do your legal work. And I was like, yeah, because all the
*  competent attorneys wouldn't do it. They said, I didn't have a prayer. Your people said I didn't
*  have a prayer. And I said, Frank said he was going to, he could get this done. And she's like, well,
*  I mean, you know, you don't like, I don't even know why they're offering you one level. I was
*  like, well, Frank said, you know, and I'm like, Frank this, Frank that. And so she ended up
*  saying, she's like, you're taking advice from a legally incompetent person. I said, yeah.
*  And she said, you know, you really don't have a prayer. I said, then why are you here?
*  I said, if they could crush me so easily, why are you here? I said, they're giving me one level.
*  Let me talk to Frank. I'll let you know what we're going to do. So I leave. I call her a couple
*  days later. I tell her Frank and I talked to Frank. Frank said, go back, go back and argue
*  for more. He said, I think the judge is going to give you more. He's going to give you at least,
*  you know, between whatever he said, like six or seven levels or something. So I get, I get moved
*  all the way back to Atlanta. The FBI agent comes to talk on my behalf. The guy that like multiple
*  people show up to talk on my behalf. They say, you know, Millie, who I filed the 2255 against.
*  So I'm basically saying, you're ineffective. You're incompetent, you know, but she knows the game.
*  She's like, I get it. She, she gets on the stand and testifies for me. So the judge goes,
*  you know, listen, I think we were asking for like nine levels or something outrageous.
*  Prosecutor starts arguing for one level. And he said, listen, one level is not nearly enough
*  for what Mr. Cox has done. He said, Mr. Cox, I know you're arguing for nine, nine levels off
*  your sentence. He goes, that was never going to happen. It's like, it felt like I got slapped.
*  And he said, so I'm going to go with six levels. No, no, I'm sorry. He said three levels. I'm going
*  to go with three levels. He is, which is, which is seven years, which he said for somebody who has
*  no arrest associated with his case. He said, I think it's pretty good. And that's why that's
*  the judgment and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he hammered, but then puts the gavel down and
*  walks off. That's it. It's over. I got seven years. I was hoping for more. So I get moved back to
*  Coleman. I get moved back to Coleman and I go to up to Frank and I said, Frank, I got, I got seven
*  years off. And he's like, I know, I know. I said, I don't mean to sound unappreciative. I said, I just,
*  I said, I was hoping for more. He goes, I was too. He said, it looks like we're going to
*  have to eat this elephant one spoonful at a time. And he goes, something will come out.
*  Something's going to happen. He said, keep your ears open. Something will happen. And I said,
*  okay. And you know, I honestly, by that point I'd done, you know, I'd done eight years. And I
*  remember like, if I got a year off for the drug program and good time and this and I had about
*  eight or eight years left to go over and something nine years left. And I was like, you know, I can
*  do that. All right. You know, I'd been writing, um, by that point, I'd, I actually written a story.
*  Like I got a book deal for Devereaux Lee, you know? Um, and I ended up, uh, writing a synopsis of a
*  guy's story and I got him in Rolling Stone magazine and I got a book deal for that. Like I got an
*  advance, it's like 3,500 bucks for being in prison, a prisoner to get a $3,500 advance. Like I'm a
*  millionaire. There's a lot of money. So, and then we option the film rights, basically the synopsis
*  that I wrote for this reporter, journalists for Rolling Stone. He goes to Rolling Stone with my,
*  with what I wrote and gives it to them and they okay it. They say, yeah, this is great. We want
*  you to write an article based on this. Okay. He writes the article. He tells me
*  that the article will be from him, his name, Gee Lawson, Douglas Dodd, which is the name of the
*  kid I wrote the memoir about, and Matthew Cox. A couple of weeks before it's going, the article
*  is going to be published. He tells me Rolling Stone doesn't want my name on the article because
*  I'm in federal prison and it doesn't look good, but don't worry. He's going to put my name in the
*  article and that's just as good. And I argue it's not just as good. It's not. I'm like, I would be,
*  I would be a writer for Rolling Stone magazine. Like you understand I'm trying to, I'm trying to
*  come up with something here that I can rebuild my life as a true crime writer. That's no good.
*  And that wasn't so bad. That wasn't the worst of the worst of it was 90% of the article that he
*  published was taken directly from what I sent him. Like, I mean, sick to my stomach, bro,
*  just sick over it. So, but they option, they option the life rights for that. And I got a piece of
*  that. So there's like $7,000. I get a check for that. So I'm thrilled. I can keep writing
*  because you have to understand writing on the computer there, they charge you. So I start
*  writing. Oh, they charge you for phone calls, writing, comedy, every single thing costs money.
*  So I start writing all these guys' stories. I start writing books.
*  I just come back from, went back to Atlanta, got, got sent in seven years, knocked off my
*  sentence, come back and I'm walking around the compound. Now there was a guy that was there
*  named Ron Wilson. Ron Wilson ran in the, if you look in the newspaper, it says it's like a,
*  a hundred million dollar Ponzi scheme, but really it was $57 million. So he had lost 57 million.
*  So it says a hundred, you know, they, you know, they always exaggerate because 57 is not enough.
*  Ron ended up getting 19 and a half years. Ron was an old con man, early sixties, 62, 61.
*  I don't know. And Ron, I, and I liked Ron. So we're walking around the compound and he's like,
*  so what are you going to do? I mean, you got, you got, you got like eight or nine more years to go.
*  And I was like, eh, you know, I'm going to keep writing. And when I get out of here,
*  maybe I'll have a huge body of work and maybe I'll be able to sell it or maybe I'll be able
*  to option some more stuff. And if I could get together with Rolling Stone or get some of these
*  magazines, I could start writing for them and I could option those. Maybe I could walk out of
*  here or something. So, right, right, right. So Ron was who'd only been locked up like a year or so.
*  He was cooperating with the secret service in his case against some of his co-defendants.
*  So he's, he's already been debriefed and he's cooperating. He's actually
*  thinking he might get brought back to have to testify at a trial.
*  We're talking and we're walking and he keeps saying, you know, even if I, even if they,
*  they charge those guys, and even if this happens, they're not going to reduce my sentence. They're
*  not going to cut my sentence. And you know, first of all, well, probably because you stole a bunch
*  of money from pension funds and churches that didn't help your case, but I don't say that.
*  So I say, oh, they have to, bro. They'll have to, they've, they've, you know, if you cooperate,
*  they're going to have to, and if they don't, we'll have Frank file a 2255. And he's like,
*  ah, that crazy mother. So he says, okay. He's like, yeah, yeah, you don't understand. You
*  don't understand. So this goes on for months. And I, and I'm like, what is the problem? And
*  he says, you know, they think I hid Ponzi scheme money, you know, and he'd actually dug up like
*  five or $6 million in Ponzi scheme proceeds that he dug. He, I mean, he buried in these.
*  Oh, literally.
*  Literally buried in aluminum ammunition canisters. Super interesting guy. So he actually went and
*  dug them up and gave them to him. And I'm like, well, you gave them all the money. It's new. You
*  didn't hide anything. Relax. It's not a big deal. They're not going to find anything. Don't worry
*  about it. And so he mentions it a couple of weeks later, a couple of weeks later. And then one day
*  I go, bro, why do you keep bringing this up? Like, what are you concerned about? They're,
*  it's not going to happen. And he said,
*  can I trust you? And I went, probably not. And he goes,
*  I did hide some money. I was like, okay. I said, you bury it in a can somewhere. And he's like,
*  no, he said, I gave my wife like 150,000 in cash. I said, okay, well, she's not going to
*  say anything. She's using. He said, no, you don't understand. Since then,
*  she found out I was having an affair. And we're going to get a divorce and she hates me. And I
*  think she'll turn that money in just to make sure that I don't get a reduction.
*  Cause if you lie to the FBI, they're not going to, it doesn't matter what you've done for them. They
*  won't give you anything. And so he's played, I mean, I'm sorry, it's secret service or
*  anyway, he is clearly lied to the secret service at this point. If she goes and says,
*  this is what he gave me. So he's like, I was like, oh wow. And he's like, and I gave my,
*  my brother's holding maybe 30,000 for me. And at that moment I was like, wow,
*  like this poor guy. No, that's not what I thought at all. What I thought was,
*  is that enough to get me a sentence reduction? And I went and I sat there and you know what I
*  thought? I thought, I thought, no, I thought that's not enough. That's not enough. It's nothing.
*  That's not even $200,000. Like, and they didn't want to give me a reduction. My prosecutor was
*  pissed that I got seven years off. She wanted me to get 30 months. She's not going to give me
*  anything. It's up to her. She's not going to do it. So I go, I lay down, I go to bed,
*  like a month later, I'm on the phone with my lawyer. Cause I had written, remember I wrote
*  a man, my, I had a manuscript for my book and I wanted to put some of the stuff that was said
*  in my sentencing in the book. So I was trying to get my lawyer to mail me my transcripts
*  and she hadn't done it. So I called her and I said, listen, you said you were going to,
*  she's like, oh God, man, I'm so sorry. I'm so busy. I'll do it. I'll do it. And then she went,
*  this was Esther. She goes, so what else is going on in there? And I, this, she never wanted to talk
*  to me. Like she didn't, you know, when they were paying her, she didn't want to talk to me. And,
*  and I was like, what do you mean? Nothing. I just need my transcripts. And she's like,
*  nothing's happening. There's nothing you want to talk about. And I was like,
*  I don't know. You know what? You know what? There's something weird happened. Listen to this.
*  And I told her about Ron Wilson and she goes, hold on. She looks at them on the computer.
*  She says, oh, wow, this is a bad guy. This is a bad guy. And he told you then, you know, where
*  does this absolutely. And she, and I can tell you exactly. And she says, okay, okay, okay.
*  She goes, let me look into this. I go, okay. So a week later, a CO comes to me and goes,
*  Hey Cox. And I go, what's up? He goes, listen at the next move. Cause you know, they have
*  controlled moves. All the doors are locked and they open them up for 10 minutes. So you can run
*  to the chow hall or you can run to the, you can't run though. There's no running on the compound,
*  but you can walk fast. Yes. To the rec yard or the library, whatever. He says at the next move,
*  go to SIS, you know, so I go to SIS on the next move, but I was used to going there by the way,
*  because I was constantly ordering freedom of information acts and they would, so I'd order
*  your, you're an inmate and I'd order, I'm writing a story for you and I'd order it and they'd send
*  it to me and then they would catch it and they'd be like, why are you getting Lex's information?
*  So they'd call me down there and I go, no, I ordered it for him and I'm writing a story.
*  And I'd already been in Rolling Stone and everything. They were like, what's the story?
*  And I tell them the story. They guys are pretty good story here. And so I go down there,
*  but this is different. This, the guy answers the door and his guy, they call him Bulldog. He was
*  a real asshole. Uh, he was a lieutenant at SIS and he's like, uh, come in here, get in here,
*  Cox, sit down. And he dials the phone and he goes, here, you gotta talk to this guy. And I'm like,
*  what? I pick up the phone. I'm like, hello. And the guy goes, Hey, this is agent Griffin with
*  the secret service. I understand. You know, where Ron Wilson is, has a hidden Ponzi scheme money.
*  I want something in writing. I want, you know, so I start doing that and they go, okay. And then
*  I get his email address and we start emailing each other back and forth. And he ends up getting a
*  letter from the U S attorney in South Carolina that says they will consider it substantial
*  assistance if they, if they make arrests or recover a substantial amount of money.
*  That's the best I'm going to get is consider. So I start talking to this guy and he starts asking
*  me questions about Ron Wilson, like, Hey, ask him this, ask him this. So I'm like, bro, I gotta
*  kind of work that into a conversation. That's an odd thing to ask. So this goes on for six months.
*  So I'm asking questions and I'm typing up little reports and I'm, I'm a, I'm a,
*  I'm a prison snitch now. So I'm not just like cooperate. I'm not a prison. So I've L I've
*  moved down. I've moved down actually from being just a cooperating witness or
*  because you're in prison. Yeah. What makes you a prison snitch? You can't even really say,
*  no, you could say prison rat. You say prison rat. I think prison snitch.
*  I think that's probably the closer to the term that most guys would use. What's the
*  difference between a snitch and a rat in prison? I'm not sure. It rolls off the tongue better.
*  Prison rat doesn't sound as good as prison snitch. I don't know. I don't spend a lot of time
*  thinking about this. So what happens is I'm, I'm asking Wilson questions periodically.
*  And at some point they contact me and they say, listen, Wilson's about to get some bad news.
*  I'm like, okay. Um, and they go, he's, you know, like, I want to want to tell you what it is.
*  Let us know what happens. It's like two days go by and one day it,
*  Wilson comes up to me one day and says, cocks cocks. And I'm like, oh shit. I'm like,
*  Hey, what's up? You know? And he's like, Oh, you're not going to believe this. I got indicted.
*  I was like, what? What happened? No. Yeah. My wife, they questioned my wife and my brother.
*  And my brother, my wife walked in. First. She said, I don't have nothing. I don't know what
*  you're talking about. The next day, the brother walks in and gives them $150,000
*  in cash. And so the next day, the wife comes back and gives them $250,000 in cash and a bunch of
*  silver, like gold bullion and silver, you know, cause this, he was a, his, his Ponzi scheme was
*  based off of silver. Uh, you know, he was going to invest in silver for you. So half a million
*  dollars, they turn over half a million. I'm like half a million dollars. I thought she was like
*  a hundred thousand or something. And he was, he's like, I know, I didn't know I could trust you.
*  I'm like, Ron, what are you doing? I thought we were. So he, um, so I'll tell you something
*  for the icing on the cake, by the way, the icing on the cake, one more thing. There's so
*  if you're going to, if somebody cooperates with the federal government, let's say I get arrested
*  and they go, you want to help yourself and you go, yeah, okay. Um, look, uh, uh, Jimmy is a,
*  he lives next to me and he's running a meth house, you know, meth lab, whatever. And they go and they
*  raid Jimmy and he gets arrested. You're going to get something off for that. Not a lot, but you're
*  going to get something now. And they could just say, we were going to bust him anyway. We were
*  already onto him. Right. Now the next level would be you wear a wire. So I wore a wire and I, I was
*  in danger. Now keep in mind, I'm asking this guy questions inside federal prison. I'm in danger.
*  So whatever, that's like the next level. You're active. You're taking an active participate
*  participation in the, um, investigation. And the third level would be you actually get on the stand
*  and you cooperate and you, you testify that there's no better cooperation than that.
*  So when Wilson says to me,
*  they're going to move me back to South Carolina. They've indicted me. They charged me.
*  What do you think I should do? And I go, I think you should go to trial
*  because I know they'll have to call me as a witness just to let you know, cause I don't,
*  I don't want you to, I don't want to walk out of here and have you feeling, feeling like,
*  Hey, there's some, there's some good to this guy. So I'm ready. I'm, I'm ready to cut Wilson like
*  a fish. So, but you are putting yourself in danger if you get on a stand, right? I'm already in
*  danger. If people there heard what I was doing, I probably would have been in, does that increase
*  the chance of them hearing or no? It does, but it also increases my ability to get more off my
*  sentence. So what happens is a couple of days later, he's on what's called the pack out, right?
*  They're going to move him maybe a week later. So they come and get them. They move him. He gets
*  back there to South Carolina and he pleads guilty. He, he, they sentence him. He gets six months
*  added on. So now from 19 and a half to 20 years. And by the way, when COVID hit, he was released.
*  So he only ended up doing like six years on a 20 year sentence because he was older. He's by that
*  point, he's 66, 67 years old. You know, he's an old, anybody older than 55 was endangered,
*  especially in the prison. So they had a COVID thing where they were releasing these guys and
*  sending them home on ankle monitors. Like he's an old man. He's not, he, he's not going to hurt.
*  He's not, he's not a danger. So they sent him home. So he ended up doing so he didn't even
*  serve the six months, even serve the original sentence, whatever, not that I care. So I'm just
*  saying it makes you feel like poor Ron. It's okay. So his wife got like a hundred years, a hundred,
*  she got like a hundred hours of community service or something or 60 hours. And I think his brother
*  got six months papers and they got charged with obstruction of justice, you know, and they didn't
*  neither one of them, you know, it's like six months probation and community service, nothing.
*  So when we, I turn around, I'm waiting for my reduction, waiting, waiting after about 90 days
*  after this guy gets sentenced, maybe six months, I send a letter, Hey, what's going on to the
*  prosecuting to my prosecutor there, the prosecutor of both districts, no response. Then I go to
*  Frank, I explained to Frank and Frank is known what's going on the whole time. And Frank goes,
*  okay, I'm going to file a 2255. So we file a 2255 government comes back and the first thing they say
*  is your honor, we don't know about any cooperation. We've never heard about any cooperation.
*  So of course, then we submit the letter that we have. The judge comes back and the judge ends up
*  saying, it's a little complicated, but he ends up saying, look, I don't have jurisdiction to hear
*  this because you're, you may be time barred, but I'm going to let the, the appeals court hear it.
*  Now, typically you have to, you have to get what's called a, like a right of sort of a
*  certification to appeal. You have to make sure that you actually have a case. He says, I'm
*  waving the cert and I'm waving the $500 fee to file with them. He said, and I'm, he's, he basically
*  expedites it for me, which is a subtle way of telling the prosecutor. I think he's got something
*  and I'm sending it up there. And he, in the way he writes his motion, it's basically saying,
*  I don't have the jurisdiction to hear it, to do anything, but they do, they need to do it.
*  And I'm paving the way you don't have to pay any money and you don't need that cert.
*  So the prosecution immediately comes back. They file a one level reduction.
*  And we immediately Frank file something saying, Hey, stop. We don't want the reduction. We don't
*  want the one level. We want to come back to court. Please don't, don't rule on it. So the judge says,
*  okay, I'm freezing everything. I'm putting a stay on everything. I'm going to give this guy a lawyer
*  to try and figure out what you're going to do. They fly down a lawyer, Leanne Weber.
*  So she comes in and she comes and sees me and she says, listen, I, I, I see that you want to go back
*  and fight this and this, but honestly, I don't think you're going to get anything more than one
*  level. I talked to the prosecution. They said they'll give you, but she said, I can work on
*  trying to get you two levels, but you don't have much of a prayer. You're going to get crushed.
*  And I said, well, then, then why are you here? If they can crush me so easy, why don't they do it?
*  Why would they pay you like they pay them like 12 grand or something just to fly down and all
*  your expenses to negotiate for me? Why not crush me? And she's like, I, I don't know. I said,
*  well, Frank said four levels. And she's like, who's Frank? I go, Frank's the guy that wrote all this.
*  And she's like, oh, is he, is he an attorney? I go, is he in here? I'm like, yeah, he's in here.
*  She's like, why is he in here? And I tell her he was taken over the world. And she says,
*  she does the strangest thing I've ever heard in my entire life. And I said, I understand.
*  But Frank said, and she's like, you're listening to an incompetent, you know, absolutely. And she,
*  and Frank said, four love, we want four levels. She, he said for me to tell you, we want four
*  levels. She was okay. She leaves. She goes to the U S attorney. We argue two levels. They come back
*  and say two levels. No, we go back and forth. We start filing motions saying we want to go back.
*  We want a hearing. We want to bring back all the FBI agents, the secret service agents. And she's
*  like, what do you want to turn this into a circus? Exactly. What do I want to do? I'm gonna turn it
*  into the biggest circus because I've already got one level. They come back one day. She says, listen,
*  three levels is the best you're going to get. She said, so I guess you'll be moved back here.
*  We'll go to the hearing. I said, no, no, no, I'll take three levels. And she's, what are you talking?
*  She said, you said four levels. You said, Frank wouldn't take, let you take anything less than
*  four. I said, no, Frank said to tell you four, I was happy with three. I wanted you to argue for
*  four. I'm good with three. I'm out of here in like a year. So, and I don't want to be moved back. I
*  don't have to get on that bus. You know what it's like to be moved. It's horrible. So I said,
*  I just want the three levels. So then we argue about the wording for about two, three months,
*  and then they file it. And then I get five years knocked off my sentence because three levels at
*  this, at the level I was at now isn't seven years, every level you get a little less time.
*  So I get five years off. So now I've got 12 years knocked off my sentence. At this point, I
*  maybe have a year and a half to go. And you know, that's doable. So I was super, super happy.
*  And I'm going to, I'm going to tell you something.
*  And I'm sorry, bro. But every time I think about it and I just feel like I have to say it,
*  like I'm Frank, I'm insane, but I can, like, I didn't have a prayer without that guy.
*  And as crazy as he is and much of a pain in the ass as he was,
*  um, like I could never repay him, bro. Like, like I'm not, I shouldn't be here.
*  I'm supposed to be in prison right now. My out date was third, was 2030 without that guy.
*  Where does he know? He got himself out. He didn't do all that time. He got himself out. I don't even
*  know how he did it. He, they even threw him back in prison again for six months and he got himself
*  out again. Uh, he's insane. He's incredible. He's insane, but he's incredible.
*  Is he really that insane?
*  He's in Orlando.
*  Is he, I mean, he seems like, he seems like a good lawyer and a good man.
*  He, he's, he's, he's great. He's great. I mean, there's no doubt in my mind. I would be in
*  prison right now if it wasn't for him. And he's done this for others.
*  Walk people right out 10 years off, five years off, nine years off, 10 years. I mean, it's,
*  I didn't pay and I didn't pay for one thing. I didn't pay for my stamps. He paid for everything.
*  It sounds like the other lawyers don't really believe
*  it's possible. And he does. It's interesting.
*  Well, I think he's, he was willing to, he's willing to badger them into doing,
*  you know, what they should have done to begin with. I actually wrote a book about it,
*  which he loved.
*  About him.
*  About him and his story. His, it's so over the top what happened with him. I mean,
*  a little, I tried to take over the Congo. I mean, there's a documentary about it. There's,
*  it's called nine days in the Congo. It's an insane story. I'm, I'm, that's one of those stories.
*  It's just like, how is this not a movie?
*  It's not a movie.
*  No, I don't, I've pitched it several times and it'd be, it would be great. But so I wrote a
*  synopsis and I turned that into a book.
*  What's the name of the book?
*  Oh, it's insanity.
*  It's insanity.
*  Yeah. But about it, like a year and a half later, like I ended up getting out of prison
*  and I went to the halfway house.
*  What'd that feel like? Freedom?
*  That was, uh, oh, this is bad, bro. This is bad. I remember when I was leaving the prison.
*  So, you know, I met some great guys in prison, which is a weird thing to say,
*  but I've met better. I met better people in prison than I'd ever met outside prison at that low.
*  I mean, because it was the first time I actually had friends, you know, like I,
*  I really had someone that wanted to hang out with me just to like, I didn't,
*  I didn't have anything to offer them. I can't make you any money. I can't do anything for you.
*  We just hanging out because we like to laugh or we're going to have things in common or we're
*  fascinated by each other or we just have good time and fun. So when I was leaving,
*  I remember my mom showed up and my brother showed up and they picked me up
*  and we were driving off. I remember looking back at the prison and my brother said, well,
*  I'm glad I'll bet you're glad to see that, you know, uh, to leave that behind you.
*  And I started crying and like nobody talked. I was so uncomfortable. Uh, it was just started crying
*  and, and it wasn't because I was like, oh, it's over. It was because it was like survivor's guilt,
*  you know, like I was leaving all of my friends and I felt so bad that I was leaving them.
*  Uh, but I, I went to the, I went to the halfway house and, uh, I had,
*  I had four, I had, so when I was getting out, I remember joking that I had exhausted my
*  trulings account, my, my, my inmate account. I'd exhausted it. I had nothing. I had like 18 cents.
*  I couldn't even figure out how to spend it. And they give you a debit card when you leave.
*  And I said, like, and they charge you every time you, you swipe, you use the card. Like I don't
*  even have enough to spend the 18 cents, you know, it's cause just charges like $3. So I was like,
*  I was like, yeah, I was like, I wonder if they're still giving me my debit card.
*  And I'm laughing. Everybody's like, what are you going to eat? What are you this? What did that?
*  And, uh, and my one buddy looked at me. He was like, you can't go to the halfway house with nothing,
*  bro. And I was like, no, it's cool. I said, no, it's cool. You know, I said, no, it's cool. I said,
*  I want to start at the bottom. I've got that coming. I got working at McDonald's coming.
*  So I'm going to work at McDonald's. I don't give a fuck. And he was like,
*  well, I think I use, I think you're going to need to buy clothes. I think that's enough. It's,
*  I said, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's at the goodwill. They'll give you a bunch of,
*  they give you a bunch of crap if you don't have anything, if you're indigent.
*  And I said, I'm indigent. And a couple of days before I'm leaving, $400 ends up on my account.
*  And I was like, what the fuck? And it was from a buddy of mine. And I go to him, my buddy, uh, Tommy.
*  And I was like, Tommy, did I go, did you put $400 on my account? And he said, I can't let you go for
*  nothing, bro. So I get to the halfway house and I go to Walmart and I buy $300 worth of clothes
*  at Walmart. I've never been in a Walmart. I go to Superball. They're huge. And I go there and I buy
*  a bunch of clothes and I buy about 300 bucks worth of clothes. And I still have some of the blue jeans.
*  To this day, I still wear some of the blue jeans. And I stayed in the halfway house and I, I
*  called the buddy of mine named Treon, uh, Treon Calta and he owns a gym. And, you know, I grew
*  up with him, his whole family, like they owned a bunch of gyms. And I, I called him and I said,
*  Hey man, I'm in the halfway house. And he was like, Hey, what's going on? He said, can I do
*  anything for you? And I was like, I mean, I need a job. I didn't think he was going to give me a job.
*  He was broke. You're hired. I'll give you a job. He's like, I can't, I'm minimum wage. I said that
*  that's fine. If I can stay out of here, I, you can work like 80 hours a week.
*  I was like, if I can just stay out of here, 80 hours and you pay me minimum wage,
*  she goes, Oh hell yeah. Perfect. So I'm at the gym and I got free reign. So I'm playing on my
*  computer, goofing off all day. And my buddy Pete, who's still locked up, he's texting me and calling
*  me and he's like, not texting me, he's emailing me through the core link system. And, and he's
*  calls me periodically. He's like, have you started a website? Cause one of the things I was going to
*  do when I got out was I was going to start a website with all these stories that I'd written.
*  And I was like, no, Pete, I don't, I can't like, I don't have a computer. He's like,
*  well, how much does a computer? I was like, I don't know. They're like 300 bucks. I was like,
*  I don't, I said, I could probably get a used Apple, like Mac book, like a five-year-old Mac
*  book or something. I don't know for like three, $350, whatever. And I said, but he was like,
*  okay, so that's all you need 300 bucks. I said, no, no, no, no, no. I said, it's not 300 bucks,
*  bro. It's 300 bucks. Plus it's getting a WordPress website, which I said costs money.
*  Plus it's hiring somebody to help me figure it out because I don't, I, I'm, I'm inept.
*  I don't know how anything works. So he, okay. And I said, plus I need this, plus I need that.
*  I need a bunch of stuff. I need $600 for this. I need 300 for this. I need 500 for this. I need
*  a thousand dollars for, for this. And he goes, okay. He said, I'm going to, I'll get you. Okay.
*  I got it. So he reads off a list. He goes, I got you. The P doesn't have any money.
*  And I go, how are you going to give me any money? He goes, he was every day I walk across the
*  compound. Some people stop me and say, how's Cox doing? And I say, oh, he's okay. And they say,
*  does he need anything? And I say, no, no, he's good. He said, I'm going to start telling these
*  fuckers. Yeah. Yeah. He needs something. You want to do something for him? Here's what he needs.
*  I ended up getting two laptops sent to me. I got the computer program,
*  Final Cut Pro. I had, I had guys in prison cutting me checks so that I could build a website
*  and put all these stories on the website. So I start putting the website, I don't know what
*  I'm doing. I put them on the website slowly. It takes forever. I'm putting pictures up. I'm
*  trying to figure out how Photoshop works, how all this stuff. The whole time I was, I wanted to
*  start because everybody, the last one, I was just getting out of prison. Everybody kept telling me
*  like, bro, you got to start a podcast. You got to start a true crime podcast. And I don't know what
*  a podcast is. The term podcast came into existence in 2009 when I'd been locked up three years.
*  I'd never been on YouTube. So by the time I get out, the last year or two, guys are coming up to
*  me, giving me magazines like this is what a podcast you need to read. Look, true crime is huge. And
*  you have to think guys are asking me every couple of days, Cox, you got any stories? And I'm like,
*  yeah, did you read cash and Coke? And they're like, is that the one with the guys or Robin,
*  the drug dealer? Yeah. Oh no, I read that one. Did you read this one? No, no, I haven't read that.
*  That's the one with the guy. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm giving these little stories and
*  then they'd come back and give them to me. You know, you don't have anything in there, right? So
*  guys that would never read in their life are reading. And I'm writing about the guy in B2,
*  the guy in C1. So I put up the whole thing and they're well, anyway, they're all telling me,
*  do a true crime podcast, true crime podcast. I don't really know what that is, but now I'm
*  starting to listen to them on YouTube, you know, a serial and a cold case files, you know, that kind
*  of stuff. And I think that's what I want to do. Well, my buddy Trion says there's a guy named Danny
*  Jones that runs a podcast called Concrete and it's in St. Petersburg and he lives a couple miles from
*  me. I see him all the time. And I went, okay. And he said, you should, you should email him. He's got
*  a guy on there all the time that does real estate. And I go, I just got out of prison for, for bank
*  fraud related to real estate. He doesn't want to interview me. He goes, well, you could, maybe he
*  does. Maybe you could ask him about starting a podcast. Okay. So I sent him an email. I remember
*  Danny called me and he said, Hey, is this Matt? I was like, yeah, this is Matt. He's like, I got
*  your email. This is Danny Jones. And I was like, okay. And he says, uh, he says, yeah, I got your
*  email, bro. He's a good fucking email. And I was like, what? He goes, I get a lot of emails, bro.
*  He said, that is a good one. He's, that was a really good, like, I mean, that was well-written.
*  He's like, I immediately knew I had to talk to you. And I said, oh, okay. I said, uh, cause you know,
*  I start off with, I think I started off with, Hey, my name is Matt Cox and I'm a con man.
*  I was recently released from federal prison. And so he was like, Oh yeah. I mean, who says that?
*  So anyway, he said, Oh, well what's going on? I said, well, and I tell them what's going on.
*  I want to start a podcast, blah, blah, blah. And you know, Danny, he listens to me for 30 minutes to
*  an hour and I've heard this and this. And he's like, yeah, well he's, you know, YouTube's not
*  really like that. And that's not really how we do it. And you know, I don't know that you're,
*  you're going to have to get a production company and blah, blah, blah. He goes, but you know what,
*  what you really need to do is to see if people are even interested in you or your story, or you're
*  able to talk. You should come on my show, you know, shameless, trying to get some content.
*  Well, I mean, so as I told you offline, Danny and concrete podcast is really good. So people
*  should definitely listen to it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it turns out people do like listening to
*  turns out. I mean, you're good at telling stories. Well, anyway, I, by the time I got it,
*  I couldn't do Danny's podcast. I can't do it, bro. I'm in the halfway house. So maybe
*  I get out of the halfway house and a couple of months go by, maybe two months, three months go
*  by. And one day I get a phone call from Danny's like, bro, you're out of the halfway house. Right.
*  And I was like, cause I told him I got out in July. It was like October, November. I'm like,
*  right. He's like, listen, I had a guest fall through. I got nobody. I need you to come on.
*  I answered all your questions. You know, I'd call them five, six times. You know, I asked you said,
*  and I was like, ah, I was like, I'll fuck it. I'll do it. That video got like a 2 million views.
*  Then I did Patrick bet David flew me out. Then I did soft white underbelly, you know, then I did
*  Vlad that I did all like people started and I'm sorry. And then, you know, it just blew up. And
*  then people started asking me to come and, you know, talk for no reason for, which was crazy,
*  but you were saying, I'm sorry. Is your dad still with us? No, he died when I was in prison.
*  He came to see me. Yeah. He came to see me two or three times.
*  When is the first time he found out that you were doing fraud?
*  The first time I got in trouble. When you got the, because I had, you know, I had to kind of explain
*  that, you know, something's happening. I didn't want him to hear from anybody else.
*  So you, so you talked to him directly about it.
*  Super disappointed. Did he ever tell you he loves you after that?
*  So I, after I got the 26 years and the government decided they weren't going to indict anybody.
*  And I really was like, wow, this is it. Like you're done. He came to see me,
*  but just by himself. And I remember he, I remember when he came to see me.
*  I, you know, he was by, it was by himself. Like he never came by himself.
*  So I remember thinking my mom, so I'm having to my mom.
*  And as soon as I walked in, he walked in, I go, what happened? I go, where's mom?
*  And he goes, oh, she's fine. She's fine. And he sat down with me and he said,
*  and I, he said, how are you doing? I was like, I'm good. And he was just like,
*  you know, he was getting sick. He was getting older. So, you know, we talked for a little bit,
*  just about the situation. And I was like, yeah. And he's like, well, what are you going to do?
*  And I was like, you know, there's nothing I can do. Like everybody I've called multiple attorneys.
*  I've talked to people, there's nothing I can do. And he was like, you know, we're going to figure
*  it out. You know, he was, he said, you're clever and you're smart and you're going to, you're not
*  going to do all of that time. And I was like, I'm done. It's over. I'm going to get out of here when
*  I'm 60, if I behave myself and if I don't, I'll be 64. And he was like, that's not going to happen.
*  And so he said, I think that was the first time he, you know, I knew he was proud of me when I was
*  making money, but he never said it. You know, you got the look like he was like impressed,
*  but we were sitting there and he said, I remember he said, cause it's the only time I can ever
*  remember him saying he was proud of me. And I remember he said, you're going to figure this out.
*  He said, I'm not proud of where you ended up, but you've done amazing things.
*  You know, I wish you'd use your talents for something different,
*  but you've done things that I could have never done. And you've led an amazing, adventurous life.
*  And I'm proud of you. And that, you know, I wish he could see you now.
*  My mom, I am my mom's, my mom's funny because my mom came to see me. My mom's a gangster.
*  My mom came to see me every two weeks for 13 years. She missed about a month and a half
*  when she had a stroke and ended up in a wheelchair. And then she came in the wheelchair
*  and she would make my brother bring her. My brother and sister would be like, mom,
*  are you sure you want to go? Like, you know, it's, it's so hard to, it's such a long drive
*  and you get so tired. Well, I'll sleep in the car. I know, but you know, then you, we have to wait
*  in that, that lot, that the, you know, in that, the waiting area, you know, forever and it takes
*  forever while I'm in the wheelchair. So I'm fine. Well, I know, but it's such a pain to get in and
*  out and then in and out. And she was like, she was, I'm going to see my son and you're taking me.
*  I mean, yeah. So I, I, so she, yeah, she was, she was something else. And, and I would say,
*  you know, like if, if I had to say,
*  you know, I don't think about all the things I did to get out. Like I know, you know, there's all
*  these guys that are like, you know, like, you know, oh, I wouldn't have done that. You know,
*  I'd have been a standup guy and I'd have been, well, good for you, bro. I wanted to get out.
*  I wanted out. And the icing on the cake of me getting out.
*  And I would have cut every mother fucker's head in that prison off.
*  I was able to get out just in time to spend the last year and a half of my mother's life with her.
*  I saw her two or three times a week, took her to dinner once a week,
*  was able to go on walks with her in her wheelchair. I was sitting right next to her when she was
*  there. I was sitting right next to her when she had her final stroke. I held her hand
*  when she took her last breath. So if I have to be called a snitch the rest of my life,
*  I don't give a fuck. Like I may not deserve more, but she deserved more.
*  Do you regret? If you just look back, would you do it? Would you do any part of your life different?
*  Oh, I'd scrap all this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'd scrap all this to be, you know, you always hear
*  these guys say, I wouldn't change it because it made me the man I am today. The man I am today
*  is a fucking 54 year old scumbag, multiple felons starting my life over broke, you know,
*  living off of scraps, you know, trying to make YouTube work. Like, you know, I've got,
*  you know, two dead parents. I'm divorced. I have a son that doesn't talk to me.
*  I have a son that doesn't talk to me for good reason, not because of a misunderstanding,
*  because he understands. Like I, he's, you can't even argue with him. He's got a powerful argument.
*  Like I don't want to be a part of this guy's life. He's a scumbag. He stole money. He went on the run.
*  He abandoned me when I was, you know, three years old. I don't want anything to do with him.
*  Like I get it. Like I, you know, and I tried to, I tried to, I've tried to do all the right things.
*  You know, I wrote the letters, I drew him pictures. I've tried to call and it's not happening. Like
*  I would do anything to go back and just be that regular middle-class guy with the two kids and
*  the wife working a regular job. You know, I, I like, that's a good life. You know, those are,
*  that's a good person. And, you know, I, I just made one arrogant decision after another, after
*  another, until it snowballed and I couldn't take it back. And then I did everything I could. And if,
*  and if I wasn't the calculating, backstabbing, scumbag motherfucker that I can be,
*  I'd be in prison right now. Sorry, you know. So yeah, yeah. I would much rather be a CPA right
*  now. I would much rather, you know, should have stuck with being an insurance adjuster or something.
*  I mean, you know, I never should have whited that 30 day late out. Never. It was a mistake.
*  It was your first mistake.
*  It was a huge mistake.
*  You think your son will forgive you?
*  No. Unfortunately, according to my, my ex-wife
*  and my sister and everybody that he is a part of their lives,
*  you know, and I've seen him, you know, my mother's funeral, I saw him,
*  you know, I've seen him at several functions. You look across and he looks right through me.
*  I think that he's a, everybody says he's a, he's just like you. He's just like you. And everybody
*  says I'm just like my dad. I've never smoked a cigarette. I've never drank alcohol, not a drop,
*  never done any drugs because my dad was an alcoholic and my dad smoked two packs a day
*  and everything in our house reeked of nicotine and I've never smoked. And my dad was a pillhead.
*  He was, he was always on some kind of prescription medication. He was drug, you know, and I didn't
*  want to, I didn't want to, I didn't want to be that person. And I, and like one day I drew a line in
*  the sand and I wouldn't do it. And I think he's drawn a line in the sand and he's decided,
*  you know, this is the hill I'm going to die on and I'm not going to back off it.
*  And the thing is my ex-wife tells him this, he's a good person. You should be in his life.
*  His, his father, cause he was adopted when I was in prison, they adopted him. Nick is his,
*  you know, his dad. Nick has told him, Nick came to see me when I was in prison.
*  You know, Nick has told him like, Hey, you, this, this is a mistake. You're making a mistake.
*  Nick, everybody that knows me knows him. And he said, he has said no. So I fully believe it's no.
*  I mean, I hope it's not. Well, I hope he forgives you. I think there's a lot of good in you despite
*  you calling yourself a scumbag over and over and over. I keep bothering you. You mentioned that
*  earlier. What advice would you give to young people given that you've lived quite an
*  non-standard life? What advice would you give them how to live a life that can be proud of?
*  I mean, it's, it's, I'm in a position that anybody would listen to me, but I, cause to me,
*  and I don't have any advice that I don't think a father would give you. And it's like,
*  work hard, be appreciative. I mean, things are so good out here. I hear people complain all the
*  time. And I think a huge part of just being happy is being appreciative. Like I didn't appreciate
*  anything when I had, this is so cliche, but when I had all the money in the world,
*  I was miserable. But when I got out with nothing, I was happier in prison with nothing
*  than I was with two or $3 million prior to prison and driving, dating a chick. I was,
*  never should have been dating, driving a sports car, vacationing all over the world. Miserable.
*  I'm crying driving away from prison because I already miss my friends.
*  You could have never told me that was going to happen.
*  Turns out money in fact does not buy happiness.
*  No. And I know, and it is such a cliche, right? But it's, it's so true.
*  Crying, driving away from prison. Yeah. You know what? I met my wife in the halfway house.
*  So she had just gotten out of prison. She was in the halfway house with me. She just did five
*  years for like a meth conspiracy. I never would have met her if I hadn't gone to prison.
*  And now your date night is hunting alligators together.
*  Yeah. That was, that was, that was like a month or so ago.
*  This is Florida folks. This is what, this is what, this is what bad ass people do in Florida.
*  My wife is a former, she used to, so she was a military, an MP in the military. She was,
*  she did, she hunted, she ran a hog hunting tour guide service for six years. Went to prison for
*  five years, got out. And then, you know, now she's a Marine mechanic. And yeah, our date night,
*  the other night was, we went in the middle of the night, went to Lake Okeechobee and went hog,
*  I went to alligator hunting. Yeah. And if I may say so, she's quite beautiful.
*  Thank you. And I did, I did nice. She didn't want to date me in the halfway house too. I kept saying,
*  I feel like you're sweet on me. She's like, I'm not, I'm not. I make fun of guys like you.
*  You're a city boy. I'm like, I don't know. I feel like, well, you wore her down.
*  Just what I exactly, what I did. It's that charisma. It always works. Well, Matt,
*  thank you for, for being so honest. Thank you for being who you are. I do think there's a lot of
*  good in you and thank you for telling your story and the story of others who have,
*  who've made mistakes in their life. Thank you for talking today. I appreciate you having me on.
*  That was a really short conversation.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Matthew Cox. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from
*  Mario Puzo, author of The Godfather. Behind every successful fortune, there's a crime.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
*  Bye.
